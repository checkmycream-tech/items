            <li>no problems, fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect combo, remembre that you have to change your cutter and your foil every 6 to 8 months, so tris product is the perfect choice</li>

            <li>Well built but takes serveral more passes to get the best shave.</li>
            <li>I would buy more of these because this electric razor works the best</li>
            <li>I love it and rate it a 5 because it is in the braun fashion a superior quality item and it works awesome ..  </li>
            <li>These are the original replacement parts!!!</li>
            <li>Fits perfect and the price was right!!</li>
            <li>Very easy thing to do!</li>
            <li>Great product as we all know but a really great price made it even better.</li>
            <li>good  value for money</li>
            <li>I bought my Braun about 6 years ago and thought it was a really good shaver.  </li>
            <li>A perfect fit for me.</li>
            <li>The prices here are as good as I&#x27;ve found anywhere else</li>
            <li>The manufacturers sell you a good razor and then it costs a fortune to keep it that way.</li>
            <li>After using BRAUN shavers for over thirty years, I continue to enjoy the quality of their products and the excellent results!  </li>
            <li>Good Braun quality.  </li>
            <li>I have the 8595 shaver that I have loved since 2005.</li>
            <li>This was a good deal for the Braun replacement shaver heads.  </li>

            <li>Nice to save some money, too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There may be some good news here though--a review by S. Bergeron for the Braun refurbished 8985 shaver that uses these blades said that the Braun 30b cutter/foil set is a better replacement.  </li>
            <li>In the 45 years that I&#x27;ve been shaving electrically,Braun is the best and the foil and cutter replacements are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I get a nice close shave</li>
            <li>- Have a tool handy for opening adult-proof packaging.)</li>
            <li>Nice close shave.</li>
            <li>Procter and Gamble own Gillette.</li>
            <li>nice replacement blade</li>
            <li>Awesome prices and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to have a close shave again.  </li>
            <li>I own a Braun 360 model 8985.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I realize this sounds cliche, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li>I works well and gives a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>Nice to get a descent price on this item.</li>
            <li>I own an 8000 series Braun shaver (8985).  </li>
            <li>This was about the 5th time I have changed the screen and blades and this was as good a replacement of the others which I paid more for thru retail outlets.  </li>
            <li>worked good don&#x27;t send any more razor waring out</li>
            <li>I own the Braun Series 5 electric shaver, model # 8995.</li>
            <li>was nicely packaged up.</li>
            <li>No problems of any kind.  </li>
            <li>factory replacement, fast and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>My shaver system is good to go again now. :-)</li>
            <li>You get at most 4 good months of shaving then you need to replace them again...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this electric razor for the better part of a decade now, but these blades keep it running just as good as the day that I bought it.  </li>
            <li>good product, fits original shaver, does a good job.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, this is great, the shave is closer than the original design head, faster, and the shaver sounds quieter</li>
            <li>The original was great and</li>
            <li>Original and at a great price, delivered on time.</li>
            <li>Great my head and face was clean for 2 days</li>
            <li>If anything changes, I&#x27;ll update this review, but I highly recommend this replacement for the Series 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/5/12: I&#x27;ve now been using this foil and cutter for a couple of months and just wanted to confirm that it&#x27;s still working excellent!  </li>
            <li>They are as high quality Braun parts and you will very happy with them as I am</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>but I find it&#x27;s more like 6 to 8 at the very most.  </li>
            <li>The replacement fit perfectly, and I think it performs better than my original foil/cutter ever did.</li>
            <li>brand new product; works perfect on a series 8 Braun.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want a new rasor, this is an excellent purchase.</li>
            <li>The 3 series is also an excellent shaver which I also had until my son absconded with it back to college..... and a lower price point.which makes it a good value</li>
            <li>I had great service and quick mailing .No</li>
            <li>Very easy to do.</li>
            <li>Replacement is very easy and fits like it was originaly installed.</li>
            <li>Perfect buy to replace old cutter and foil!</li>
            <li>is everything very good but 35 $ for that is too much and</li>
            <li>Installed my old Syncro foil over the Series 5 cutter &amp; had the best close shave (without pulling hair) that I have had since I quit using my Syncro.</li>
            <li>and this was by far the best price.  </li>
            <li>These fit my braun series 5 razor and worked good.</li>
            <li>: Mine is the old 8 series, and these work PERFECTLY.</li>
            <li>Greatly enhanced my razor&#x27;s function and extended its useful life indefinitely.</li>
            <li>The 3 head Norelco/Phillips style is more effective and simpler to use.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s my own problem.  </li>
            <li>A frequent consumable for Braun Razors that does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li>It fit my shaver and does a good job of rejuvinating its performance.</li>
            <li>This replacement cutter &amp; foil fit really good.  </li>
            <li>I think this pack offers excellent value</li>
            <li>does the job, exactly as advertised, fit my series 5 razor perfectly,</li>
            <li>Works great, and stays attached to my razor better than the original screen did :)  </li>
            <li>On the positive side, this replacement cutter for the Series 5 shaver is a perfect fit for the razor.</li>
            <li>But it easy for me to change the foil replacement for him!</li>
            <li>I strongly agree!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been months now of using this replacement and it is still going strong!  </li>
            <li>The Braun razor does a great, comfortable job- quickly too!</li>
            <li>and I think this replacement is as good as the original.  </li>
            <li>I want to explain what some people are complaining about concerning this replacement blade set not being as good as the original.</li>
            <li>to replacement, just as good as the original parts</li>
            <li>It may not be quite as good as the original but its not like it doesn&#x27;t work like</li>
            <li>The cutter block blades are thicker and the foil pattern isn&#x27;t as good as the original.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good replacement for the original foil and cutter.</li>
            <li>I had read reviews saying the 51S replacement foil and cutter were not as good as the original parts that come with the Braun Series 5 shaver.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the original.</li>

            <li>OK, it worked,</li>
            <li>4 more words required</li>
            <li>Price was better</li>
            <li>and I get close to a year and 3 months and more before having to replace.  </li>
            <li>Braun makes outstanding well made products.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping , great job.</li>
            <li>You will be better served by getting the Braun Series 3 Combi 30B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>In fact I stopped using it and bought a Panasonic that I like much better.  </li>
            <li>Close shave, better than before.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so much better.  </li>
            <li>Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I read through many of the reviews before purchasing this item.</li>
            <li>Well then, you&#x27;ll love this replacement foil.  </li>
            <li>cost and service was outstanding.</li>
            <li>TOO MANY NUMBERS  --</li>
            <li>it transformed the 8985 into the most efficient shaver i&#x27;ve ever used (or tried).</li>
            <li>This is the Braun which I think is better than the Gillette which I tried before.</li>
            <li>and that surely they might want the parts for Q&amp;C checking.  </li>
            <li>used to love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Noticeably better shaves father the switch is made.</li>
            <li>I grew to fear shaving if I had anything more than 1 day of stubble.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this product for many years.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll probably be OK.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Gotta Love the Free Shipping!</li>
            <li>Not as close a shave as the the Braun 3, I thought going up in price and newer would be better ,but turned out the Braun</li>
            <li>3 is better , I would like to try the Braun 7 but cant afford</li>
            <li>This item seems to cost more than it should</li>
            <li>You have the chance to sell them separate and charge more money.</li>
            <li>The package came with two replacement parts ( the razor itself and the grate guard that goes on top).  </li>
            <li>I need to change foil/cutter more often than the factory recommends.</li>
            <li>Once I started noticing people having better experiences with the ones made in Germany, I decided to pull the trigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side</li>
            <li>the foil is a bit pricey, but will continue to order more when required as i do not plan to get rid of my shaver.</li>
            <li>What more could you want?</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better.  </li>
            <li>Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I love it,</li>
            <li>It might be more then 5 years since I replaced this</li>
            <li>but I refused saying there&#x27;s no point of enduring more pain by using the 51S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw</li>
            <li>Also I was nicked more</li>
            <li>Read my review of that product (http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BR8AFAHU584G/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B001VH6F9G&amp;nodeID&#x3D;&amp;tag&#x3D;&amp;linkCode&#x3D;) for more detail.  </li>
            <li>They sure don&#x27;t make them like they used to.</li>
            <li>I am sure</li>
            <li>Item completely satisfied my requirement.</li>
            <li>I though spending more means a better product</li>
            <li>the shaver is a lot more noisy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of the models over the years.</li>
            <li>The shaves are closer, quicker and more comfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>thank God so he can&#x27;t do any more damage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this replacement blade for many months now.  </li>
            <li>I get a better shave with a $20 battery-operated shaver than I do with my 8595 using this foil &amp; cutter.</li>
            <li>Now I add more test to reach the character count.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, I am glad to have run across this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you&#x27;re matching the correct foil to model number of your shaver.</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to find this.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, it works great and shipping couldn&#x27;t have been better.</li>
            <li>and i love it every time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my Braun 8000 series shaver for more than 5 years now and like it.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to shave once a day, but over time I&#x27;ve had to reduce to twice a week to avoid skin irritation and ingrown</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>Price was better than my discount store.  </li>
            <li>The replacement set fit was perfect in my 4 year old 51s razor.  </li>
            <li>already.they should be better than this</li>
            <li>I make sure that my husband changes his foil and cutter replacement when he needs to.</li>
            <li>I think there is more money to be made in replacement parts than the shaver purchase itself..</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I intended to buy the latest version Braun 7 Series but after reading the reviews I changed my mind.</li>
            <li>It also just refused to cut many patches on my face.  </li>
            <li>It matches up perfect with the 8000 series, its just a different color plastic.  </li>
            <li>LOVE MY BRAUN SHAVER, SO I HAD TO REPLACE FOIL &amp; CUTTER AFTER 1 YEAR</li>
            <li>Simply put it delivers a close shave the best I ever had with</li>
            <li>and this is a good and economical way to do that.</li>
            <li>how many times I try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A perfect fit for my old razor.  </li>
            <li>In fact, nearly more of a hassle than shaving with a blade.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 more words required</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with these replacements.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I just ordered a replacement and am satisfied with the shave.</li>
            <li>My husband said the cutter was sharper and cut better then</li>
            <li>and I am glad I can get these parts for my Braun 8585 shaver that I bought in December 2001....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve pucrhased many of these</li>
            <li>Just what we need and much better price than in stores.</li>
            <li>I thought it was still OK.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed at how much better it shaved.  </li>
            <li>The foil and cutter replacement is just what I wanted, there a two different foils and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>In my case, I feel rotary cutters are more appropriate.</li>
            <li>Great product fast delivery</li>
            <li>Just as described at a fantastic price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers ever since I started shaving many decades ago and never had this happen before.  </li>
            <li>and i will definately order more, if you have a series 5</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I ordered in spite of these reviews.</li>
            <li>never knowing when it was appropriate.</li>
            <li>Perfect and last forever</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use these any more.  </li>
            <li>(BTW: always replace the two at the same time for best results)</li>
            <li>Package arrived Ok as scheduled</li>
            <li>He says it is much better than the razor he was using.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>and here&#x27;s me taking up more space</li>
            <li>Definitely enjoying my shave again now.</li>
            <li>Still delivers day after day and that for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>I was able to find.</li>
            <li>As a result, I  have been able to substantially reduce the time it takes me to shave.</li>
            <li>The package saved a total of $12 over the best I could do anywhere else</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not much more to say about this purchase ... ...</li>
            <li>because I am not going to say &amp;#34;I Love it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Cheaply made foil and cutter!</li>
            <li>I was never so glad to get this  </li>
            <li>After 8+ years I guess it was about time :)</li>
            <li>This blade set is the same, works great, feels good and shaves close.</li>
            <li>Blades are excellent and are a better shave than the last set I purchased.  </li>
            <li>I love Braun razors.</li>
            <li>Glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using braun electric shavers for over 25 years and love their products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Brauns&#x27; for more than 40 years, do I need to say more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paal</li>
            <li>Excellent replacement for two different razor models.</li>
            <li>The foil &amp; cutter replacement made shaving 100% better.  </li>
            <li>I was so satisfied with the replacement pack that I immediately ordered another to have as a backup.  </li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price was the best I could find &amp; the price was even lower when I ordered the second pack!</li>
            <li>The replacement foil and cutter does make your razor work better.  </li>
            <li>Also the Amazon price was much better than buying this in store.</li>
            <li>For me, the foil pattern on the 30b does a MUCH better job holding/stabilizing the hair</li>
            <li>Of course, this problem becomes more and more noticeable with longer intervals between shaving and/or as the blade edges deteriorate over time.</li>
            <li>Braun needs to restore the quality or I will be finding a better company to purchase razors from.</li>
            <li>As always I was greatly satisfied with product and service</li>
            <li>Glad I got this.  </li>
            <li>Shaver works much better</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found a better electric yet...</li>
            <li>Complete\\&quot; to the \\&quot;Series 5 Combi 51S\\&quot; I am not getting as many shaves from it as I would have.</li>
            <li>I bought many years ago which served me well up until about 2 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Been Braun for more than 30 years.</li>
            <li>Smooth, close shaves!  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>Blades do a better job and are cheaper.</li>
            <li>I love the razor, and the cutter/foil that come with it.</li>
            <li>I wish Braun were a better company...</li>
            <li>Tanks a lot,&amp;#60;i will need more</li>
            <li>I have used series 5  for  many  years, and I like it a lot.  </li>
            <li>I love the Braun series 5 and shave both my head and face with it 2-3 times per week.</li>
            <li>razor works much better freshened up, closer and faster shave</li>
            <li>The replacement pack was a gift for him to continue enjoying his shaver.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a Braun for many years.</li>
            <li>better than a cheaper replacement that I think was made in China and came from Korea</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s face is smooth again!</li>
            <li>Braun should do better by its customers.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;ok...</li>
            <li>Pricing and  delivery was excellent, will definitely order again when needed.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on the 51s and wasn&#x27;t pleased, however I note this assembly was made in Germany, not China.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the product and pleased with Amazon&#x27;s customer service.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with the replacement cutter and screen.</li>
            <li>I am also pleased that the price has been reduced.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave!</li>
            <li>The manufacturer recommends replacing them at 18 month intervals, so I knew it should have lasted more than two months.</li>
            <li>This was a more inexpensive part than the one made specifically for the Braun Activator Shaver and works perfectly--both cutter and screen.</li>
            <li>This product was authentic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The replacement blades seem to work better then when it was new.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li>There is nothing more to say.</li>
            <li>Glad Amazon had this</li>
            <li>I an perfectly satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Will by again is a great price for the right fit.</li>
            <li>I change the blade about on e every 18 months and this genuine Braun replacement was priced right and works great.</li>
            <li>I have used most other popular brand razors and like this one the best.  </li>
            <li>Works good and the price was right</li>
            <li>Good to use the right replacement parts.  </li>
            <li>Right away I didn&#x27;t get a good shave.</li>
            <li>Exactly the way described!!!</li>
            <li>However, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the replacement and it&#x27;s actually better than what it originally came with!  </li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping good item</li>
            <li>Now I get a good smooth quick shave, no scraping or pulling.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First couple shaves were good.</li>
            <li>Was sent to me packaged pretty good as well</li>
            <li>Pretty good quality for your shave machine, I would advise to replace it once a year.</li>
            <li>The original lasted 18 Months, as advertised!</li>
            <li>Husband was excited to get this for Christmas!</li>
            <li>As you move the razor, you&#x27;ll get that eye opening riiiipppp, that just screams, \\&quot;Welcome to the new day!\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I installed this NEW set and trust me, it shaves GREAT.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However the quality is great and using it is like having a brand new shaver.</li>
            <li>My husband needed a new razor head and it works great</li>
            <li>and I was happy I purchased the new parts.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell a great deal of difference with the new blade</li>
            <li>But there is no doubt that the new blades, also part of the package, make a great difference to the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get a really nice clean shave really smooth on the skin you feel like you just shaved with razor in soap</li>
            <li>Easy to install and a must after many shaves.  </li>
            <li>Braun series 5 combi 51s foil and cutter replacement pack is good, only replace them every 6months and good price.</li>
            <li>Then I learned that the Braun 30B replacement cutter - which is actually made for the 7000 series shavers - fits perfectly on the 8585 and does an absolutely fantastic job.</li>
            <li>I purchased it initially because of the awesome, smooth shave that the Gillette-branded blades provided.  </li>
            <li>It fit perfectly and works just as well as his last one.</li>
            <li>Once again, I now experience a great Activator / 360 Complete shave!</li>
            <li>Works great &amp; shipped super fast!</li>
            <li>An excellent product, easy to install, lasts a long time--about 18 mos.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite sure this will work just fine</li>
            <li>pairing was a mistake by Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Product is probably fine for the appropriate razor model.</li>
            <li>The head itself is fine and it works ok.</li>
            <li>I am comletely satisfied with the product (working better than original one) and delivery on time(exceed my expectation).</li>
            <li>Shaves as good or better than new!</li>
            <li>A standard foil/cutter package at at very good price.</li>
            <li>This is about the third replacement blade I have bought for my razor and while the service was really very good with the parts arriving within 3-4 days</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how the heck they quantitatively compute a percentage increase for the efficacy of a shave (25% better?), but qualitatively there is a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe I am one of the more fortunate people</li>
            <li>Shaves are more comfortable, closer and are finished quicker to boot.</li>
            <li>This is a great improvement on the old foil &amp; cutter rom Braun.</li>
            <li>Great product, I bought the replacement razor for my Braun Series 5 360 complete.  </li>
            <li>The product was just what we expected, and the service was excellent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise though, this product is a great way to extend the life of your electric razor for another year or two at a time, especially with the ballooning costs of traditional shaving, this is a wonderful avenue.</li>
            <li>Worked great on my husband&#x27;s 6 yr old Braun Activator series.  </li>
            <li>Once I was able to break the foil and cutter free from the packaging</li>
            <li>Great replacement my razor is over 10 years old</li>
            <li>and they fit perfectly ok my razor.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and good value.</li>
            <li>Good seller, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>good price, and fast shipping</li>
            <li>good price and fast service</li>
            <li>Really does a good job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, because the Activator is an excellent shaver that worked very well for years, but the new foil renders it unusable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was good, but a new razor was better.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality - easy to install - faster than expected delivery.</li>
            <li>Honestly 18 months is about right to replace these.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found over all the other ones I was using,</li>
            <li>bought the cheaper 7000 series foil as a replacement and it works more like the original foil and cutter.  </li>
            <li>The cutter in this one is more like the original for my Activator.  </li>
            <li>The cutter block and foil on the original shaver was much better.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied with its performance and it seems to work as well as the original one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li>My Braun now works better than I can ever remember since the original date of purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nope, not a bad thing at all!  </li>
            <li>Everything seems to be working well - the shaver is as good as new!</li>
            <li>Now I just buy the foil and cutter replacement and I am good to go, just like new!</li>
            <li>I replace each year and it feels as good as new!</li>
            <li>Easy to replace</li>
            <li>A great feet of German engineering :-)</li>
            <li>Easy to install.</li>
            <li>Easy to replace.  </li>
            <li>Easy to replace.</li>
            <li>It was shipped in the plastic molded container and was easy to install onto the shaver.</li>
            <li>This product is so easy to change, don&#x27;t have to have a PhD.</li>
            <li>Easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and easy to install.</li>
            <li>These replacement parts arrived very quickly via mail.</li>
            <li>easy to install.</li>
            <li>Husband is really happy, He has had trouble finding  this and is delighted with the price.</li>
            <li>I always took the foil off and cleaned the shaver in the self cleaner without it to get a better clean.</li>
            <li>This arrived very quickly and was as described.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how good it feels to actually have your beard hair cut and not pulled out!&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I could use my electric shaver..as it be much easy to hold too then a Razor Blade ( mach3 )</li>
            <li>Easy off and on replacement.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you clean them often</li>
            <li>It was easy to install.</li>
            <li>But this easily washed off.</li>
            <li>Great price on this item that sells for $20 more in local stores.</li>
            <li>I purchased the razor in the spring of 2005 and change it about every 12 -14 months, still going strong.  </li>
            <li>but I strongly suspect it</li>
            <li>Fit perfectly on my Braun as expected.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is the first time with this new series 5 and the result has been very good.</li>
            <li>i think its way too high but if you want a good shave who are you going to complain to ...</li>
            <li>The product shipped in great time, was the right part without damage, and replaces the worn out parts as promised, and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Installation is easy, even for someone who is not known for having nimble fine motor skills.</li>
            <li>What I just received is amazingly smooth; even better than I remember the original.</li>
            <li>Nice, sharp, great replacement.</li>
            <li>I gave it a full three months before deciding that it was indeed the foil/cutter block, that was the problem, and not me :)&lt;</li>
            <li>This new foil and cutter head have transformed my 3 year-old Braun shaver into a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Works just GREAT !</li>
            <li>Excellent, the shaver is like new with the new foil and cutter</li>
            <li>The price was the best hands down between any store or online-site.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember ever getting a shave this good when the razor was new.  </li>
            <li>Not quite as good as new.....</li>
            <li>This new cutter block and foil are not as good</li>
            <li>Good buy and will make your rates are shaved like new.</li>
            <li>Shaver was not doing a good job, But now with the new blades.</li>
            <li>The item was shipped in time, and now the shaver works as good as new.</li>
            <li>I forgot how good new blades are.</li>
            <li>it looked fine until i removed it.&lt;br /&gt;then</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>just want to agree with that one I found and read, this item does indeed work fine with the 8585 model.</li>
            <li>Fits by 8595 series 5 just fine.</li>
            <li>It worked fine.</li>
            <li>This product works fine with my 8985 series shaver.  </li>
            <li>now, it has held up just fine, but it hurts when using it...</li>
            <li>This is a razor head replacement and works just fine.</li>
            <li>This replacement pack worked fine on my 8000 series shaver.  </li>
            <li>I forgot that the hairs were not supposed to be ripped out at the root but finely cut.</li>
            <li>The replacement worked fine for me.</li>
            <li>Braun series 5 foil and cutter replacement works fine on my model 8595.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave, and easy to install.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m assuming that it works fine</li>
            <li>Fits my Braun Series 8585 fine, no muss, no fuss.</li>
            <li>Worked fine.  </li>
            <li>The Amazon experience is always just fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>It fits perfectly and seems to cut just as well as the previous generations.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, works fine.</li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>It works fine; no discomfort and a close shave.  </li>
            <li>And, it works fine.</li>
            <li>and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Item works fine, no issues with it.</li>
            <li>Fit like it should and was easy to install.  </li>
            <li>Works fine...</li>
            <li>The products I ordered seem to work fine.  </li>
            <li>Worked fine.</li>
            <li>and I fully expect that it will work fine.</li>
            <li>Very happy to have the razor performing like new on this old face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how I managed for forget how well it shaved when new, or maybe this is better than it used to be.</li>
            <li>Does a good job of a smooth shave when new and undamaged.</li>
            <li>I was a bit apprehensive buying parts for my Braun over the internet, but the description and information about the shavers it would fit was accurate and easy to understand.  </li>
            <li>After about ten years, the motor works as it did the day I bought it, the battery still holds a charge that easily takes me through a week, and the cleaning system continues to do a great job.</li>
            <li>Does a good job but not as good as my previous two purchases of foil/cutter from Braun that I would rate a five.</li>
            <li>The cutter block fit fine</li>
            <li>The Braun replacement parts fit and work fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is just a replacement and it fit just fine.  </li>
            <li>It fit my razor just fine.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to replace the parts and the first shaves were a noticable improvement with no problems or issues.  </li>
            <li>Exact replacement parts, very easy to replace.</li>
            <li>My original Braun 8000 series razor is still going strong even if some of th epaint is wearing off.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to try the new ones they sent to see if they&#x27;re any better, but it was a very nice gesture and definitely appreciated, considering I purchased this set for almost $40.</li>
            <li>The new Braun blades and foil seem to be superior to the original product.</li>
            <li>As good as can be, though will never shave as close as original Eltron-Braun which is now 20 years new.</li>
            <li>I love the way just shaved my face so quickly and easily in the morning its way better than using a blade and shaving cream and hot water etc etc and cheaper too</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and was concerned about quality but found the reviews helpful about making sure to not push too hard for the best shave.</li>
            <li>and this was a perfect fit/replacement for the original foil and cutter I&#x27;ve had for about a year and a half.  </li>
            <li>Foil and cutter hard to find a good one for this razor, but this works great.  </li>
            <li>Huge savings over retail.</li>
            <li>What a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>my face is smooth.</li>
            <li>Made it run quieter and felt smooth against my skin for a close shave.</li>
            <li>so I order these after checking around for a few months and these were the best deal.  </li>
            <li>the shave is pain free and close.</li>
            <li>After 16 months or so the replace foil/cutter light came on.</li>
            <li>I have ordered before off Amazon, genuine parts and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>A real necessity, if you own a shaver.</li>
            <li>Others sound like a roaring jet engine in comparison.</li>
            <li>The Sears store is a joke for replacement parts - they&#x27;re locked on the racks (if available) and there is no help.</li>
            <li>and this was genuine</li>
            <li>There were two model numbers available  </li>
            <li>In fact I am faced with buying yet another set in order to onve again shave comfortably and not have my face ripped off</li>
            <li>Panasonic electric razors are rated great in Consumer Reports so my next electric will be a Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I DID NOT GET THIS PRODUCT FREE OR AT A DISCOUNT IN RETURN FOR A REVIEW</li>
            <li>and I had forgotten how smooth this shaver can perform.</li>
            <li>They fit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced none of the issues mentioned, quite the opposite.</li>
            <li>Both gave me a comfortable shave, but the 51S gave me a closer shave faster.</li>
            <li>Please also check out the 2 images I&#x27;ve uploaded (available in the customer images</li>
            <li>I have experienced the opposite, thankfully.  </li>
            <li>No problems at all with fit, or performance.</li>
            <li>but it will fit and</li>
            <li>The blade fit my razor but the foil didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews from others and seeing that it would fit with my shaver, I went ahead and purchased this replacement foil and cutter</li>
            <li>it is important that you periodicly replace the screen and the blade.</li>
            <li>I only had this one for 4 days and its great.</li>
            <li>, I keep clean easily and replace the screen and head&lt;</li>
            <li>but it is great to find them online and avoid the big box stores.</li>
            <li>have had the razor for a number of years and continue to enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Given my heavy shave requirements I think the 5 series is excellent...</li>
            <li>This item is wearing through after 60 days of light use.</li>
            <li>product fit as advertised.  </li>
            <li>replacement cutter/foils fit this shaver.  </li>
            <li>still works great 13 years later!</li>
            <li>Each time I think I&#x27;m going to now get these incredibly smooth shaves.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and fit with no problems.</li>
            <li>A smooth, close shave, with no bite.</li>
            <li>It works and I save money, but I don&#x27;t enjoy using the product.</li>
            <li>I ordered the replacement kit which arrived on time and worked smoothly.  </li>
            <li>; no iiritation, smooth, and dependable.</li>
            <li>Fantastic  product.  </li>
            <li>self-cleaning razor system flashes a light when 18 months&lt;</li>
            <li>time around, I&#x27;m not waiting for the &#x27;replacement reminder&#x27; light to go off on me!&lt;br</li>
            <li>great deal for my daily shaver</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not a Braun fan you&#x27;re missing the best shave on the market.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Recommend genuine Braun parts for your razor&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Rubbing a cheese grater over my face would be a preferable experience to what this cheaply engineered and manufactured replacement head puts me through every morning.</li>
            <li>SMOOTH  </li>
            <li>Nice, fast and just as it was described.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Initial foil and blade on my series 5 was fantastic and durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Part arrived quickly, in good order, and it was exactly what I ordered, the electric razor now works again, and cuts very well!</li>
            <li>I purchased a Braun Series 5 360 Complete and loved the shaver.  </li>
            <li>far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>As good or better as when my last foil/cutter was new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li>afyer reading others reviews I gave it a shot and bought the one they recommended ( Made in GERMANY) , not in China!..and so far so good.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied with the performance and it has given the razor a good refresh.</li>
            <li>I need to shave with it for a year or so to judge durability, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>In my experience the foil design of the 30b is FAR superior to the foil design of the 51s.</li>
            <li>It is a far superior product in every way than the 51s.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, have gone back to safety razor and realize just how satisfying a really good, close shave can be.  </li>
            <li>The razor cuts 5 times better (just a guess, but much much better), is quieter, and now my razor stays charged much longer.  </li>
            <li>So easy to remember to change your foil when the replacement part comes right to your front door!  </li>
            <li>The cutter worked fine, easy to install quickly.  </li>
            <li>Instead, buy the 30B and enjoy smooth and comfortable shaves that are even closer than the original cutter head on the 8585.</li>
            <li>Was very pleased with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Items have restored my razor to the shaving comfort when it was brand new.</li>
            <li>sure you order the right one for your shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this foil works for the right razor.  </li>
            <li>Works good, just wish Braun would make the Gillette heads again like what originally came with the 360 complete</li>
            <li>great nice and sharp, shipped right out</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t perfect for every type of facial hair, but it does a decent job.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I had saved the original foil and have reinstalled it.  </li>
            <li>Product as expected, good price and prompt delivery to Australia!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered these before, and they have always fit my razor like the original did.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and lasts the full 18 months.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave closely, quickly, nor easily.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t let the beard get too long (say more than 2 days of growth in my case), no pulling and a superior shave from the 51S.  </li>
            <li>My husband said the foil was quick and easy to replace.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!</li>
            <li>My 8585 now shaves like new, maybe better!</li>
            <li>This new foil fits great and gives a really close shave.  </li>
            <li>I have used this razor for many years and have used Amazon for ordering replacement packs because of easy accessibility and reasonable pricing.</li>
            <li>Bruan is well worth the money!</li>
            <li>The original was for 5 years.</li>
            <li>I see and feel no difference between this replacement and the original.</li>
            <li>It cuts like the original.</li>
            <li>My original foil that came with the shaver got chipped within 4 months.</li>
            <li>The Braun series 5 replacement cutter is just like the original in the Braun 360 razor.</li>
            <li>When I contacted them regarding the discontinued support for the original foil/cutter block, their response was to refer me to a store called the Essentials, which to no surprise, no longer carries the original.</li>
            <li>THE ORIGINAL EMAIL</li>
            <li>I have the 8595 razor, and the original foil lasted beyond 18 months before a hole formed.  </li>
            <li>I used my original blades and foil for 2 to 3 years.  </li>
            <li>After replacing the foil it shaves like it originally did, with no nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li>Replacing the foil and cutter made a significant improvement in the performance of the razor.  </li>
            <li>My razor originally came with a \\&quot;smart\\&quot; foil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an improvement over the original, and</li>
            <li>I used my original cutter and foil set for well beyond two years without significant decrease in effectiveness.</li>
            <li>It is not anyway like the original blade/foil that came on the razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;My shaver hummed like I had just opened it from the original packaging.  </li>
            <li>The first time I replaced the blades on this about 2 or more years ago, YES, they sucked.</li>
            <li>I still have the original blade and foil set AND the REPLACEMENT set that basically SUCKED.</li>
            <li>Original Braun.</li>
            <li>This replacement is actually better than the first replacement I bought.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t risk it, buy Braun Original replacements.</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>Great shaver as long as I replace the cutters and head every year.  </li>
            <li>what can you say it is a replacement part of a worn out part it works like the original as by design.</li>
            <li>I still have the original foiil and block on the 590.</li>
            <li>The reviews brought home how unsatisfied I have been since replacing the original block and foil.  </li>
            <li>They seem to be the closest to the original.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as the original</li>
            <li>just like original.</li>
            <li>The original one lasted two years</li>
            <li>I had overextended the original shaver head.  </li>
            <li>I had my original blades for 18 months</li>
            <li>and  I wish to get the original ones</li>
            <li>The original foil broke</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s $18.00 more than I paid for the first one</li>
            <li>not a disappointment at all!</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for the original foil on my 8000 series razor.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll continue with the replacement heads as long as it survives, a great shave.</li>
            <li>Original braun product</li>
            <li>I purchased this kit for my dad to replace the worn out original parts.</li>
            <li>it did not work as well as the original shipped with the braun.</li>
            <li>The original foil and cutter lasted 3 years before the foil broke</li>
            <li>I dropped my shaver on vacation and broke the original foil.  </li>
            <li>For some background, I have had a Braun 8995 for probably 4 or so years using the original foil/blade.</li>
            <li>I was still using the original head after 3 years.  </li>
            <li>This cutter restored original performance to my shaver.  </li>
            <li>Worth the 27-28$!</li>
            <li>I did not notice any difference from the original parts.</li>
            <li>My original foil lasted for years without a problem.</li>
            <li>Worked just like the original</li>
            <li>I compared it to my original blade that came with shaver and</li>
            <li>I get many stuff from Amazon and this is the first thing I get that is junk...</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Braun is one of the best electric shavers on the market today and past years.</li>
            <li>Then I remembered that my shaver foil didn&#x27;t look like the original one on the Braun Series 5 590cc.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend&#x27;s original foil and cutter lasted just under 2 years before it needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li>so it was exactly what I ordered and it will fit his razor!</li>
            <li>This is the original OEM replacement foil and cutter for my Braun.  </li>
            <li>The original foil and cutter had been in use for over 5 years.</li>
            <li>but it gives me a closer, smoother shave than the original without any pulling or discomfort.</li>
            <li>The original foil lasted about 18 months.</li>
            <li>Also...my original order did not show up.  </li>
            <li>Had the original foil for about two years.</li>
            <li>Just like the original.</li>
            <li>Upgraded foil pattern over the original that came with my Braun.  </li>
            <li>should have looked here first since the price was better.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li>My husband uses his Braun Shaver every morning and is thrilled with his new replacement foil and cutter.  </li>
            <li>This new blade set gave me a REALLY nice shave after three days of not shaving.</li>
            <li>Also, many thanks for discontinuing the Activator branded replacement foil that gave me a comfortable shave every day for 2 years.</li>
            <li>After figuring it out, I love it and think it is better than the old version.  </li>
            <li>The shave is quick and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I know how to take care of their shavers and blades, don&#x27;t push it into your beard and keep it clean and all of that.</li>
            <li>I get a clean, close shave</li>
            <li>Works awesome, no issues and seems to last nearly a year.</li>
            <li>Got a clean shave after 5 minute switch out.</li>
            <li>recommend to anyone who needs a clean shave</li>
            <li>so the block/blade below can make a clean cut without any tugging/pulling.</li>
            <li>Well I finally found this and despite the difficulty determining which was for my razor it is by far the best version to date.</li>
            <li>I have a series 8000 Braun Clean and Renew system (8781)</li>
            <li>so I manually clean my shaver after each use.  </li>
            <li>This cuts closely, cleanly, etc., etc.</li>
            <li>Used my old set for many many years and never replaced it.  </li>
            <li>CLEAN  </li>
            <li>To be precise, it&#x27;s the new foil that does it; the shave head itself is actually perfectly fine, and in fact I think cuts better than the original.</li>
            <li>this blade and foil is not as good as the original one, and it is not the same as the original one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to be able to replace parts instead of having to buy a whole new razor.  </li>
            <li>Despite some of the negative reviews posted about this replacement foil and cutter, I found the items were a perfect replacement for the original 8000 series shaving heads.</li>
            <li>I recently decided to purchase some from Amazon and was excited to find them at what I thought was a fair price.</li>
            <li>In fact, if you have one of the great braun 8000&#x27;s, you might as well buy a new shaver from another manufacturer to avoid the new cutter block altogether.</li>
            <li>New blades a new foil are great to have every year.</li>
            <li>The replacement foil and cutter replacement packs are very easy to install and last more than 6 months each time I replace them.</li>
            <li>Husband said the replacement parts work great would highly recommend to anyone, he reorders these parts when needed, saves on buying the complete shaver</li>
            <li>No issues and experienced a close shave as expected.</li>
            <li>Fits great and works as expected.</li>
            <li>The foil and cutter performance appeared good at the start but within a very short time (about 6 weeks of shaving once per day)</li>
            <li>Only good thing is its cheaper.</li>
            <li>I recommend replacing every 6 months rather than waiting a full year.</li>
            <li>The shave is fairly close, closer than the prior 7000 series replacement heads.</li>
            <li>and it was getting to where I really really needed to, even at the risk of getting what many here are calling a junk replacement.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to think these products are not too good.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s undergone the most changes and which really help.</li>
            <li>I wish these companies would make a better foil that did not wear out so fast.</li>
            <li>Nice to keep the old unit going.</li>
            <li>My husband has been using this razor for several years now, the replacement foil/cutter are a good price considering he replaces it about once a year.</li>
            <li>Quick, Clean Shave each time with no scratches or nicks.</li>
            <li>Love the whole concept of the electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Full disclosure</li>
            <li>Can anyone with confidence tell me where I can buy an ACTUAL good replacement cutter for this model?</li>
            <li>They still do a good job of shaving, but they tend to last just over 1-1/2 months.</li>
            <li>The only reason I haven&#x27;t returned it is because it&#x27;s been used a number of times and I can&#x27;t in good conscience return something for a refund that&#x27;s been used.  </li>
            <li>It cuts better and gives a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>Work as good as the one I bought as the local store.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After swapping in the new product (very easy to do), man, did the shaving get a lot closer than it used to.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE one year later:  FIrst couple of months was great but it quickly degraded.  </li>
            <li>Shaver delivers a much more comfortable shave with the new foil and cutter.</li>
            <li>The foil screen doesn&#x27;t quite fit right</li>
            <li>Not the right fit for my shaver.</li>
            <li>I see some other people complaining about this replacement model but it works great for me.</li>
            <li>In fact my first one that I own for 20 years (and keep as back up) gives me a better shave.  </li>
            <li>This new cutter/foil also seems to incorporate some advances from the series 5 generation of Braun Razors (The power cutter and blades are improved), so it seems to do a better job in that regard than the original Activator cutter/foil too.</li>
            <li>After replacing the blade and screen it shaved better than new!</li>
            <li>I love the smoothness of the new blades!  </li>
            <li>, was exactly what I ordered and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Is not cutting as cleanly as you remember?  </li>
            <li>glad to finally replace my old foil and cutter, feels good to shave clean, again.</li>
            <li>super product.</li>
            <li>I think the older design cut better.</li>
            <li>It also shaves closer without needing to go over the same place as many times and seems to do a better job of lifting hairs.  </li>
            <li>They worked and were as decribed, they came quickly.</li>
            <li>Best price I have found on these bad boys, good ddeal</li>
            <li>Love this product: been using it for more than ten years.</li>
            <li>The cutter does fit and seems to work ok with the old foil.</li>
            <li>It is supposed to be quick using an electric razor but</li>
            <li>the older version did cut a littler closer then this one but all around this one is better in my opinon.</li>
            <li>but luckily I found these replacement cutters</li>
            <li>Product as promised, and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Probably like most owners of a Braun Series 5 shaver, I have read the many critical reviews of the company&#x27;s replacement foil &amp; cutter (&#x27;51S&#x27;).  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Received quickly.  </li>
            <li>Quickly delivered and does the job.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and delivery.</li>
            <li>These only last 12 at best</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It also is affordable and was shipped to me quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly</li>
            <li>The screen and cutter were an exact  OEM fit.</li>
            <li>you read the \\&quot;comments to my review\\&quot; section, you will know that I have long since switched to the 30B foil and cutter block for my 8985 shaver, with good results.</li>
            <li>you read the \\&quot;comments to my review\\&quot; section, you will know that I have long since switched to the 30B foil and cutter block for my 8985 shaver, with good results.</li>
            <li>The new one takes less time to shave with the best result.</li>
            <li>This replacement for my Activator is like getting a new razor -- new cutter and block perform just like the original with a  nice close clean shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that the problem with this product has been fixed and now it works exactly as I remember it working when my 360 shaver (model 8595) was new.</li>
            <li>Great price for this becoming hard to find replacement parts.</li>
            <li>now requires very little pressure to get a great, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>The new blade and foil leads to many pulled hairs</li>
            <li>I was pleased at the price and the new closer shave.</li>
            <li>the new screen and cutter work better and shave cleaner when used together.</li>
            <li>My husband is so pleased to have a new foil delivered every 6 months.</li>
            <li>Much better shave now with new foil.</li>
            <li>He was able to replace his blades without even looking at the instructions and says that it works like it is brand new.  </li>
            <li>But this new screen and cutter block design are better than anything I&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I reread reviews on here and found out the new shipment of packs had been re-upped in quality.  </li>
            <li>This works better than the foil and cutter that were replaced (as they should being brand new parts).  </li>
            <li>So I will never use that again and most my money go to this nursing home that I live in..</li>
            <li>In fact it seems that I&#x27;m getting a better shave now than I did when the razor was new.</li>
            <li>Was a new cutter and foil and fit my shaver fine.</li>
            <li>It is less $ and works great.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and easy to install on existing razor.  </li>
            <li>It gives and excellent close shave for the first 2 months, then starts loses its edge after that time.</li>
            <li>Installation was fast and easy.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Braun for making the replacement so easy.</li>
            <li>As always, fast shipping and easy ordering from Amazon</li>
            <li>Not at all the clean, fast shave I got with my original blades.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I pay for!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>(the first lasted two years!)</li>
            <li>Got it on time and works exactly like my original!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li>This blade and cover are an exact replica of the original ones.  </li>
            <li>If you like Braun razors this replacement cutter is the exact original, and works new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price and fits unit.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for, a bit confused since the model number changed, but the part fit perfect</li>
            <li>This replacement blade is not built exactly like the original blade.  </li>
            <li>The razor shaves like it did when I first bought it!</li>
            <li>The first two primal blades holed 4-5 months!</li>
            <li>Brought my shaver back to being able to cut again!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve been using the same foils and cutters for a year or more, it&#x27;s time to make the change!</li>
            <li>Nothing looked drastically different, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of comfort, the 51S felt great, like a new kit should.</li>
            <li>The shaver runs cooler, cuts more effectively, and pulls at the hairs less.</li>
            <li>This replacement was reasonably priced, arrived quickly and gave me a close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Apparently the company knew about this and changed the design of the openings to a more circular hole pattern instead of the triangular holes in the original.</li>
            <li>This is the same exact foil and cutter as the original if you own a 360 Complete/8985</li>
            <li>and I put it on and everything looks fine so far (except for the looks and also that the travel case plastic cover doesn&#x27;t quite fit since there is no notch on the foil cover</li>
            <li>Although I do not love the razor that this product goes with the best, the Braun Series 5 provides a decent shave</li>
            <li>I normally have good cutters and foils shipped to me, but for some reason the cutter was not sharp at all this time.</li>
            <li>it is not the original blade or foil, so it does not work with the original (high end) Activator.  </li>
            <li>Working great, don&#x27;t have to work hard, a light touch</li>
            <li>This razor head is a hard to find item and it came in perfect condition and at a better price than the last time I had to replace it.</li>
            <li>I get comfortable with what the worn our foil and cutter was doing and didn&#x27;t realize just how much smoother my skin would feel after a replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but shipping was free and fast.</li>
            <li>Too much work for a cheap item.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>So far the Panasonic seems much better than the Braun.</li>
            <li>Also, I use to feel occasional pull, which kind of hurts, when I shave with smartfoil.  </li>
            <li>This replacement works much better than the old blade.</li>
            <li>but honestly it seemed to shave the same since the day I purchased the shaver</li>
            <li>but at a fraction of the cost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely post reviews</li>
            <li>Well okay, it isn&#x27;t completely junk</li>
            <li>Updating the foil and cutter is worth it.</li>
            <li>I discovered that the old style requires more pressure on your face to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>This is compounded by an old cutter block that has seen more than 18 months of use.  </li>
            <li>I still feel that my last Panasonic shaver did better than this Braun, and I primarily attribute that to the foil/cutter design.</li>
            <li>Economical way to get replacement cutter.</li>
            <li>it looks like they fixed it, and more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice close shave and only takes about 5 minutes per day.  </li>
            <li>I suppose if they had surprised me with more I would have given them five stars.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Price was good, delivered sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>this replacement is far better than what came with my shaver...  </li>
            <li>the blades and the screen were great ,easy to install,once again i could have a clean shave  with the razor cutting myself,i would definatly would tell any body that has one ther shaves and is having trouble shaving to check it out they go a real good job</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase</li>
            <li>Well worth the replacement cost.</li>
            <li>Probably, but it&#x27;s so worth it when you use it.</li>
            <li>Much better than the old one that broke.</li>
            <li>Well, no shaver is fun with the blade hitting skin.</li>
            <li>well worth doing to rejuvenate your Braun.</li>
            <li>With this &amp;#34;cutter&amp;#34;, there is no cutting noise at all.</li>
            <li>Not cutting close.  </li>
            <li>Braun does far more than that.  </li>
            <li>This is exciting as a set of replacement foils can be.</li>
            <li>This is a complete waste, as the rest of the razor is still excellent.</li>
            <li>Much better than the old one that started to break.</li>
            <li>Works great, smooth shave and foil cover fits well if not a little tight compared to the original.</li>
            <li>I think I had &#x27;tears of joy&#x27; after using this new foil after a long weekend where I hadn&#x27;t shaved for three days.  </li>
            <li>My first shave with the new foil/cutter was better than I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Love the shaver unit for long battery &amp; charge life, easy use but the plummeting quality of cutter replacement may force me to abandon it.</li>
            <li>I think this new foil gives a closer and more comfortable shave, kind of like the previous generation 8000 series used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It simply works great, and the price was much better than from other sources.</li>
            <li>this foil and cutter are so fine tuned that the unit is quieter in-use than I can ever remember; it performs like new too!</li>
            <li>worked great for what we needed, replacement for a ripped old head and a new blade, made a new life out of my razor</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say if it is any better than the original shaver foil and cutter that came with my shaver, as it performs similarly.  </li>
            <li>Since I first started purchasing replacements, I have not managed to get even two months of use of each of 3 sets, and the effectiveness did not match that of the original even when first installed.</li>
            <li>The foil is slightly different than the original I think for the better.</li>
            <li>, I actually was getting a better shave than with the original equipment.  </li>
            <li>Braun razors are the best but only with sharp shaving heads and foil.</li>
            <li>I have no idea where the negative comments are coming from, but my best guess is that they&#x27;re coming from people who are replacing parts on older razors, not the Series 5 razors.  </li>
            <li>Experienced same issues as others noted, doesn&#x27;t shave as close now and major irritation.  </li>
            <li>It cuts very well and evenly without the pain and discomfort of the original.  </li>
            <li>Good for shave due to quality</li>
            <li>Very good product and razor blades last a long time.</li>
            <li>is the right product for you.</li>
            <li>it pops right in the shaver.</li>
            <li>I could not find the right one in the retail store</li>
            <li>It always popped right off.</li>
            <li>She was right.  </li>
            <li>You have to replace your foils every 18 months (and that is about right)</li>
            <li>Worked in my shaver and the price was right.</li>
            <li>The price was right too.&lt;br /&gt;No problems.</li>
            <li>they were right here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The improvement was noticeable right away.  </li>
            <li>right outta</li>
            <li>Easy to replace and works like new.  </li>
            <li>have seen this exact same package sell out of N.Y.C. for around $50, so I felt it was an amazing deal, almost bought two.</li>
            <li>So save your money &amp; enjoy your closer shaves with the older foil kits on your Series 5.</li>
            <li>Shaves now are much quicker and clean again.</li>
            <li>This product fit my razor, even though I have an older model.  </li>
            <li>When I shaved the first time with the replacement I thought at first it wasn&#x27;t doing anything!  </li>
            <li>Nice to have a sharp clean blade again.</li>
            <li>This was money well spent for $39 I now have a like new razor that produces a great close shave.</li>
            <li>Changing it out is simple and the razor was as good as new when it was done.</li>
            <li>Very easy to switch old for new!</li>
            <li>Back to smooth, easy shaves.</li>
            <li>New screen worked just fine on my 8000 series razor, would have given it 5 stars except for the shipping problem.  </li>
            <li>the new one works fine</li>
            <li>Shaves like new again, it worked fine.</li>
            <li>When you finely put new blades in, it works</li>
            <li>I just bought the 30B foil and cutter for my shaver after reading other similar suggestions and it works great - the cutter is designed differently but the dimensions are exactly the same and it fits perfectly with the shaver.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed to perk up a razor that was not cutting the hairs well and pulling in some cases..easy to swop it out.</li>
            <li>(roughly 7 years as opposed to the 18 month replacement recommendation by the manufacturer), so I was very pleased about that.  </li>
            <li>Product is the usual great quality from Braun.  </li>
            <li>This 5 series pack made an average shaver a good one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not entirely sure it&#x27;s as good as the original</li>
            <li>Works like new a close and smooth shave better then the 30b that others suggested cost little more but worth it for a close shave</li>
            <li>It installs fine but just doesn&#x27;t feel or sound the same.  </li>
            <li>Braun quality fit and finish made changing blade simple and quick!</li>
            <li>If you look at it in that light, it&#x27;s a pretty amazingly good buy relative to traditional razors.  </li>
            <li>I always love the first week of a new shaver head, quick smooth shaves, then it goes longer and longer to get the same effect.  </li>
            <li>To my dismay I quickly realized that the 51 S is nowhere near the quality that the razor originally came with.</li>
            <li>I had chucked the old one in my cabinet and lo and behold the OLD ORIGINAL foil works 10 times better than this GARBAGE replacement they are selling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>foil and cutter set was not the correct match (fit) for my new Series 5 razor.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>As stated, the new replacement head made my old shaver as good as when it was new.</li>
            <li>needed a new foil and cutter, i bought my 5 series in 2008 and it fit it well....</li>
            <li>I noticed the higher noise level right away.  </li>
            <li>Easy to swap out the old blade and foil and pop these in.  </li>
            <li>Great deal and prevents me going to A big box store for them only to be out</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I found it so easily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Series 3 foil and cutter as well, and even though this one costs more, I think it&#x27;s worth it since I only replace about every 2 years.</li>
            <li>The replacement screen and block are visually identical to what was on the shaver from the factory and the resulting shave is smooth, close, and comfortable.</li>
            <li>My current set was about a year old and my wife mentioned that I wasn&#x27;t getting a good shave.  </li>
            <li>It was so easy to replace the old parts</li>
            <li>worked well and continues to work properly with a clean easy shave.</li>
            <li>good replacement same as in wal-mart no problems fits my 360 complete grate.</li>
            <li>Braun razors used to give relatively quick and very close shaves.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a daily shaver and/or change the block/foil frequently there&#x27;s probably no discernible difference between the two but for anyone who, like me, goes a couple days between shaving and/or likes to maximize the life of the blade then the 30b is superior.</li>
            <li>this change gives me a new Braun!!!</li>
            <li>Works like new !!!</li>
            <li>Right out of the box (once I discovered how to get the old blade off), it cut so smoothly.</li>
            <li>I considered buying the new braun but changed my mind when I saw how much it was and knowing that with the new blade mine will be 94% as good as the new &#x27;improved&#x27; version.</li>
            <li>where I didn&#x27;t use it very much.</li>
            <li>The product arrived very fast</li>
            <li>THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE PERSON WHO RECOMENDED THE 7000 SERIES (</li>
            <li>THE PRICE WAS VERY REASONABLE.</li>
            <li>The Braun Shaver head was very reasonably priced versus the Braun website that quite often charges a premium.</li>
            <li>I like the Braun Series 5 shaver very much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, nothing to rave about.&lt;br /&gt;Bought it once and the second time you raised the price, so that wasn&#x27;t very smart on your part</li>
            <li>I am at a loss to understand how a genuine replacement part could be so inferior to the original one that came with the shaver as they look the same.  </li>
            <li>As most amazon shoppers know, prices fluctuate all the time and this is an item to throw in your cart (or save it for later) and then check back daily until you&#x27;re happy with the price or you&#x27;re willing to pay what it is</li>
            <li>Using it with my Braun 360 complete and works fine.</li>
            <li>&quot; but rest assured it will work fine on your 8000 series 360 Complete model too.</li>
            <li>The center strip seems to cut better than my original.</li>
            <li>I really love changing out to a new head, makes the razor seem brand new</li>
            <li>The bottom line is that the new foil/cutter performs better than when the razor was new.</li>
            <li>The new cutter and foil makes the electric razor feel better than it did when it was new.</li>
            <li>because if I don&#x27;t it does start to irritate a little, but all in all a good product.</li>
            <li>Replacing with the new shaver foil restored original performance</li>
            <li>But, performance of the new cutter and foil was just not up to the original.</li>
            <li>It is important to clean this head daily in order to prolong its life.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and a curly beard, which has become increasingly more so as I&#x27;ve gotten older.</li>
            <li>replacement is very easy and worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>Great replacement for when the cutter gets dull and the foil gets damaged.</li>
            <li>I bought this replacement pack along with the clean &amp; renew cartridges for my husband, in trying not to buy a brand new razor.  </li>
            <li>Both are super easy to change and are cheaper then throwing out your old razor and buying new.</li>
            <li>It made a HUGE difference in the shave I get from my old razor.</li>
            <li>I have been using a Braun for over for 20 years (not the same one) &amp; now I need to to put baby oil or olive oil w/lavender on my face for a better smoother shave.</li>
            <li>This is the only razor my husband likes after trying many others.</li>
            <li>I use my Braun for travel only, so the shaver takes more of a beating than my Norelco at home.  </li>
            <li>Also the newer cutter block fit both Braun 360 complete as well as Braun Activator</li>
            <li>you are looking for an exact replacement for the Braun Activator line of shavers</li>
            <li>/&gt;Reviewers, who are deciding to buy the 51S, or comparing 51S and 30B foils, should consult the more recent reviews, as those will pertain to the newer foils.</li>
            <li>Have noticed nothing different except a better shave.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I used this replacement foil.  </li>
            <li>At first, I though it was the incorrect head - but it is the correct replacement for my model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended for all my fellow cheapskates out there ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I read the reviews here on Amazon, because I realize that I&#x27;m not the only having issues with this foil.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaver works now like it did when I first used it about 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>Braun-the Ultimate shaver-like being able to buy replacement parts that don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg  </li>
            <li>Bought this Braun shaver (my first electric) at Sears a year ago for over 200 bucks.</li>
            <li>Braun advises to replace cutter and foil every 18 months and the foil and cutter would easily last 24 or even more months.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I bought it online.</li>
            <li>and you are straight!</li>
            <li>Funny thing:  </li>
            <li>Thanks to the reviewers who recommended this product as a replacement!</li>
            <li>I finally had to accept that the shaver just wasn&#x27;t inclined to cut wiskers any more.</li>
            <li>( i replaced the heads pretty close to the schedule).</li>
            <li>They were exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Much nicer shave with fresh foil and cutter.  </li>
            <li>First head lasted 3 or 4 years.</li>
            <li>and this is the first time I replace the cutter and foil.</li>
            <li>but pretty close.</li>
            <li>I have only experienced this before when I was shaving really fast or on a low charge.</li>
            <li>also wrote to Braun asking them if they were aware if \\&quot;Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack\\&quot; would work with the 8585</li>
            <li>I first started off with the cutter block of the 51S and foil of the 30B.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>When I first started using Braun, I could get 2-3 years out of a foil.</li>
            <li>Will order more in future.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny, now with the replacement foil and blades</li>
            <li>This feels like an exact replacement for my 5 series shaver.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted almost 10 months.  </li>
            <li>and this is the first time I ever had a problem.  </li>
            <li>I bought my most recent Braun 550 two years ago.  </li>
            <li>that were more than local retail.</li>
            <li>It was time for a replacement because my dad&#x27;s electric razor&#x27;s foil got damaged and he never changed the cutter from when he first got it.</li>
            <li>I use it daily.  :-)</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>and I started first on my neck.  </li>
            <li>The attached pic is exactly what mine looks like, but it&#x27;s a stock image for reference.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Hope its not a fake.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was expecting, thank you.</li>
            <li>Exact manufacturer&#x27;s replacement.</li>
            <li>First two were Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Braun Series 5 is an expensive razor, so refurbishing it made perfect sense.</li>
            <li>This one is the real deal!  </li>
            <li>This is the first time in a couple of years that I bought a cutter block &amp; foil for my Braun 8585 Razor, and they definitely changed the design for the better.</li>
            <li>(whisker) cutters are larger and work better.</li>
            <li>Which not only works better, but keeps the blades sharper (and hopefully longer).</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s also the first cutter block I&#x27;ve purchased in quite a while</li>
            <li>do not know if the ones in the stores are of any better quality and last longer.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>That is exactly what it does.</li>
            <li>Shipping was also fast!  </li>
            <li>Was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to find replacement heads locally.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the replacement pack and the first thing I noticed were the words \\&quot;Made in Germany\\&quot; on the package.  </li>
            <li>Great price and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and is the exact parts needed.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR</li>
            <li>Was exactly what it was described to be.  </li>
            <li>I know exactly what to expect when buying a replacement cutter and foil.</li>
            <li>So I glad I saved $10 buying it through amazon, instead of at our local Kmart.</li>
            <li>The one that came in from Amazon cut like the first one that came with my Series 5.  </li>
            <li>Personally, given how much better it worked after I replaced them, I&#x27;m going to replace at 12 months from now on.  </li>
            <li>I own a Braun 8985 and needed a replacement foil and was nervous about buying this one after reading some of the reviews, but I have been using it for a month or so now with absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li>Always exactly what we need.</li>
            <li>This is the exact replacement from the factory for my shaver.</li>
            <li>The installation was a breeze and the shaving experience is now again like it once was when I first bought the shaver.</li>
            <li>exactly what i needed</li>
            <li>Great value and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I needed for my Braun Shaver.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed my Braun Series 5 shaver for over 5 years and have only replaced the foil and cutter</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This saved me from buying a whole shaver!  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve gotten replacement cutters and foil for a shaver I received about 14 months ago.</li>
            <li>For anyone who wears glasses, if you remember the shock at the first time you ever put on a pair after months or years of having gotten used to the blurry world around you, you know how I&#x27;ve felt again about the morning shave.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Exactly the refill i was after for my Series 5.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>With the reviews here, I looked all over before ordering the first replacement 6 months ago.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and works well.  </li>
            <li>DUH, needed to change the head and block; the head &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34; cheaper but works quite great</li>
            <li>I have an old Braun Shaver and this screen and cutter was said to fit it.  </li>
            <li>One star is too much for this item!</li>
            <li>Exact replacement.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what is stated on line.  </li>
            <li>After a cleaning cycle I had no other problems and it performs flawlessly, still the closest electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and I have no intention of buying a new electric until this one completely bites the dust, as long as I can get these replacement foil/cutters and the rest of the razor</li>
            <li>, my strong recommendation is to avoid the 51S (I will most likely avoid Braun in general from now on) like the plague.</li>
            <li>If you have an older series 5 razor, you would think that this replacement part would fit, since there is nothing on the package or ad that says it is for a new type od series 5 razor!</li>
            <li>The new redesigned foil and cutter have completely destroyed my love for my shaver.</li>
            <li>Was able to use old foil with new cutter.  </li>
            <li>Wow you can tell the difference!!!!</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!  </li>
            <li>These are good but not long lasting.</li>
            <li>This comb design scrapes the skin more intensely (it is thicker, wider and protrudes more), which left me with a red face after shaving (from irritation).</li>
            <li>The blades are very thin, so it is best just to use the liquid cleaner.</li>
            <li>I too was surprised when I replaced my original cutter/foil set with these.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this replacement foil and cutter after using the original for nearly two years.  </li>
            <li>I assume this is all original equipment for my old Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>I just got another replacement blade and its so nice and sharp</li>
            <li>Worked just as well as the original for the 360 complete.</li>
            <li>But, as I remember,  it doesn&#x27;t shave quite as closely as the original set that came with my Braun 360 complete.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good feature of the Braun Series 5 because the replacement essentially returns the shaver to near new condition.</li>
            <li>Excellent replacements that are hard to find in any local store.</li>
            <li>arrived fast, easy to change,new sharp blade makes shaving easy and</li>
            <li>The New replacement pack installs easy and made the shaver work like new.</li>
            <li>After Braun switched to the new 5-Series branding the quality of the replacement heads declined quickly.  </li>
            <li>I needed the foil and cutter replacement set because my old one had holes in the screen I like the shaver because it gives a clean shave.</li>
            <li>I have to be extremely gentle especially when using around the lower jaw since it seems to hurt the most there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the second or third Braun I have had they are good razors</li>
            <li>The blades last and are of such good quality.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that it would help so much and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I should have run it through a cleaning cycle first as I got a little harmless residue on my face with the first use, but that aside, it performed just as good as when the razor was new.  </li>
            <li>Makes for a remarkable upgrade when the blades get dull.  </li>
            <li>My razor is over 10 years old and runs great due to the new blades and foils every three years or so.</li>
            <li>Seeing newer positive reviews encouraged me to take a chance on this one</li>
            <li>Fast and exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and the product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>this is exactly as advertised, and a whole lot cheaper than buying it in a brick and mortar store.</li>
            <li>I used straight razors for the first 34 years of my life, but my wife bought me this razor a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li>Removal of the old blade and installation of the new blade and cover were easy.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it to get a virtually new shaver.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the money to get new blades.</li>
            <li>Easy to install and only took about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>it was like 3 years old, I am lucky I did not keep using that.</li>
            <li>Amazon is an easy and affordable way to obtain these necessary parts.</li>
            <li>2nd replacement and still going strong.</li>
            <li>It was a good price but never seem to last as long as they say.  </li>
            <li>Braun always has good quality and long lasting sharpness.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s certainly a lot cheaper than going to the barber every two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Certainly a must to get.</li>
            <li>I found them, my razor feels like brand new!!</li>
            <li>I was only able to get it on Amazon, and the razor once again performed like it was brand new.</li>
            <li>I love my Braun shaver, and this is a quality replacement pack, bringing the shaver back to new performance capability.  </li>
            <li>I thought about a new shaver but at over 100 bucks I said someone must sell parts and sure enough there</li>
            <li>I almost gave up on it, but then decided I don&#x27;t want to spend so much on a new razor right now</li>
            <li>The new foil style really makes a difference in making sure that even the hairs growing parallel to the skin are raised and shaved.  </li>
            <li>My old foil and cutter had worn out completely, so had to replace with a new one that I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have had issues in  the past with the replacements not feeling as good as they should, but so far this one seems to be the right match.</li>
            <li>I bought the first replacement from the same place I bought the razor originally.</li>
            <li>Been ordering these Brain cutters for several years and they work fine, always arrive on time.</li>
            <li>but it works fine especially considering the price compared to brick and mortar stores.  </li>
            <li>It shaves and feels exactly the same as the original.</li>
            <li>This is the original replacement foil, and after using a knockoff foil and being completely disappointed, I am very happy to have purchased this.</li>
            <li>The replacement foil and cutter are exactly the same as original.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly which I needed to bring shaver back to original performance.</li>
            <li>If this is some sort of scheme to force people to replace an older electric razor with a newer one, well bravo!</li>
            <li>Price very high</li>
            <li>From what I can tell, the cutter seems to be exactly the same as what originally came with the razor, although this one is obviously much sharper than the one that was well over a year</li>
            <li>Good price for hard to find item.</li>
            <li>Similarly, the holes on the new 51S foil are much more uniform (if not a tad smaller) than the design of the foil on the original Activator foil.</li>
            <li>Numerous reviewers have complained that they&#x27;ve experienced significant irritation by the new product.</li>
            <li>hope Braun eventually gets the message that they need to pay as much attention to the quality of replacement parts as they do of the original, as this is a huge black eye for a company that I&#x27;ve always regarded with respect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now used to the fact that it&#x27;s just much better than the old foil, so I don&#x27;t really notice anymore, but the shave remains closer than it ever was with the original foil with less passes./&gt;Update 4/5/12</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now used to the fact that it&#x27;s just much better than the old foil, so I don&#x27;t really notice anymore, but the shave remains closer than it ever was with the original foil with less passes.</li>
            <li>It gives such a fast, comfortable shave</li>
            <li>I dont know when the last time i replaced my shaver head but this replacement pack is a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li>These recent 51S blocks are a huge improvement over what they used to be.  </li>
            <li>They seemed very apologetic, and actually sent me two free sets.</li>
            <li>The Bruan shaver is really a lifetime shaver.</li>
            <li>Really, you want me to rate a razor foil?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will fit your shaver but it is a different product.</li>
            <li>But my gripe is that the foils wear out too fast.</li>
            <li>The situation seems to be that Braun is pulling a fast shuffle on foil replacements.</li>
            <li>Replacing with the razor heads keeps each shave a smooth result and the power only needs recharging every three months!  </li>
            <li>With the volume of my voice, the whole household knew that I was getting that Epilady close shave that</li>
            <li>that absolutely nobody would want.  </li>
            <li>THE ONE I GOT WASN&#x27;T FOR #5735 - AND ONLY THE CUTTER FIT.</li>
            <li>With the fast oscilations of this model, there is no tugging</li>
            <li>After a month of use it literally hurts and pulls too much to use.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for carrying these.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived fast.</li>
            <li>it could be thanks to the Lectric</li>
            <li>Thanks Braun for making these replacement items and selling them together.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>Vendor is a fast shipper, will use this vendor again</li>
            <li>just what I needed and fast delivery</li>
            <li>Fast shipping with prime.</li>
            <li>Around 3-4 months to tell much change.</li>
            <li>eg pressing harder to make sure</li>
            <li>I decided to try Amazon, because I have been very satisfied with past transactions.  </li>
            <li>Fast ship.  </li>
            <li>but the point is it is very durable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a chance to try both of them now, and I much prefer the 51S for my 8585 shaver.</li>
            <li>It was just as smooth as using the earlier 8000 series or the 30B (cutter block and foil).</li>
            <li>It was just as smooth as using the earlier 8000 series or the 30B (cutter block and foil).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how close the shave is now and how much quicker it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I really need to replace mine every 6-9 months . . .</li>
            <li>I tried to adjust the tension of the foil by gently compressing it.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper here than at the box store.</li>
            <li>I really like my shaver</li>
            <li>Now only series 5 came up, so I hoped for a fit.</li>
            <li>I put off ordering one since I didn&#x27;t want a piece of junk, I wanted a real replacement.  </li>
            <li>the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually a Braun product instead of a cheap knockoff</li>
            <li>The replacement foils and cutters are very durable as well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference</li>
            <li>and I did not want to throw away the shaver because it works very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to the replacement foil I don&#x27;t have to throw the shaver away</li>
            <li>You only can get this part number to fit and its a matter of where you are going to purchase yours..</li>
            <li>This worked very well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I really like the Braun shaver, I may need to move to something else.  </li>
            <li>Why do manufacturers always change things that are not broken.</li>
            <li>This time it was very noticeable better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>No pulls or issues and a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>Something has absolutely changed, as others have pointed out.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast too.</li>
            <li>Shave is so much closer/smoother.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews posted for this foil/cutter replacement I was a bit nervous about how this would work, but as another reviewer said, this seems to be the real deal.  </li>
            <li>This replacement foil really improved performance.</li>
            <li>You need to replace your foil and cutter - minimum - every 18 months and this fits my Braun Series 5 550cc and works very well.</li>
            <li>Now amazon has promised to give me a credit, lets see how much of that is the truth.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this before for my shaver and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>Much more economical than the local stores, but of same quality!</li>
            <li>just what I expected love Braum</li>
            <li>It was exactly as I expected, and my shaves have been much better since I replaced it with this product.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>How much can one say about a razor screen?  </li>
            <li>I have to get more blades for that...and it harder to hold with my hand and fingers</li>
            <li>I really needed this.</li>
            <li>I was frankly amazed at how much difference it</li>
            <li>I really like my Braun shaver and finding Amazon had</li>
            <li>the replacement heads was a real find for mew.  </li>
            <li>Upgrading was out of want not so much need, I would recommend this to anybody that likes electrics.</li>
            <li>I really am at a loss for words.  </li>
            <li>Look at the much hyped pictures on the Braun Shaver Series 5 590cc shaver page they look nothing like the foil head</li>
            <li>I received it in the mail I didn&#x27;t really think anything of it.  </li>
            <li>The screen was all i really needed.</li>
            <li>- I have a light beard / light stubble so those with thicker facial hair may have a different experience.  </li>
            <li>I paid about $5.00 too much for this item.</li>
            <li>The replacement foil and cutter arrived very promptly.  </li>
            <li>So we need a  foil &amp; cutter replacement fast.  </li>
            <li>Now it shaves very well and close.</li>
            <li>I have a much faster and cleaner shave now.</li>
            <li>The problem is the cutter, not so much the foil.</li>
            <li>It also allows for a much closer and quicker shave.</li>
            <li>thanks, once &amp;#60;i buy this machine &amp;#60;i knew&amp;#60;i</li>
            <li>I have used Braun shavers for over thirty years and have had very satisfactory results.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It just does not give me a shave that is really close.</li>
            <li>However my Braun was making a lot of noise, not shaving well, and using up the charge on the razor extremely fast.  </li>
            <li>The Braun replacement foil and cutter head works very well.</li>
            <li>Much improved shave quality</li>
            <li>The Braun Series 5 Foil &amp; Cutter that I purchased worked well and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>It is a very simply and light product to ship.</li>
            <li>This replacement foil/cutter pack was really cheap compared to my local stores.</li>
            <li>The Braun series cutter and foil work very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that even with that head being twice as old, it is giving a better shave then the 7 month old replacement one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 7000 series (30B) cutter/foil is more recessed and glides better on my skin without irritating it and while giving me a faster, closer shave...\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I was forced to go over and over many sections of my face until it was smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a Braun for about 10 years now, and my old foils would last many months</li>
            <li>The most misleading part of this Amazon listing is (Formerly 8000 360 Complete Or Activator).  </li>
            <li>Good price and arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>Awesome price, especially when you really need one once a month as I do as my facial hair is rated at the same streng as steal of the same diameter instead of copper</li>
            <li>blade didn&#x27;t even last 5 months before breaking and giving me a nice red scrape on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>New foil and block arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>If the new replacement doesn&#x27;t work better, I&#x27;m dumping razor and switching brands (so long Braun).</li>
            <li>My previous replacement sets were great and lasted me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love my Braun 8585, but after the original cutter became dull, I bought this replacement.</li>
            <li>I was getting until shaving for the first time with the new foil and cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed to repair and tune up my razor, making it like brand new again.  </li>
            <li>exactly what the shaver needed to work like new again</li>
            <li>Buy this if you own a 360 Complete, try the other package if you have the Activator.  </li>
            <li>Original product with a much cheaper price than local stores.</li>
            <li>such luck on this, and Im not aware of a good alternative....</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, extremely satisfied with this purchase, and very glad that I didn&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews, which I don&#x27;t believe are related to the Series 5 razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to replace by popping the old one off with the button on the side of the head and then just slipping this one in it&#x27;s place.  </li>
            <li>The foil is configured differently than the original</li>
            <li>Be aware all electric shavers requiring more back and forth movement - especially about the neck.</li>
            <li>I purchased the 51S foil and cutter at Wal-Mart for ~$40 which is about $15 more than the other Braun foils, but says it&#x27;s for the 8000 series razor on the package.&lt;br</li>
            <li>saved my original blade and am considering switching back to it in spite of the increased shaving time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve admittedly only used this replacement for one day, but from what I can tell, the OptiFoil is a significant improvement over the SmartFoil.  </li>
            <li>I only replaced the razors and kept my original guard.  </li>
            <li>I think they tried to lower the quality a couple of years ago and didn&#x27;t realize that people were going to complain and then went back to the original design.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SO, they are back to the ORIGINAL design.</li>
            <li>The razor head ends protrude very slightly above the foil and the original set did not.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary I have about the same hours on both shavers and the original foil has lasted longer than the replacement</li>
            <li>Having used the same Braun for over 3 years, I decided to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to this foil from my original Activator 8000 series.</li>
            <li>As mentioned in many other reviews this is not the true/correct replacement for a 8000 series shaver.  </li>
            <li>The replacement foil/blade are made in Germany and seem similar to the original in performance.</li>
            <li>Replacement seem to result in the same close shave as original.</li>
            <li>When opening the replacement pack, I noticed that the foil design was somewhat different than the original.</li>
            <li>The screen looks different than the original</li>
            <li>Actually it may be an improvement over the original foil.  </li>
            <li>Try your old foils (if you still have them) &amp; you&#x27;ll be amazed at the comparable fit between the old &amp; new foils.</li>
            <li>However, these new ones certainly made a difference in the feel and effectiveness of the shaver as a whole.  </li>
            <li>The blade seemed to seat more firmly and it cut on the first pass.  </li>
            <li>This is a necessary item if you want to get clean shaves for years.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth pointing out that that it looks like at some stage Braun changed the design slightly so that although the blade still fits my razor perfectly fine, the foil has been redesigned and therefore did not fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much closer shave after replacing the older cutter.</li>
            <li>I combined this product with the cleaning solution to remember to clean my razor properly.</li>
            <li>I bought the Braun series 5 with instant clean holder.  </li>
            <li>The Braun razor unit itself though never worked as advertized, tends to miss large portions of normal beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to find out if you really needed to replace the cutters every 18 months; if there was a real difference between cutters that had been used and taken care of, and the new one.</li>
            <li>This replacement is a cheap way to get that new shaver quality back.</li>
            <li>It served good , but last half of  the time.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Office Home &amp; student 2013 software as a disc for best down load but same came as a internet down load card much to my dismay.  </li>
            <li>sure how long it will last, but I very much like the results of the design changes.</li>
            <li>Why buy a new razor when you can buy a new head and have the old, familiar razor work like brand new?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this kind of shaver for the past 15 years</li>
            <li>you are looking for an exact replacement for the Braun 360 Complete line of shavers, then this Braun Series 5 Combi 51S</li>
            <li>So, in essence, I guess it has had a bit better performance so far, but in only a fraction of the time that I had used my old foil and cutter.</li>
            <li>Best price , these foils wear out fast , and are expensive in local stores.</li>
            <li>The ones that came with my shaver were made by Gillette, and they were too aggressive for my skin, so I dropped in a used cutter block from my old 5000 series shaver and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>My shaving time has reduced from 12-15 min down to 7-8 in most cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like having a new razor!</li>
            <li>He said that the razor works like new!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s working like new!</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t want or need to buy a new shaver!  </li>
            <li>Just like new!</li>
            <li>Makes my razor NEW again!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like I have a brand new razor!</li>
            <li>Saves like new again!</li>
            <li>My razor is as new!</li>
            <li>and it feels like a new shaver!  </li>
            <li>A replacement foil and cutter added new life to my razor!  </li>
            <li>and my shaver is like new!</li>
            <li>Just like a new shaver!</li>
            <li>The replacement parts made it run like new!</li>
            <li>The new one doesn&#x27;t perform like this one does used!</li>
            <li>Works like a new razor now!</li>
            <li>My shaver works like brand new again!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s practically new again!</li>
            <li>It was 100% Brand New!</li>
            <li>I live S&amp;S items!</li>
            <li>After replacing my blade, my Braun worked like new!  </li>
            <li>Made my shaver shave like new again!</li>
            <li>Shaver feels like new again !</li>
            <li>So far so good, it seems these blades get dull just like razor blades do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  a completely viable replacement for the original parts, which really isn&#x27;t a surprise since it&#x27;s from the same mfg.</li>
            <li>It really does feel like a new razor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking I should buy a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li>It has me shopping for a whole new shaver</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>I was ready to purchase a new shaver, but thought I would take a chance on this kit.  </li>
            <li>The new cutter and foil is a much closer, faster and smoother shave.</li>
            <li>It really could notice the difference when I inserted the new blade and shield.</li>
            <li>Replacing these parts is much cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>After installing the new parts I could really feel a difference in the way my razor worked.</li>
            <li>This product really regenerates my shaver and makes it feel almost like new.</li>
            <li>WAS THINKING I WOULD HAVE TO GET A WHOLE NEW SHAVER</li>
            <li>However, it seems to razor burn more than the previous one.</li>
            <li>The Braun Series 5 replacement pack is much better than the previous replacement pack purchased 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>: i&#x27;ve noticed that the current cutter blocks and foil (like the 51S) listed by Braun for the 8000 series have the more agressive &#x27;comb&#x27; between the foils (blue in color).</li>
            <li>A couple years later the only replacement head offered is this one that magically fits all three generations of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It used the older 8000 series foil and cutter heads</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of shaving there is no discernible difference between this model and the older 8000 series.  </li>
            <li>The main thing is that I saved money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m at the moment looking for the cutter block for the older models (Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack).</li>
            <li>The cutter worked but the foil design has changed and is no longer compatible with the older model</li>
            <li>As this is a replacement component of a product I&#x27;ve used for years - all I can say is this is the same as what I paid a lot more for in a local store</li>
            <li>this one cuts a lot smoother then the older version.</li>
            <li>Spend your money on a decent 5-bladed razor and a pack of refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re sending another replacement pack which will most likely be the same problem.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell the difference from when I first bought the razor, crisp and close shaves are back.</li>
            <li>those who buy this product, I would suggest to pay particular attention to the \\&quot;Made in...\\&quot; marking on the package.  </li>
            <li>I have an older model 360 shaver, and this is the replacement cutter and foil.  </li>
            <li>This particular vendor must have sold me defective cutters.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok but trie to white me in french....</li>
            <li>I ended up with the same problem of the replacement not cutting very well.  </li>
            <li>Fits my older Braun 8975 model and makes the shaver work well again.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s just an oddity with this particular package.</li>
            <li>I was not getting a close shave from an older cutter and foil for my 8585 activator, so I ordered this series 5 set.  </li>
            <li>The screen guard metal is so fragile,  once it lasted 1 week, hoping to last more than a month.  </li>
            <li>But it seems Braun decided to outsource the manufacturing of their replacement heads for this older model to Larry, Moe, and Curly.</li>
            <li>The cutter grabs and pulls the long hairs -- something that never happened with the original Activator cutterheads even as they were wearing</li>
            <li>My first couple of shaves with this replacement did leave me nicked but that seems to have stopped and my shaves are back to being quite close and comfortable without the need for medical intervention.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Logically you would think that a brand new blade would make and old razor \\&quot;like new\\&quot; again.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this replacement.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>The new Braun actually CUTS my skin that I really bleed - at the bonny points like the chin.  </li>
            <li>The  most recent set I purchased will be my last, and I will be purchasing a new (non-Braun)</li>
            <li>I use the Braun clean and renew refills as well so between the two I expect a long life out of this shaver.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Braun 8000 series for a few years now, and I think it&#x27;s great quality, but just like other reviewers</li>
            <li>Other reviews have mentioned that their old foil/cutter combination seemed to work better.  </li>
            <li>the photo in the description should be taken a little bit better.</li>
            <li>I bought the new foil and cutter and when I used it for the first time I thought I made a mistake and put the old one in rather than the new one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately the new foil is standard on all new Braun shavers and the old silver foil is no longer available, so it looks like I&#x27;ll have to try a competitor.</li>
            <li>The foil is somewhat prone to easy damage if the foil is accidentally bumped into or banged into a sharp corner..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this whenever yours starts to feel rough because it now is so smooth.</li>
            <li>It is so smooth, so much quieter than what my other cutter/foil had become, it&#x27;s almost as if it&#x27;s a new razor  altogether.  </li>
            <li>my older Braun feel and work like a brand new shaver.</li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d say anything bad about my Braun 8585 shaver, but the replacement foils and cutterblock have ruined a wonderful shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worked for one month then something snapped inside it and it makes a really loud buzzing noise and vibrates too much.</li>
            <li>Shave is very close, closer than old remington or norelco that I had.</li>
            <li>The cutter replacement pack fit like a glove on my Series 5 razor and worked perfectly as expected.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give my old but very reliable 8585 cordless another year of use; so, I ordered this kit.  </li>
            <li>This product is great, but not perfect, so I am leaving room for improvement.  </li>
            <li>Item was a direct replacement part at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The foil and cutter lost their sharpness to fast, I was quite surprised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had absolutely zero problems with this after installing the parts and trying them out, despite the fact that I&#x27;ve got somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Fit me series 5 perfectly, generally these last me 1 year before replacing.</li>
            <li>At first I could feel a real improvement but for the last month or two, it has taken longer to shave and not felt as close.  </li>
            <li>Normally a replacement foil/cutter lasts 70 or 80 shaves, minimum.  </li>
            <li>My beard isn&#x27;t heavy, but I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>The first cutter foil did not fit securely over my razor</li>
            <li>its not as quiet as some, but it is powerful and provides a close shave.</li>
            <li>I installed both correctly and was using it normally.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price, cutter and foil will last.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if what I received was an aberration, or that&#x27;s the normal product that is sold.  </li>
            <li>The full model number is on the bottom front of the razor - same side as the on/off slider near the power connector.</li>
            <li>As most people, I read the negative reviews first.  </li>
            <li>Actually surprised they are still being made/sold because my shaver is pretty old.</li>
            <li>a little over a year, I&#x27;ll have to get a new razor because I won&#x27;t be able to find these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note</li>
            <li>Pretty much the same as if I bought a new one.</li>
            <li>and I used it like a new razor {without as much pressure as with an old razor].</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to have to buy a whole new electric shaver since mine is seven years old</li>
            <li>Really does return your old razor to like new condition.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was heartened to see so many recent positive reviews of the replacement 51S replacement pack, and I noticed that they had returned to being produced in Germany, so I decided to give these blades one last try before replacing the razor entirely.  </li>
            <li>Finally, the right one for series 5</li>
            <li>had it not fit exactly as the original equipment did, but it does.  </li>
            <li>So I decided to use my last replacement for the last three years or so thinking it was still fine.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend if to men with fine to very coarse hair</li>
            <li>I was considering buying a new Braun, but when I saw they use essentially the same head, I just got this, and it works fine.</li>
            <li>My old cutter was 5 years old and it took a long time to shave and the shave was no longer close and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I have fairly light stubble and shave every other day.</li>
            <li>Restored the like new feel to my Series 5 electric razor.</li>
            <li>Cuts like when it was brand new.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a brand new razor.</li>

            <li>A bit pricey but works like new</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m shopping for a new razor today.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This replacement pack gives you the feel of a brand new</li>
            <li>My Braun Razor now works like it did when it was new.  </li>
            <li>I noticed about 18 months later that I was working too hard to get a good shave</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how much quieter the new set was compared to the old set.  </li>
            <li>The Braun is heavy noisy and most importantly does not give me the close shave I was used to with their previous shavers.  </li>
            <li>I have an older Braun Activator (aka 360 Complete) 8585 shaver.  </li>
            <li>must say that my shaver works like the day I bought it and really does a great job of cutting the hairs.  </li>
            <li>Clearly, this is a particularly profitable item for Braun.  </li>
            <li>, it does not fit the old series 5, and I could not find one that would fit!</li>
            <li>Braun is trying to get away cheap by not offering the same screen but a screen for various models.</li>
            <li>I wet shave with a double edge razor most days but use my Braun electric when I&#x27;m in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>Maybe the parts fit several different models?</li>
            <li>In short, if you need to buy a new foil/head combo and are still fortunate enough to have the old steel colored foil, KEEP IT!</li>
            <li>so I would have been VERY surprised</li>
            <li>This NEW one is EXACTLY the same as the one that came with the razor.</li>
            <li>I called Braun before ordering this NEW set (foil and blades) and they informed me that it is now back to being the same as the original that came with the razor.</li>
            <li>Product is very sharp and noticeably better at trimming my facial hair than the older blade is.</li>
            <li>like the other reviewers, I found this foil is noisier and doesn&#x27;t cut as well as the original foil.  </li>
            <li>I would say that is average since I am shaving more than twice the normal facial area.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the first place I&#x27;ll go next year.</li>
            <li>I will admit that I got a lot of facial hair ripped out in the first 20 seconds of use.  </li>
            <li>And I never shave on my days off which means first day back to work:</li>
            <li>This product has the different net shape on the head compare the original one.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>This product is the exact same thing you can buy at the store.</li>
            <li>This is the same EXACT blade and foil set that came with my razor.  </li>
            <li>the product did show up on my door step, last week as was stated when I made first card number purch.</li>
            <li>However if you are unlucky like me to have the 51S and plan on using it until it&#x27;s advertised life, you might want to shave more often (like daily or every other day)</li>
            <li>the first foil and cutter I installed did not line up properly and didn&#x27;t work correctly.  </li>
            <li>This is the second replacement pack I&#x27;ve purchased but the first on wasn&#x27;t this make (Braun).</li>
            <li>The old foils didn&#x27;t do this after 18 months of use!</li>
            <li>My razor is over 5 years old and had begun to pinch and pull!</li>
            <li>Same exact one that&#x27;s offered locally.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just echoing a lot of other people - This replacement does not stand up to the original.</li>
            <li>The foil also has a different hole pattern and middle blade than the original.</li>
            <li>but these are the German ones and do bring your razor back to original performance.  </li>
            <li>this is slightly different from the original foil that is on my shaver, but it works just the same.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I got exactly the same thing :</li>
            <li>The new screen and cutter block once again made my 5- year old Braun like new.</li>
            <li>I shave every other day and clean once per week.  </li>
            <li>my  other one was shot and in 3 minutes I had old one out and new one installed headed for that clean shaved look.</li>
            <li>fit my 8000 series and it very sharp.</li>
            <li>The original and the first replacement heads were not very good, the shaver pulled hairs and burned my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for 15 years and suddenly my old 8585 has new life.</li>
            <li>Made my four year old shaver brand new</li>
            <li>The foil and cutter makes my old razor like new again.</li>
            <li>this product made my old Braun razor feel like new.</li>
            <li>I chose the  rating id did because of the ease of getting the old worn part out of the razor and the way the new part just sets in without the need for tools</li>
            <li>you can always tell the difference when you replace the old cutter and heads with new ones.</li>
            <li>I guess I waited much longer this last time because when I put the new foil and cutter on the shaver it was just like new again.  </li>
            <li>I replaced the old cutter and foil with these new ones.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll just stick with the old technology and live without the convenience of an electric.  </li>
            <li>This replacement has gone 2 so far and still like new...</li>
            <li>Replacing the foil and cutter on my 5 year old razor makes it feel like its brand new.  </li>
            <li>Want the Best this is it,  my father would use no other than this Braun, won&#x27;t be  disappointed,  highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I will say that replacing the old cutter did make a huge difference in both the closeness of the shave and ability to cut all hairs in one pass, but the pulling and ripping is not worth it.  </li>
            <li>I was a loyal Braun customer over the past 20 years this is the third Braun shaver I bought and the one I am least happy with.  </li>
            <li>Fast charge, fairly long lasting, easy to use, and has a set of 5 lites to show battery power left.  </li>
            <li>Replacement is dead easy.</li>
            <li>This fits the bill if you need a exact replacement for the 360 complete buy this with confidence this my second purchase.</li>
            <li>At first I was unsure of it being the correct part; but was quickly assured with not only the description; but other responses.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if Amazon takes these back (it would be kind of gross if they did), so I&#x27;m going to go straight to complaining to Braun.</li>
            <li>Foil And Cutter Replacement Pack (7000/4000 Series)]], which was acceptable, but seemed to bog down unlike the original or this one.</li>
            <li>Before buying the 51S, I was considering getting a new 700 series, but at this point, I&#x27;m starting to wonder if it&#x27;s worth considering a different brand altogether.</li>
            <li>The foils had been lasting me 12 - 18 months and this new model lasted just a few days more than one month.</li>
            <li>I procrastinated replacing the Foil and Cutter because I think I can remember when I would pay only a little more to buy an entirely new electric razor (not a Braun) for only a little more.  </li>
            <li>I almost want to switch back to the old one because it is slightly better even after being used for a year and a half.</li>
            <li>Its not exactly as close as straight razor but pretty close and a lot easier on your skin.</li>
            <li>A little light on the razor indicates it&#x27;s time to replace.  </li>
            <li>original razor came with the SmartFoil, which has apparently since been replaced with the OptiFoil (same as in the 7 series), and now only the Series 3 and below are using the SmartFoil.  </li>
            <li>Very good I did not know how bad a shave</li>
            <li>my Braun 5 series legitamitely gives me a cleaner, and closer shave with less irritation than the original foil did.</li>
            <li>I prefer to spend a little more for the extra comfort, and replace mine every 12 months.  </li>
            <li>Actually, the shaves have seemed a little better.</li>
            <li>This foil and head is the Original Braun shaver and head used previously used for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li>So, there goes that theory on spending a little more on Braun to get a razor that will last longer</li>
            <li>This shaver gives a good close shave with very little irritation as long as you replace the foil and cutter regularly.</li>
            <li>I have an older Braun 8595 Shaver that is going into it&#x27;s 9th year of daily use and still runs as well as the day it was new.</li>
            <li>Like having a new razor,packaging difficult to open.however super easy to install.</li>
            <li>This cutting foil has a great life span.</li>
            <li>The series 5 pack is a direct replacement for the old 360 complete pack.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t CLEAR that this is a valid replacement part, but it appeared to be the case - and it is.  </li>
            <li>My old foil had a hole in it.</li>
            <li>an old razor thatt</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, if you own a Braun shaver, which give a great shave, you are required to replace these expensive foil/cutters from time to time.</li>
            <li>I have gone through 3 of them so far</li>
            <li>I have the Braun 360 Complete 8985 shaver.</li>
            <li>I even went to a number of online stores to see if one had the old pack</li>
            <li>The cutter block lasts far longer than the foil.</li>
            <li>I have also e-mailed Braun with this complaint, it will be interesting to see if I hear from them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found my old Braun Syncro &amp; checked the head against the Syncro &amp; discovered that the heads were idenditical.</li>
            <li>From the day I purchased my Braun 360 Complete shaver</li>
            <li>So far I like the replacement.</li>
            <li>I have a seven year old Braun Activator (8585) and after almost two years with the old foil/head I had to buy a replacement.</li>
            <li>The product fits just like the old one.</li>
            <li>However, I have the Braun 8985 -- 360 Complete.  </li>
            <li>I bought up two sets just to keep my 4 year old shaver running.</li>
            <li>It does lack the 360 Complete inscription, but does not affect form or function.</li>
            <li>Thanks MSO for making this possible.</li>
            <li>my  old replacement</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this model.</li>
            <li>- i have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>There was no improvement from the old cutter and foil.</li>
            <li>I just deduct a star, because these parts last much shorter now than some years ago.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The package is marked Made in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>foil looks identical to the 360 Complete foil I removed except for the \\&quot;360 Complete\\&quot; logo.</li>
            <li>you are using the 8000 series, 360 Complete style, I do not see a problem with this replacement.</li>
            <li>Then I put on my old block and foil, which knocked the stubble off with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i actually wait until almost two years (procrastinator) and the quality of shave does not suffer much even at that point.</li>
            <li>After replacing the old set (which was overdue) I could immediatley tell the difference.</li>
            <li>And even though the series of these foil cutters is over 6 years old, they still tend to be a bit pricey.</li>
            <li>Wow, what an upgrade over the old, patterned Activator foil.</li>
            <li>And so much easier than hunting all over locally for it.  </li>
            <li>After reading some of the reviews on here I decided to give this a shot for my Braun 8975 360 Complete.</li>
            <li>My face is smoother and not chewed - got the job done in a couple minutes and far fewer passes than the old Series 5 set.</li>
            <li>Since I had stock piled a couple cutter sets, I&#x27;ll run thru them before deciding to dump this old shaver or not.</li>
            <li>And they should&lt;br /&gt;be sold separately because the blades or cutter last much longer than the Foil.</li>
            <li>(prob 3-4 years old).</li>
            <li>I just replaced the foil and cutter and WOW what a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using my Braun 8000 series shaver for nearly 7 years</li>
            <li>Installation was simple and directions straight forward.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money if you think this will work on your Series 8000.</li>
            <li>I needed this for my old Braun 8975 shaver.  </li>
            <li>I am writing Braun in the hopes they will swap it with an old style 8000.</li>
            <li>This is by far the worst.&lt;br</li>
            <li>been to find the old &#x27;beat&#x27; foil.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this as a replacement option for your 360 degree  Complete 8000 series shaver</li>
            <li>The shaver dates to the early millennium</li>
            <li>Guess the idea is to make as much profit on the replacement as on the entire razor.</li>
            <li>My shaver is probably over 10 years old now.  </li>
            <li>Cost and the reviews always makes my ordering an item so much easier, knowing what others have to input on such item.</li>
            <li>I read many negative reviews but needed a replacement</li>
            <li>He now can shave without the pulling and using Amazon.com to find the product was much easier and cheaper than trying to find it in a local store.</li>
            <li>Comes with the complete foil and the complete cutter.</li>
            <li>My Braun razor is probably 6 years old.</li>
            <li>While cheaper than the stores&#x27; offerings, this product frequently pinches.</li>
            <li>The old ones get blunt in 12 - 18 months</li>
            <li>CAREGIVERS AND MYSELF HAD NO TROUBLE WITH IT, NOR</li>
            <li>This replacement pack was just the thing to completely rejuvenate my shaver.  </li>
            <li>This replacement pack was just the thing to completely rejuvenate my shaver.</li>
            <li>The order arrived early.  </li>
            <li>Old foil and cutter needed replacing</li>
            <li>The old one lasted about 12 years.</li>
            <li>Discipline, starts early, make time.</li>
            <li>When I opened the package, it looked as if the replacement part was far lower quality than the one I had.</li>
            <li>Please, someone, anyone, direct me to the Quality Cutters.</li>
            <li>The only place my husband can find these cutter heads at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>My old Foil &amp; Cutter Braun Series 5 was almost 3 years old.</li>
            <li>I had to retrieve my old cutter from the garbage</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d get pulling with the old foil, now I get it with every shave and</li>
            <li>I received the Braun Series 5 foil and cutter in time frame promised but the product is completely unusable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and so I have to continue using the old one</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and low price.</li>
            <li>My years old electric cuts like a *dream* again.  </li>
            <li>This item is a direct replacement for my Series 5 shaver.  </li>
            <li>This completely solved that problem.</li>
            <li>The old one lasted like 4 years.</li>
            <li>After only the few months I could put up with is I saw reviews on here had gotten better and ventured another shot at a newer pack.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have an extremely thick beard or anything, but these blades couldn&#x27;t cut through my whiskers without yanking many of them out.  </li>
            <li>I always find that the light comes on to replace the set a little bit earlier than needed, and a better method of figuring out when to replace it is to look at the actual foil itself and see if there are any holes or other issues going on there.  </li>
            <li>They were a little bit more reasonable than the other model number advertised.</li>
            <li>Got exactly what I expected; new foil and cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My original foil had a little piece break off</li>
            <li>I was originally planning on shaving with the 51S today and do the same next week and use the 30B next Sunday.</li>
            <li>Since the performance of the original foil and cutter diminished so slowly over time, the degree to which the performance of the razor had diminished was not fully appreciated until compared to the performance of the replacements.</li>
            <li>I also change the cleaning fluid and use that function frequently, it has kept my shave like new for 5 years now!</li>
            <li>Long story short, I finally realized that not only were my shaves becoming less and less comfortable, the razor itself was less effective at giving me a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It pulls on my facial hair sometimes and makes it a lot harder to get a clean, painless shave.</li>
            <li>After checking prices for replacements, I was somewhat surprised to find that replacement costs were almost double the cost of my older Syncro foils.</li>
            <li>I managed to get one of the few original activator/360 foil/cutter block.  </li>
            <li>WELL WORTH THE MONEY, EXTREMELY CLOSE SHAVE</li>
            <li>This set comes with the foil and the cutter and although this is something you might change once every 6 months or once a year... or just never, it is pricey for what it&#x27;s worth because it can get dull really quick especially if you use this every day.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s shaver was actually hurting him - replaced the baldes and it is like new again!  </li>
            <li>the razor is now essentially brand new again!</li>
            <li>As expected, but not quite the same quality as the original foil; replacement foils seems to have less dense whole spacing, but work reasonably well.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and less expensive than locally.</li>
            <li>this foil does not compare to the quality of the same older foils.</li>
            <li>this is the second foil that i&#x27;ve bought for my older series 5 shaver.</li>
            <li>and i checked it out and the foil and cutter are the same as the older version that came with the shaver.</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed the improvement in quality over my older, worn-down foil/cutter set, especially when I used it after letting the hair grow for a couple days.  </li>
            <li>I noticed the foil head had even-sized small holes throughout, whereas the last replacement I bought (~4 yrs ago) had more of a honeycomb look to the holes.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit concerned after reading the very mixed reviews about using this 51s foil and cutter pack for my older series Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Braun for years without a problem, but this particular shaver seems to occasionally pull my hairs out.</li>
            <li>It is overall a decent entry level razor.</li>
            <li>The original foil I had was the OptiFoil with random honeycomb shaped holes, this new 51S has more symmetrical circle holes (look at the picture carefully by zooming on the packaging and you will see).</li>
            <li>The initial cost and replacement pack cost is too high for it&#x27;s usability.  </li>
            <li>It shaves me very comfortably &amp; gives me a very close shave even with a few days heavy growth.</li>
            <li>I used the new foil and blade replacement only 6 or 7 times and the foil developed a hole and scraped my face till it bleed.</li>
            <li>I have bought several of these blades for the new shaver and for the old Braun before it went DOA.</li>
            <li>Made my razor feel like new (especially since I had cracked the old foil cover and was using that way for months before buying this).</li>
            <li>It essentially turned my perhaps 9 years old 8585 shaver into a brand new one again.</li>
            <li>it arrived, I briefly compared the old and new.  </li>
            <li>I was starting to complain that the electric razor simply wasn&#x27;t capable of a smith and quick shave, but when my wife ordered the replacement head, I was shocked by how much faster and better the shave was.  </li>
            <li>Replacement long overdue, for fast shaving; I waited too long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>not sure if this makes a difference in fit or performance.  </li>
            <li>So now after another 4 years, I decided to replace the foil/cutter pack as it was taking too long and too much effort to get a satisfactory shave.</li>
            <li>I put the shaver into the cleaner and tried it again on the bare part of my arm just to see if that fixed the problem.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Reviewers, who are deciding to buy the 51S, or comparing 51S and 30B foils, should consult the more recent reviews, as those will pertain to the newer foils.l occasionally pull some hair, but if I shave everyday then</li>
            <li>Amazon was not the first place i expected to find these replacement parts</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Love this razor when it&#x27;s new, but it doesn&#x27;t take long for it to dull and make it feel like you&#x27;re plucking the hairs off your race, rather than shaving.</li>
            <li>The original blades has more space for facial hairs to enter the cutting area.  </li>
            <li>but this new foil didn&#x27;t even last 6 months</li>
            <li>its been 3 years since my last set of new blades.  </li>
            <li>but since I purchased this new cutter and head this is a different shaver.</li>
            <li>Same as new.  </li>
            <li>i proboably only used the new blades 5-6 times and today two pieces of it broke apart.</li>
            <li>Decided my face was chewed enough and opened a new cutter pack - surprise -</li>
            <li>but it was starting to not work like new, after replacing the foil and cutter</li>
            <li>I typically only have to buy these new blade replacements about once every 2 years.  </li>
            <li>Do this before you buy a new shaver, and save some money at the same time.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve starting shopping for a new razor.</li>
            <li>I received and installed the new replacement foil and cutter head, for the fourth time since I bought my Braun 8585.  </li>
            <li>With a very VERY simple replacement, my razor works as new.  </li>
            <li>Open package, but appeared to be new.  </li>
            <li>This replacement made my current braun shaver like new.</li>
            <li>After 18 months, this brought my Braun back to like new performance.  </li>
            <li>this gets 5 stars from me for essentially giving me a brand new razor.</li>
            <li>The new cutter simply does not cut.</li>
            <li>Finally I got the new foil.  </li>
            <li>Too big of a hassle to return and wait for a new one.</li>
            <li>New foil and cutter are definitely what I needed.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me, you enjoy the most painful shave in the morning to help wake you up.  </li>
            <li>I have the 360 complete model and wish the foil said that (like my old foil did) instead of \\&quot;Series 5\\&quot;; it&#x27;s not a big deal though.</li>
            <li>Made shaving with my Braun much nicer after replacing the cutter and the price beats the only local store I could find that stocks it.</li>
            <li>Apparently, I got the German version, because it fits and works fine in my Braun 8985 shaver and heavy beard.</li>
            <li>However, I have noticed as of late that they don&#x27;t even last 6 months any more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my Activator 360 for nearly 5 years now and it seems that each time I need to replace the blade Braun has &#x27;conveniently&#x27; changed the design/packaging and most frustratingly the name of my foil/cutter.</li>
            <li>These are pretty expensive (most likely they are made of very durable metal that keeps their sharpness for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my son who is in the Marines, he needs to be completely shaved smooth and he claims that it does NOT shave like it says not close enough needs to use an older one he had to finish not good</li>
            <li>but no more than what i had with the original shaver</li>
            <li>This works very well and usually last me closer to 2 years since I don&#x27;t exactly have a heavy 5-O&#x27;Clock shadow.  </li>
            <li>and I bought one which was around $10 higher than the other.</li>
            <li>I am used to buying this and have no other option.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason I only gave this replacement foil 2 stars is because the excruciating pain that I love so much, is only possible when I haven&#x27;t shaved for a few days.  </li>
            <li>Although they are more expensive than I would expect for such a simple product design it is worth the money since it saves my skin from irritation and I avoid the cost of the disposable razors that I would need to buy.  </li>
            <li>My razor wasn&#x27;t cutting very well, bought a new replacement and it did not cut much better</li>
            <li>Cuts more efficiently and slightly closer than previous versions.</li>
            <li>but they wrote back saying that they recommend only using the ones made for a particular model.</li>
            <li>no other options readily available, I ordered the 51S for my 8995 shaver (at least 5 years</li>
            <li>After reading all of the reviews posted for the replacement foil/cutter, I decided to buy it in spite of everyone saying that the new design is not nearly as good as the original.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Regarding the many negative reviews of this Series 5 replacement, perhaps other sellers are selling factory seconds, or perhaps there&#x27;s some slight fit problems with the newer models of the 8900 series such as Activator and 360</li>

            <li>While the new foil and cutter is an upgrade from my old, severly worn down one, it&#x27;s not nearly as comfortable a shave as I recall getting from the original.</li>
            <li>After some searching I found that other users had purchased this blade/foil replacement and seen positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Generally I would get up to 1 year of year on this foil.</li>
            <li>If I shave everyday and don&#x27;t let my beard get too long, I get that unsatisfying comfortable, \\&quot;pain-free\\&quot; and close shave</li>
            <li>Just really don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the ones as I buy in the store.  </li>
            <li>I wouldnt hesitate to purchase again in the near future..</li>
            <li>The problem appears to be that this is actually the replacement foil and cutter block for the Braun 360 complete series shavers, specifically the 89</li>
            <li>If I skip shaving one day then on the next shave this cutter block will occasionally pull some hair, but if I shave everyday then the shave is pain free and close.</li>
            <li>I have used my current razor for nearly seven years and have never had problems with the operation.  </li>
            <li>It appears, at least to me, to work and shave pretty much exactly the same, as well as look the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I could barely feel anything.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and close and there is no need to go back over the same place ten times.</li>
            <li>Apparently Braun was bought out by Gillette in 2005.  </li>
            <li>Using it softly wasn&#x27;t enough anymore</li>
            <li>This foil has apparently been replaced by the \\&quot;opti\\&quot; foil (garbage).</li>
            <li>Quality at Braun has apparently gone to pot.</li>

            <li>My old foil used to pull the occasional hair, but this one has not as of yet.  </li>
            <li>This product is really just as I expected...</li>
            <li>and it brings the old razor back to life.</li>
            <li>My Braun 8585 shaver finally gave up completely after 7/8 years.</li>
            <li>The originals lasted much longer than expected</li>

            <li>Braun Series 5 Combi 51S Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 8000 360 Complete or Activator)]]</li>
            <li>I had used my old foil for years, finally replacing it when it started to fall apart and cut me.</li>
            <li>Brought my old electric shaver Serie 5 back to life and my is skin no longer showing signs of a worn out screen.</li>
            <li>we had no trouble installing it since it came in a different container.  </li>
            <li>So far has totally met my expectations ...</li>
            <li>There were some mixed reviews, but I replaced the old blade and this one cuts like butter.  </li>
            <li>In fact, the last one I ordered was on September 26th, and by the end of of October it started to feel like an old blade.  </li>
            <li>The old Foil and Cutter were definitely worn out.  </li>
            <li>Given all the negative reviews, I was pleasantly surprised that it works well; does not pinch/pull my hairs, even after not shaving for two full days.</li>
            <li>This is especially true once they went to the Gillette-made cutter (with the beveled cutting surfaces).</li>
            <li>I have a light beard, not too thick.  </li>
            <li>I had replaced my shaver heads every 18 months like the manufacturer said, but I got behind on this latest replacement.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the product has changed since the poor reviews were written or if the 5000 series is \\&quot;more compatible.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>read on a few blogs that people had success using a \\&quot;30B; series 3\\&quot; replacement meant for a 4000/7000 series.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t read into it as being better or worse.  </li>
            <li>razors are unnecessarily expensive, so it is nice to get them at a lower price.</li>
            <li>Unlike the original \\&quot;Activator\\&quot; branded foil that came with my razor, this one locates the long hairs and grabs on to them tightly.  </li>
            <li>It has given me a close, comfortable shave so far and has cut down my shaving time by 30 seconds/shave, on average.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars because I was able to get it cleaned up and back to working how it should, but having this black stuff coming out of the head or the cutter is not right.  </li>
            <li>Had gone way past the recommended time of use on my old one so decided to buy this rather than a whole new shaver.  </li>
            <li>My previous razor was leaving large tracts of facial skin untouched and, when my wife of fifty years of marriage, informed me of the fact, I knew that it was time for a new razor.</li>
            <li>The new foil and cutter actually feels like it trimmed my facial hairs and made my face smoother</li>
            <li>I only wish that I hadn&#x27;t bought I years supply of the cleaner because now that will be a total loss as I now plan to look for a new razor (not a Braun).</li>
            <li>I can only tell the difference because I bought a new 590 series shaver I bought 1 year ago about the same time as I bought the replacement 51s foil.  </li>
            <li>My husband has had this shaver for several years, and if you regularly change the foil and cutter, it works like new.  </li>
            <li>The shave is much closer than it ever was previously, and by far the closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten from any electric razor.</li>
            <li>, I bought a new Panasonic high speed shaver for less than $100.  </li>
            <li>I have had my razor for a long time, and this product makes it perform like new again.</li>
            <li>you shouldn&#x27;t wait so long to replace.&lt;br /&gt;Big difference,razor like new again.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Bob</li>
            <li>In addition, shaves are taking significantly longer than before (Almost 6 minutes today!), are uncomfortable and are not nearly as close as when I first bought this.</li>
            <li>Exactly as ordered and half the price here in australia.</li>
            <li>I did notice a slight tendency of the blades to &#x27;grab&#x27; when I first started using it</li>
            <li>Usually, the cutters remain sharp for 6 months or more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting hard to find the original style foil with the multi-shaped holes.</li>
            <li>Now the big negative that many others have commented on: Upon changing the foil, I noticed immediately that the pattern/design of the foil was NOT the same as the one that came standard with my Series 5 unit.</li>
            <li>I should have gone straight to Amazon.com instead of wasting time looking for it on other websites.</li>
            <li>Very confusing seeing a different foil design and heads/blades for most electric razors are over-priced and these are no exception.</li>
            <li>Perhaps Braun had a good idea with their cutter redesign but then had some bad early production runs.  </li>
            <li>This cost just about the same as an 8 pack of razors and doesn&#x27;t nearly give you a close enough shave as a razor.</li>
            <li>Everything I&#x27;ve read on the newer shavers from Braun seems to indicate that there has been no real advancement in the shaver over my nearly decade old Braun.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as expected and much cheaper than big box</li>
            <li>The foil is a more complex (usable) pattern and the center</li>
            <li>The improvement in shaving results only lasts a couple of weeks - then it&#x27;s about the same as 6 month old blades.</li>
            <li>My razor is an older model,so it&#x27;s harder to find replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>price is little bit higher</li>
            <li>Personally I would shave with no other electric razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had the new foil for 6 weeks or so and cant yet speak of how long it will shave close</li>
            <li>I have flat, soft facial hair as opposed to</li>
            <li>I will keep my old razor till it wears out as long as you carry the replacements.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I wanted within a few days.  </li>
            <li>Makes my razor shave like new, the quality is as expected from a BRAUN product.</li>
            <li>I would give it a 5-star rating for quality, but have to knock off 1 star due to the high price of these replacement blades.  </li>
            <li>It is much smoother than the previous version.  </li>
            <li>It makes every shave much smoother and less intrusive.  </li>
            <li>Not better, not worse than my 4+ year old</li>
            <li>wish I could recommend a different replacement set for this, but apparently this is the only one.  </li>
            <li>Mine is several years old, but still works well, so long as I follow the recommendations and replace this part regularly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it was a huge waste of money, because it was more expensive than the other replacements I bought.  </li>
            <li>I usually use this to shave with first and then use a conventional razor and shaving cream to get a REALLY close shave.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews, that this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; setup was going to start yanking my beard hairs out or something, but after using it, I can&#x27;t detect a discernable difference from my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; ones, which were working just fine aside from a little hole in the foil.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I waited to long to replace my last blade.you should replace at least every 12 to 18 months it does make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>, I am tossing the whole mess out and going with another electric razor company, haven&#x27;t decided which, yet.  </li>
            <li>My ten plus year old razor shaves like new after this little tune up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, short of ditching your $100 shaver and buying a new one, there&#x27;s really no choice.  </li>
            <li>The new screen does not fit my razor, and after several tries of installing, I just reused the old one on the new cutter.</li>
            <li>I no longer have to wait until the shaver starts pulling and missing, but can change to the new one while the old is still functioning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tempted to try and find one of the old Activator cutter/foil packs because this combi cutter/foil doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li>For some reason, it seems so much better than the previous replacement, which I was not very happy with.  </li>
            <li>The foil design is significantly different and although everything snapped in place the way it should, the foil appears to set down in the razor just a little bit deeper than the original.  </li>
            <li>what is there to say other than it is the replacement part for the Braun shaver, that it arrived in new condition and it works.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize how dull the old cutter was until it started pinching in spots and wouldn&#x27;t cut very close.</li>
            <li>The new 51S foil has a very different foil pattern and the embossed blue center power comb has been changed to a flat silver colored power comb.</li>
            <li>The new 51S foil has a very different foil pattern and the embossed blue center power comb has been changed to a flat silver colored power comb.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve broken the foil, consider buying a new brand of razor as the new Braun line all seem to use the new style of head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only is the new replacement pack more expensive than the previous model, the quality has gone straight down the tubes.</li>
            <li>, the blades on the 51S cutting block are much wider than the Activator block from my 8585, but I didn&#x27;t think it would be a huge deal.</li>

            <li> I bought my Braun about 6 years ago and thought it was a really good shaver.  </li>
            <li> A perfect fit for me.</li>
            <li> The prices here are as good as I&#x27;ve found anywhere else</li>
            <li> The manufacturers sell you a good razor and then it costs a fortune to keep it that way.</li>
            <li> After using BRAUN shavers for over thirty years, I continue to enjoy the quality of their products and the excellent results!  </li>
            <li> Good Braun quality.  </li>
            <li> I have the 8595 shaver that I have loved since 2005.</li>
            <li> This was a good deal for the Braun replacement shaver heads.  </li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> Good replacements for the 5-series etc.</li>
            <li> I loved this razor because it never did that.  </li>

            <li> Braun makes a good shaver and these foil heads make it shave even closer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazon price is so good that I replace the heads annually instead of every 18 months.</li>
            <li> Good Luck.</li>
            <li> Good value and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> This was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if Braun switched manufacturers to save themselves some money, but this ruined a perfectly good electric razor.  </li>

            <li> Nice to save some money, too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There may be some good news here though--a review by S. Bergeron for the Braun refurbished 8985 shaver that uses these blades said that the Braun 30b cutter/foil set is a better replacement.  </li>
            <li> In the 45 years that I&#x27;ve been shaving electrically,Braun is the best and the foil and cutter replacements are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I get a nice close shave</li>
            <li> - Have a tool handy for opening adult-proof packaging.)</li>
            <li> Nice close shave.</li>
            <li> Procter and Gamble own Gillette.</li>
            <li> nice replacement blade</li>
            <li> Awesome prices and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to have a close shave again.  </li>
            <li> I own a Braun 360 model 8985.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I realize this sounds cliche, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> I works well and gives a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li> Nice to get a descent price on this item.</li>
            <li> I own an 8000 series Braun shaver (8985).  </li>
            <li> This was about the 5th time I have changed the screen and blades and this was as good a replacement of the others which I paid more for thru retail outlets.  </li>
            <li> worked good don&#x27;t send any more razor waring out</li>
            <li> I own the Braun Series 5 electric shaver, model # 8995.</li>
            <li> was nicely packaged up.</li>
            <li> No problems of any kind.  </li>
            <li> factory replacement, fast and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> My shaver system is good to go again now. :-)</li>
            <li> You get at most 4 good months of shaving then you need to replace them again...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this electric razor for the better part of a decade now, but these blades keep it running just as good as the day that I bought it.  </li>
            <li> good product, fits original shaver, does a good job.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is great, the shave is closer than the original design head, faster, and the shaver sounds quieter</li>
            <li> The original was great and</li>
            <li> Original and at a great price, delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Great my head and face was clean for 2 days</li>
            <li> If anything changes, I&#x27;ll update this review, but I highly recommend this replacement for the Series 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/5/12: I&#x27;ve now been using this foil and cutter for a couple of months and just wanted to confirm that it&#x27;s still working excellent!  </li>
            <li> They are as high quality Braun parts and you will very happy with them as I am</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> but I find it&#x27;s more like 6 to 8 at the very most.  </li>
            <li> The replacement fit perfectly, and I think it performs better than my original foil/cutter ever did.</li>
            <li> brand new product; works perfect on a series 8 Braun.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want a new rasor, this is an excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> The 3 series is also an excellent shaver which I also had until my son absconded with it back to college..... and a lower price point.which makes it a good value</li>
            <li> I had great service and quick mailing .No</li>
            <li> Very easy to do.</li>
            <li> Replacement is very easy and fits like it was originaly installed.</li>
            <li> Perfect buy to replace old cutter and foil!</li>
            <li> is everything very good but 35 $ for that is too much and</li>
            <li> Installed my old Syncro foil over the Series 5 cutter &amp; had the best close shave (without pulling hair) that I have had since I quit using my Syncro.</li>
            <li> and this was by far the best price.  </li>
            <li> These fit my braun series 5 razor and worked good.</li>
            <li> : Mine is the old 8 series, and these work PERFECTLY.</li>
            <li> Greatly enhanced my razor&#x27;s function and extended its useful life indefinitely.</li>
            <li> The 3 head Norelco/Phillips style is more effective and simpler to use.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s my own problem.  </li>
            <li> A frequent consumable for Braun Razors that does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> It fit my shaver and does a good job of rejuvinating its performance.</li>
            <li> This replacement cutter &amp; foil fit really good.  </li>
            <li> I think this pack offers excellent value</li>
            <li> does the job, exactly as advertised, fit my series 5 razor perfectly,</li>
            <li> Works great, and stays attached to my razor better than the original screen did :)  </li>
            <li> On the positive side, this replacement cutter for the Series 5 shaver is a perfect fit for the razor.</li>
            <li> But it easy for me to change the foil replacement for him!</li>
            <li> I strongly agree!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been months now of using this replacement and it is still going strong!  </li>
            <li> The Braun razor does a great, comfortable job- quickly too!</li>
            <li> and I think this replacement is as good as the original.  </li>
            <li> I want to explain what some people are complaining about concerning this replacement blade set not being as good as the original.</li>
            <li> to replacement, just as good as the original parts</li>
            <li> It may not be quite as good as the original but its not like it doesn&#x27;t work like</li>
            <li> The cutter block blades are thicker and the foil pattern isn&#x27;t as good as the original.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good replacement for the original foil and cutter.</li>
            <li> I had read reviews saying the 51S replacement foil and cutter were not as good as the original parts that come with the Braun Series 5 shaver.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the original.</li>
            <li> These never seem as good as the original, but still do the job well</li>
            <li> GOOD PRICE, FREE SHIPPING, DON&#x27;T HAVE TO DRIVE AROUND TO FIND AND PAY MORE.</li>
            <li> Good clean close shave.</li>
            <li> Great product and very fast service.</li>
            <li> It moves very smoothly over my face.</li>
            <li> quick delivery and a good price, works well</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement and now my face is as smooth as a new born butt.</li>
            <li> Fit perfect in my Series 5 - shaves like new.</li>
            <li> back to new the best shave ever fit braun series 5 perfect screen and blades see you in 9 months</li>
            <li> Once you own an electric shaver as fine as the Braun Series 5, you owe it to yourself to keep it in top running condition by replacing the foils and cutters periodically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great cut at a decent price!</li>
            <li> The Braun shaver cutter is a great replacement for my dull cutter at an excellent price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pete</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the original product, fast delivery, would recommend to anyone very, very good original spare parts braun taken Amazon</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to do anything to it for more than 10 years</li>
            <li> OK, it worked,</li>
            <li> 4 more words required</li>
            <li> Price was better</li>
            <li> and I get close to a year and 3 months and more before having to replace.  </li>
            <li> Braun makes outstanding well made products.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping , great job.</li>
            <li> You will be better served by getting the Braun Series 3 Combi 30B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> In fact I stopped using it and bought a Panasonic that I like much better.  </li>
            <li> Close shave, better than before.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so much better.  </li>
            <li> Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I read through many of the reviews before purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> Well then, you&#x27;ll love this replacement foil.  </li>
            <li> cost and service was outstanding.</li>
            <li> TOO MANY NUMBERS  --</li>
            <li> it transformed the 8985 into the most efficient shaver i&#x27;ve ever used (or tried).</li>
            <li> This is the Braun which I think is better than the Gillette which I tried before.</li>
            <li> and that surely they might want the parts for Q&amp;C checking.  </li>
            <li> used to love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Noticeably better shaves father the switch is made.</li>
            <li> I grew to fear shaving if I had anything more than 1 day of stubble.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this product for many years.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll probably be OK.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Gotta Love the Free Shipping!</li>
            <li> Not as close a shave as the the Braun 3, I thought going up in price and newer would be better ,but turned out the Braun</li>
            <li> 3 is better , I would like to try the Braun 7 but cant afford</li>
            <li> This item seems to cost more than it should</li>
            <li> You have the chance to sell them separate and charge more money.</li>
            <li> The package came with two replacement parts ( the razor itself and the grate guard that goes on top).  </li>
            <li> I need to change foil/cutter more often than the factory recommends.</li>
            <li> Once I started noticing people having better experiences with the ones made in Germany, I decided to pull the trigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side</li>
            <li> the foil is a bit pricey, but will continue to order more when required as i do not plan to get rid of my shaver.</li>
            <li> What more could you want?</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better.  </li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I love it,</li>
            <li> It might be more then 5 years since I replaced this</li>
            <li> but I refused saying there&#x27;s no point of enduring more pain by using the 51S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw</li>
            <li> Also I was nicked more</li>
            <li> Read my review of that product (http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BR8AFAHU584G/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B001VH6F9G&amp;nodeID&#x3D;&amp;tag&#x3D;&amp;linkCode&#x3D;) for more detail.  </li>
            <li> They sure don&#x27;t make them like they used to.</li>
            <li> I am sure</li>
            <li> Item completely satisfied my requirement.</li>
            <li> I though spending more means a better product</li>
            <li> the shaver is a lot more noisy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the models over the years.</li>
            <li> The shaves are closer, quicker and more comfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> thank God so he can&#x27;t do any more damage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this replacement blade for many months now.  </li>
            <li> I get a better shave with a $20 battery-operated shaver than I do with my 8595 using this foil &amp; cutter.</li>
            <li> Now I add more test to reach the character count.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, I am glad to have run across this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you&#x27;re matching the correct foil to model number of your shaver.</li>
            <li> Glad I was able to find this.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, it works great and shipping couldn&#x27;t have been better.</li>
            <li> and i love it every time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun 8000 series shaver for more than 5 years now and like it.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to shave once a day, but over time I&#x27;ve had to reduce to twice a week to avoid skin irritation and ingrown</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I did.  </li>
            <li> Price was better than my discount store.  </li>
            <li> The replacement set fit was perfect in my 4 year old 51s razor.  </li>
            <li> already.they should be better than this</li>
            <li> I make sure that my husband changes his foil and cutter replacement when he needs to.</li>
            <li> I think there is more money to be made in replacement parts than the shaver purchase itself..</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I intended to buy the latest version Braun 7 Series but after reading the reviews I changed my mind.</li>
            <li> It also just refused to cut many patches on my face.  </li>
            <li> It matches up perfect with the 8000 series, its just a different color plastic.  </li>
            <li> LOVE MY BRAUN SHAVER, SO I HAD TO REPLACE FOIL &amp; CUTTER AFTER 1 YEAR</li>
            <li> Simply put it delivers a close shave the best I ever had with</li>
            <li> and this is a good and economical way to do that.</li>
            <li> how many times I try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A perfect fit for my old razor.  </li>
            <li> In fact, nearly more of a hassle than shaving with a blade.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 more words required</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with these replacements.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I just ordered a replacement and am satisfied with the shave.</li>
            <li> My husband said the cutter was sharper and cut better then</li>
            <li> and I am glad I can get these parts for my Braun 8585 shaver that I bought in December 2001....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pucrhased many of these</li>
            <li> Just what we need and much better price than in stores.</li>
            <li> I thought it was still OK.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed at how much better it shaved.  </li>
            <li> The foil and cutter replacement is just what I wanted, there a two different foils and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> In my case, I feel rotary cutters are more appropriate.</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery</li>
            <li> Just as described at a fantastic price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers ever since I started shaving many decades ago and never had this happen before.  </li>
            <li> and i will definately order more, if you have a series 5</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I ordered in spite of these reviews.</li>
            <li> never knowing when it was appropriate.</li>
            <li> Perfect and last forever</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these any more.  </li>
            <li> (BTW: always replace the two at the same time for best results)</li>
            <li> Package arrived Ok as scheduled</li>
            <li> He says it is much better than the razor he was using.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> and here&#x27;s me taking up more space</li>
            <li> Definitely enjoying my shave again now.</li>
            <li> Still delivers day after day and that for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> I was able to find.</li>
            <li> As a result, I  have been able to substantially reduce the time it takes me to shave.</li>
            <li> The package saved a total of $12 over the best I could do anywhere else</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not much more to say about this purchase ... ...</li>
            <li> because I am not going to say &amp;#34;I Love it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Cheaply made foil and cutter!</li>
            <li> I was never so glad to get this  </li>
            <li> After 8+ years I guess it was about time :)</li>
            <li> This blade set is the same, works great, feels good and shaves close.</li>
            <li> Blades are excellent and are a better shave than the last set I purchased.  </li>
            <li> I love Braun razors.</li>
            <li> Glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using braun electric shavers for over 25 years and love their products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Brauns&#x27; for more than 40 years, do I need to say more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paal</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement for two different razor models.</li>
            <li> The foil &amp; cutter replacement made shaving 100% better.  </li>
            <li> I was so satisfied with the replacement pack that I immediately ordered another to have as a backup.  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price was the best I could find &amp; the price was even lower when I ordered the second pack!</li>
            <li> The replacement foil and cutter does make your razor work better.  </li>
            <li> Also the Amazon price was much better than buying this in store.</li>
            <li> For me, the foil pattern on the 30b does a MUCH better job holding/stabilizing the hair</li>
            <li> Of course, this problem becomes more and more noticeable with longer intervals between shaving and/or as the blade edges deteriorate over time.</li>
            <li> Braun needs to restore the quality or I will be finding a better company to purchase razors from.</li>
            <li> As always I was greatly satisfied with product and service</li>
            <li> Glad I got this.  </li>
            <li> Shaver works much better</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found a better electric yet...</li>
            <li> Complete\\&quot; to the \\&quot;Series 5 Combi 51S\\&quot; I am not getting as many shaves from it as I would have.</li>
            <li> I bought many years ago which served me well up until about 2 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Been Braun for more than 30 years.</li>
            <li> Smooth, close shaves!  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> Blades do a better job and are cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love the razor, and the cutter/foil that come with it.</li>
            <li> I wish Braun were a better company...</li>
            <li> Tanks a lot,&amp;#60;i will need more</li>
            <li> I have used series 5  for  many  years, and I like it a lot.  </li>
            <li> I love the Braun series 5 and shave both my head and face with it 2-3 times per week.</li>
            <li> razor works much better freshened up, closer and faster shave</li>
            <li> The replacement pack was a gift for him to continue enjoying his shaver.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun for many years.</li>
            <li> better than a cheaper replacement that I think was made in China and came from Korea</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s face is smooth again!</li>
            <li> Braun should do better by its customers.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;ok...</li>
            <li> Pricing and  delivery was excellent, will definitely order again when needed.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on the 51s and wasn&#x27;t pleased, however I note this assembly was made in Germany, not China.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the product and pleased with Amazon&#x27;s customer service.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with the replacement cutter and screen.</li>
            <li> I am also pleased that the price has been reduced.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave!</li>
            <li> The manufacturer recommends replacing them at 18 month intervals, so I knew it should have lasted more than two months.</li>
            <li> This was a more inexpensive part than the one made specifically for the Braun Activator Shaver and works perfectly--both cutter and screen.</li>
            <li> This product was authentic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The replacement blades seem to work better then when it was new.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> There is nothing more to say.</li>
            <li> Glad Amazon had this</li>
            <li> I an perfectly satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Will by again is a great price for the right fit.</li>
            <li> I change the blade about on e every 18 months and this genuine Braun replacement was priced right and works great.</li>
            <li> I have used most other popular brand razors and like this one the best.  </li>
            <li> Works good and the price was right</li>
            <li> Good to use the right replacement parts.  </li>
            <li> Right away I didn&#x27;t get a good shave.</li>
            <li> Exactly the way described!!!</li>
            <li> However, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the replacement and it&#x27;s actually better than what it originally came with!  </li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping good item</li>
            <li> Now I get a good smooth quick shave, no scraping or pulling.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First couple shaves were good.</li>
            <li> Was sent to me packaged pretty good as well</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality for your shave machine, I would advise to replace it once a year.</li>
            <li> The original lasted 18 Months, as advertised!</li>
            <li> Husband was excited to get this for Christmas!</li>
            <li> As you move the razor, you&#x27;ll get that eye opening riiiipppp, that just screams, \\&quot;Welcome to the new day!\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I installed this NEW set and trust me, it shaves GREAT.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However the quality is great and using it is like having a brand new shaver.</li>
            <li> My husband needed a new razor head and it works great</li>
            <li> and I was happy I purchased the new parts.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell a great deal of difference with the new blade</li>
            <li> But there is no doubt that the new blades, also part of the package, make a great difference to the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get a really nice clean shave really smooth on the skin you feel like you just shaved with razor in soap</li>
            <li> Easy to install and a must after many shaves.  </li>
            <li> Braun series 5 combi 51s foil and cutter replacement pack is good, only replace them every 6months and good price.</li>
            <li> Then I learned that the Braun 30B replacement cutter - which is actually made for the 7000 series shavers - fits perfectly on the 8585 and does an absolutely fantastic job.</li>
            <li> I purchased it initially because of the awesome, smooth shave that the Gillette-branded blades provided.  </li>
            <li> It fit perfectly and works just as well as his last one.</li>
            <li> Once again, I now experience a great Activator / 360 Complete shave!</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; shipped super fast!</li>
            <li> An excellent product, easy to install, lasts a long time--about 18 mos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite sure this will work just fine</li>
            <li> pairing was a mistake by Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Product is probably fine for the appropriate razor model.</li>
            <li> The head itself is fine and it works ok.</li>
            <li> I am comletely satisfied with the product (working better than original one) and delivery on time(exceed my expectation).</li>
            <li> Shaves as good or better than new!</li>
            <li> A standard foil/cutter package at at very good price.</li>
            <li> This is about the third replacement blade I have bought for my razor and while the service was really very good with the parts arriving within 3-4 days</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how the heck they quantitatively compute a percentage increase for the efficacy of a shave (25% better?), but qualitatively there is a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe I am one of the more fortunate people</li>
            <li> Shaves are more comfortable, closer and are finished quicker to boot.</li>
            <li> This is a great improvement on the old foil &amp; cutter rom Braun.</li>
            <li> Great product, I bought the replacement razor for my Braun Series 5 360 complete.  </li>
            <li> The product was just what we expected, and the service was excellent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise though, this product is a great way to extend the life of your electric razor for another year or two at a time, especially with the ballooning costs of traditional shaving, this is a wonderful avenue.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my husband&#x27;s 6 yr old Braun Activator series.  </li>
            <li> Once I was able to break the foil and cutter free from the packaging</li>
            <li> Great replacement my razor is over 10 years old</li>
            <li> and they fit perfectly ok my razor.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good value.</li>
            <li> Good seller, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> good price, and fast shipping</li>
            <li> good price and fast service</li>
            <li> Really does a good job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame, because the Activator is an excellent shaver that worked very well for years, but the new foil renders it unusable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was good, but a new razor was better.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality - easy to install - faster than expected delivery.</li>
            <li> Honestly 18 months is about right to replace these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found over all the other ones I was using,</li>
            <li> bought the cheaper 7000 series foil as a replacement and it works more like the original foil and cutter.  </li>
            <li> The cutter in this one is more like the original for my Activator.  </li>
            <li> The cutter block and foil on the original shaver was much better.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied with its performance and it seems to work as well as the original one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> My Braun now works better than I can ever remember since the original date of purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nope, not a bad thing at all!  </li>
            <li> Everything seems to be working well - the shaver is as good as new!</li>
            <li> Now I just buy the foil and cutter replacement and I am good to go, just like new!</li>
            <li> I replace each year and it feels as good as new!</li>
            <li> Easy to replace</li>
            <li> A great feet of German engineering :-)</li>
            <li> Easy to install.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace.  </li>
            <li> Easy to replace.</li>
            <li> It was shipped in the plastic molded container and was easy to install onto the shaver.</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to change, don&#x27;t have to have a PhD.</li>
            <li> Easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and easy to install.</li>
            <li> These replacement parts arrived very quickly via mail.</li>
            <li> easy to install.</li>
            <li> Husband is really happy, He has had trouble finding  this and is delighted with the price.</li>
            <li> I always took the foil off and cleaned the shaver in the self cleaner without it to get a better clean.</li>
            <li> This arrived very quickly and was as described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how good it feels to actually have your beard hair cut and not pulled out!&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I could use my electric shaver..as it be much easy to hold too then a Razor Blade ( mach3 )</li>
            <li> Easy off and on replacement.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you clean them often</li>
            <li> It was easy to install.</li>
            <li> But this easily washed off.</li>
            <li> Great price on this item that sells for $20 more in local stores.</li>
            <li> I purchased the razor in the spring of 2005 and change it about every 12 -14 months, still going strong.  </li>
            <li> but I strongly suspect it</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly on my Braun as expected.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time with this new series 5 and the result has been very good.</li>
            <li> i think its way too high but if you want a good shave who are you going to complain to ...</li>
            <li> The product shipped in great time, was the right part without damage, and replaces the worn out parts as promised, and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Installation is easy, even for someone who is not known for having nimble fine motor skills.</li>
            <li> What I just received is amazingly smooth; even better than I remember the original.</li>
            <li> Nice, sharp, great replacement.</li>
            <li> I gave it a full three months before deciding that it was indeed the foil/cutter block, that was the problem, and not me :)&lt;</li>
            <li> This new foil and cutter head have transformed my 3 year-old Braun shaver into a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Works just GREAT !</li>
            <li> Excellent, the shaver is like new with the new foil and cutter</li>
            <li> The price was the best hands down between any store or online-site.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember ever getting a shave this good when the razor was new.  </li>
            <li> Not quite as good as new.....</li>
            <li> This new cutter block and foil are not as good</li>
            <li> Good buy and will make your rates are shaved like new.</li>
            <li> Shaver was not doing a good job, But now with the new blades.</li>
            <li> The item was shipped in time, and now the shaver works as good as new.</li>
            <li> I forgot how good new blades are.</li>
            <li> it looked fine until i removed it.&lt;br /&gt;then</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> just want to agree with that one I found and read, this item does indeed work fine with the 8585 model.</li>
            <li> Fits by 8595 series 5 just fine.</li>
            <li> It worked fine.</li>
            <li> This product works fine with my 8985 series shaver.  </li>
            <li> now, it has held up just fine, but it hurts when using it...</li>
            <li> This is a razor head replacement and works just fine.</li>
            <li> This replacement pack worked fine on my 8000 series shaver.  </li>
            <li> I forgot that the hairs were not supposed to be ripped out at the root but finely cut.</li>
            <li> The replacement worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> Braun series 5 foil and cutter replacement works fine on my model 8595.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave, and easy to install.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m assuming that it works fine</li>
            <li> Fits my Braun Series 8585 fine, no muss, no fuss.</li>
            <li> Worked fine.  </li>
            <li> The Amazon experience is always just fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly and seems to cut just as well as the previous generations.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, works fine.</li>
            <li> It works fine</li>
            <li> It works fine; no discomfort and a close shave.  </li>
            <li> And, it works fine.</li>
            <li> and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Item works fine, no issues with it.</li>
            <li> Fit like it should and was easy to install.  </li>
            <li> Works fine...</li>
            <li> The products I ordered seem to work fine.  </li>
            <li> Worked fine.</li>
            <li> and I fully expect that it will work fine.</li>
            <li> Very happy to have the razor performing like new on this old face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how I managed for forget how well it shaved when new, or maybe this is better than it used to be.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of a smooth shave when new and undamaged.</li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive buying parts for my Braun over the internet, but the description and information about the shavers it would fit was accurate and easy to understand.  </li>
            <li> After about ten years, the motor works as it did the day I bought it, the battery still holds a charge that easily takes me through a week, and the cleaning system continues to do a great job.</li>
            <li> Does a good job but not as good as my previous two purchases of foil/cutter from Braun that I would rate a five.</li>
            <li> The cutter block fit fine</li>
            <li> The Braun replacement parts fit and work fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is just a replacement and it fit just fine.  </li>
            <li> It fit my razor just fine.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to replace the parts and the first shaves were a noticable improvement with no problems or issues.  </li>
            <li> Exact replacement parts, very easy to replace.</li>
            <li> My original Braun 8000 series razor is still going strong even if some of th epaint is wearing off.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to try the new ones they sent to see if they&#x27;re any better, but it was a very nice gesture and definitely appreciated, considering I purchased this set for almost $40.</li>
            <li> The new Braun blades and foil seem to be superior to the original product.</li>
            <li> As good as can be, though will never shave as close as original Eltron-Braun which is now 20 years new.</li>
            <li> I love the way just shaved my face so quickly and easily in the morning its way better than using a blade and shaving cream and hot water etc etc and cheaper too</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was concerned about quality but found the reviews helpful about making sure to not push too hard for the best shave.</li>
            <li> and this was a perfect fit/replacement for the original foil and cutter I&#x27;ve had for about a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> Foil and cutter hard to find a good one for this razor, but this works great.  </li>
            <li> Huge savings over retail.</li>
            <li> What a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> my face is smooth.</li>
            <li> Made it run quieter and felt smooth against my skin for a close shave.</li>
            <li> so I order these after checking around for a few months and these were the best deal.  </li>
            <li> the shave is pain free and close.</li>
            <li> After 16 months or so the replace foil/cutter light came on.</li>
            <li> I have ordered before off Amazon, genuine parts and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> A real necessity, if you own a shaver.</li>
            <li> Others sound like a roaring jet engine in comparison.</li>
            <li> The Sears store is a joke for replacement parts - they&#x27;re locked on the racks (if available) and there is no help.</li>
            <li> and this was genuine</li>
            <li> There were two model numbers available  </li>
            <li> In fact I am faced with buying yet another set in order to onve again shave comfortably and not have my face ripped off</li>
            <li> Panasonic electric razors are rated great in Consumer Reports so my next electric will be a Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I DID NOT GET THIS PRODUCT FREE OR AT A DISCOUNT IN RETURN FOR A REVIEW</li>
            <li> and I had forgotten how smooth this shaver can perform.</li>
            <li> They fit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced none of the issues mentioned, quite the opposite.</li>
            <li> Both gave me a comfortable shave, but the 51S gave me a closer shave faster.</li>
            <li> Please also check out the 2 images I&#x27;ve uploaded (available in the customer images</li>
            <li> I have experienced the opposite, thankfully.  </li>
            <li> No problems at all with fit, or performance.</li>
            <li> but it will fit and</li>
            <li> The blade fit my razor but the foil didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews from others and seeing that it would fit with my shaver, I went ahead and purchased this replacement foil and cutter</li>
            <li> it is important that you periodicly replace the screen and the blade.</li>
            <li> I only had this one for 4 days and its great.</li>
            <li> , I keep clean easily and replace the screen and head&lt;</li>
            <li> but it is great to find them online and avoid the big box stores.</li>
            <li> have had the razor for a number of years and continue to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Given my heavy shave requirements I think the 5 series is excellent...</li>
            <li> This item is wearing through after 60 days of light use.</li>
            <li> product fit as advertised.  </li>
            <li> replacement cutter/foils fit this shaver.  </li>
            <li> still works great 13 years later!</li>
            <li> Each time I think I&#x27;m going to now get these incredibly smooth shaves.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and fit with no problems.</li>
            <li> A smooth, close shave, with no bite.</li>
            <li> It works and I save money, but I don&#x27;t enjoy using the product.</li>
            <li> I ordered the replacement kit which arrived on time and worked smoothly.  </li>
            <li> ; no iiritation, smooth, and dependable.</li>
            <li> Fantastic  product.  </li>
            <li> self-cleaning razor system flashes a light when 18 months&lt;</li>
            <li> time around, I&#x27;m not waiting for the &#x27;replacement reminder&#x27; light to go off on me!&lt;br</li>
            <li> great deal for my daily shaver</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not a Braun fan you&#x27;re missing the best shave on the market.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Recommend genuine Braun parts for your razor&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Rubbing a cheese grater over my face would be a preferable experience to what this cheaply engineered and manufactured replacement head puts me through every morning.</li>
            <li> SMOOTH  </li>
            <li> Nice, fast and just as it was described.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initial foil and blade on my series 5 was fantastic and durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Part arrived quickly, in good order, and it was exactly what I ordered, the electric razor now works again, and cuts very well!</li>
            <li> I purchased a Braun Series 5 360 Complete and loved the shaver.  </li>
            <li> far so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> As good or better as when my last foil/cutter was new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li> afyer reading others reviews I gave it a shot and bought the one they recommended ( Made in GERMANY) , not in China!..and so far so good.</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Overall I am satisfied with the performance and it has given the razor a good refresh.</li>
            <li> I need to shave with it for a year or so to judge durability, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> In my experience the foil design of the 30b is FAR superior to the foil design of the 51s.</li>
            <li> It is a far superior product in every way than the 51s.</li>
            <li> In the meantime, have gone back to safety razor and realize just how satisfying a really good, close shave can be.  </li>
            <li> The razor cuts 5 times better (just a guess, but much much better), is quieter, and now my razor stays charged much longer.  </li>
            <li> So easy to remember to change your foil when the replacement part comes right to your front door!  </li>
            <li> The cutter worked fine, easy to install quickly.  </li>
            <li> Instead, buy the 30B and enjoy smooth and comfortable shaves that are even closer than the original cutter head on the 8585.</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Items have restored my razor to the shaving comfort when it was brand new.</li>
            <li> sure you order the right one for your shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this foil works for the right razor.  </li>
            <li> Works good, just wish Braun would make the Gillette heads again like what originally came with the 360 complete</li>
            <li> great nice and sharp, shipped right out</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t perfect for every type of facial hair, but it does a decent job.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I had saved the original foil and have reinstalled it.  </li>
            <li> Product as expected, good price and prompt delivery to Australia!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these before, and they have always fit my razor like the original did.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and lasts the full 18 months.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave closely, quickly, nor easily.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t let the beard get too long (say more than 2 days of growth in my case), no pulling and a superior shave from the 51S.  </li>
            <li> My husband said the foil was quick and easy to replace.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My 8585 now shaves like new, maybe better!</li>
            <li> This new foil fits great and gives a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> I have used this razor for many years and have used Amazon for ordering replacement packs because of easy accessibility and reasonable pricing.</li>
            <li> Bruan is well worth the money!</li>
            <li> The original was for 5 years.</li>
            <li> I see and feel no difference between this replacement and the original.</li>
            <li> It cuts like the original.</li>
            <li> My original foil that came with the shaver got chipped within 4 months.</li>
            <li> The Braun series 5 replacement cutter is just like the original in the Braun 360 razor.</li>
            <li> When I contacted them regarding the discontinued support for the original foil/cutter block, their response was to refer me to a store called the Essentials, which to no surprise, no longer carries the original.</li>
            <li> THE ORIGINAL EMAIL</li>
            <li> I have the 8595 razor, and the original foil lasted beyond 18 months before a hole formed.  </li>
            <li> I used my original blades and foil for 2 to 3 years.  </li>
            <li> After replacing the foil it shaves like it originally did, with no nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li> Replacing the foil and cutter made a significant improvement in the performance of the razor.  </li>
            <li> My razor originally came with a \\&quot;smart\\&quot; foil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an improvement over the original, and</li>
            <li> I used my original cutter and foil set for well beyond two years without significant decrease in effectiveness.</li>
            <li> It is not anyway like the original blade/foil that came on the razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;My shaver hummed like I had just opened it from the original packaging.  </li>
            <li> The first time I replaced the blades on this about 2 or more years ago, YES, they sucked.</li>
            <li> I still have the original blade and foil set AND the REPLACEMENT set that basically SUCKED.</li>
            <li> Original Braun.</li>
            <li> This replacement is actually better than the first replacement I bought.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t risk it, buy Braun Original replacements.</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Great shaver as long as I replace the cutters and head every year.  </li>
            <li> what can you say it is a replacement part of a worn out part it works like the original as by design.</li>
            <li> I still have the original foiil and block on the 590.</li>
            <li> The reviews brought home how unsatisfied I have been since replacing the original block and foil.  </li>
            <li> They seem to be the closest to the original.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as the original</li>
            <li> just like original.</li>
            <li> The original one lasted two years</li>
            <li> I had overextended the original shaver head.  </li>
            <li> I had my original blades for 18 months</li>
            <li> and  I wish to get the original ones</li>
            <li> The original foil broke</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s $18.00 more than I paid for the first one</li>
            <li> not a disappointment at all!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for the original foil on my 8000 series razor.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll continue with the replacement heads as long as it survives, a great shave.</li>
            <li> Original braun product</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit for my dad to replace the worn out original parts.</li>
            <li> it did not work as well as the original shipped with the braun.</li>
            <li> The original foil and cutter lasted 3 years before the foil broke</li>
            <li> I dropped my shaver on vacation and broke the original foil.  </li>
            <li> For some background, I have had a Braun 8995 for probably 4 or so years using the original foil/blade.</li>
            <li> I was still using the original head after 3 years.  </li>
            <li> This cutter restored original performance to my shaver.  </li>
            <li> Worth the 27-28$!</li>
            <li> I did not notice any difference from the original parts.</li>
            <li> My original foil lasted for years without a problem.</li>
            <li> Worked just like the original</li>
            <li> I compared it to my original blade that came with shaver and</li>
            <li> I get many stuff from Amazon and this is the first thing I get that is junk...</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Braun is one of the best electric shavers on the market today and past years.</li>
            <li> Then I remembered that my shaver foil didn&#x27;t look like the original one on the Braun Series 5 590cc.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s original foil and cutter lasted just under 2 years before it needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li> so it was exactly what I ordered and it will fit his razor!</li>
            <li> This is the original OEM replacement foil and cutter for my Braun.  </li>
            <li> The original foil and cutter had been in use for over 5 years.</li>
            <li> but it gives me a closer, smoother shave than the original without any pulling or discomfort.</li>
            <li> The original foil lasted about 18 months.</li>
            <li> Also...my original order did not show up.  </li>
            <li> Had the original foil for about two years.</li>
            <li> Just like the original.</li>
            <li> Upgraded foil pattern over the original that came with my Braun.  </li>
            <li> should have looked here first since the price was better.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> My husband uses his Braun Shaver every morning and is thrilled with his new replacement foil and cutter.  </li>
            <li> This new blade set gave me a REALLY nice shave after three days of not shaving.</li>
            <li> Also, many thanks for discontinuing the Activator branded replacement foil that gave me a comfortable shave every day for 2 years.</li>
            <li> After figuring it out, I love it and think it is better than the old version.  </li>
            <li> The shave is quick and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I know how to take care of their shavers and blades, don&#x27;t push it into your beard and keep it clean and all of that.</li>
            <li> I get a clean, close shave</li>
            <li> Works awesome, no issues and seems to last nearly a year.</li>
            <li> Got a clean shave after 5 minute switch out.</li>
            <li> recommend to anyone who needs a clean shave</li>
            <li> so the block/blade below can make a clean cut without any tugging/pulling.</li>
            <li> Well I finally found this and despite the difficulty determining which was for my razor it is by far the best version to date.</li>
            <li> I have a series 8000 Braun Clean and Renew system (8781)</li>
            <li> so I manually clean my shaver after each use.  </li>
            <li> This cuts closely, cleanly, etc., etc.</li>
            <li> Used my old set for many many years and never replaced it.  </li>
            <li> CLEAN  </li>
            <li> To be precise, it&#x27;s the new foil that does it; the shave head itself is actually perfectly fine, and in fact I think cuts better than the original.</li>
            <li> this blade and foil is not as good as the original one, and it is not the same as the original one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to be able to replace parts instead of having to buy a whole new razor.  </li>
            <li> Despite some of the negative reviews posted about this replacement foil and cutter, I found the items were a perfect replacement for the original 8000 series shaving heads.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to purchase some from Amazon and was excited to find them at what I thought was a fair price.</li>
            <li> In fact, if you have one of the great braun 8000&#x27;s, you might as well buy a new shaver from another manufacturer to avoid the new cutter block altogether.</li>
            <li> New blades a new foil are great to have every year.</li>
            <li> The replacement foil and cutter replacement packs are very easy to install and last more than 6 months each time I replace them.</li>
            <li> Husband said the replacement parts work great would highly recommend to anyone, he reorders these parts when needed, saves on buying the complete shaver</li>
            <li> No issues and experienced a close shave as expected.</li>
            <li> Fits great and works as expected.</li>
            <li> The foil and cutter performance appeared good at the start but within a very short time (about 6 weeks of shaving once per day)</li>
            <li> Only good thing is its cheaper.</li>
            <li> I recommend replacing every 6 months rather than waiting a full year.</li>
            <li> The shave is fairly close, closer than the prior 7000 series replacement heads.</li>
            <li> and it was getting to where I really really needed to, even at the risk of getting what many here are calling a junk replacement.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to think these products are not too good.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s undergone the most changes and which really help.</li>
            <li> I wish these companies would make a better foil that did not wear out so fast.</li>
            <li> Nice to keep the old unit going.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this razor for several years now, the replacement foil/cutter are a good price considering he replaces it about once a year.</li>
            <li> Quick, Clean Shave each time with no scratches or nicks.</li>
            <li> Love the whole concept of the electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Full disclosure</li>
            <li> Can anyone with confidence tell me where I can buy an ACTUAL good replacement cutter for this model?</li>
            <li> They still do a good job of shaving, but they tend to last just over 1-1/2 months.</li>
            <li> The only reason I haven&#x27;t returned it is because it&#x27;s been used a number of times and I can&#x27;t in good conscience return something for a refund that&#x27;s been used.  </li>
            <li> It cuts better and gives a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> Work as good as the one I bought as the local store.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After swapping in the new product (very easy to do), man, did the shaving get a lot closer than it used to.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE one year later:  FIrst couple of months was great but it quickly degraded.  </li>
            <li> Shaver delivers a much more comfortable shave with the new foil and cutter.</li>
            <li> The foil screen doesn&#x27;t quite fit right</li>
            <li> Not the right fit for my shaver.</li>
            <li> I see some other people complaining about this replacement model but it works great for me.</li>
            <li> In fact my first one that I own for 20 years (and keep as back up) gives me a better shave.  </li>
            <li> This new cutter/foil also seems to incorporate some advances from the series 5 generation of Braun Razors (The power cutter and blades are improved), so it seems to do a better job in that regard than the original Activator cutter/foil too.</li>
            <li> After replacing the blade and screen it shaved better than new!</li>
            <li> I love the smoothness of the new blades!  </li>
            <li> , was exactly what I ordered and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Is not cutting as cleanly as you remember?  </li>
            <li> glad to finally replace my old foil and cutter, feels good to shave clean, again.</li>
            <li> super product.</li>
            <li> I think the older design cut better.</li>
            <li> It also shaves closer without needing to go over the same place as many times and seems to do a better job of lifting hairs.  </li>
            <li> They worked and were as decribed, they came quickly.</li>
            <li> Best price I have found on these bad boys, good ddeal</li>
            <li> Love this product: been using it for more than ten years.</li>
            <li> The cutter does fit and seems to work ok with the old foil.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to be quick using an electric razor but</li>
            <li> the older version did cut a littler closer then this one but all around this one is better in my opinon.</li>
            <li> but luckily I found these replacement cutters</li>
            <li> Product as promised, and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Probably like most owners of a Braun Series 5 shaver, I have read the many critical reviews of the company&#x27;s replacement foil &amp; cutter (&#x27;51S&#x27;).  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Received quickly.  </li>
            <li> Quickly delivered and does the job.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and delivery.</li>
            <li> These only last 12 at best</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It also is affordable and was shipped to me quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly</li>
            <li> The screen and cutter were an exact  OEM fit.</li>
            <li> you read the \\&quot;comments to my review\\&quot; section, you will know that I have long since switched to the 30B foil and cutter block for my 8985 shaver, with good results.</li>
            <li> you read the \\&quot;comments to my review\\&quot; section, you will know that I have long since switched to the 30B foil and cutter block for my 8985 shaver, with good results.</li>
            <li> The new one takes less time to shave with the best result.</li>
            <li> This replacement for my Activator is like getting a new razor -- new cutter and block perform just like the original with a  nice close clean shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that the problem with this product has been fixed and now it works exactly as I remember it working when my 360 shaver (model 8595) was new.</li>
            <li> Great price for this becoming hard to find replacement parts.</li>
            <li> now requires very little pressure to get a great, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The new blade and foil leads to many pulled hairs</li>
            <li> I was pleased at the price and the new closer shave.</li>
            <li> the new screen and cutter work better and shave cleaner when used together.</li>
            <li> My husband is so pleased to have a new foil delivered every 6 months.</li>
            <li> Much better shave now with new foil.</li>
            <li> He was able to replace his blades without even looking at the instructions and says that it works like it is brand new.  </li>
            <li> But this new screen and cutter block design are better than anything I&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I reread reviews on here and found out the new shipment of packs had been re-upped in quality.  </li>
            <li> This works better than the foil and cutter that were replaced (as they should being brand new parts).  </li>
            <li> So I will never use that again and most my money go to this nursing home that I live in..</li>
            <li> In fact it seems that I&#x27;m getting a better shave now than I did when the razor was new.</li>
            <li> Was a new cutter and foil and fit my shaver fine.</li>
            <li> It is less $ and works great.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and easy to install on existing razor.  </li>
            <li> It gives and excellent close shave for the first 2 months, then starts loses its edge after that time.</li>
            <li> Installation was fast and easy.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Braun for making the replacement so easy.</li>
            <li> As always, fast shipping and easy ordering from Amazon</li>
            <li> Not at all the clean, fast shave I got with my original blades.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I pay for!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> (the first lasted two years!)</li>
            <li> Got it on time and works exactly like my original!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> This blade and cover are an exact replica of the original ones.  </li>
            <li> If you like Braun razors this replacement cutter is the exact original, and works new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price and fits unit.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for, a bit confused since the model number changed, but the part fit perfect</li>
            <li> This replacement blade is not built exactly like the original blade.  </li>
            <li> The razor shaves like it did when I first bought it!</li>
            <li> The first two primal blades holed 4-5 months!</li>
            <li> Brought my shaver back to being able to cut again!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been using the same foils and cutters for a year or more, it&#x27;s time to make the change!</li>
            <li> Nothing looked drastically different, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of comfort, the 51S felt great, like a new kit should.</li>
            <li> The shaver runs cooler, cuts more effectively, and pulls at the hairs less.</li>
            <li> This replacement was reasonably priced, arrived quickly and gave me a close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Apparently the company knew about this and changed the design of the openings to a more circular hole pattern instead of the triangular holes in the original.</li>
            <li> This is the same exact foil and cutter as the original if you own a 360 Complete/8985</li>
            <li> and I put it on and everything looks fine so far (except for the looks and also that the travel case plastic cover doesn&#x27;t quite fit since there is no notch on the foil cover</li>
            <li> Although I do not love the razor that this product goes with the best, the Braun Series 5 provides a decent shave</li>
            <li> I normally have good cutters and foils shipped to me, but for some reason the cutter was not sharp at all this time.</li>
            <li> it is not the original blade or foil, so it does not work with the original (high end) Activator.  </li>
            <li> Working great, don&#x27;t have to work hard, a light touch</li>
            <li> This razor head is a hard to find item and it came in perfect condition and at a better price than the last time I had to replace it.</li>
            <li> I get comfortable with what the worn our foil and cutter was doing and didn&#x27;t realize just how much smoother my skin would feel after a replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but shipping was free and fast.</li>
            <li> Too much work for a cheap item.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> So far the Panasonic seems much better than the Braun.</li>
            <li> Also, I use to feel occasional pull, which kind of hurts, when I shave with smartfoil.  </li>
            <li> This replacement works much better than the old blade.</li>
            <li> but honestly it seemed to shave the same since the day I purchased the shaver</li>
            <li> but at a fraction of the cost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely post reviews</li>
            <li> Well okay, it isn&#x27;t completely junk</li>
            <li> Updating the foil and cutter is worth it.</li>
            <li> I discovered that the old style requires more pressure on your face to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> This is compounded by an old cutter block that has seen more than 18 months of use.  </li>
            <li> I still feel that my last Panasonic shaver did better than this Braun, and I primarily attribute that to the foil/cutter design.</li>
            <li> Economical way to get replacement cutter.</li>
            <li> it looks like they fixed it, and more.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice close shave and only takes about 5 minutes per day.  </li>
            <li> I suppose if they had surprised me with more I would have given them five stars.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Price was good, delivered sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> this replacement is far better than what came with my shaver...  </li>
            <li> the blades and the screen were great ,easy to install,once again i could have a clean shave  with the razor cutting myself,i would definatly would tell any body that has one ther shaves and is having trouble shaving to check it out they go a real good job</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase</li>
            <li> Well worth the replacement cost.</li>
            <li> Probably, but it&#x27;s so worth it when you use it.</li>
            <li> Much better than the old one that broke.</li>
            <li> Well, no shaver is fun with the blade hitting skin.</li>
            <li> well worth doing to rejuvenate your Braun.</li>
            <li> With this &amp;#34;cutter&amp;#34;, there is no cutting noise at all.</li>
            <li> Not cutting close.  </li>
            <li> Braun does far more than that.  </li>
            <li> This is exciting as a set of replacement foils can be.</li>
            <li> This is a complete waste, as the rest of the razor is still excellent.</li>
            <li> Much better than the old one that started to break.</li>
            <li> Works great, smooth shave and foil cover fits well if not a little tight compared to the original.</li>
            <li> I think I had &#x27;tears of joy&#x27; after using this new foil after a long weekend where I hadn&#x27;t shaved for three days.  </li>
            <li> My first shave with the new foil/cutter was better than I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Love the shaver unit for long battery &amp; charge life, easy use but the plummeting quality of cutter replacement may force me to abandon it.</li>
            <li> I think this new foil gives a closer and more comfortable shave, kind of like the previous generation 8000 series used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It simply works great, and the price was much better than from other sources.</li>
            <li> this foil and cutter are so fine tuned that the unit is quieter in-use than I can ever remember; it performs like new too!</li>
            <li> worked great for what we needed, replacement for a ripped old head and a new blade, made a new life out of my razor</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if it is any better than the original shaver foil and cutter that came with my shaver, as it performs similarly.  </li>
            <li> Since I first started purchasing replacements, I have not managed to get even two months of use of each of 3 sets, and the effectiveness did not match that of the original even when first installed.</li>
            <li> The foil is slightly different than the original I think for the better.</li>
            <li> , I actually was getting a better shave than with the original equipment.  </li>
            <li> Braun razors are the best but only with sharp shaving heads and foil.</li>
            <li> I have no idea where the negative comments are coming from, but my best guess is that they&#x27;re coming from people who are replacing parts on older razors, not the Series 5 razors.  </li>
            <li> Experienced same issues as others noted, doesn&#x27;t shave as close now and major irritation.  </li>
            <li> It cuts very well and evenly without the pain and discomfort of the original.  </li>
            <li> Good for shave due to quality</li>
            <li> Very good product and razor blades last a long time.</li>
            <li> is the right product for you.</li>
            <li> it pops right in the shaver.</li>
            <li> I could not find the right one in the retail store</li>
            <li> It always popped right off.</li>
            <li> She was right.  </li>
            <li> You have to replace your foils every 18 months (and that is about right)</li>
            <li> Worked in my shaver and the price was right.</li>
            <li> The price was right too.&lt;br /&gt;No problems.</li>
            <li> they were right here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The improvement was noticeable right away.  </li>
            <li> right outta</li>
            <li> Easy to replace and works like new.  </li>
            <li> have seen this exact same package sell out of N.Y.C. for around $50, so I felt it was an amazing deal, almost bought two.</li>
            <li> So save your money &amp; enjoy your closer shaves with the older foil kits on your Series 5.</li>
            <li> Shaves now are much quicker and clean again.</li>
            <li> This product fit my razor, even though I have an older model.  </li>
            <li> When I shaved the first time with the replacement I thought at first it wasn&#x27;t doing anything!  </li>
            <li> Nice to have a sharp clean blade again.</li>
            <li> This was money well spent for $39 I now have a like new razor that produces a great close shave.</li>
            <li> Changing it out is simple and the razor was as good as new when it was done.</li>
            <li> Very easy to switch old for new!</li>
            <li> Back to smooth, easy shaves.</li>
            <li> New screen worked just fine on my 8000 series razor, would have given it 5 stars except for the shipping problem.  </li>
            <li> the new one works fine</li>
            <li> Shaves like new again, it worked fine.</li>
            <li> When you finely put new blades in, it works</li>
            <li> I just bought the 30B foil and cutter for my shaver after reading other similar suggestions and it works great - the cutter is designed differently but the dimensions are exactly the same and it fits perfectly with the shaver.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to perk up a razor that was not cutting the hairs well and pulling in some cases..easy to swop it out.</li>
            <li> (roughly 7 years as opposed to the 18 month replacement recommendation by the manufacturer), so I was very pleased about that.  </li>
            <li> Product is the usual great quality from Braun.  </li>
            <li> This 5 series pack made an average shaver a good one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure it&#x27;s as good as the original</li>
            <li> Works like new a close and smooth shave better then the 30b that others suggested cost little more but worth it for a close shave</li>
            <li> It installs fine but just doesn&#x27;t feel or sound the same.  </li>
            <li> Braun quality fit and finish made changing blade simple and quick!</li>
            <li> If you look at it in that light, it&#x27;s a pretty amazingly good buy relative to traditional razors.  </li>
            <li> I always love the first week of a new shaver head, quick smooth shaves, then it goes longer and longer to get the same effect.  </li>
            <li> To my dismay I quickly realized that the 51 S is nowhere near the quality that the razor originally came with.</li>
            <li> I had chucked the old one in my cabinet and lo and behold the OLD ORIGINAL foil works 10 times better than this GARBAGE replacement they are selling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> foil and cutter set was not the correct match (fit) for my new Series 5 razor.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> As stated, the new replacement head made my old shaver as good as when it was new.</li>
            <li> needed a new foil and cutter, i bought my 5 series in 2008 and it fit it well....</li>
            <li> I noticed the higher noise level right away.  </li>
            <li> Easy to swap out the old blade and foil and pop these in.  </li>
            <li> Great deal and prevents me going to A big box store for them only to be out</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I found it so easily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Series 3 foil and cutter as well, and even though this one costs more, I think it&#x27;s worth it since I only replace about every 2 years.</li>
            <li> The replacement screen and block are visually identical to what was on the shaver from the factory and the resulting shave is smooth, close, and comfortable.</li>
            <li> My current set was about a year old and my wife mentioned that I wasn&#x27;t getting a good shave.  </li>
            <li> It was so easy to replace the old parts</li>
            <li> worked well and continues to work properly with a clean easy shave.</li>
            <li> good replacement same as in wal-mart no problems fits my 360 complete grate.</li>
            <li> Braun razors used to give relatively quick and very close shaves.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a daily shaver and/or change the block/foil frequently there&#x27;s probably no discernible difference between the two but for anyone who, like me, goes a couple days between shaving and/or likes to maximize the life of the blade then the 30b is superior.</li>
            <li> this change gives me a new Braun!!!</li>
            <li> Works like new !!!</li>
            <li> Right out of the box (once I discovered how to get the old blade off), it cut so smoothly.</li>
            <li> I considered buying the new braun but changed my mind when I saw how much it was and knowing that with the new blade mine will be 94% as good as the new &#x27;improved&#x27; version.</li>
            <li> where I didn&#x27;t use it very much.</li>
            <li> The product arrived very fast</li>
            <li> THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE PERSON WHO RECOMENDED THE 7000 SERIES (</li>
            <li> THE PRICE WAS VERY REASONABLE.</li>
            <li> The Braun Shaver head was very reasonably priced versus the Braun website that quite often charges a premium.</li>
            <li> I like the Braun Series 5 shaver very much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, nothing to rave about.&lt;br /&gt;Bought it once and the second time you raised the price, so that wasn&#x27;t very smart on your part</li>
            <li> I am at a loss to understand how a genuine replacement part could be so inferior to the original one that came with the shaver as they look the same.  </li>
            <li> As most amazon shoppers know, prices fluctuate all the time and this is an item to throw in your cart (or save it for later) and then check back daily until you&#x27;re happy with the price or you&#x27;re willing to pay what it is</li>
            <li> Using it with my Braun 360 complete and works fine.</li>
            <li> &quot; but rest assured it will work fine on your 8000 series 360 Complete model too.</li>
            <li> The center strip seems to cut better than my original.</li>
            <li> I really love changing out to a new head, makes the razor seem brand new</li>
            <li> The bottom line is that the new foil/cutter performs better than when the razor was new.</li>
            <li> The new cutter and foil makes the electric razor feel better than it did when it was new.</li>
            <li> because if I don&#x27;t it does start to irritate a little, but all in all a good product.</li>
            <li> Replacing with the new shaver foil restored original performance</li>
            <li> But, performance of the new cutter and foil was just not up to the original.</li>
            <li> It is important to clean this head daily in order to prolong its life.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and a curly beard, which has become increasingly more so as I&#x27;ve gotten older.</li>
            <li> replacement is very easy and worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Great replacement for when the cutter gets dull and the foil gets damaged.</li>
            <li> I bought this replacement pack along with the clean &amp; renew cartridges for my husband, in trying not to buy a brand new razor.  </li>
            <li> Both are super easy to change and are cheaper then throwing out your old razor and buying new.</li>
            <li> It made a HUGE difference in the shave I get from my old razor.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Braun for over for 20 years (not the same one) &amp; now I need to to put baby oil or olive oil w/lavender on my face for a better smoother shave.</li>
            <li> This is the only razor my husband likes after trying many others.</li>
            <li> I use my Braun for travel only, so the shaver takes more of a beating than my Norelco at home.  </li>
            <li> Also the newer cutter block fit both Braun 360 complete as well as Braun Activator</li>
            <li> you are looking for an exact replacement for the Braun Activator line of shavers</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reviewers, who are deciding to buy the 51S, or comparing 51S and 30B foils, should consult the more recent reviews, as those will pertain to the newer foils.</li>
            <li> Have noticed nothing different except a better shave.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I used this replacement foil.  </li>
            <li> At first, I though it was the incorrect head - but it is the correct replacement for my model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended for all my fellow cheapskates out there ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I read the reviews here on Amazon, because I realize that I&#x27;m not the only having issues with this foil.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaver works now like it did when I first used it about 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> Braun-the Ultimate shaver-like being able to buy replacement parts that don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg  </li>
            <li> Bought this Braun shaver (my first electric) at Sears a year ago for over 200 bucks.</li>
            <li> Braun advises to replace cutter and foil every 18 months and the foil and cutter would easily last 24 or even more months.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought it online.</li>
            <li> and you are straight!</li>
            <li> Funny thing:  </li>
            <li> Thanks to the reviewers who recommended this product as a replacement!</li>
            <li> I finally had to accept that the shaver just wasn&#x27;t inclined to cut wiskers any more.</li>
            <li> ( i replaced the heads pretty close to the schedule).</li>
            <li> They were exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Much nicer shave with fresh foil and cutter.  </li>
            <li> First head lasted 3 or 4 years.</li>
            <li> and this is the first time I replace the cutter and foil.</li>
            <li> but pretty close.</li>
            <li> I have only experienced this before when I was shaving really fast or on a low charge.</li>
            <li> also wrote to Braun asking them if they were aware if \\&quot;Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack\\&quot; would work with the 8585</li>
            <li> I first started off with the cutter block of the 51S and foil of the 30B.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> When I first started using Braun, I could get 2-3 years out of a foil.</li>
            <li> Will order more in future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny, now with the replacement foil and blades</li>
            <li> This feels like an exact replacement for my 5 series shaver.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted almost 10 months.  </li>
            <li> and this is the first time I ever had a problem.  </li>
            <li> I bought my most recent Braun 550 two years ago.  </li>
            <li> that were more than local retail.</li>
            <li> It was time for a replacement because my dad&#x27;s electric razor&#x27;s foil got damaged and he never changed the cutter from when he first got it.</li>
            <li> I use it daily.  :-)</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> and I started first on my neck.  </li>
            <li> The attached pic is exactly what mine looks like, but it&#x27;s a stock image for reference.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Hope its not a fake.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was expecting, thank you.</li>
            <li> Exact manufacturer&#x27;s replacement.</li>
            <li> First two were Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Braun Series 5 is an expensive razor, so refurbishing it made perfect sense.</li>
            <li> This one is the real deal!  </li>
            <li> This is the first time in a couple of years that I bought a cutter block &amp; foil for my Braun 8585 Razor, and they definitely changed the design for the better.</li>
            <li> (whisker) cutters are larger and work better.</li>
            <li> Which not only works better, but keeps the blades sharper (and hopefully longer).</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s also the first cutter block I&#x27;ve purchased in quite a while</li>
            <li> do not know if the ones in the stores are of any better quality and last longer.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> That is exactly what it does.</li>
            <li> Shipping was also fast!  </li>
            <li> Was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to find replacement heads locally.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the replacement pack and the first thing I noticed were the words \\&quot;Made in Germany\\&quot; on the package.  </li>
            <li> Great price and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is the exact parts needed.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR</li>
            <li> Was exactly what it was described to be.  </li>
            <li> I know exactly what to expect when buying a replacement cutter and foil.</li>
            <li> So I glad I saved $10 buying it through amazon, instead of at our local Kmart.</li>
            <li> The one that came in from Amazon cut like the first one that came with my Series 5.  </li>
            <li> Personally, given how much better it worked after I replaced them, I&#x27;m going to replace at 12 months from now on.  </li>
            <li> I own a Braun 8985 and needed a replacement foil and was nervous about buying this one after reading some of the reviews, but I have been using it for a month or so now with absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> Always exactly what we need.</li>
            <li> This is the exact replacement from the factory for my shaver.</li>
            <li> The installation was a breeze and the shaving experience is now again like it once was when I first bought the shaver.</li>
            <li> exactly what i needed</li>
            <li> Great value and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I needed for my Braun Shaver.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed my Braun Series 5 shaver for over 5 years and have only replaced the foil and cutter</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This saved me from buying a whole shaver!  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve gotten replacement cutters and foil for a shaver I received about 14 months ago.</li>
            <li> For anyone who wears glasses, if you remember the shock at the first time you ever put on a pair after months or years of having gotten used to the blurry world around you, you know how I&#x27;ve felt again about the morning shave.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Exactly the refill i was after for my Series 5.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> With the reviews here, I looked all over before ordering the first replacement 6 months ago.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and works well.  </li>
            <li> DUH, needed to change the head and block; the head &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34; cheaper but works quite great</li>
            <li> I have an old Braun Shaver and this screen and cutter was said to fit it.  </li>
            <li> One star is too much for this item!</li>
            <li> Exact replacement.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what is stated on line.  </li>
            <li> After a cleaning cycle I had no other problems and it performs flawlessly, still the closest electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and I have no intention of buying a new electric until this one completely bites the dust, as long as I can get these replacement foil/cutters and the rest of the razor</li>
            <li> , my strong recommendation is to avoid the 51S (I will most likely avoid Braun in general from now on) like the plague.</li>
            <li> If you have an older series 5 razor, you would think that this replacement part would fit, since there is nothing on the package or ad that says it is for a new type od series 5 razor!</li>
            <li> The new redesigned foil and cutter have completely destroyed my love for my shaver.</li>
            <li> Was able to use old foil with new cutter.  </li>
            <li> Wow you can tell the difference!!!!</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!  </li>
            <li> These are good but not long lasting.</li>
            <li> This comb design scrapes the skin more intensely (it is thicker, wider and protrudes more), which left me with a red face after shaving (from irritation).</li>
            <li> The blades are very thin, so it is best just to use the liquid cleaner.</li>
            <li> I too was surprised when I replaced my original cutter/foil set with these.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this replacement foil and cutter after using the original for nearly two years.  </li>
            <li> I assume this is all original equipment for my old Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> I just got another replacement blade and its so nice and sharp</li>
            <li> Worked just as well as the original for the 360 complete.</li>
            <li> But, as I remember,  it doesn&#x27;t shave quite as closely as the original set that came with my Braun 360 complete.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good feature of the Braun Series 5 because the replacement essentially returns the shaver to near new condition.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacements that are hard to find in any local store.</li>
            <li> arrived fast, easy to change,new sharp blade makes shaving easy and</li>
            <li> The New replacement pack installs easy and made the shaver work like new.</li>
            <li> After Braun switched to the new 5-Series branding the quality of the replacement heads declined quickly.  </li>
            <li> I needed the foil and cutter replacement set because my old one had holes in the screen I like the shaver because it gives a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I have to be extremely gentle especially when using around the lower jaw since it seems to hurt the most there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the second or third Braun I have had they are good razors</li>
            <li> The blades last and are of such good quality.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that it would help so much and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I should have run it through a cleaning cycle first as I got a little harmless residue on my face with the first use, but that aside, it performed just as good as when the razor was new.  </li>
            <li> Makes for a remarkable upgrade when the blades get dull.  </li>
            <li> My razor is over 10 years old and runs great due to the new blades and foils every three years or so.</li>
            <li> Seeing newer positive reviews encouraged me to take a chance on this one</li>
            <li> Fast and exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and the product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> this is exactly as advertised, and a whole lot cheaper than buying it in a brick and mortar store.</li>
            <li> I used straight razors for the first 34 years of my life, but my wife bought me this razor a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li> Removal of the old blade and installation of the new blade and cover were easy.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it to get a virtually new shaver.</li>
            <li> definitely worth the money to get new blades.</li>
            <li> Easy to install and only took about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> it was like 3 years old, I am lucky I did not keep using that.</li>
            <li> Amazon is an easy and affordable way to obtain these necessary parts.</li>
            <li> 2nd replacement and still going strong.</li>
            <li> It was a good price but never seem to last as long as they say.  </li>
            <li> Braun always has good quality and long lasting sharpness.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s certainly a lot cheaper than going to the barber every two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Certainly a must to get.</li>
            <li> I found them, my razor feels like brand new!!</li>
            <li> I was only able to get it on Amazon, and the razor once again performed like it was brand new.</li>
            <li> I love my Braun shaver, and this is a quality replacement pack, bringing the shaver back to new performance capability.  </li>
            <li> I thought about a new shaver but at over 100 bucks I said someone must sell parts and sure enough there</li>
            <li> I almost gave up on it, but then decided I don&#x27;t want to spend so much on a new razor right now</li>
            <li> The new foil style really makes a difference in making sure that even the hairs growing parallel to the skin are raised and shaved.  </li>
            <li> My old foil and cutter had worn out completely, so had to replace with a new one that I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have had issues in  the past with the replacements not feeling as good as they should, but so far this one seems to be the right match.</li>
            <li> I bought the first replacement from the same place I bought the razor originally.</li>
            <li> Been ordering these Brain cutters for several years and they work fine, always arrive on time.</li>
            <li> but it works fine especially considering the price compared to brick and mortar stores.  </li>
            <li> It shaves and feels exactly the same as the original.</li>
            <li> This is the original replacement foil, and after using a knockoff foil and being completely disappointed, I am very happy to have purchased this.</li>
            <li> The replacement foil and cutter are exactly the same as original.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly which I needed to bring shaver back to original performance.</li>
            <li> If this is some sort of scheme to force people to replace an older electric razor with a newer one, well bravo!</li>
            <li> Price very high</li>
            <li> From what I can tell, the cutter seems to be exactly the same as what originally came with the razor, although this one is obviously much sharper than the one that was well over a year</li>
            <li> Good price for hard to find item.</li>
            <li> Similarly, the holes on the new 51S foil are much more uniform (if not a tad smaller) than the design of the foil on the original Activator foil.</li>
            <li> Numerous reviewers have complained that they&#x27;ve experienced significant irritation by the new product.</li>
            <li> hope Braun eventually gets the message that they need to pay as much attention to the quality of replacement parts as they do of the original, as this is a huge black eye for a company that I&#x27;ve always regarded with respect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now used to the fact that it&#x27;s just much better than the old foil, so I don&#x27;t really notice anymore, but the shave remains closer than it ever was with the original foil with less passes./&gt;Update 4/5/12</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now used to the fact that it&#x27;s just much better than the old foil, so I don&#x27;t really notice anymore, but the shave remains closer than it ever was with the original foil with less passes.</li>
            <li> It gives such a fast, comfortable shave</li>
            <li> I dont know when the last time i replaced my shaver head but this replacement pack is a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li> These recent 51S blocks are a huge improvement over what they used to be.  </li>
            <li> They seemed very apologetic, and actually sent me two free sets.</li>
            <li> The Bruan shaver is really a lifetime shaver.</li>
            <li> Really, you want me to rate a razor foil?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will fit your shaver but it is a different product.</li>
            <li> But my gripe is that the foils wear out too fast.</li>
            <li> The situation seems to be that Braun is pulling a fast shuffle on foil replacements.</li>
            <li> Replacing with the razor heads keeps each shave a smooth result and the power only needs recharging every three months!  </li>
            <li> With the volume of my voice, the whole household knew that I was getting that Epilady close shave that</li>
            <li> that absolutely nobody would want.  </li>
            <li> THE ONE I GOT WASN&#x27;T FOR #5735 - AND ONLY THE CUTTER FIT.</li>
            <li> With the fast oscilations of this model, there is no tugging</li>
            <li> After a month of use it literally hurts and pulls too much to use.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for carrying these.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived fast.</li>
            <li> it could be thanks to the Lectric</li>
            <li> Thanks Braun for making these replacement items and selling them together.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Vendor is a fast shipper, will use this vendor again</li>
            <li> just what I needed and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Fast shipping with prime.</li>
            <li> Around 3-4 months to tell much change.</li>
            <li> eg pressing harder to make sure</li>
            <li> I decided to try Amazon, because I have been very satisfied with past transactions.  </li>
            <li> Fast ship.  </li>
            <li> but the point is it is very durable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a chance to try both of them now, and I much prefer the 51S for my 8585 shaver.</li>
            <li> It was just as smooth as using the earlier 8000 series or the 30B (cutter block and foil).</li>
            <li> It was just as smooth as using the earlier 8000 series or the 30B (cutter block and foil).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how close the shave is now and how much quicker it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I really need to replace mine every 6-9 months . . .</li>
            <li> I tried to adjust the tension of the foil by gently compressing it.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper here than at the box store.</li>
            <li> I really like my shaver</li>
            <li> Now only series 5 came up, so I hoped for a fit.</li>
            <li> I put off ordering one since I didn&#x27;t want a piece of junk, I wanted a real replacement.  </li>
            <li> the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a Braun product instead of a cheap knockoff</li>
            <li> The replacement foils and cutters are very durable as well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference</li>
            <li> and I did not want to throw away the shaver because it works very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to the replacement foil I don&#x27;t have to throw the shaver away</li>
            <li> You only can get this part number to fit and its a matter of where you are going to purchase yours..</li>
            <li> This worked very well</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I really like the Braun shaver, I may need to move to something else.  </li>
            <li> Why do manufacturers always change things that are not broken.</li>
            <li> This time it was very noticeable better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> No pulls or issues and a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> Something has absolutely changed, as others have pointed out.  </li>
            <li> Shipped fast too.</li>
            <li> Shave is so much closer/smoother.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews posted for this foil/cutter replacement I was a bit nervous about how this would work, but as another reviewer said, this seems to be the real deal.  </li>
            <li> This replacement foil really improved performance.</li>
            <li> You need to replace your foil and cutter - minimum - every 18 months and this fits my Braun Series 5 550cc and works very well.</li>
            <li> Now amazon has promised to give me a credit, lets see how much of that is the truth.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this before for my shaver and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> Much more economical than the local stores, but of same quality!</li>
            <li> just what I expected love Braum</li>
            <li> It was exactly as I expected, and my shaves have been much better since I replaced it with this product.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> How much can one say about a razor screen?  </li>
            <li> I have to get more blades for that...and it harder to hold with my hand and fingers</li>
            <li> I really needed this.</li>
            <li> I was frankly amazed at how much difference it</li>
            <li> I really like my Braun shaver and finding Amazon had</li>
            <li> the replacement heads was a real find for mew.  </li>
            <li> Upgrading was out of want not so much need, I would recommend this to anybody that likes electrics.</li>
            <li> I really am at a loss for words.  </li>
            <li> Look at the much hyped pictures on the Braun Shaver Series 5 590cc shaver page they look nothing like the foil head</li>
            <li> I received it in the mail I didn&#x27;t really think anything of it.  </li>
            <li> The screen was all i really needed.</li>
            <li> - I have a light beard / light stubble so those with thicker facial hair may have a different experience.  </li>
            <li> I paid about $5.00 too much for this item.</li>
            <li> The replacement foil and cutter arrived very promptly.  </li>
            <li> So we need a  foil &amp; cutter replacement fast.  </li>
            <li> Now it shaves very well and close.</li>
            <li> I have a much faster and cleaner shave now.</li>
            <li> The problem is the cutter, not so much the foil.</li>
            <li> It also allows for a much closer and quicker shave.</li>
            <li> thanks, once &amp;#60;i buy this machine &amp;#60;i knew&amp;#60;i</li>
            <li> I have used Braun shavers for over thirty years and have had very satisfactory results.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It just does not give me a shave that is really close.</li>
            <li> However my Braun was making a lot of noise, not shaving well, and using up the charge on the razor extremely fast.  </li>
            <li> The Braun replacement foil and cutter head works very well.</li>
            <li> Much improved shave quality</li>
            <li> The Braun Series 5 Foil &amp; Cutter that I purchased worked well and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> It is a very simply and light product to ship.</li>
            <li> This replacement foil/cutter pack was really cheap compared to my local stores.</li>
            <li> The Braun series cutter and foil work very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that even with that head being twice as old, it is giving a better shave then the 7 month old replacement one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 7000 series (30B) cutter/foil is more recessed and glides better on my skin without irritating it and while giving me a faster, closer shave...\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was forced to go over and over many sections of my face until it was smooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun for about 10 years now, and my old foils would last many months</li>
            <li> The most misleading part of this Amazon listing is (Formerly 8000 360 Complete Or Activator).  </li>
            <li> Good price and arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Awesome price, especially when you really need one once a month as I do as my facial hair is rated at the same streng as steal of the same diameter instead of copper</li>
            <li> blade didn&#x27;t even last 5 months before breaking and giving me a nice red scrape on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> New foil and block arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> If the new replacement doesn&#x27;t work better, I&#x27;m dumping razor and switching brands (so long Braun).</li>
            <li> My previous replacement sets were great and lasted me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love my Braun 8585, but after the original cutter became dull, I bought this replacement.</li>
            <li> I was getting until shaving for the first time with the new foil and cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to repair and tune up my razor, making it like brand new again.  </li>
            <li> exactly what the shaver needed to work like new again</li>
            <li> Buy this if you own a 360 Complete, try the other package if you have the Activator.  </li>
            <li> Original product with a much cheaper price than local stores.</li>
            <li> such luck on this, and Im not aware of a good alternative....</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, extremely satisfied with this purchase, and very glad that I didn&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews, which I don&#x27;t believe are related to the Series 5 razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to replace by popping the old one off with the button on the side of the head and then just slipping this one in it&#x27;s place.  </li>
            <li> The foil is configured differently than the original</li>
            <li> Be aware all electric shavers requiring more back and forth movement - especially about the neck.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 51S foil and cutter at Wal-Mart for ~$40 which is about $15 more than the other Braun foils, but says it&#x27;s for the 8000 series razor on the package.&lt;br</li>
            <li> saved my original blade and am considering switching back to it in spite of the increased shaving time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve admittedly only used this replacement for one day, but from what I can tell, the OptiFoil is a significant improvement over the SmartFoil.  </li>
            <li> I only replaced the razors and kept my original guard.  </li>
            <li> I think they tried to lower the quality a couple of years ago and didn&#x27;t realize that people were going to complain and then went back to the original design.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SO, they are back to the ORIGINAL design.</li>
            <li> The razor head ends protrude very slightly above the foil and the original set did not.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary I have about the same hours on both shavers and the original foil has lasted longer than the replacement</li>
            <li> Having used the same Braun for over 3 years, I decided to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to this foil from my original Activator 8000 series.</li>
            <li> As mentioned in many other reviews this is not the true/correct replacement for a 8000 series shaver.  </li>
            <li> The replacement foil/blade are made in Germany and seem similar to the original in performance.</li>
            <li> Replacement seem to result in the same close shave as original.</li>
            <li> When opening the replacement pack, I noticed that the foil design was somewhat different than the original.</li>
            <li> The screen looks different than the original</li>
            <li> Actually it may be an improvement over the original foil.  </li>
            <li> Try your old foils (if you still have them) &amp; you&#x27;ll be amazed at the comparable fit between the old &amp; new foils.</li>
            <li> However, these new ones certainly made a difference in the feel and effectiveness of the shaver as a whole.  </li>
            <li> The blade seemed to seat more firmly and it cut on the first pass.  </li>
            <li> This is a necessary item if you want to get clean shaves for years.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth pointing out that that it looks like at some stage Braun changed the design slightly so that although the blade still fits my razor perfectly fine, the foil has been redesigned and therefore did not fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much closer shave after replacing the older cutter.</li>
            <li> I combined this product with the cleaning solution to remember to clean my razor properly.</li>
            <li> I bought the Braun series 5 with instant clean holder.  </li>
            <li> The Braun razor unit itself though never worked as advertized, tends to miss large portions of normal beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to find out if you really needed to replace the cutters every 18 months; if there was a real difference between cutters that had been used and taken care of, and the new one.</li>
            <li> This replacement is a cheap way to get that new shaver quality back.</li>
            <li> It served good , but last half of  the time.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Office Home &amp; student 2013 software as a disc for best down load but same came as a internet down load card much to my dismay.  </li>
            <li> sure how long it will last, but I very much like the results of the design changes.</li>
            <li> Why buy a new razor when you can buy a new head and have the old, familiar razor work like brand new?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this kind of shaver for the past 15 years</li>
            <li> you are looking for an exact replacement for the Braun 360 Complete line of shavers, then this Braun Series 5 Combi 51S</li>
            <li> So, in essence, I guess it has had a bit better performance so far, but in only a fraction of the time that I had used my old foil and cutter.</li>
            <li> Best price , these foils wear out fast , and are expensive in local stores.</li>
            <li> The ones that came with my shaver were made by Gillette, and they were too aggressive for my skin, so I dropped in a used cutter block from my old 5000 series shaver and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> My shaving time has reduced from 12-15 min down to 7-8 in most cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having a new razor!</li>
            <li> He said that the razor works like new!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s working like new!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t want or need to buy a new shaver!  </li>
            <li> Just like new!</li>
            <li> Makes my razor NEW again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like I have a brand new razor!</li>
            <li> Saves like new again!</li>
            <li> My razor is as new!</li>
            <li> and it feels like a new shaver!  </li>
            <li> A replacement foil and cutter added new life to my razor!  </li>
            <li> and my shaver is like new!</li>
            <li> Just like a new shaver!</li>
            <li> The replacement parts made it run like new!</li>
            <li> The new one doesn&#x27;t perform like this one does used!</li>
            <li> Works like a new razor now!</li>
            <li> My shaver works like brand new again!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s practically new again!</li>
            <li> It was 100% Brand New!</li>
            <li> I live S&amp;S items!</li>
            <li> After replacing my blade, my Braun worked like new!  </li>
            <li> Made my shaver shave like new again!</li>
            <li> Shaver feels like new again !</li>
            <li> So far so good, it seems these blades get dull just like razor blades do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  a completely viable replacement for the original parts, which really isn&#x27;t a surprise since it&#x27;s from the same mfg.</li>
            <li> It really does feel like a new razor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking I should buy a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li> It has me shopping for a whole new shaver</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> I was ready to purchase a new shaver, but thought I would take a chance on this kit.  </li>
            <li> The new cutter and foil is a much closer, faster and smoother shave.</li>
            <li> It really could notice the difference when I inserted the new blade and shield.</li>
            <li> Replacing these parts is much cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> After installing the new parts I could really feel a difference in the way my razor worked.</li>
            <li> This product really regenerates my shaver and makes it feel almost like new.</li>
            <li> WAS THINKING I WOULD HAVE TO GET A WHOLE NEW SHAVER</li>
            <li> However, it seems to razor burn more than the previous one.</li>
            <li> The Braun Series 5 replacement pack is much better than the previous replacement pack purchased 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> : i&#x27;ve noticed that the current cutter blocks and foil (like the 51S) listed by Braun for the 8000 series have the more agressive &#x27;comb&#x27; between the foils (blue in color).</li>
            <li> A couple years later the only replacement head offered is this one that magically fits all three generations of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It used the older 8000 series foil and cutter heads</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of shaving there is no discernible difference between this model and the older 8000 series.  </li>
            <li> The main thing is that I saved money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at the moment looking for the cutter block for the older models (Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack).</li>
            <li> The cutter worked but the foil design has changed and is no longer compatible with the older model</li>
            <li> As this is a replacement component of a product I&#x27;ve used for years - all I can say is this is the same as what I paid a lot more for in a local store</li>
            <li> this one cuts a lot smoother then the older version.</li>
            <li> Spend your money on a decent 5-bladed razor and a pack of refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re sending another replacement pack which will most likely be the same problem.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell the difference from when I first bought the razor, crisp and close shaves are back.</li>
            <li> those who buy this product, I would suggest to pay particular attention to the \\&quot;Made in...\\&quot; marking on the package.  </li>
            <li> I have an older model 360 shaver, and this is the replacement cutter and foil.  </li>
            <li> This particular vendor must have sold me defective cutters.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok but trie to white me in french....</li>
            <li> I ended up with the same problem of the replacement not cutting very well.  </li>
            <li> Fits my older Braun 8975 model and makes the shaver work well again.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s just an oddity with this particular package.</li>
            <li> I was not getting a close shave from an older cutter and foil for my 8585 activator, so I ordered this series 5 set.  </li>
            <li> The screen guard metal is so fragile,  once it lasted 1 week, hoping to last more than a month.  </li>
            <li> But it seems Braun decided to outsource the manufacturing of their replacement heads for this older model to Larry, Moe, and Curly.</li>
            <li> The cutter grabs and pulls the long hairs -- something that never happened with the original Activator cutterheads even as they were wearing</li>
            <li> My first couple of shaves with this replacement did leave me nicked but that seems to have stopped and my shaves are back to being quite close and comfortable without the need for medical intervention.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Logically you would think that a brand new blade would make and old razor \\&quot;like new\\&quot; again.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this replacement.</li>
            <li> Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> The new Braun actually CUTS my skin that I really bleed - at the bonny points like the chin.  </li>
            <li> The  most recent set I purchased will be my last, and I will be purchasing a new (non-Braun)</li>
            <li> I use the Braun clean and renew refills as well so between the two I expect a long life out of this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Braun 8000 series for a few years now, and I think it&#x27;s great quality, but just like other reviewers</li>
            <li> Other reviews have mentioned that their old foil/cutter combination seemed to work better.  </li>
            <li> the photo in the description should be taken a little bit better.</li>
            <li> I bought the new foil and cutter and when I used it for the first time I thought I made a mistake and put the old one in rather than the new one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately the new foil is standard on all new Braun shavers and the old silver foil is no longer available, so it looks like I&#x27;ll have to try a competitor.</li>
            <li> The foil is somewhat prone to easy damage if the foil is accidentally bumped into or banged into a sharp corner..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this whenever yours starts to feel rough because it now is so smooth.</li>
            <li> It is so smooth, so much quieter than what my other cutter/foil had become, it&#x27;s almost as if it&#x27;s a new razor  altogether.  </li>
            <li> my older Braun feel and work like a brand new shaver.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d say anything bad about my Braun 8585 shaver, but the replacement foils and cutterblock have ruined a wonderful shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worked for one month then something snapped inside it and it makes a really loud buzzing noise and vibrates too much.</li>
            <li> Shave is very close, closer than old remington or norelco that I had.</li>
            <li> The cutter replacement pack fit like a glove on my Series 5 razor and worked perfectly as expected.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give my old but very reliable 8585 cordless another year of use; so, I ordered this kit.  </li>
            <li> This product is great, but not perfect, so I am leaving room for improvement.  </li>
            <li> Item was a direct replacement part at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> The foil and cutter lost their sharpness to fast, I was quite surprised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had absolutely zero problems with this after installing the parts and trying them out, despite the fact that I&#x27;ve got somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Fit me series 5 perfectly, generally these last me 1 year before replacing.</li>
            <li> At first I could feel a real improvement but for the last month or two, it has taken longer to shave and not felt as close.  </li>
            <li> Normally a replacement foil/cutter lasts 70 or 80 shaves, minimum.  </li>
            <li> My beard isn&#x27;t heavy, but I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> The first cutter foil did not fit securely over my razor</li>
            <li> its not as quiet as some, but it is powerful and provides a close shave.</li>
            <li> I installed both correctly and was using it normally.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price, cutter and foil will last.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if what I received was an aberration, or that&#x27;s the normal product that is sold.  </li>
            <li> The full model number is on the bottom front of the razor - same side as the on/off slider near the power connector.</li>
            <li> As most people, I read the negative reviews first.  </li>
            <li> Actually surprised they are still being made/sold because my shaver is pretty old.</li>
            <li> a little over a year, I&#x27;ll have to get a new razor because I won&#x27;t be able to find these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note</li>
            <li> Pretty much the same as if I bought a new one.</li>
            <li> and I used it like a new razor {without as much pressure as with an old razor].</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to have to buy a whole new electric shaver since mine is seven years old</li>
            <li> Really does return your old razor to like new condition.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was heartened to see so many recent positive reviews of the replacement 51S replacement pack, and I noticed that they had returned to being produced in Germany, so I decided to give these blades one last try before replacing the razor entirely.  </li>
            <li> Finally, the right one for series 5</li>
            <li> had it not fit exactly as the original equipment did, but it does.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to use my last replacement for the last three years or so thinking it was still fine.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend if to men with fine to very coarse hair</li>
            <li> I was considering buying a new Braun, but when I saw they use essentially the same head, I just got this, and it works fine.</li>
            <li> My old cutter was 5 years old and it took a long time to shave and the shave was no longer close and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have fairly light stubble and shave every other day.</li>
            <li> Restored the like new feel to my Series 5 electric razor.</li>
            <li> Cuts like when it was brand new.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a brand new razor.</li>
            <li> Would order again when I need new blades in 18 months.</li>
            <li> Made my shaver feel like it was brand new.</li>
            <li> Made it like I was opening up a new shaver again.  </li>
            <li> Might look at buying again rather than new shaver.</li>
            <li> I have never used the new 51S, so I do not know how it cuts or whether it still pulls hair or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not used this new 30B, so I cannot say anything about it</li>
            <li> I have never used the new 51S, so I do not know how it cuts or whether it still pulls hair or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not used this new 30B, so I cannot say anything about it</li>
            <li> I used the Series 5 for 1&amp;1/2 yrs til it required a new cutter &amp; foil.</li>
            <li> and I see no difference between it and a brand new razor.</li>

            <li> I was surprised at how much quieter the new set was compared to the old set.  </li>
            <li> The Braun is heavy noisy and most importantly does not give me the close shave I was used to with their previous shavers.  </li>
            <li> I have an older Braun Activator (aka 360 Complete) 8585 shaver.  </li>
            <li> must say that my shaver works like the day I bought it and really does a great job of cutting the hairs.  </li>
            <li> Clearly, this is a particularly profitable item for Braun.  </li>
            <li> , it does not fit the old series 5, and I could not find one that would fit!</li>
            <li> Braun is trying to get away cheap by not offering the same screen but a screen for various models.</li>
            <li> I wet shave with a double edge razor most days but use my Braun electric when I&#x27;m in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> Maybe the parts fit several different models?</li>
            <li> In short, if you need to buy a new foil/head combo and are still fortunate enough to have the old steel colored foil, KEEP IT!</li>
            <li> so I would have been VERY surprised</li>
            <li> This NEW one is EXACTLY the same as the one that came with the razor.</li>
            <li> I called Braun before ordering this NEW set (foil and blades) and they informed me that it is now back to being the same as the original that came with the razor.</li>
            <li> Product is very sharp and noticeably better at trimming my facial hair than the older blade is.</li>
            <li> like the other reviewers, I found this foil is noisier and doesn&#x27;t cut as well as the original foil.  </li>
            <li> I would say that is average since I am shaving more than twice the normal facial area.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the first place I&#x27;ll go next year.</li>
            <li> I will admit that I got a lot of facial hair ripped out in the first 20 seconds of use.  </li>
            <li> And I never shave on my days off which means first day back to work:</li>
            <li> This product has the different net shape on the head compare the original one.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> This product is the exact same thing you can buy at the store.</li>
            <li> This is the same EXACT blade and foil set that came with my razor.  </li>
            <li> the product did show up on my door step, last week as was stated when I made first card number purch.</li>
            <li> However if you are unlucky like me to have the 51S and plan on using it until it&#x27;s advertised life, you might want to shave more often (like daily or every other day)</li>
            <li> the first foil and cutter I installed did not line up properly and didn&#x27;t work correctly.  </li>
            <li> This is the second replacement pack I&#x27;ve purchased but the first on wasn&#x27;t this make (Braun).</li>
            <li> The old foils didn&#x27;t do this after 18 months of use!</li>
            <li> My razor is over 5 years old and had begun to pinch and pull!</li>
            <li> Same exact one that&#x27;s offered locally.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just echoing a lot of other people - This replacement does not stand up to the original.</li>
            <li> The foil also has a different hole pattern and middle blade than the original.</li>
            <li> but these are the German ones and do bring your razor back to original performance.  </li>
            <li> this is slightly different from the original foil that is on my shaver, but it works just the same.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I got exactly the same thing :</li>
            <li> The new screen and cutter block once again made my 5- year old Braun like new.</li>
            <li> I shave every other day and clean once per week.  </li>
            <li> my  other one was shot and in 3 minutes I had old one out and new one installed headed for that clean shaved look.</li>
            <li> fit my 8000 series and it very sharp.</li>
            <li> The original and the first replacement heads were not very good, the shaver pulled hairs and burned my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for 15 years and suddenly my old 8585 has new life.</li>
            <li> Made my four year old shaver brand new</li>
            <li> The foil and cutter makes my old razor like new again.</li>
            <li> this product made my old Braun razor feel like new.</li>
            <li> I chose the  rating id did because of the ease of getting the old worn part out of the razor and the way the new part just sets in without the need for tools</li>
            <li> you can always tell the difference when you replace the old cutter and heads with new ones.</li>
            <li> I guess I waited much longer this last time because when I put the new foil and cutter on the shaver it was just like new again.  </li>
            <li> I replaced the old cutter and foil with these new ones.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll just stick with the old technology and live without the convenience of an electric.  </li>
            <li> This replacement has gone 2 so far and still like new...</li>
            <li> Replacing the foil and cutter on my 5 year old razor makes it feel like its brand new.  </li>
            <li> Want the Best this is it,  my father would use no other than this Braun, won&#x27;t be  disappointed,  highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I will say that replacing the old cutter did make a huge difference in both the closeness of the shave and ability to cut all hairs in one pass, but the pulling and ripping is not worth it.  </li>
            <li> I was a loyal Braun customer over the past 20 years this is the third Braun shaver I bought and the one I am least happy with.  </li>
            <li> Fast charge, fairly long lasting, easy to use, and has a set of 5 lites to show battery power left.  </li>
            <li> Replacement is dead easy.</li>
            <li> This fits the bill if you need a exact replacement for the 360 complete buy this with confidence this my second purchase.</li>
            <li> At first I was unsure of it being the correct part; but was quickly assured with not only the description; but other responses.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if Amazon takes these back (it would be kind of gross if they did), so I&#x27;m going to go straight to complaining to Braun.</li>
            <li> Foil And Cutter Replacement Pack (7000/4000 Series)]], which was acceptable, but seemed to bog down unlike the original or this one.</li>
            <li> Before buying the 51S, I was considering getting a new 700 series, but at this point, I&#x27;m starting to wonder if it&#x27;s worth considering a different brand altogether.</li>
            <li> The foils had been lasting me 12 - 18 months and this new model lasted just a few days more than one month.</li>
            <li> I procrastinated replacing the Foil and Cutter because I think I can remember when I would pay only a little more to buy an entirely new electric razor (not a Braun) for only a little more.  </li>
            <li> I almost want to switch back to the old one because it is slightly better even after being used for a year and a half.</li>
            <li> Its not exactly as close as straight razor but pretty close and a lot easier on your skin.</li>
            <li> A little light on the razor indicates it&#x27;s time to replace.  </li>
            <li> original razor came with the SmartFoil, which has apparently since been replaced with the OptiFoil (same as in the 7 series), and now only the Series 3 and below are using the SmartFoil.  </li>
            <li> Very good I did not know how bad a shave</li>
            <li> my Braun 5 series legitamitely gives me a cleaner, and closer shave with less irritation than the original foil did.</li>
            <li> I prefer to spend a little more for the extra comfort, and replace mine every 12 months.  </li>
            <li> Actually, the shaves have seemed a little better.</li>
            <li> This foil and head is the Original Braun shaver and head used previously used for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li> So, there goes that theory on spending a little more on Braun to get a razor that will last longer</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a good close shave with very little irritation as long as you replace the foil and cutter regularly.</li>
            <li> I have an older Braun 8595 Shaver that is going into it&#x27;s 9th year of daily use and still runs as well as the day it was new.</li>
            <li> Like having a new razor,packaging difficult to open.however super easy to install.</li>
            <li> This cutting foil has a great life span.</li>
            <li> The series 5 pack is a direct replacement for the old 360 complete pack.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t CLEAR that this is a valid replacement part, but it appeared to be the case - and it is.  </li>
            <li> My old foil had a hole in it.</li>
            <li> an old razor thatt</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, if you own a Braun shaver, which give a great shave, you are required to replace these expensive foil/cutters from time to time.</li>
            <li> I have gone through 3 of them so far</li>
            <li> I have the Braun 360 Complete 8985 shaver.</li>
            <li> I even went to a number of online stores to see if one had the old pack</li>
            <li> The cutter block lasts far longer than the foil.</li>
            <li> I have also e-mailed Braun with this complaint, it will be interesting to see if I hear from them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found my old Braun Syncro &amp; checked the head against the Syncro &amp; discovered that the heads were idenditical.</li>
            <li> From the day I purchased my Braun 360 Complete shaver</li>
            <li> So far I like the replacement.</li>
            <li> I have a seven year old Braun Activator (8585) and after almost two years with the old foil/head I had to buy a replacement.</li>
            <li> The product fits just like the old one.</li>
            <li> However, I have the Braun 8985 -- 360 Complete.  </li>
            <li> I bought up two sets just to keep my 4 year old shaver running.</li>
            <li> It does lack the 360 Complete inscription, but does not affect form or function.</li>
            <li> Thanks MSO for making this possible.</li>
            <li> my  old replacement</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this model.</li>
            <li> - i have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> There was no improvement from the old cutter and foil.</li>
            <li> I just deduct a star, because these parts last much shorter now than some years ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The package is marked Made in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> foil looks identical to the 360 Complete foil I removed except for the \\&quot;360 Complete\\&quot; logo.</li>
            <li> you are using the 8000 series, 360 Complete style, I do not see a problem with this replacement.</li>
            <li> Then I put on my old block and foil, which knocked the stubble off with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i actually wait until almost two years (procrastinator) and the quality of shave does not suffer much even at that point.</li>
            <li> After replacing the old set (which was overdue) I could immediatley tell the difference.</li>
            <li> And even though the series of these foil cutters is over 6 years old, they still tend to be a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Wow, what an upgrade over the old, patterned Activator foil.</li>
            <li> And so much easier than hunting all over locally for it.  </li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews on here I decided to give this a shot for my Braun 8975 360 Complete.</li>
            <li> My face is smoother and not chewed - got the job done in a couple minutes and far fewer passes than the old Series 5 set.</li>
            <li> Since I had stock piled a couple cutter sets, I&#x27;ll run thru them before deciding to dump this old shaver or not.</li>
            <li> And they should&lt;br /&gt;be sold separately because the blades or cutter last much longer than the Foil.</li>
            <li> (prob 3-4 years old).</li>
            <li> I just replaced the foil and cutter and WOW what a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Braun 8000 series shaver for nearly 7 years</li>
            <li> Installation was simple and directions straight forward.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money if you think this will work on your Series 8000.</li>
            <li> I needed this for my old Braun 8975 shaver.  </li>
            <li> I am writing Braun in the hopes they will swap it with an old style 8000.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst.&lt;br</li>
            <li> been to find the old &#x27;beat&#x27; foil.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this as a replacement option for your 360 degree  Complete 8000 series shaver</li>
            <li> The shaver dates to the early millennium</li>
            <li> Guess the idea is to make as much profit on the replacement as on the entire razor.</li>
            <li> My shaver is probably over 10 years old now.  </li>
            <li> Cost and the reviews always makes my ordering an item so much easier, knowing what others have to input on such item.</li>
            <li> I read many negative reviews but needed a replacement</li>
            <li> He now can shave without the pulling and using Amazon.com to find the product was much easier and cheaper than trying to find it in a local store.</li>
            <li> Comes with the complete foil and the complete cutter.</li>
            <li> My Braun razor is probably 6 years old.</li>
            <li> While cheaper than the stores&#x27; offerings, this product frequently pinches.</li>
            <li> The old ones get blunt in 12 - 18 months</li>
            <li> CAREGIVERS AND MYSELF HAD NO TROUBLE WITH IT, NOR</li>
            <li> This replacement pack was just the thing to completely rejuvenate my shaver.  </li>
            <li> This replacement pack was just the thing to completely rejuvenate my shaver.</li>
            <li> The order arrived early.  </li>
            <li> Old foil and cutter needed replacing</li>
            <li> The old one lasted about 12 years.</li>
            <li> Discipline, starts early, make time.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package, it looked as if the replacement part was far lower quality than the one I had.</li>
            <li> Please, someone, anyone, direct me to the Quality Cutters.</li>
            <li> The only place my husband can find these cutter heads at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> My old Foil &amp; Cutter Braun Series 5 was almost 3 years old.</li>
            <li> I had to retrieve my old cutter from the garbage</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get pulling with the old foil, now I get it with every shave and</li>
            <li> I received the Braun Series 5 foil and cutter in time frame promised but the product is completely unusable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and so I have to continue using the old one</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and low price.</li>
            <li> My years old electric cuts like a *dream* again.  </li>
            <li> This item is a direct replacement for my Series 5 shaver.  </li>
            <li> This completely solved that problem.</li>
            <li> The old one lasted like 4 years.</li>
            <li> After only the few months I could put up with is I saw reviews on here had gotten better and ventured another shot at a newer pack.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an extremely thick beard or anything, but these blades couldn&#x27;t cut through my whiskers without yanking many of them out.  </li>
            <li> I always find that the light comes on to replace the set a little bit earlier than needed, and a better method of figuring out when to replace it is to look at the actual foil itself and see if there are any holes or other issues going on there.  </li>
            <li> They were a little bit more reasonable than the other model number advertised.</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I expected; new foil and cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My original foil had a little piece break off</li>
            <li> I was originally planning on shaving with the 51S today and do the same next week and use the 30B next Sunday.</li>
            <li> Since the performance of the original foil and cutter diminished so slowly over time, the degree to which the performance of the razor had diminished was not fully appreciated until compared to the performance of the replacements.</li>
            <li> I also change the cleaning fluid and use that function frequently, it has kept my shave like new for 5 years now!</li>
            <li> Long story short, I finally realized that not only were my shaves becoming less and less comfortable, the razor itself was less effective at giving me a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It pulls on my facial hair sometimes and makes it a lot harder to get a clean, painless shave.</li>
            <li> After checking prices for replacements, I was somewhat surprised to find that replacement costs were almost double the cost of my older Syncro foils.</li>
            <li> I managed to get one of the few original activator/360 foil/cutter block.  </li>
            <li> WELL WORTH THE MONEY, EXTREMELY CLOSE SHAVE</li>
            <li> This set comes with the foil and the cutter and although this is something you might change once every 6 months or once a year... or just never, it is pricey for what it&#x27;s worth because it can get dull really quick especially if you use this every day.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s shaver was actually hurting him - replaced the baldes and it is like new again!  </li>
            <li> the razor is now essentially brand new again!</li>
            <li> As expected, but not quite the same quality as the original foil; replacement foils seems to have less dense whole spacing, but work reasonably well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and less expensive than locally.</li>
            <li> this foil does not compare to the quality of the same older foils.</li>
            <li> this is the second foil that i&#x27;ve bought for my older series 5 shaver.</li>
            <li> and i checked it out and the foil and cutter are the same as the older version that came with the shaver.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed the improvement in quality over my older, worn-down foil/cutter set, especially when I used it after letting the hair grow for a couple days.  </li>
            <li> I noticed the foil head had even-sized small holes throughout, whereas the last replacement I bought (~4 yrs ago) had more of a honeycomb look to the holes.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned after reading the very mixed reviews about using this 51s foil and cutter pack for my older series Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun for years without a problem, but this particular shaver seems to occasionally pull my hairs out.</li>
            <li> It is overall a decent entry level razor.</li>
            <li> The original foil I had was the OptiFoil with random honeycomb shaped holes, this new 51S has more symmetrical circle holes (look at the picture carefully by zooming on the packaging and you will see).</li>
            <li> The initial cost and replacement pack cost is too high for it&#x27;s usability.  </li>
            <li> It shaves me very comfortably &amp; gives me a very close shave even with a few days heavy growth.</li>
            <li> I used the new foil and blade replacement only 6 or 7 times and the foil developed a hole and scraped my face till it bleed.</li>
            <li> I have bought several of these blades for the new shaver and for the old Braun before it went DOA.</li>
            <li> Made my razor feel like new (especially since I had cracked the old foil cover and was using that way for months before buying this).</li>
            <li> It essentially turned my perhaps 9 years old 8585 shaver into a brand new one again.</li>
            <li> it arrived, I briefly compared the old and new.  </li>
            <li> I was starting to complain that the electric razor simply wasn&#x27;t capable of a smith and quick shave, but when my wife ordered the replacement head, I was shocked by how much faster and better the shave was.  </li>
            <li> Replacement long overdue, for fast shaving; I waited too long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> not sure if this makes a difference in fit or performance.  </li>
            <li> So now after another 4 years, I decided to replace the foil/cutter pack as it was taking too long and too much effort to get a satisfactory shave.</li>
            <li> I put the shaver into the cleaner and tried it again on the bare part of my arm just to see if that fixed the problem.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Reviewers, who are deciding to buy the 51S, or comparing 51S and 30B foils, should consult the more recent reviews, as those will pertain to the newer foils.l occasionally pull some hair, but if I shave everyday then</li>
            <li> Amazon was not the first place i expected to find these replacement parts</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Love this razor when it&#x27;s new, but it doesn&#x27;t take long for it to dull and make it feel like you&#x27;re plucking the hairs off your race, rather than shaving.</li>
            <li> The original blades has more space for facial hairs to enter the cutting area.  </li>
            <li> but this new foil didn&#x27;t even last 6 months</li>
            <li> its been 3 years since my last set of new blades.  </li>
            <li> but since I purchased this new cutter and head this is a different shaver.</li>
            <li> Same as new.  </li>
            <li> i proboably only used the new blades 5-6 times and today two pieces of it broke apart.</li>
            <li> Decided my face was chewed enough and opened a new cutter pack - surprise -</li>
            <li> but it was starting to not work like new, after replacing the foil and cutter</li>
            <li> I typically only have to buy these new blade replacements about once every 2 years.  </li>
            <li> Do this before you buy a new shaver, and save some money at the same time.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve starting shopping for a new razor.</li>
            <li> I received and installed the new replacement foil and cutter head, for the fourth time since I bought my Braun 8585.  </li>
            <li> With a very VERY simple replacement, my razor works as new.  </li>
            <li> Open package, but appeared to be new.  </li>
            <li> This replacement made my current braun shaver like new.</li>
            <li> After 18 months, this brought my Braun back to like new performance.  </li>
            <li> this gets 5 stars from me for essentially giving me a brand new razor.</li>
            <li> The new cutter simply does not cut.</li>
            <li> Finally I got the new foil.  </li>
            <li> Too big of a hassle to return and wait for a new one.</li>
            <li> New foil and cutter are definitely what I needed.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you enjoy the most painful shave in the morning to help wake you up.  </li>
            <li> I have the 360 complete model and wish the foil said that (like my old foil did) instead of \\&quot;Series 5\\&quot;; it&#x27;s not a big deal though.</li>
            <li> Made shaving with my Braun much nicer after replacing the cutter and the price beats the only local store I could find that stocks it.</li>
            <li> Apparently, I got the German version, because it fits and works fine in my Braun 8985 shaver and heavy beard.</li>
            <li> However, I have noticed as of late that they don&#x27;t even last 6 months any more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Activator 360 for nearly 5 years now and it seems that each time I need to replace the blade Braun has &#x27;conveniently&#x27; changed the design/packaging and most frustratingly the name of my foil/cutter.</li>
            <li> These are pretty expensive (most likely they are made of very durable metal that keeps their sharpness for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my son who is in the Marines, he needs to be completely shaved smooth and he claims that it does NOT shave like it says not close enough needs to use an older one he had to finish not good</li>
            <li> but no more than what i had with the original shaver</li>
            <li> This works very well and usually last me closer to 2 years since I don&#x27;t exactly have a heavy 5-O&#x27;Clock shadow.  </li>
            <li> and I bought one which was around $10 higher than the other.</li>
            <li> I am used to buying this and have no other option.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I only gave this replacement foil 2 stars is because the excruciating pain that I love so much, is only possible when I haven&#x27;t shaved for a few days.  </li>
            <li> Although they are more expensive than I would expect for such a simple product design it is worth the money since it saves my skin from irritation and I avoid the cost of the disposable razors that I would need to buy.  </li>
            <li> My razor wasn&#x27;t cutting very well, bought a new replacement and it did not cut much better</li>
            <li> Cuts more efficiently and slightly closer than previous versions.</li>
            <li> but they wrote back saying that they recommend only using the ones made for a particular model.</li>
            <li> no other options readily available, I ordered the 51S for my 8995 shaver (at least 5 years</li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews posted for the replacement foil/cutter, I decided to buy it in spite of everyone saying that the new design is not nearly as good as the original.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Regarding the many negative reviews of this Series 5 replacement, perhaps other sellers are selling factory seconds, or perhaps there&#x27;s some slight fit problems with the newer models of the 8900 series such as Activator and 360</li>
            <li> the many negative reviews of this Series 5 replacement, perhaps other sellers are selling factory seconds, or perhaps there&#x27;s some slight fit problems with the newer models of the 8900 series such as Activator and 360</li>
            <li> While the new foil and cutter is an upgrade from my old, severly worn down one, it&#x27;s not nearly as comfortable a shave as I recall getting from the original.</li>
            <li> After some searching I found that other users had purchased this blade/foil replacement and seen positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Generally I would get up to 1 year of year on this foil.</li>
            <li> If I shave everyday and don&#x27;t let my beard get too long, I get that unsatisfying comfortable, \\&quot;pain-free\\&quot; and close shave</li>
            <li> Just really don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the ones as I buy in the store.  </li>
            <li> I wouldnt hesitate to purchase again in the near future..</li>
            <li> The problem appears to be that this is actually the replacement foil and cutter block for the Braun 360 complete series shavers, specifically the 89</li>
            <li> If I skip shaving one day then on the next shave this cutter block will occasionally pull some hair, but if I shave everyday then the shave is pain free and close.</li>
            <li> I have used my current razor for nearly seven years and have never had problems with the operation.  </li>
            <li> It appears, at least to me, to work and shave pretty much exactly the same, as well as look the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I could barely feel anything.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and close and there is no need to go back over the same place ten times.</li>
            <li> Apparently Braun was bought out by Gillette in 2005.  </li>
            <li> Using it softly wasn&#x27;t enough anymore</li>
            <li> This foil has apparently been replaced by the \\&quot;opti\\&quot; foil (garbage).</li>
            <li> Quality at Braun has apparently gone to pot.</li>
            <li> B001VEK1IU Braun Series 5 Combi 51S Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 8000 360 Complete or Activator)]]</li>
            <li> My old foil used to pull the occasional hair, but this one has not as of yet.  </li>
            <li> This product is really just as I expected...</li>
            <li> and it brings the old razor back to life.</li>
            <li> My Braun 8585 shaver finally gave up completely after 7/8 years.</li>
            <li> The originals lasted much longer than expected</li>
            <li> What finally inspired me was a hole developed in the foil</li>
            <li> A number of the critical reviewers commented that the products that they purchased were marked as \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Braun Series 5 Combi 51S Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 8000 360 Complete or Activator)]]</li>
            <li> I had used my old foil for years, finally replacing it when it started to fall apart and cut me.</li>
            <li> Brought my old electric shaver Serie 5 back to life and my is skin no longer showing signs of a worn out screen.</li>
            <li> we had no trouble installing it since it came in a different container.  </li>
            <li> So far has totally met my expectations ...</li>
            <li> There were some mixed reviews, but I replaced the old blade and this one cuts like butter.  </li>
            <li> In fact, the last one I ordered was on September 26th, and by the end of of October it started to feel like an old blade.  </li>
            <li> The old Foil and Cutter were definitely worn out.  </li>
            <li> Given all the negative reviews, I was pleasantly surprised that it works well; does not pinch/pull my hairs, even after not shaving for two full days.</li>
            <li> This is especially true once they went to the Gillette-made cutter (with the beveled cutting surfaces).</li>
            <li> I have a light beard, not too thick.  </li>
            <li> I had replaced my shaver heads every 18 months like the manufacturer said, but I got behind on this latest replacement.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the product has changed since the poor reviews were written or if the 5000 series is \\&quot;more compatible.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> read on a few blogs that people had success using a \\&quot;30B; series 3\\&quot; replacement meant for a 4000/7000 series.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t read into it as being better or worse.  </li>
            <li> razors are unnecessarily expensive, so it is nice to get them at a lower price.</li>
            <li> Unlike the original \\&quot;Activator\\&quot; branded foil that came with my razor, this one locates the long hairs and grabs on to them tightly.  </li>
            <li> It has given me a close, comfortable shave so far and has cut down my shaving time by 30 seconds/shave, on average.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars because I was able to get it cleaned up and back to working how it should, but having this black stuff coming out of the head or the cutter is not right.  </li>
            <li> Had gone way past the recommended time of use on my old one so decided to buy this rather than a whole new shaver.  </li>
            <li> My previous razor was leaving large tracts of facial skin untouched and, when my wife of fifty years of marriage, informed me of the fact, I knew that it was time for a new razor.</li>
            <li> The new foil and cutter actually feels like it trimmed my facial hairs and made my face smoother</li>
            <li> I only wish that I hadn&#x27;t bought I years supply of the cleaner because now that will be a total loss as I now plan to look for a new razor (not a Braun).</li>
            <li> I can only tell the difference because I bought a new 590 series shaver I bought 1 year ago about the same time as I bought the replacement 51s foil.  </li>
            <li> My husband has had this shaver for several years, and if you regularly change the foil and cutter, it works like new.  </li>
            <li> The shave is much closer than it ever was previously, and by far the closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten from any electric razor.</li>
            <li> , I bought a new Panasonic high speed shaver for less than $100.  </li>
            <li> I have had my razor for a long time, and this product makes it perform like new again.</li>
            <li> you shouldn&#x27;t wait so long to replace.&lt;br /&gt;Big difference,razor like new again.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Bob</li>
            <li> In addition, shaves are taking significantly longer than before (Almost 6 minutes today!), are uncomfortable and are not nearly as close as when I first bought this.</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered and half the price here in australia.</li>
            <li> I did notice a slight tendency of the blades to &#x27;grab&#x27; when I first started using it</li>
            <li> Usually, the cutters remain sharp for 6 months or more.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting hard to find the original style foil with the multi-shaped holes.</li>
            <li> Now the big negative that many others have commented on: Upon changing the foil, I noticed immediately that the pattern/design of the foil was NOT the same as the one that came standard with my Series 5 unit.</li>
            <li> I should have gone straight to Amazon.com instead of wasting time looking for it on other websites.</li>
            <li> Very confusing seeing a different foil design and heads/blades for most electric razors are over-priced and these are no exception.</li>
            <li> Perhaps Braun had a good idea with their cutter redesign but then had some bad early production runs.  </li>
            <li> This cost just about the same as an 8 pack of razors and doesn&#x27;t nearly give you a close enough shave as a razor.</li>
            <li> Everything I&#x27;ve read on the newer shavers from Braun seems to indicate that there has been no real advancement in the shaver over my nearly decade old Braun.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as expected and much cheaper than big box</li>
            <li> The foil is a more complex (usable) pattern and the center</li>
            <li> The improvement in shaving results only lasts a couple of weeks - then it&#x27;s about the same as 6 month old blades.</li>
            <li> My razor is an older model,so it&#x27;s harder to find replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> price is little bit higher</li>
            <li> Personally I would shave with no other electric razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the new foil for 6 weeks or so and cant yet speak of how long it will shave close</li>
            <li> I have flat, soft facial hair as opposed to</li>
            <li> I will keep my old razor till it wears out as long as you carry the replacements.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I wanted within a few days.  </li>
            <li> Makes my razor shave like new, the quality is as expected from a BRAUN product.</li>
            <li> I would give it a 5-star rating for quality, but have to knock off 1 star due to the high price of these replacement blades.  </li>
            <li> It is much smoother than the previous version.  </li>
            <li> It makes every shave much smoother and less intrusive.  </li>
            <li> Not better, not worse than my 4+ year old</li>
            <li> wish I could recommend a different replacement set for this, but apparently this is the only one.  </li>
            <li> Mine is several years old, but still works well, so long as I follow the recommendations and replace this part regularly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it was a huge waste of money, because it was more expensive than the other replacements I bought.  </li>
            <li> I usually use this to shave with first and then use a conventional razor and shaving cream to get a REALLY close shave.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews, that this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; setup was going to start yanking my beard hairs out or something, but after using it, I can&#x27;t detect a discernable difference from my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; ones, which were working just fine aside from a little hole in the foil.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I waited to long to replace my last blade.you should replace at least every 12 to 18 months it does make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> , I am tossing the whole mess out and going with another electric razor company, haven&#x27;t decided which, yet.  </li>
            <li> My ten plus year old razor shaves like new after this little tune up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, short of ditching your $100 shaver and buying a new one, there&#x27;s really no choice.  </li>
            <li> The new screen does not fit my razor, and after several tries of installing, I just reused the old one on the new cutter.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to wait until the shaver starts pulling and missing, but can change to the new one while the old is still functioning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tempted to try and find one of the old Activator cutter/foil packs because this combi cutter/foil doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> For some reason, it seems so much better than the previous replacement, which I was not very happy with.  </li>
            <li> The foil design is significantly different and although everything snapped in place the way it should, the foil appears to set down in the razor just a little bit deeper than the original.  </li>
            <li> what is there to say other than it is the replacement part for the Braun shaver, that it arrived in new condition and it works.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how dull the old cutter was until it started pinching in spots and wouldn&#x27;t cut very close.</li>
            <li> The new 51S foil has a very different foil pattern and the embossed blue center power comb has been changed to a flat silver colored power comb.</li>
            <li> The new 51S foil has a very different foil pattern and the embossed blue center power comb has been changed to a flat silver colored power comb.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve broken the foil, consider buying a new brand of razor as the new Braun line all seem to use the new style of head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only is the new replacement pack more expensive than the previous model, the quality has gone straight down the tubes.</li>
            <li> , the blades on the 51S cutting block are much wider than the Activator block from my 8585, but I didn&#x27;t think it would be a huge deal.</li>
            <li> must have left my previous one on too long (difficult to remember when you last replaced it) because shaving now is so much smoother and with a better result than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was worried , based on the other negative reviews I read, but it&#x27;s fine for the Series 5.</li>
            <li> I recently replaced the foil and cutter for my Activator shaver, and the new foil design (with the blue grille) is much worse than the old foil (with the silver grille), as the new foil irritates my skin to the point where I can longer use the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even tried out alternative blades from the 3-Series razor which actually worked better for a time, but they dulled very quickly due to the much thinner blades in the cutting block.  </li>
            <li> But I find the part on the back(Trimmer) is so weak now, the machine is pretty old though</li>
            <li> The only noticeable difference was my middle (long hair) cutter was blue and this one is the same silver.  </li>
            <li> Like a lot of things packaged these days this was a little hard to open but nothing that a pair of scissors couldn&#x27;t handle easily.</li>
            <li> The old foil and cutter had somewhat corroded over time due to age and a bit of citric acid being in the cleaning solution (lemon scent).  </li>
            <li> I guess my Braun razor is going to last forever -- and now that I&#x27;m shaving some days with a regular razor blade, it may last twice as long as ME.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical buying this online as my shaver is older and was not sure it would fit or work right.  </li>
            <li> After two years he was thinking of buying a new shaver, but with this replacement pack it seems like he has one for much less money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much less than purchasing a new razor</li>
            <li> coarse, round stubble and the new foil loves to rip my hair out on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> When companies start making stupid moves (why ruin something that worked perfectly in the past), it&#x27;s time to ditch them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I only used it when I needed a fast shave or was too lazy to shave with shaving cream</li>
            <li> First, I have to confess, I think I&#x27;ve used the same foil and cutter for at least 4 years...seriously.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the same exact blade I&#x27;ve been using for at least 3 years.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to an older one you don&#x27;t realize what you are missing.</li>
            <li> Still a little bummed about the shavers operation prior to the new heads.</li>
            <li> The new replacement blades are the) &#x27;gillette&#x27; blade cutter block, which is not nearly as effective as the older style Braun cutter blocks (the gillette type has wide blades with narrower gaps between them, leading to skipped hairs and requiring multiple passes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This became noticeably dull after less than 20 shaves, and the &amp;#34;Replace&amp;#34; light went on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> High-volume retailers, such as Amazon, may have already cleared out most of the old, less-good, products but it wouldn&#x27;t be a bad idea to check before you open.</li>
            <li> These heads are getting harder and harder to find this restored my shaver and saved me a the price of a new shaver.</li>
            <li> jury still out - the last time we bought this single it only lasted 5 months</li>
            <li> I read several reviews, some positive and some negative.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used in the past produced so much skin irritation, ingrown hairs, and tugging/snagging while I shaved that I gave up on them.  </li>
            <li> Next time, I won&#x27;t wait so long to replace the parts.</li>
            <li> However, depending on how long you shave each day, this will NOT typically last 18 months . . .</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll probably get another ten years out of the shaver as long as I can keep replacing the foil and cutter.</li>
            <li> Time will tell if it will last as long as the discontinued Series 8.</li>
            <li> Tried off-brand replacement products which did not measure up to the quality (or last as long) as Braun&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> The Braun shaver head kit has become harder and harder to find in stores near me, so when I found it on Amazon with the opportunity to subscribe, I did so without a second thought.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really rate it other than average so not bad or not great.</li>
            <li> , IS BLACK NOT SILVER (BIG DEAL), AND AS SOMEONE REPORTED THE PLASTIC PROTECTIVE COVER DOES NOT FIT EXACTLY, BUT WILL STILL WORK, JUST DOES NOT SNAP IN PLACE.</li>
            <li> I used the original well beyond the recommended life span ( the &amp;#34;replace foil/cutter&amp;#34; LED came on at least half a year ago)</li>
            <li> people have stated that the new foil is at fault for the horrendous shave while I&#x27;ve firmly believed that it is the cutter block at fault.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the new Series 5 Combi 51S Foil/Cutter for a few weeks now and have no complaints.  </li>
            <li> This time the new cutter assembly did not fit my razor and there was no instructions concerning it.</li>
            <li> However, the shaving foils don&#x27;t seem to last very long.  </li>
            <li> Foil did not last very long, about 3 months, had to replace again with another vendor.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t understand how this can be sold as the same foil as the one I received with my Series 5 shaver when it very clearly is not.</li>
            <li> It is identical to the one you previously had except that 360 complete is not written on</li>
            <li> I finally called Braun and confirmed that this is the wrong replacement for the</li>
            <li> I was nervous to buy this replacement with all the negative reviews out there, but i had no problem - smooth shave, had a few nicks</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, I have had it less than a month, and one of the foils has already developed holes in it.</li>
            <li> The only difference is the words &#x27;360 complete&#x27; are missing.  </li>
            <li> (I used my old foil until it too broke a few days later.)</li>
            <li> I have replaced my screen and cutters twice now, and both screens developed holes after only a few weeks use.</li>
            <li> Therefore I will say the obvious, these replacement parts for my electric razor are German and they do what I expected them to do: they work.</li>
            <li> And generally I could hardly tell the diference with the new combo.</li>
            <li> After reviewing some negative and positive reviews, I ordered and tried the replacement pack.</li>
            <li> The original 590 foil that I use now that is now over a year old gives me a much smoother and gives me a less painful shave than the replacement foil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yesterday, one of the retaining clips beside the middle cutter came loose and struck me in the cheek.  </li>
            <li> Using it daily you don&#x27;t notice just how bad it needs a new set until it gets changed,then you&#x27;ll notice a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I originally thought they sent me a fake one especially after I started using it since it hurt to use around my lower jaw area and chin.</li>
            <li> I also have a tendency to get a few ingrown hairs which I previously had to pluck out as the old foil didn&#x27;t lift them, but so far, this foil has lifted and cut them off.  </li>
            <li> Been needing a new blade and screen for a while - shaves were starting to become random with too many whiskers needing multiple passes at the very least.  </li>
            <li> It does shave close and a little smoother then my old cutter and foil that is now worn out.</li>
            <li> Ordering on line through Amazon makes it so much easier when it is hard getting out to see what stores might carry this replacement item.  </li>
            <li> The pricing is a little expensive for my tastes, but since they aren&#x27;t generic replacement parts, Braun can pretty much charge what they want for them.</li>
            <li> I was very concerned by the amount of negative reviews regarding this replacement part for my Braun razor.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades surface has more guide plate area than cutting holes.  </li>
            <li> Do you get how much that sucks?</li>
            <li> wrong thing ,doesnt fit, returned</li>
            <li> Way too long to wait.  </li>
            <li> If someone can recall the Braun 360 was a minor upgrade to the Braun Activator line of shavers.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I waited a long time to replace my foil and cutter</li>
            <li> I have had it for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time (4 or 5 shaves).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to replace the blades in my Braun razor.</li>
            <li> As long as the razor works well, I will probably reorder blades etc.</li>
            <li> but both these are extremely minor).</li>
            <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t wait as long as I did to buy a replacement.</li>
            <li> I purchased this instead of the normal model number I usually use as it said it works for my shaver (8000 series).</li>
            <li> I have had my Braun razor so long they no longer produce this model, buy my model number converted to the newer model.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to see how long this works.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product, I do not remember it saying anything about a LONG delivery time.  </li>
            <li> One of the smartest buys I&#x27;ve made in a long, long time.</li>
            <li> How did I let this go for so long.  </li>
            <li> i waited way too long to replace these items, i just got accustomed to how it was performing.</li>
            <li> but if I get the same service from it, it&#x27;s $ well spent.</li>
            <li> and my shaves took 3x as long.  </li>
            <li> Replacing the comb and blade made me realize I&#x27;d waited too long to do it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased my Braun razor about 11 years ago and it has worked wonderfully as long as I buy one of these each year</li>
            <li> Not anymore - this one takes a long time, misses lots of stubble on each pass, and as a result of having to go over and over, skin irritation occurs.</li>
            <li> But in this case, I think I had waited too long to replace my foil and cutter on my Braun Series 5 electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had waited too long to do this (over 2 years) and now wish that I would&#x27;ve done so a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for a long time and always buy my replacment head on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I think I waited too long before I changed</li>
            <li> make the mistake I did and wait to long on replacing these.</li>
            <li> I will not wait as long again.</li>
            <li> I was simply pushing so hard by habit that I was getting hair pulled out by the new model.</li>
            <li> would have given 5 stars - only downfall is that the product is not properly cleaned after manufacture/testing? - some black residue is left on my face after a wet shave.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that it took too long to deliver from South Korea to New York.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good while it lasts but these things go bad in a about a yr. and a half.</li>
            <li> The only down side to the cheaper foil is that it&#x27;s black and the protective clear foil cover doesn&#x27;t lock on to this foil as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Less than ten shaves later</li>
            <li> In any case, as usual after replacing this stuff it shaves like new.  </li>
            <li> Replaced all the past on my Braun series 5 shaver today with the new parts.  </li>
            <li> Mine has no LCD display on it, just the plain Braun 8985 from, if memory serves correctly, the early 2000s...</li>
            <li> This item does a fine job of cutting beards, is fairly quiet, and is built well.  </li>
            <li> The 30B seems to wear out faster than the 51B, likely due to my longer run time to get a close shave compared to the 51S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more nicks from the old cutter!</li>
            <li> I believe that&#x27;s due to the different shaped holes in the grating of the replacement foil.  </li>
            <li> The other low reviews on this product show that I didn&#x27;t just get</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on the reccommendations posted by other reviewers, I went ahead with the Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 4700,7000), and it works as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks everyone for pointing it out.</li>
            <li> I used this razor daily for five years and the blade remained sharp to the end</li>
            <li> have an 8985 which seems to be different than the other 8XXX series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a fool to wait so long!  </li>
            <li> Given that the series 5 is a bit older, it&#x27;s hard to find these parts in the store anymore.  </li>
            <li> While I appreciate that, I am still shocked that they weren&#x27;t aware of the issue and aren&#x27;t interested in pursuing it.  </li>
            <li> After I learned the trick to clean the blade through running water instead of brushing it, it is difficult for me imagine when I will buy another replacement.</li>
            <li> After reading many negative reviews of how this upgraded foil/cutter was worse than before I was nervous ordering it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how these blades hold up over the next few months.der a different razor yet.  </li>
            <li> Since I usually dont dispose of the old foils &amp; cutters, I checked the packaging for my last two replacements for the Syncro &amp; Found that one was a 7000 &amp; the other was a 30B.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m treated to a sharp, fast, close cut with minimal skin irritation on my neck where I usually get ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t get through a single shave without having a hair pulled out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That is not a good idea but who wants to spend money on this.</li>
            <li> Price was average for the same product at the time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll last, with an average beard, about 5-6mths.</li>
            <li> My shaver foil developed a small hole--</li>
            <li> The first one was sent to me, package opened, item used and broken.</li>
            <li> Although it is expensive, a new cutter and foil make the razor seem like new.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull the blades where untill I shaved with the new foil and cutter installed.</li>
            <li> Seriously this razor is about ten years old.</li>
            <li> finally broke down and ordered this combi cutter/foil replacement</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is that recently I find a version of this blade that is not even sharp!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with the high prices for anything that the product needs to run properly.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this foil - I wish I had spent the extra money for the previous model!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really annoying as i obviously can&#x27;t get the full benefit from the purchase, so check your particular model carefully!</li>
            <li> I read a lot of bad reviews on this, but decided to try anyway since it seemed pretty straight forward.  </li>
            <li> (I paid less than $30 last time).</li>
            <li> It cuts closer than previous styles, sometimes close enough to nick me.  </li>
            <li> and it was ten dollars less than anywhere I had priced it.</li>
            <li> I have owned a Braun shaver for years and have previously replaced thebroil and cutters by simply ordering from Braun.</li>
            <li> What was taking 5-6 minutes is now back to 2-3 and with substantially less aggravation to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> If I had shaved half my face with the 51S, I probably would have landed up with half my face red and with several cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just like what you&#x27;d buy at Target only half the price.  </li>
            <li> but it last less than 5 months.  </li>
            <li> I do not have to go over the same areas multiple times as I did in the past as my blades got old.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how a product made in Germany can be bought for less in an Asian country.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is happening to the quality of these Braun replacement cutters and screens, but the last two that I have bought have lasted about 6 weeks before the screen starts to rip open in the corner.</li>
            <li> no more multiple multiple passes to get that close</li>
            <li> Previous reviews have noted that units manufactured in Japan did not meet the German standards, however, my foil and cutter replacement for my Braun shaver shaves close and without pull.  </li>
            <li> Well, I don&#x27;t know if it doesn&#x27;t work well with my shaver, or it&#x27;s not very good, or my shaver&#x27;s getting old, but it didn&#x27;t improve the shaving in the slightest.</li>
            <li> In the past, buying a new cutter block never really helped much, and so I only bought the combination when the foil failed.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with this new foil and cutter, but what are you going to do about it.</li>
            <li> I instead of the 14 months one had lasted previously - blades were dull way too fast</li>
            <li> Like others, I noticed that it is not the same as the original, so based on other reviews, I also picked up the 30b foil and cutting block.</li>
            <li> According to Braun, the newer cutter block and foil were better at cutting than the previous Activator series cutter block.</li>
            <li> If you have more than a half day growth, it passes over whiskers without cutting, you pull and stretch your skin, and still it doesn&#x27;t get them.</li>
            <li> On the first use of the new cutter and foil the cutter created a small hole in the foil rendering it useless for any additional shaves.</li>
            <li> For the the 18 month life is only a dream because I not only shave my face but my head everyday, so I find the efficiency of the razor drops dramatically after the first month, then continues to slowly decline to where shaving is too slow to justify using the razor any longer (about 9-10 months).  </li>
            <li> The old head had lost it&#x27;s effectiveness little by little.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to keep going over and over the same spot to catch all the little stragglers.  </li>
            <li> agree with other reviewers though, not sure it&#x27;s gonna last the 18 months like the last one I bought.</li>
            <li> They last a little longer than 6 months.  </li>
            <li> , the old worn out versions don&#x27;t cut well and you have to push hard.  </li>
            <li> then the 2 yr old dull one it replaces.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my old foil and cutter was.</li>
            <li> These are often hard to find at stores and often more expensive than the Amazon price.</li>
            <li> &#x27; I thought, &#x27;Maybe this will be a bad thing like so many others have said&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My Braun&#x27;s at least 4 yrs old.</li>
            <li> Now the center cutter has moved upward level with the foil as there is nothing to keep it in place.  </li>
            <li> I spent over $30 at Target for this P-O-S.</li>
            <li> Received as expected.</li>
            <li> It was getting harder and harder to find them</li>
            <li> At approximately $25, the one I purchased was quite reasonable.</li>
            <li> I am curious how well these parts will maintain their performance.</li>
            <li> I read a few different reviews of this product.</li>
            <li> These last 6-8 months for an everyday shaver.</li>
            <li> I replace my foil and cutter when the foil starts to tear, roughly after a year or so.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected from Braun</li>
            <li> THey should make it known UP FRONT on the listing that delivery will be longer than normally expected.  </li>
            <li> there really is no substitude around</li>
            <li> Has not lost its performance, even with minimal cleaning.</li>
            <li> then I would expect that it works as expected..</li>
            <li> The item was as I expected.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how these blades hold up over the next few months.</li>
            <li> There is really no choice&#x27;s in this area of shaving..</li>
            <li> My current Braun did not shave as close after a few years.</li>
            <li> I just spent 15 minutes</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no break-in period.</li>
            <li> Delivered and performed as expected</li>
            <li> Product came as expected and in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> It was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ask me why but after a while you&#x27;re tired of listening to the whole process.</li>
            <li> does the job as expected</li>
            <li> The product received was as expected.</li>
            <li> Received on time and works as expected</li>
            <li> After 2 uses the center piece on the foil broke and sticks up on one end.</li>
            <li> Arrived as scheduled, no issues in receiving it &amp; is what we expected.</li>
            <li> The cover foil was fragile and torn after a few usages.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about it -</li>
            <li> Replacement kit works as expected</li>
            <li> the razor cutter arrived faster than expected and is working well</li>
            <li> But for me any &#x27;pulling&#x27; is minimal and I do not notice it anymore.  </li>
            <li> It came sooner then expected</li>
            <li> Was as exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no irritation.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money and time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often write reviews, but I had read some poor reports on this product and wanted to set the record straight.</li>
            <li> Works as designed and expected.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected and cheaper here than in retail stores.</li>
            <li> foil broke after minimal use</li>
            <li> The only way to avoid it is to move as slow as possible across your face.  </li>
            <li> But I have thick, coarse facial hair.</li>
            <li> These replacements are considerably lower quality than what comes with the razor, but seem to be the only game in town.</li>
            <li> The slow decline of my old foil and cutter had me convinced that it was time to through the Braun away.  </li>
            <li> The replacements appear to work fine but time and useage will determine if they hold up and last as advertised or fall apart as badly as some of their other products .</li>
            <li> My last \\&quot;proper\\&quot; Activator kit in my 8585 was getting long in the tooth at nearly two years, and I&#x27;ve been putting off replacing it because of the bad reviews I&#x27;ve been reading on this new pack.</li>
            <li> The larger hexagon shaped holes in the 51s seem to allow a little &amp;#34;wiggle&#x27; in the hair shaft as the block is cutting it, thereby creating a tugging/pulling force on the hair rather than cleanly shearing it.</li>
            <li> This replacement is obviously some sort of fake -- it doesn&#x27;t cut well, not anywhere close to the original, and is no better than the worn down foil I replaced.  </li>
            <li> It was turning my face grey or black.  </li>
            <li> These Braun shaver foils are a license to print money,  almost $60 at my local drug store,  I paid less than half that on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Works as expected.</li>
            <li> The original foil and cutter had a tendency to snag hairs while cutting.  </li>
            <li> Close shave and absolutely no hair-pulling as described in other reviews.</li>
            <li> I was not able to push it back in place and the other retaining bar also came loose and had to be removed.  </li>
            <li> I got my Braun razor for Christmas a couple of years ago because my then current $40 Walmart special was pulling and snagging, which can be quite painful.  </li>
            <li> I bought the 51S less than 1 year ago and the foil has come loose from the center support.</li>
            <li> I hope that in about a year and a half I&#x27;ll remember to not wait so long to get a replacement!</li>
            <li> I had dutifully replaced my cutter/foil on my Braun Activator several times in the past and noticed no real difference</li>
            <li> took intirely too long too get once ordered, thats my only complaint item preforms well</li>
            <li> First time last no longer than 1 month(start cracking and cutting my skin).</li>
            <li> The shave pulls much less, and is much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can argue it&#x27;s a bit unfortunate that the Braun cutter blocks don&#x27;t last longer.</li>
            <li> I had gone a little long (2 years) to replace the foil and cutter.  </li>
            <li> However, the replacement pack doesn&#x27;t last very long before it starts to get dull.  </li>
            <li> Not quite the same quality as the original, but cuts my disgusting face admirably, and cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> Careful not to cut yourself!</li>
            <li> It is the same product as in the past</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t review a lot of products, however, I felt I needed to this time for other 8585 users.</li>
            <li> , if there&#x27;s any other 8585 users out there wondering if this is the replacement you need, the answer is</li>
            <li> Not exactly the quality I expect from Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only gripe is the cost, $30+ for these replacments seems excessive.</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, was almost tempted to buy the series 3 foil and cutter (head) but resisted and purchased this for my 8585.</li>
            <li> I wish they would stay sharp longer.</li>
            <li> And although they may have come from the stock room,the cutter(s)were as sharp as a blade can get, with no irregularities(nicks, shavings of metal, etc.</li>
            <li> It is cheaper than any other shaving system.</li>
            <li> I did order from the 8000 series page but received a package that looked different from what I had received in the past.</li>
            <li> It made his razor like new-so sharp that he wasn&#x27;t used to it in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> Was difficult to identify the one for my exact shaver</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is my actual electric razor itself or replacing these Foil &amp; Cutters (which did improve my shaving).</li>
            <li> Other reviewers will tell you the correct replacement.</li>
            <li> wont bore with other sahving details.  </li>
            <li> wont bore with other sahving details.  </li>
            <li> Hi dollars for such a small part...</li>
            <li> so it stays sharp.</li>
            <li> Been using Braun for 20 years, wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same Braun series 5 raisor for the past couple years.</li>
            <li> The blade looks identical, the foil is lacking the \\&quot;360\\&quot; logo as noted in other reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if they still have the Chinese version out there,</li>
            <li> I would have none other.</li>
            <li> and it cleans the shaver well, and seems to help keep it sharp.</li>
            <li> I have too much other stuff to think about.  </li>
            <li> With the Series 5 blades they give you a &#x27;close shave&#x27; - what other brands attempt to do.  </li>
            <li> Never had this problem with other units.  </li>
            <li> This item was a replacement part for one that was in the shaver and had worn out due to use.</li>
            <li> If you have a sharp blade, the razor works like a champ.</li>
            <li> I used to do every other day, i tried every day as well, nothing helps.</li>
            <li> This product is so unbelievable because it instantly eases any abrasive shaving.</li>
            <li> I wil purchase other products.</li>
            <li> Both times, the 51S foil developed large holes in the mesh that made it painful to shave.  </li>
            <li> It really made it quite clear how bad my other cutter had become.  </li>
            <li> Yes, this new cutter and foil is worse than my 2-year-old cutter and foil.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see why exactly giving it a visual examination but something is very wrong.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy thick, beard and sensitive neck skin</li>
            <li> The work as expected and cost less than in any department store.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, the replacement pack I got was an imitation product instead of something that is manufactured in the US.  </li>
            <li> Thin, short, white peach fuzz and this cutter can&#x27;t even handle it.</li>
            <li> Braun Series 5 does a very poor job of getting close and being consistent with shaving hair.</li>
            <li> If I skipped a day shaving I paid the price the next time I shaved - a very painful shave with many pulls.  </li>
            <li> The product is the same as always but the price was less then I usually pay.</li>
            <li> but I did compare prices with WalMart, and a few other stores that just didn&#x27;t have it on the shelf but an empty area for it</li>
            <li> Product is great, packaging is terrible, very hard to open and process.</li>
            <li> Even worse though, after three or four shaves, this morning two long, sharp, metal bars flew out of the flat area between the foils - one hitting my eye and the other gouging my cheek.  </li>
            <li> With the last replacement foil 51s bought just a couple of weeks ago, it doesn&#x27;t hardly cut at all.  </li>
            <li> However, when you put a new cutter in, the difference is dramatic.</li>
            <li> In the past there were many bad reviews for Braun replacement cutters.  </li>
            <li> When I saw all of the negative reviews here, I simply didn&#x27;t believe them.</li>
            <li> lack of quality in the genuine Braun replacement part (not cheap!) is extremely disappointing.  </li>
            <li> the shave has definitely been deteriorating lately.  </li>
            <li> I have bought several of these cutters over the past few years.</li>
            <li> They DID try to cheapen the blades on this razor like I said, but obviously gave in to pressure when people complained.</li>
            <li> This is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I hope it will last at least a year, the manufacturer recommends changing it every 18 months.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the price.</li>
            <li> and my shaver will last at least another two years.</li>
            <li> I use my shaver everyday, recent head replacements including this one seem to wear out quicker than in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fun to have hair being ripped out of your cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what I will do now, it seems my Braun shaver has become useless if I can&#x27;t find reasonable replacement foil and cutter.</li>
            <li> If you have thick facial hair you may want to consider another replacement.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have a thick beard and it was a struggle several times through&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The foil finally ripped and forced me to look for the replacement.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it in use for a few months now and absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> I shaved half my face with a razor and the other half with my braun and my wife could not tell which side was which.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just cynical enough to believe that Braun made a crappy replacement so that people would buy new razors.</li>
            <li> I have to go hunt one down now.</li>
            <li> I wrote the date down on a sticker that I put on the docking station for the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Went down hill from there.</li>
            <li> that was so well balanced, that the noise level of my razor went down quite a bit.</li>
            <li> but the quality did slowly go down.  </li>
            <li> I dropped down to the 300</li>
            <li> Still usable, but have to push down every time I use it.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t cut down to my face and what it did cut, would hurt me.</li>
            <li> I think Braun has it down.  </li>
            <li> This item is of Extremely Inferior Quality!</li>
            <li> was purchasing through a third party retailer via Amazon, but after processing my order and taking my payment they had no more in stock!</li>
            <li> Opening the bubble pack packaging was the hardest part and required a sharp knife!</li>
            <li> As at least one other reviewer has mentioned, earlier shipments seem or have been from elsewhere, but mine, which arrived a few days ago, was stamped with Angela Merkel&#x27;s seal of approval.  </li>
            <li> and now I can shave in half the time it took me before.  </li>
            <li> It is black</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these for the Braun 8985 shaver (to save on shipping) and it seems like a nicer blade than the previous one I had.</li>
            <li> I can unequivocally verify that Braun is not exaggerating when they claim the cutter blocks wear out after a year and a half.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You probably think your razor hasn&#x27;t deteriorated over the year and a half, but it has.</li>
            <li> It looks just like the previous cutter and is made in Germany.  </li>
            <li> I had not replaced the cutter and screen for over a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> But I decided to shave half with the 51S and half with the 30B.</li>
            <li> This is an update to my previous one-star review.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they only seem to last for a year but less than a two years.</li>
            <li> Though my previous one I noticed had a cut in the foil itself</li>
            <li> I have a thick heavy beard, similar to Homer Simpson</li>
            <li> This costs about half of what I was paying at a somewhat nearby shaver shop.</li>
            <li> the I had previously bought online elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I find that there is less irritation as well.</li>
            <li> So, the part is ruined in less than 12 months despite a recommended 18 month service life.</li>
            <li> In what I can only assume was a cost-cutting measure, I was soon unable to find those thinner-bladed 3-Series replacement blocks and stopped buying blades entirely for close to two</li>
            <li> I had been asked to rate the ease of getting the part out of the package it would have gotten less than one star</li>
            <li> This replacement cutter/foil now costs less than it did when I purchased it in 2013.</li>
            <li> Door to door service for less the cost.</li>
            <li> Still waiting, it is a lot less than 18 months when I changed these previously.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item on here to replace previous cutter.  </li>
            <li> In reading the scathing reviews, though, I did notice that many/most of them were from 2010 or early 2011; I noticed that some recent reviewers were not experiencing the problems that others were reporting.  </li>
            <li> I can shave in half the time now.</li>
            <li> it will wear out in less than a year.  </li>
            <li> It had been less than a year.</li>
            <li> But it cut my shaving time in half from what it used to take with my worn out foil.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s closer than the previous Activator foil/cutter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Braun series five doesn&#x27;t cut as close as the previous model;&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Spend way less on this than I did buying premium disposable razors</li>
            <li> When shaving, I started seeing like a black soot or dust or something from the shaver on my face.  </li>
            <li> the foil makes it easier for me to shave with less passes.</li>
            <li> less than one month start cracking and pulling the metal part.</li>
            <li> The previous foil on the razor had a tear in it.  </li>
            <li> and i get a shave closer than a wet blade in very little</li>
            <li> I put off replacing the screen and blades on my Braun 360 for as long as I could because of the negative reviews I had read.</li>
            <li> Looks like the geniuses at Gillete managed to mess that up as well.</li>
            <li> I just wish the manufacturer would concentrate a little less on obsolescence.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about getting this at first because of all the negative reviews, but it turns out those are all from people who have the Activator.  </li>
            <li> I wasted half my money.</li>
            <li> My previous razor head was no longer laying waste to the weekend</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that the price had gone up so much since my earlier purchase from you was $21.99</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rated 1 star due to the rediculous amount of pulled hairs - usually five plus per shave.</li>
            <li> I, on the other hand am too lazy for that.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks now, and when I don&#x27;t shave on the weekends my hair grows out a little.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous that it shows \\&quot;Series 5\\</li>
            <li> Since my husbands shaver is a 8000 series I was a little hesitant to purchase this replacement.</li>
            <li> Stray hairs mocked me and stuck out like a bunch of little hairs giving me the finger in the mirror.</li>
            <li> I noticed little difference in performance.</li>
            <li> This can lead to a little confusion, so hopefully this helps identify the razor these work with.</li>
            <li> Then when I shave Monday morning I have to move very slowly to reduce the pulling of facial hair.</li>
            <li> ordered a 30B cutting block and foil (for the series 7000 synchro models), which has the older, skinny blades design and bingo!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking about just getting a whole kit because this just isn&#x27;t cutting it (no pun intended).</li>
            <li> So replace your head before it breaks and save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this shaver I was not happy with the shave I got and went back to a blade.</li>
            <li> A few years ago when I asked Braun about upgrading to the \\&quot;360</li>
            <li> This foil/cutter performs well and should last approximately one year before needing replacement.</li>
            <li> I have a HEAVY beard.</li>
            <li> It can cut you if  a blade is missing.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve been using my 51S for a few months (2-3)</li>
            <li> and it it does I&#x27;ll order a few of the 30B in case Braun manages to ruin the 30B as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Caution - This foil does not fit a Braun Series 5 723 shaver.</li>
            <li> But that is small comfort for poor shave, takes a long time to get a close shave, parts fall off from unknown places after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why it did not fit.</li>
            <li> Inproved shaving for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Numbering is confusing on Braun...be careful.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe what I was missing by now changing out the foil and cutter sooner.</li>
            <li> I replace this part every few months.</li>
            <li> the last year or two, I&#x27;ve been wondering if the replacement cartridges were getting worse.  </li>
            <li> This one has all round holes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this a few times</li>
            <li> Absolutely poor quality that makes me want to switch back to a Norelco.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this replacement foil and on the fence about it, as I was, I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I was worried after reading reviews about the poor quality of Braun&#x27;s replacement foils, but was heartened by the comment on one that they had switched their manufacturing back from China.</li>
            <li> For a year I looked at my foil that had holes in it and at the blade that was missing parts of it.</li>
            <li> So when I used my shaver I felt a few pinches here and there.  </li>
            <li> simple because of the poor quality of this product.</li>
            <li> got this for my 5775 type 5724 and it did not fit.  </li>
            <li> Every limp Richard celeb sporting an uber trimmed chin, or disheveled ignored nest</li>
            <li> This foil and cutter replacement pack does not fit my Braun 5614 shaver and the company I purchased it from Hazlo Trading in Dublin Ireland</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few months, I purchased the Braun 30B on the advice of someone&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> A month later, it is broken</li>
            <li> Not cheap, but</li>
            <li> But the packing will literally stop a HEAT round.  </li>
            <li> I have had my 8995 since 2006, replaced a few of the foil/cutter blocks.</li>
            <li> ; Foil did not fit</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and that&#x27;s why I like a Braun Shaver.  </li>
            <li> had it tested after just destorying hundreds of disposables and a few electrics even this does not give the closet shave</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nearly impossible to find the correct replacement in the stores, and they are very expensive--almost not worth replacing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for my Braun Electric Razor expecting it would perform as well as previous replacements I had purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> It would now take about a half an hour to shave my face!  </li>
            <li> The foil snapped in half after about 2 months--and past the return date.  </li>
            <li> And sadly when they can be located, the original cutter replacements are insanely expensive.  </li>
            <li> I too had read many of the other reviews here that say how horrible this shaver replacement is, and I too was worried just like you probably are.  </li>
            <li> so I do not doubt other&#x27;s negative reactions.  </li>
            <li> plainly shows the depth of Amazon&#x27;s stock room.</li>
            <li> I use his electric razor to edge up the back of my neck and ever since he changed it, there is a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> It only doesn&#x27;t rate 5 stars because even when used daily, there tends to be a small bit of unnecessary discomfort while shaving the neck region that I had not experienced with past shavers.</li>
            <li> It took a little longer than usual, but it&#x27;s understandable when is coming from South Korea.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty painful.</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of trouble in the past with electric shavers tearing up my neck.  </li>
            <li> When I began replacing the foil/cutter with the series 5 replacement items I began to have unsatisfactory results such as pinching, poor cutting action, insufficient beard removal, etc.  </li>
            <li> For those who complained about pulling, see if it helps to follow the directions - don&#x27;t press down on your face and move the shaver slower, let it do the work.</li>
            <li> shave that this gives is so bad that in a meeting on the day i shaved, (a video-conf meeting), the guy on the other side was joking - \\&quot;maybe you need a new blade\\&quot; - no i am not making this up!&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about buying this because of some of the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this replacement foil/cutter set with a little bit of concern after reading some negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was a little slow for Amazon, but then it was shipped from Ireland.</li>
            <li> The cutters became dull after a few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews and figured how bad could it really be.</li>
            <li> It catches easily on small amounts of hair.</li>
            <li> I think this is expensive but about the same in Walmart except no tax&#x3D; 10-15% savings.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re usually about $45 in stores</li>
            <li> I usually change out my heads every 12 months instead of the recommended 18.</li>
            <li> not sure what all the complaints are about.  </li>
            <li> Usually replace after 4-5 months</li>
            <li> Some people gave it low marks saying it was a third-party product with questionable quality.</li>
            <li> 29 years and usually shave every Mon, Wed &amp; Fri</li>
            <li> No more pulling, no nicks, and a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Went through three of these in the past year, no more, switched to Panasonic a couple of months ago</li>
            <li> I usually shop the price as these can get pricey.</li>
            <li> Not sure how anyone can complain?</li>
            <li> not sure if they discontinued them or Braun is not making them</li>
            <li> Not sure if this a legit Braun product???</li>
            <li> Not sure why this product has a few negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Kept my old razor cutting my beard.</li>
            <li> Maybe I will try buying again from BBB, just hate to waste so much money for nothing!</li>
            <li> Series 5 is what my husband has in qhis braun razor, and these did not fit the machine!</li>
            <li> so not sure if that makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Not much more to say.</li>
            <li> Middle of November and its completely useless.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this unit from Amazon because, as usual, they had the best&lt;br /&gt;price</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading the reviews, i am not sure if i should buy the series 3 30B either.</li>
            <li> but I was not sure.  </li>
            <li> tough plastic wrapper takes sharp knife to dig through, so I knew it was unused in a tamper proof package.</li>
            <li> First because I hate the Gillette company for outrageous over pricing and also because Panasonic has better ratings in consumer reports.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun 8985 electric shaver for a few years now, and I&#x27;ve gone through several sets of cutting blocks and foils.  </li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in it, but after replacing the foil/cutter with a new series 5 pack</li>
            <li> At first it was annoying</li>
            <li> Shaving is much easier and less painful!</li>
            <li> but I was not happy with it turning part of my face black.  </li>
            <li> A little less expensive than at the store</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find item in our area for some reason.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my razor had become.</li>
            <li> and he told me that it&#x27;s dull already.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t push hard with this one and it will work fantastically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could hardly feel anything when shaving with it.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t realize how dull your blade is until you replace it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull it was until I replaced.</li>
            <li> these are hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> Had to work hard to keep that hole away from my beard.</li>
            <li> Instead of the blades pointing up (which tends to dull them faster in any razor), they are now pointed to the sides...where each blade piece has to two ends.</li>
            <li> That way he won&#x27;t have to shave with a dull razor.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why Braun made the original replacement foil unavailable and instead is selling this Series 5 Combi 51s model, but it is terrible.</li>
            <li> so I hardly ever replace them (even after a year).</li>
            <li> This is something that I have a hard time buying.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t realize how dull my razor had become until i replaced my foil and cutter.</li>
            <li> Ours electric razor Combi 51s &#x27;s foil &amp; cutter went dull.</li>
            <li> Complaint-</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint, and it falls on def ears, is Amazon&#x27;s quality control SUCKS.&lt;br /&gt;Props-</li>
            <li> Shaving is painful and uneven, especially if you skip a day between shaves.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit too late for that.</li>
            <li> I called and complained about the change and was promptly sent....</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the negative comments.</li>
            <li> I recently replaced my Braun Activator 8585 with the 51S foil and cutting block.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to replace these items on my razor occasionally and I have not yet been unhappy with any of the replacement parts.</li>
            <li> Must be replaced often or shaver is not effective.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t agree with the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> cutting block and foil sets are supposed to last about 18 months before you need to change them.  </li>
            <li> Believe the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> These will prevent it from effectively cutting your facial hair, but until there are holes in the foil, I would hold off on replacing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Going back would be faster but feels like I&#x27;m cutting my skin every time.</li>
            <li> I read some of the negative reviews and don&#x27;t find the problems they discuss.</li>
            <li> This is the lowest price I&#x27;ve found anywhere by at least $10 difference.</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous about ordering this replacement for my 8585 shaver - based on some of the negative reviews here.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unhappy and I&#x27;m switching to a different razor.</li>
            <li> Too late to get a refund, but beware...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading the negative reviews of this product</li>
            <li> They have all gotten progressively worse, with the latest being the worst (series 5 combi 51s), for 8995.</li>
            <li> It was a week late in arriving.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly thick stubble and my Activator razor now sounds like a weed whacker when I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have a course or thick beard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not even talking about a thick beard -- I couldn&#x27;t grow a beard to save my life.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a thick beard nor lots of hair.  </li>
            <li> I am too disappointed with the new design that Braun came up with.</li>
            <li> do still occasionally get a tug or a snag which is very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> by far; but I was disappointed in it.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy this item to replace the foil head, which does wear thin and can start to nick one&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t even cutting bad, but I figured it was worth freshening the cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i am seriously thinking of switching to another shaver if the quality of the foil is going to be like this.</li>
            <li> This foil constantly snags my facial hair and has proven to be a horrible investment.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> There was a Chinese verson that was awful and didn&#x27;t cut well, and a German version that did work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Braun is utterly ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Less expensive than buying a replacement.</li>
            <li> The only difficult part of the process is opening the silly plastic container without incurring a serious laceration.</li>
            <li> Everyone else was so much more expensive and wanted to charge outrageous amount of money for shipping.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was a little shaken.  </li>
            <li> was a little expensive</li>
            <li> It almost felt like it started off somewhat dull and got worse from there.  </li>
            <li> A little excessive packaging for just a cutting head and foil but that just my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why people are giving this such bad reviews.</li>
            <li> So I bought the series 5 head despite some earlier bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Bad news on this though - even the ones Target sell are the low quality model.</li>
            <li> because I received two responses saying my cards were not good.</li>
            <li> thinking of ordering another one) and read all the negative reviews and realized it was the newer version of the foil and cutter block that was just poorly made.</li>
            <li> Since Braun sold out to P&amp;G and now has Gillette making the cutter block, the shave is not nearly as good.</li>
            <li> It pulls instead of cutting in the center section.</li>
            <li> The problem with this is that you get several painful pulls of hair while shaving.</li>
            <li> I was wary of the new 51s because of  the bad reviews</li>
            <li> else be ready for a very painful shave.</li>
            <li> The cutting head snaps out and the replacement pack restores the blade sharp quality.</li>
            <li> Replace your cutter at least once per year!</li>
            <li> After 5 months, shaving has become a very long painful process.  </li>
            <li> Braun Series 5 Razor replacement is tough to find in Canada.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard</li>
            <li> I have a tough job finding an electric razor that works well for me.  </li>
            <li> Please Braun engineers, work harder to take this technology even closer to the shear terror that everybody so enjoys in a painful shave.  </li>
            <li> and I do sympathize with those who are not happy with this foil and cutter.  </li>
            <li> , this is worse.</li>
            <li> decreased the price and will help me not forget to get a replacement for my husband</li>
            <li> The worse part, though, came when I called Braun USA (aka.</li>
            <li> I read the poor reviews for this item and considered getting the 30b model instead.  </li>
            <li> I found the shave quality decreased and the blades started pulling whiskers.  </li>
            <li> But, if you have a 5000 series Braun don&#x27;t worry about the folks that have had poor performance on the non-5000 series shavers.</li>
            <li> Being unshaven is not favored at home.</li>
            <li> Having to pay big replacement costs for parts is annoying.</li>
            <li> Twice the effort for a poor result.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of buying the foil and block</li>
            <li> And one I am using is broken</li>
            <li> The irritation was worse than if I used a 1-bladed disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Braun customer service about the poor quality of this set of blades.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this foil/cutterblock combo three times and the foil has broken on me all three times between 9 months and a year.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all in the quality or poor quality of the replacement head.</li>
            <li> Why fix something that wasn&#x27;t broken?</li>
            <li> After 2 years of use, I noticed that my Series 5 shaver was leaving me poorly shaven and my skin irritated.</li>
            <li> Replaced a broken foil/cutter.  </li>
            <li> The package is annoying to open but does protect the item.</li>
            <li> The worse replacement foil and cutter I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Foil arrived broken.  </li>
            <li> now my base unit is dying so am gonna have to upgrade shortly.</li>
            <li> Perhaps, as mentioned by other buyers, the bad experiences that some people had were because for a while, Braun was outsourcing the product to China .Hope</li>
            <li> the other Activator owners here I am also in for a painful experience whenever I skip a day of shaving.  </li>
            <li> If you look at the spacing between the metal ridges, the newer foil has visibly closer spacing than the older ones, which might be the problem, but I am so disgusted with the trend and increasing replacement expense for this razor</li>
            <li> My experience is about 4-5 months before they get a small hole in the cutting foil which cuts your face.</li>
            <li> The new design is awful.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and replaced the foil and cutter after about 10 months of usage; don&#x27;t expect dramatic improvement in shave quality or closeness.  </li>
            <li> The difference was quite dramatic.</li>
            <li> Too expensive and in retrospect it was a dumb idea to purchase this shaving system altogether.</li>
            <li> Suffice it to say, if you&#x27;re worried about all the other bad reviews saying how uncomfortable this setup is, youplacements in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li> Suffice it to say, if you&#x27;re worried about all the other bad reviews saying how uncomfortable this setup is, you</li>
            <li> Was a little tentative in ordering this item with all the bad reviews, but I did so thinking I could return it if unsatisfactory.</li>
            <li> It had been pulling instead of cutting lately.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have to report that it is significantly worse.  </li>
            <li> foil is completely broken and useless.  </li>
            <li> very disappointed for the money I paid never expected from this brand</li>
            <li> According to me, the cutter block is the reason behind that horrible shave and Braun should be ashamed of putting such garbage out there..</li>
            <li> According to me, the cutter block is the reason behind that horrible shave and Braun should be ashamed of putting such garbage out there.</li>
            <li> and i must say this cutting block \\&quot;made in china\\&quot; is not a good as the 30b.</li>
            <li> Less than worthless.</li>
            <li> smoother and less violent shaving experience</li>
            <li> Difficult to go wrong with Braun products.  </li>
            <li> I will update this review if this foil fails before time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will update this review if this foil fails before time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind if they weren&#x27;t so expensive or if you could buy the foil seperately.</li>
            <li> It is definitely a racket when you factor in the outrageous cost of the &amp;#34;clean and renew&amp;#34; cartridges.</li>
            <li> While the products are expensive, the results make BRAUN a bargain.</li>
            <li> and perhaps my face is not a perfect match.  </li>
            <li> BUT  FOR THE WRONG  MODEL.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive.</li>
            <li> It is difficult for me to find replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s razor.  </li>
            <li> Since I thought it was a fake</li>
            <li> wrong one.</li>
            <li> Alas, not!</li>
            <li> They will steer you in the wrong direction.</li>
            <li> Wrong size for shaver.</li>
            <li> Its a necessary evil to me sorta.  </li>
            <li> Seems lame that that should be so, and I think it should not be on the market</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how uncomfortable my razor had become before I bought the head and foil.</li>
            <li> In reality there is nothing wrong with the working body of the razor</li>
            <li> It is difficult to describe the difference but this replacement foil appears simpler and is probably cheaper to manufacture.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see anything overtly wrong with the replacement.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong model #&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This foil is of extremely poor quality!</li>
            <li> wrong item.</li>
            <li> Too expensive?  </li>
            <li> I am amazed they are as expensive as they are.</li>
            <li> nothing wrong with my mind...</li>
            <li> I then bought the expensive Braun razor.  </li>
            <li> and that is expensive.</li>
            <li> Sorry buddies.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but I need it</li>
            <li> I unfortunately don&#x27;t remember the purchase dates, so I wait for my razor to alert me.  </li>
            <li> Mere seconds.  </li>
            <li> I have a random directional growing beard.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who has a very tough beard.  </li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very poor design.</li>
            <li> The shave is not as close and the quality of the blade is very poor.</li>
            <li> it just very hard to hold too with my bad fingers.</li>
            <li> Making matters worse, it pulls and tugs my hair, making shaving a painful experience.</li>
            <li> This replacement foil was quite in expensive as well as the cutting blades that came in the packaging as well.</li>
            <li> I was terribly disappointed to find that it did a poor job shaving my stubble.</li>
            <li> am so frustrated because it now takes me 3 times as long to shave and the results are just terrible.  </li>
            <li> I was having a real tough go shaving.</li>
            <li> The shaver is cutting my face and not my hair.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it is so close because it is no longer cutting, but just pulling all of the hairs out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For Amazon to stock it&#x27;s foil and cutting blade  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the recommended replacement cutting parts.</li>
            <li> Men don&#x27;t realize if they don&#x27;t change the foil and cutter in their Braun Series 5 they will end up cutting and tearing their skin.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to replace your foil and cutter, I&#x27;d suggest cutting your losses now.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why they had to change design of the cutting block.</li>
            <li> I know I upgraded to the Braun Shaver Series 5 590cc in order to get upgraded foil cutting geometry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> is the correct replacement cutting block for the Series 5 550cc.</li>
            <li> YOU CAN NOT GO WRONG WITH THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Braun Series 5 Combi 51s Foil served the purpose but expensive!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have had to change the foil already!  </li>
            <li> I bought the Wrong one Stupid me</li>
            <li> This makes for a very uncomfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> 22 June 2011  I received an e-mail from Braun very sorry for my experience and they would be sharing my comments with their Health and Safety division.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s useless and worthless</li>
            <li> I see bad reviews about this replacement foil here on Amazon and almost decided against buying it.</li>
            <li> I hesitated to order another replacement after I read the bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have found that these need to be replaced about every 6 months in order to keep from getting bad razor rash and irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s bad.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the bad reviews keep you from ordering this.</li>
            <li> and it was just so painful to use.</li>
            <li> The shave was just as painful as before.</li>
            <li> grabs my stubble making every shave extremely painful.</li>
            <li> From then on, the shave is not efficient and has become painful.  </li>
            <li> have never been so frustrated with a product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you buy this foil and cutter you will be disappointed within a month.</li>
            <li> By Marjorie&#x27;s husband:  Severely disappointed in this for my 8000 series Activator shaver.  </li>
            <li> If they had disappointed me I would have given them no stars.</li>
            <li> disappointed in Braun.</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> I have always used Braun replacement parts and have never been disappointed with their quality.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing shaves.</li>
            <li> method is utterly stupid.  </li>
            <li> I hate that company.</li>
            <li> I hate that company.</li>
            <li> I hate the packaging on these things</li>
            <li> I hate the Braun Series 5 Combi 51s</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the cleaning base anymore</li>
            <li> If this is Proctor &amp; Gamble&#x27;s idea of preventing counterfeiting all they&#x27;re doing is annoying their customers...</li>
            <li> I have always hated the idea of parts that wear out and need replacing.  </li>
            <li> but it makes shaving very painful.</li>
            <li> (very painful).  </li>
            <li> IT.. supposed to do away with hair.. and very VERY painful to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worst replacement product ever...</li>
            <li> I wish I could return this horrific foil.</li>
            <li> The foil cutter is terrible.  </li>
            <li> Anyway - these are terrible.  </li>
            <li> The worst part is that it does not contain the shaved hair but rather &#x27;rains&#x27; it all over the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely horrible replacement foil/cutter block.</li>
            <li> all the time, with each shave, just horrible.</li>
            <li> pathetic.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> glad to finally replace my old foil and cutter, feels good to shave clean, again. My old foil had a hole in it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing shaves. I have been using a Braun for over for 20 years (not the same one) &amp; now I need to to put baby oil or olive oil w/lavender on my face for a better smoother shave.</li>
            <li> Excellent, the shaver is like new with the new foil and cutter</li>
            <li> Restored the like new feel to my Series 5 electric razor. Easy to install and only took about 30 seconds. Huge savings over retail.</li>
            <li> Best price on the market.</li>
            <li> good  value for money</li>
            <li> Excellent product and less expensive than locally. I&#x27;ll order another&lt;br /&gt;shortly for backup because I have an old razor thatt I want to keep&lt;br /&gt;going.</li>
            <li> Complaint- This is my second one. The first one was sent to me, package opened, item used and broken. This is the second time Amazon has sent me a used and returned item. My biggest complaint, and it falls on def ears, is Amazon&#x27;s quality control SUCKS.&lt;br /&gt;Props-The item itself is great! The Bruan shaver is really a lifetime shaver. I haven&#x27;t had to do anything to it for more than 10 years and I anticipate this screen and cutter lasting another 10+ years before I have to replace it. Bruan is well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Using on my Braun 8985 shaver and it makes a big difference when you change it out. Cuts like when it was brand new.</li>
            <li> Great my head and face was clean for 2 days</li>
            <li> Difficult to go wrong with Braun products.  The engineering is superb.  Easy to swap out the old blade and foil and pop these in.  Careful not to cut yourself!</li>
            <li> Very good price! Great service and performance! This is the only razor my husband likes after trying many others. Happy!</li>
            <li> Really, you want me to rate a razor foil?  OK, it worked, my face is smooth. 4 more words required</li>
            <li> I bought my Braun about 6 years ago and thought it was a really good shaver.  Over time it didn&#x27;t shave as well and so I decided to buy a different shaver.  This one eventually made it to my cabin ( weekend get away) where I didn&#x27;t use it very much. Then I decided to purchase this item.  What a huge difference.  It&#x27;s like a brand new razor. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for a shaver. it was the right model, but the third day it was used, the blades tore two large holes in the foil,  rendering the shaver useless.</li>
            <li> After the third shave, they cut my face up, just like everyone else said. Save the packaging!</li>
            <li> The replacement blades work great at a great price. Fast shipping and good value. Would order again when I need new blades in 18 months.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my Series 5 Braun</li>
            <li> It served good , but last half of  the time.</li>
            <li> A perfect fit for me.</li>
            <li> So far so good, it seems these blades get dull just like razor blades do. Once every 3 months (I think) will work well for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, if you own a Braun shaver, which give a great shave, you are required to replace these expensive foil/cutters from time to time. The prices here are as good as I&#x27;ve found anywhere else so I keep coming back.</li>
            <li> I broke the foil , and had to get a replacement. I was only looking for the foil, but only found this package.&lt;br /&gt;Had no problems, fits perfectly. Saving the razor replacement for later since I don&#x27;t need to change that yet.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect combo, remembre that you have to change your cutter and your foil every 6 to 8 months, so tris product is the perfect choice</li>
            <li> Perfect buy to replace old cutter and foil! My husband was very happy to get these as a &amp;#34;father&#x27;s gift&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this kind of shaver for the past 15 years and I don&#x27;t plan to change anytime soon. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found over all the other ones I was using,</li>
            <li> Perfect. The original was for 5 years.</li>
            <li> Made my shaver feel like it was brand new. Made it run quieter and felt smooth against my skin for a close shave.</li>
            <li> I was reading the directions and found that you should change your blades evey 12-18 months so I order these after checking around for a few months and these were the best deal.  Wow you can tell the difference!!!!</li>
            <li> great product, great service</li>
            <li> Part arrived quickly, in good order, and it was exactly what I ordered, the electric razor now works again, and cuts very well!</li>
            <li> Purchase of replacement part. Price was better that through local retailors. I would recommend to my friends, that they follow this process.</li>
            <li> it looked fine until i removed it.&lt;br /&gt;then i saw it was broken.&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t shave well at all.&lt;br /&gt;have to buy a replacement.</li>
            <li> I use my Braun for travel only, so the shaver takes more of a beating than my Norelco at home.  For the price of these replacement blades, I order 2 and always have one for a spare!</li>
            <li> I see and feel no difference between this replacement and the original. Works just as it should. Easy to clean and lasts the full 18 months. I have gone through 3 of them so far and they all work great.</li>
            <li> Purchased this replacement hardware for my 8585 (with reservations based on a lot of reviews).  It&#x27;s like having a new razor! Works great, smooth shave and foil cover fits well if not a little tight compared to the original.</li>
            <li> I searched everywhere,so since I can no longer find this in a store, it&#x27;s a life-saver!!! I should have bought 2.......</li>
            <li> I have been buying this combo for several years and have no had any problems at all.  It is the same product as in the past and I get close to a year and 3 months and more before having to replace.  Maybe I am one of the more fortunate people and I do sympathize with those who are not happy with this foil and cutter.  By the way, my Braun is model 8595.  I hope I have been helpful to the readers. - Bobby Blue</li>
            <li> I think the last time I replaced my blade was probably 2 years ago.  Way too long to wait.  I almost got rid of my shaver because it sucked!  I figured I would give this a try to see if it made any difference and now I can shave in half the time it took me before.  Honestly 18 months is about right to replace these.</li>
            <li> Great product and works just as described.I wouldnt hesitate to purchase again in the near future..Braun makes outstanding well made products.</li>
            <li> Had gone way past the recommended time of use on my old one so decided to buy this rather than a whole new shaver.  Made it like I was opening up a new shaver again.  Might look at buying again rather than new shaver.</li>
            <li> Great price for what I needed. Fast shipping , great job. Thank you</li>
            <li> this foil does not compare to the quality of the same older foils. i have been using this shaver for over 3 years and have gone through 2 foils which were excellent. but this new foil didn&#x27;t even last 6 months and i have been getting razor burns. i am seriously thinking of switching to another shaver if the quality of the foil is going to be like this. i hope someone from braun reads about this and does something...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun electric foil shavers for over ten years. When I saw all of the negative reviews here, I simply didn&#x27;t believe them. I bought this product from Amazon, hoping to improve the performance of my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this is worse. Yes, this new cutter and foil is worse than my 2-year-old cutter and foil. It catches easily on small amounts of hair. It doesn&#x27;t shave closely, quickly, nor easily. I&#x27;m very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking at Panasonic&#x27;s line of shavers, as a result.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my husband.  He said that the razor works like new!</li>
            <li> I see some other people complaining about this replacement model but it works great for me. No cuts &amp; burns.</li>
            <li> I see bad reviews about this replacement foil here on Amazon and almost decided against buying it. The problem appears to be that this is actually the replacement foil and cutter block for the Braun 360 complete series shavers, specifically the 89** series. This series along with the Braun Activator has now been discontinued. I have the Braun 360 Complete 8985 shaver. If someone can recall the Braun 360 was a minor upgrade to the Braun Activator line of shavers. The upgrade was in the foil and the cutter block assembly only. According to Braun, the newer cutter block and foil were better at cutting than the previous Activator series cutter block. Also the newer cutter block fit both Braun 360 complete as well as Braun Activator shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun has now discontinued the individual cutter blocks for these shavers and now they offer only the Braun Series 5 Combi 51S for both shavers. So, here&#x27;s the deal:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;If you are looking for an exact replacement for the Braun 360 Complete line of shavers, then this Braun Series 5 Combi 51S is the right product for you. It is identical to the one you previously had except that 360 complete is not written on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;If you are looking for an exact replacement for the Braun Activator line of shavers then this is NOT the replacement for you. This will fit your shaver but it is a different product. You will be better served by getting the Braun Series 3 Combi 30B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the quality of this cutter block and foil. It cuts like the original. Since I never had another shaver or another cutter block, so I cannot compare it to another. My original foil that came with the shaver got chipped within 4 months. I was quite upset but went ahead and bought another one, the replacement lasted for almost 3 years. So, now I have bought this one, let&#x27;s hope this lasts for 3 years too. I have been using it for a month. This is made in Germany. If I skip shaving one day then on the next shave this cutter block will occasionally pull some hair, but if I shave everyday then the shave is pain free and close. I will update this review if this foil fails before time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 29 February 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see my post in the \\&quot;comments\\&quot; for an update on this review.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update April 7, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to let everyone know that since I wrote my review, Braun has updated both the 51S and the 30B foils. The new 51S foil has a very different foil pattern and the embossed blue center power comb has been changed to a flat silver colored power comb. I have never used the new 51S, so I do not know how it cuts or whether it still pulls hair or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you read the \\&quot;comments to my review\\&quot; section, you will know that I have long since switched to the 30B foil and cutter block for my 8985 shaver, with good results. However, be advised that Braun has also changed the 30B foil and the newer one has a different cutter block. I have not used this new 30B, so I cannot say anything about it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewers, who are deciding to buy the 51S, or comparing 51S and 30B foils, should consult the more recent reviews, as those will pertain to the newer foils.l occasionally pull some hair, but if I shave everyday then the shave is pain free and close.

            <li> I hesitated to order another replacement after I read the bad reviews.  I even went to a number of online stores to see if one had the old pack but none did.  So I ordered this and it&#x27;s fine.  Have noticed nothing different except a better shave.</li>
            <li> Just as described and a great price.</li>
            <li> My razor works well, again. But my gripe is that the foils wear out too fast. I wouldn&#x27;t mind if they weren&#x27;t so expensive or if you could buy the foil seperately. The cutter block lasts far longer than the foil. It is definitely a racket when you factor in the outrageous cost of the &amp;#34;clean and renew&amp;#34; cartridges. The manufacturers sell you a good razor and then it costs a fortune to keep it that way. I guess I bought into their hype and the never-ending cycle of greed.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Braun Series 5 360 Complete and loved the shaver.  After 16 months or so the replace foil/cutter light came on. I ordered a Braun 51S Foil &amp; Cutter from Amazon.  At first I could feel a real improvement but for the last month or two, it has taken longer to shave and not felt as close.  Yesterday, one of the retaining clips beside the middle cutter came loose and struck me in the cheek.  I was not able to push it back in place and the other retaining bar also came loose and had to be removed.  Now the center cutter has moved upward level with the foil as there is nothing to keep it in place.  This makes for a very uncomfortable shave.  Fortunately I had saved the original foil and have reinstalled it.  I was surprised to find that even with that head being twice as old, it is giving a better shave then the 7 month old replacement one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lack of quality in the genuine Braun replacement part (not cheap!) is extremely disappointing.  I am at a loss to understand how a genuine replacement part could be so inferior to the original one that came with the shaver as they look the same.  I have also e-mailed Braun with this complaint, it will be interesting to see if I hear from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 22 June 2011  I received an e-mail from Braun very sorry for my experience and they would be sharing my comments with their Health and Safety division.  They also requested I keep the shaver head for two weeks in case they needed to retrieve it.  In the meantime, they have mailed me a replacement foil and cutter block.</li>
            <li> I received this foil and cutterhead a week or so ago through the Subscribe and Save program.  I have been using the Subscribe and Save program for years but the actual item has changed several times.  This was the first time I used this replacement foil.  It should be listed as an epilator instead of a cutter.  It tears your beard from your face.  It also tears up your skin.  At first, I though it was the incorrect head - but it is the correct replacement for my model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I canceled this Subscribe and Save and ordered the 7000 series replacement foil/cutter as recommended by others.  Hopefully I can update this review with the great results others say they received.</li>
            <li> After having used a Braun Syncro for over nine years (&amp; four replacement foils &amp; cutters) I decided to upgrade to a Braun Series 5. I used the Series 5 for 1&amp;1/2 yrs til it required a new cutter &amp; foil. After checking prices for replacements, I was somewhat surprised to find that replacement costs were almost double the cost of my older Syncro foils. After reading some of the reviews regarding Series 5 replacement foils, I decided to buy the 30B replacement head. I found my old Braun Syncro &amp; checked the head against the Syncro &amp; discovered that the heads were idenditical. Installed my old Syncro foil over the Series 5 cutter &amp; had the best close shave (without pulling hair) that I have had since I quit using my Syncro. Since I usually dont dispose of the old foils &amp; cutters, I checked the packaging for my last two replacements for the Syncro &amp; Found that one was a 7000 &amp; the other was a 30B. The situation seems to be that Braun is pulling a fast shuffle on foil replacements. Try your old foils (if you still have them) &amp; you&#x27;ll be amazed at the comparable fit between the old &amp; new foils. So save your money &amp; enjoy your closer shaves with the older foil kits on your Series 5.</li>
            <li> I used the new foil and blade replacement only 6 or 7 times and the foil developed a hole and scraped my face till it bleed. Never had that happen before, please advise if replaceable</li>
            <li> I happy it is available.  super product.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t perfect for every type of facial hair, but it does a decent job.</li>
            <li> Been using Braun shavers for over 20 years.  Mfg says this should be changed every 18 months.  It all depends on the cutter foil and blades.  I think this is expensive but about the same in Walmart except no tax&#x3D; 10-15% savings.</li>
            <li> I finally called Braun and confirmed that this is the wrong replacement for the 8985 model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The correct replacement part is 30B</li>
            <li> Great Brand - good service.</li>
            <li> I was a loyal Braun customer over the past 20 years this is the third Braun shaver I bought and the one I am least happy with.  In fact I stopped using it and bought a Panasonic that I like much better.  The Braun is heavy noisy and most importantly does not give me the close shave I was used to with their previous shavers.  In fact my first one that I own for 20 years (and keep as back up) gives me a better shave.  The new Braun actually CUTS my skin that I really bleed - at the bonny points like the chin.  Never knew that an electric shaver can cut me and make me bleed.  So far the Panasonic seems much better than the Braun.</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find item in our area for some reason. Don&#x27;t know if it is being phased out or what, but I did compare prices with WalMart, and a few other stores that just didn&#x27;t have it on the shelf but an empty area for it and this was by far the best price.  Plus signing up for every 6 month delivery decreased the price and will help me not forget to get a replacement for my husband (makes me look like I am on top of things!!!).</li>
            <li> After using BRAUN shavers for over thirty years, I continue to enjoy the quality of their products and the excellent results!  I have used my current razor for nearly seven years and have never had problems with the operation.  Replacing with the razor heads keeps each shave a smooth result and the power only needs recharging every three months!  While the products are expensive, the results make BRAUN a bargain.</li>
            <li> quick delivery and a good price, works well</li>
            <li> Just go with the 30b replacement for the 8595.  It is less $ and works great.  Been using it for weeks now.  Close shave, better than before.  It is black so it does not match...but who cares!  It is a shaver!  It&#x27;s not on display!</li>
            <li> Makes my razor shave like new, the quality is as expected from a BRAUN product.</li>
            <li> never ordered one of these</li>
            <li> Further proof that Braun leads the pack. Smoothest shave ever ... no surprise! I&#x27;ve tried some of the so-called \\&quot;top\\&quot; brand shavers but ended up back with Braun. Reliable shaver and accessories.</li>
            <li> The Braun series 5 replacement cutter is just like the original in the Braun 360 razor. Easy to replace and I see no difference between it and a brand new razor. Ever since I bought the 360 I don&#x27;t use a regular razor anymore. No need to. The Braun cuts close!! With no nicks.</li>
            <li> From the day I purchased my Braun 360 Complete shaver I was a little disappointed in it, but after replacing the foil/cutter with a new series 5 pack it&#x27;s so much better.  Wish I made the switch years ago.  The series 5 pack is a direct replacement for the old 360 complete pack.  The only difference is the words &#x27;360 complete&#x27; are missing.  This 5 series pack made an average shaver a good one.</li>
            <li> brand new product; works perfect on a series 8 Braun. AAAAAAAA</li>
            <li> I have ordered before off Amazon, genuine parts and arrived on time. Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I feel this replacement shaves cleaner than the smartfoil that came with the shaver.  Also, I use to feel occasional pull, which kind of hurts, when I shave with smartfoil.  However, I haven&#x27;t had that problem with this foil.  So far I like the replacement.</li>
            <li> Great price and I have check everywhere (yes Walmart).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t review a lot of products, however, I felt I needed to this time for other 8585 users. I read through many of the reviews before purchasing this item. I was attempting to find out if any of them were 8585 users replacing their cutter and block. I found only one that specifically named the 8585 in their review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to agree with that one I found and read, this item does indeed work fine with the 8585 model. It appears, at least to me, to work and shave pretty much exactly the same, as well as look the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if there&#x27;s any other 8585 users out there wondering if this is the replacement you need, the answer is yes, this is what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> This replacement works much better than the old blade. I hope it will last.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li> This is my second replacement foil and blade combination for my Braun 8975 shaver.  For some reason, it seems so much better than the previous replacement, which I was not very happy with.  The original was excellent and I think this replacement is as good as the original.  The blade seemed to seat more firmly and it cut on the first pass.  This will save me time. No kidding.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews, some positive and some negative.  I have to admit that I waited a long time to replace my foil and cutter but honestly it seemed to shave the same since the day I purchased the shaver so there was no urgency to do so.  The original foil and cutter had a tendency to snag hairs while cutting.  At first it was annoying but I got used to it after awhile and just accepted that this is how it works and perhaps my face is not a perfect match.  But it got the job done which was my end goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After finally deciding to replace the foil and cutter I was concerned that I would need to get used to a different way of snagging, heheh.  The foil is configured differently than the original so I was concerned.  But nothing could be further from the truth!  When I shaved the first time with the replacement I thought at first it wasn&#x27;t doing anything!  It was as if either the hair wasn&#x27;t getting cut or my skin was being numbed so I could barely feel anything.  This foil and cutter does the job smoother than anything I&#x27;ve experienced without the snags!  It cuts very well and evenly without the pain and discomfort of the original.  It&#x27;s like I purchased a brand new and improved shaver but at a fraction of the cost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely post reviews but I felt that this one was warranted, however, your mileage may vary.  ;-)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you enjoy the most painful shave in the morning to help wake you up.  Well then, you&#x27;ll love this replacement foil.  Unlike the original \\&quot;Activator\\&quot; branded foil that came with my razor, this one locates the long hairs and grabs on to them tightly.  As you move the razor, you&#x27;ll get that eye opening riiiipppp, that just screams, \\&quot;Welcome to the new day!\\&quot;.  I think I had &#x27;tears of joy&#x27; after using this new foil after a long weekend where I hadn&#x27;t shaved for three days.  My family relished in my \\&quot;delight\\&quot; as I exclaimed \\&quot;Ouch!\\&quot;, \\&quot;#$&amp;%!\\&quot; and \\&quot;*%$&amp;!\\&quot; throughout my shave.  With the volume of my voice, the whole household knew that I was getting that Epilady close shave that everyone enjoys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I only gave this replacement foil 2 stars is because the excruciating pain that I love so much, is only possible when I haven&#x27;t shaved for a few days.  If I shave everyday and don&#x27;t let my beard get too long, I get that unsatisfying comfortable, \\&quot;pain-free\\&quot; and close shave that absolutely nobody would want.  Please Braun engineers, work harder to take this technology even closer to the shear terror that everybody so enjoys in a painful shave.  Also, many thanks for discontinuing the Activator branded replacement foil that gave me a comfortable shave every day for 2 years.</li>
            <li> I had dutifully replaced my cutter/foil on my Braun Activator several times in the past and noticed no real difference (Or so I thought). So I decided to use my last replacement for the last three years or so thinking it was still fine. Long story short, I finally realized that not only were my shaves becoming less and less comfortable, the razor itself was less effective at giving me a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally broke down and ordered this combi cutter/foil replacement and I have to say, the difference is night and day. Shaves are more comfortable, closer and are finished quicker to boot. This new cutter/foil also seems to incorporate some advances from the series 5 generation of Braun Razors (The power cutter and blades are improved), so it seems to do a better job in that regard than the original Activator cutter/foil too. It really does feel like a new razor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for all my fellow cheapskates out there ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: 6 months have elapsed and it feels like performance of the cutter/foil has degraded dramatically. I have fairly thick stubble and my Activator razor now sounds like a weed whacker when I&#x27;m shaving. In addition, shaves are taking significantly longer than before (Almost 6 minutes today!), are uncomfortable and are not nearly as close as when I first bought this. I&#x27;m tempted to try and find one of the old Activator cutter/foil packs because this combi cutter/foil doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> Good Braun quality.  Fits by 8595 series 5 just fine.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my razor had become. It&#x27;s like a new razor again</li>
            <li> The Braun shaver cutter is a great replacement for my dull cutter at an excellent price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pete</li>
            <li> I would add that in addition to the deceptive advertising, Braun customer support is passing along misinformation.  When I contacted them regarding the discontinued support for the original foil/cutter block, their response was to refer me to a store called the Essentials, which to no surprise, no longer carries the original.</li>
            <li> This item, if you can find it, will run you $40 plus tax at Target. So replace your head before it breaks and save a few bucks. Not like me...</li>
            <li> I have a seven year old Braun Activator (8585) and after almost two years with the old foil/head I had to buy a replacement. This piece of garbage is the only option. Well okay, it isn&#x27;t completely junk but it makes shaving very painful. I&#x27;ve owned this head now for several months and I can&#x27;t get through a single shave without having a hair pulled out.&lt;br /&gt;  I have flat, soft facial hair as opposed to coarse, round stubble and the new foil loves to rip my hair out on a regular basis. To be precise, it&#x27;s the new foil that does it; the shave head itself is actually perfectly fine, and in fact I think cuts better than the original. (I used my old foil until it too broke a few days later.) I tried contacting Braun customer support but was told in no uncertain terms \\&quot;You must be shaving incorrectly.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  In short, if you need to buy a new foil/head combo and are still fortunate enough to have the old steel colored foil, KEEP IT! The shave head works perfectly well as a replacement. If you&#x27;ve broken the foil, consider buying a new brand of razor as the new Braun line all seem to use the new style of head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rated 1 star due to the rediculous amount of pulled hairs - usually five plus per shave.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!  what a difference it makes to have a new set of blades.  its been 3 years since my last set of new blades.  cost and service was outstanding.</li>
            <li> Excellent fulfillment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Braun fan so I like it. Nice to save some money, too.</li>
            <li> i WANTED A NEW HEAD.I GOT A NEW HEAD [FOIL &amp;CUTTER]. MY RAISOR IS A SERIES 5. I GOT A FOIL &amp; CUTTER FOR A SERIES 5 BUT  FOR THE WRONG  MODEL. MY MODEL IS #5735. THE ONE I GOT WASN&#x27;T FOR #5735 - AND ONLY THE CUTTER FIT. I NEEDED THE CUTTER SO I&#x27;M USING IT WITHOUT A NEW FOIL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN YOU SENT ME THE ORIGINAL EMAIL THERE WAS ONLY SERIES 5 LISTED .&lt;br /&gt;yOU USE TOO MANY NUMBERS  -- FOR WHOSE CONVENIENCE I SUSSPECT WAS NOT DONE FOR THE CUSTOMER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FORGET \\&quot;SERIES 5\\&quot;.  IF I HAD ASKED FOR A bRAUN SHAVER HEAD CUTTER AND FOIL FOR A MODEL # 5735, WOULDN\\&quot;T TOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS ?</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas. It&#x27;s only Jan 26 and he told me that it&#x27;s dull already. I spent over $30 at Target for this P-O-S. I thought that the packaging says something about 18 months. Whatever. The original that came with the kit is the best. I have to go hunt one down now.</li>
            <li> I normally have good cutters and foils shipped to me, but for some reason the cutter was not sharp at all this time.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and replaced the foil and cutter after about 10 months of usage; don&#x27;t expect dramatic improvement in shave quality or closeness.  Shaving with this Braun in not the same or as close as shaving with a razor. Be aware all electric shavers requiring more back and forth movement - especially about the neck. This all adds to the shave time and skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these for the Braun 8985 shaver (to save on shipping) and it seems like a nicer blade than the previous one I had. However, it seems to razor burn more than the previous one. Could just be a person by person thing though. Otherwise, no complaints!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product, but my only interest in it is the price.  As most amazon shoppers know, prices fluctuate all the time and this is an item to throw in your cart (or save it for later) and then check back daily until you&#x27;re happy with the price or you&#x27;re willing to pay what it is (Amazon will warn you when items in your cart have changed prices).  (I paid less than $30 last time).</li>
            <li> I recently replaced the foil and cutter for my Activator shaver, and the new foil design (with the blue grille) is much worse than the old foil (with the silver grille), as the new foil irritates my skin to the point where I can longer use the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the new foil is standard on all new Braun shavers and the old silver foil is no longer available, so it looks like I&#x27;ll have to try a competitor. It&#x27;s a shame, because the Activator is an excellent shaver that worked very well for years, but the new foil renders it unusable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve contacted Braun on this issue and all they could say was that they would forward my information to their marketing department.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I read the reviews here on Amazon, because I realize that I&#x27;m not the only having issues with this foil.  I have the 8595 razor, and the original foil lasted beyond 18 months before a hole formed.  I purchased the 51S foil and cutter at Wal-Mart for ~$40 which is about $15 more than the other Braun foils, but says it&#x27;s for the 8000 series razor on the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like the other reviewers, I found this foil is noisier and doesn&#x27;t cut as well as the original foil.  It also pulled on my whiskers, and it also started falling apart and is now unusable.  Not exactly the quality I expect from Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the cheaper 7000 series foil as a replacement and it works more like the original foil and cutter.  It&#x27;s quieter, cuts faster, and hasn&#x27;t pulled any hair out of my head (yet).  The only down side to the cheaper foil is that it&#x27;s black and the protective clear foil cover doesn&#x27;t lock on to this foil as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d sooner sell my razor than use the 51S foil again!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly well.  Not a hitch.</li>
            <li> I bought this replacement pack along with the clean &amp; renew cartridges for my husband, in trying not to buy a brand new razor.  He wasn&#x27;t very good at maintaining his razor, so he was thrilled with the results.  After all of the packs and refills were in place, my husband said it was like his razor was brand new.  If he&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I have the 8595 shaver that I have loved since 2005. The new redesigned foil and cutter have completely destroyed my love for my shaver. Not only is the new replacement pack more expensive than the previous model, the quality has gone straight down the tubes. Shaving is painful and uneven, especially if you skip a day between shaves. The icing on the cake is that after 3 months of use the foil is already falling apart and unusable. Do not waste your money on this foil - I wish I had spent the extra money for the previous model!!!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t beat this price!!!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. Buying for the second time. it pops right in the shaver.</li>
            <li> Worked for one month then something snapped inside it and it makes a really loud buzzing noise and vibrates too much. I can&#x27;t see why exactly giving it a visual examination but something is very wrong. I tried taking it out and putting it back in multiple times which did nothing.</li>
            <li> A great machine. I bought it years and years ago and it&#x27;s working like new! A great feet of German engineering :-)</li>
            <li> I too was surprised when I replaced my original cutter/foil set with these.  They didn&#x27;t cut well, and they tugged on my stubble.  Not at all the clean, fast shave I got with my original blades.  That&#x27;s why I switched to Braun from Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may be some good news here though--a review by S. Bergeron for the Braun refurbished 8985 shaver that uses these blades said that the Braun 30b cutter/foil set is a better replacement.  Here&#x27;s what he had to say about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;(...The new replacement blades are the) &#x27;gillette&#x27; blade cutter block, which is not nearly as effective as the older style Braun cutter blocks (the gillette type has wide blades with narrower gaps between them, leading to skipped hairs and requiring multiple passes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a 30B cutting block and foil (for the series 7000 synchro models), which has the older, skinny blades design and bingo! it transformed the 8985 into the most efficient shaver i&#x27;ve ever used (or tried). With the fast oscilations of this model, there is no tugging and i get a shave closer than a wet blade in very little time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: i&#x27;ve noticed that the current cutter blocks and foil (like the 51S) listed by Braun for the 8000 series have the more agressive &#x27;comb&#x27; between the foils (blue in color). This comb design scrapes the skin more intensely (it is thicker, wider and protrudes more), which left me with a red face after shaving (from irritation). The 7000 series (30B) cutter/foil is more recessed and glides better on my skin without irritating it and while giving me a faster, closer shave...\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have used these foil and cutter replacements, before.  My razor and shave have benefited from this new foil and cutter.  It cuts closer than previous styles, sometimes close enough to nick me.  For the the 18 month life is only a dream because I not only shave my face but my head everyday, so I find the efficiency of the razor drops dramatically after the first month, then continues to slowly decline to where shaving is too slow to justify using the razor any longer (about 9-10 months).  I would say that is average since I am shaving more than twice the normal facial area.  It still beats regular razors!</li>
            <li> These replacement parts have been the only thing saving my current Braun from ending up in the trash.  A real necessity, if you own a shaver.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this shaver I was not happy with the shave I got and went back to a blade. I only used it when I needed a fast shave or was too lazy to shave with shaving cream but since I purchased this new cutter and head this is a different shaver. I now have put away the shaving cream and only use my Braun It&#x27;s fast and close and there is no need to go back over the same place ten times.</li>
            <li> I buy one of these every year and have the luxury of what seems to be a brand new shaver each time.</li>
            <li> This was a good deal for the Braun replacement shaver heads.  They&#x27;re usually about $45 in stores and I got them for $28 on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This replacement for my Activator is like getting a new razor -- new cutter and block perform just like the original with a  nice close clean shave. This is the Braun which I think is better than the Gillette which I tried before.</li>
            <li> This foil and cutter is a redesign. I think the older design cut better. You can tell the new design was meant to reduce costs. Next time I need c replacement I&#x27;ll probably replace the shaver instead.</li>
            <li> excellent electrical shaving machine.</li>
            <li> I installed one of these \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; replacements in my Braun 8585 shaver (of 4 years) a week ago.  I noticed the higher noise level right away.  Even worse though, after three or four shaves, this morning two long, sharp, metal bars flew out of the flat area between the foils - one hitting my eye and the other gouging my cheek.  Needless to say, I was a little shaken.  The worse part, though, came when I called Braun USA (aka. Proctor &amp; Gamble).  I figured there might be a recall and that surely they might want the parts for Q&amp;C checking.  Instead, they simply took my name and address to send a replacement pack to me.  While I appreciate that, I am still shocked that they weren&#x27;t aware of the issue and aren&#x27;t interested in pursuing it.  Hopefully, no one else will have the same thing happen to them.  As soon as I finish this review, I&#x27;ll be shopping for a new, non-Braun, shaver.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> Updating the foil and cutter is worth it. The product fits just like the old one.</li>
            <li> Despite some of the negative reviews posted about this replacement foil and cutter, I found the items were a perfect replacement for the original 8000 series shaving heads. The package I received was marked&amp;#34; Made in Germany&amp;#34; so it was not a Chinese ripoff. Perhaps, as mentioned by other buyers, the bad experiences that some people had were because for a while, Braun was outsourcing the product to China .Hope they have learned their lesson..&lt;br /&gt;Shaver works now like it did when I first used it about 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d say anything bad about my Braun 8585 shaver, but the replacement foils and cutterblock have ruined a wonderful shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what happened....I used my original blades and foil for 2 to 3 years.  The shaver gave me a GREAT shave.  Then I replaced those blades with replacement foil and cutterblock.  What a mistake!  Apparently Braun was bought out by Gillette in 2005.  Gillette changed the design of the blades and moved the manufacture of them to China.  Well, now blades that are supposed to last 18 months only last 2-3 months. They are HORRIBLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so frustrated because it now takes me 3 times as long to shave and the results are just terrible.  The shaver is cutting my face and not my hair.  Yesterday, I ordered a Panasonic shaver because I can&#x27;t afford to replace the blades every 2-3 months and get a crappy shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to love this shaver.  What a shame.</li>
            <li> Good replacements for the 5-series etc. I had issues with the foils failing earlier than what the cutters would need replacing for. They have lasted the advertised period though, so not a big complain, but it will add to the overall cost of the razor.</li>
            <li> Keeps my shaver working properly. Great price.</li>
            <li> A close shave is what I get every morning with this Braun Series 5 Combi 51S Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack. This shaver and shaving head make up what is for me the best shaving experience I&#x27;ve ever had in the 60 years I&#x27;ve been shaving. It is bar none the quietest shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. Others sound like a roaring jet engine in comparison. If you want a close shave that won&#x27;t make you deaf, choose this one.  :)</li>
            <li> A great electric razor-though-all our faces are definitly different! (Thank the Lord!) The Braun razor does a great, comfortable job- quickly too! With trimmer for mushtash &amp; sideborns too.</li>
            <li> I got my Braun razor for Christmas a couple of years ago because my then current $40 Walmart special was pulling and snagging, which can be quite painful.  I loved this razor because it never did that.  Well, the screen started breaking so I needed a new one, got this and guess what... It snagged and pulled.  I don&#x27;t know what is different from this and factory parts (I thought it was factory) but it doesn&#x27;t work as well.  The only noticeable difference was my middle (long hair) cutter was blue and this one is the same silver.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Braun-the Ultimate shaver-like being able to buy replacement parts that don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg  won&#x27;t shave with anythind alse.</li>
            <li> The replacement foil &amp; cutter fits Braun activator as described.  Fast shipping and easy to install on existing razor.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews before making this purchase.  I was a little concerned about buying this because of some of the negative reviews.  However, I have the Braun 8985 -- 360 Complete.  It was very easy to replace the parts and the first shaves were a noticable improvement with no problems or issues.  If you have the same series, I would recommend this replacement</li>
            <li> Just as ordered, and it made our life easier as we couldn&#x27;t find the new replacements and my husband has 2 shavers that need the replacement...didn&#x27;t want or need to buy a new shaver!  Happy you had the repacements.</li>
            <li> If you buy this foil and cutter you will be disappointed within a month. I&#x27;ve bought about 5 in the last year, despite the company suggesting I change every 18 months. After a month of use it literally hurts and pulls too much to use. I just bought the 30B foil and cutter for my shaver after reading other similar suggestions and it works great - the cutter is designed differently but the dimensions are exactly the same and it fits perfectly with the shaver. It makes me wonder why they even sell a foil and cutter specifically for the Series 5.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the low price of $24.39.  My last blade replacment cost me almost $50.00.  I always check Amazon&#x27;s prices before I make an online purchase and I almost always find the best price.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews posted for the replacement foil/cutter, I decided to buy it in spite of everyone saying that the new design is not nearly as good as the original.  Unfortunately, I have to report that it is significantly worse.  The new blade and foil leads to many pulled hairs (very painful).  The only way to avoid it is to move as slow as possible across your face.  I will say that replacing the old cutter did make a huge difference in both the closeness of the shave and ability to cut all hairs in one pass, but the pulling and ripping is not worth it.  Perhaps it is so close because it is no longer cutting, but just pulling all of the hairs out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saved my original blade and am considering switching back to it in spite of the increased shaving time.  I have contacted Braun/Proctor and Gamble with my concerns, and am still waiting to hear back from them.</li>
            <li> Amazon was not the first place i expected to find these replacement parts but it&#x27;s the first place I&#x27;ll go next year. Bought this Braun shaver (my first electric) at Sears a year ago for over 200 bucks. The foil and cutter are supposed to last 18 mos but lost their edge 10 mos into it. The Sears store is a joke for replacement parts - they&#x27;re locked on the racks (if available) and there is no help. I tried Amazon out of desperation - to my surprise the price was lower, item was in stock, and delivery took 4-5 days. I&#x27;m happy and clean shaven!</li>
            <li> After reviewing some negative and positive reviews, I ordered and tried the replacement pack. The product I received was made in Germany and I used it like a new razor {without as much pressure as with an old razor]. It worked fine. Just like new!</li>
            <li> Works great in my 5 series</li>
            <li> I have an older Braun Activator (aka 360 Complete) 8585 shaver.  I&#x27;ve tried both screens, this one and the 3 series unit (30B model) and I prefer the 51S.  The 30B is a bit easier on the skin and doesn&#x27;t pull longer hairs like the 51S, but, the 30B takes a longer shave to get the same closeness as the 51B.  The 30B seems to wear out faster than the 51B, likely due to my longer run time to get a close shave compared to the 51S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t let the beard get too long (say more than 2 days of growth in my case), no pulling and a superior shave from the 51S.  If you don&#x27;t shave as often, stick with the 30B.  I just wish the 51S didn&#x27;t pull the occasional hair.</li>
            <li> I did not expect this from Braun. I bought this replacement for Activator in March 2010 and it did not look the same to me. I thought it from Braun so went ahead with the purchase. Braun advises to replace cutter and foil every 18 months and the foil and cutter would easily last 24 or even more months. This one did not even last 12 months. The foil lining broke while I was shaving and it made streaks on my face. I am too disappointed with the new design that Braun came up with.</li>
            <li> This is the same exact foil and cutter as the original if you own a 360 Complete/8985 and it works great.  I was skeptical about getting this at first because of all the negative reviews, but it turns out those are all from people who have the Activator.  After replacing the foil it shaves like it originally did, with no nicks or cuts.  Buy this if you own a 360 Complete, try the other package if you have the Activator.  Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the confusion the different models have created.</li>
            <li> Great deal and prevents me going to A big box store for them only to be out</li>
            <li> In the 45 years that I&#x27;ve been shaving electrically,Braun is the best and the foil and cutter replacements are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> My husband uses his Braun Shaver every morning and is thrilled with his new replacement foil and cutter.  No more nicks from the old cutter!</li>
            <li> This is a necessary item if you want to get clean shaves for years. Noticeably better shaves father the switch is made.</li>
            <li> I read the poor reviews for this item and considered getting the 30b model instead.  I got this one since it was recommended by Braun.  I will admit that I got a lot of facial hair ripped out in the first 20 seconds of use.  I decided to figure out what the problem was.  I managed to get one of the few original activator/360 foil/cutter block.  I discovered that the old style requires more pressure on your face to get the job done.  This is compounded by an old cutter block that has seen more than 18 months of use.  I was simply pushing so hard by habit that I was getting hair pulled out by the new model. After figuring it out, I love it and think it is better than the old version.  I get a nice close shave again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short version, the old worn out versions don&#x27;t cut well and you have to push hard.  Don&#x27;t push hard with this one and it will work fantastically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I dropped this to 1 star.  After a month of use this cutter block might as well be labelled the braun epilator.  I grew to fear shaving if I had anything more than 1 day of stubble.  Using it softly wasn&#x27;t enough anymore and I would have to shave a pass with the grain, a pass across the grain, and then a pass against the grain to reduce the number of hairs ripped from my face.  Do Not Buy.  In fact, if you have one of the great braun 8000&#x27;s, you might as well buy a new shaver from another manufacturer to avoid the new cutter block altogether.</li>
            <li> Same as new.  It&#x27;s an OK, razor, but not the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I was relieved to get this replacement shaver head. The original and the first replacement heads were not very good, the shaver pulled hairs and burned my face. I determined that, if these were the same as the others, I would have to throw out my $150 shaver and go back to norelco. Apparently the company knew about this and changed the design of the openings to a more circular hole pattern instead of the triangular holes in the original. Still a little bummed about the shavers operation prior to the new heads.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. A bit expensive.</li>
            <li> My original foil had a little piece break off so I purchased this replacement. Works as it should, brings new life to the shaver.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t bother reviewing the overall performance of the razors themselves for which this is a replacement. Presumably if you&#x27;re in the market for one of these it&#x27;s a bit too late for that. So, I will just address the issue of whether or not you should bother buying this replacement. Does it make sense to replace the cutter head as often as the manufacturer states, or even at all? I can unequivocally verify that Braun is not exaggerating when they claim the cutter blocks wear out after a year and a half. I don&#x27;t know how the heck they quantitatively compute a percentage increase for the efficacy of a shave (25% better?), but qualitatively there is a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You probably think your razor hasn&#x27;t deteriorated over the year and a half, but it has. You just don&#x27;t notice it because it&#x27;s gradual. However, when you put a new cutter in, the difference is dramatic. The shave pulls much less, and is much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can argue it&#x27;s a bit unfortunate that the Braun cutter blocks don&#x27;t last longer. I tend to agree. But the truth is they don&#x27;t. This is especially true once they went to the Gillette-made cutter (with the beveled cutting surfaces). If anything, I&#x27;d recommend replacement once a year.</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly on my shaver.</li>
            <li> jury still out - the last time we bought this single it only lasted 5 months I instead of the 14 months one had lasted previously - blades were dull way too fast</li>
            <li> as advertised and with instructions and duct tape not needed lol</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for carrying these.  My razor is over 10 years old and runs great due to the new blades and foils every three years or so.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product for many years.This is the first time I bought it online.The product is the same as always but the price was less then I usually pay.</li>
            <li> It works? My razor shaves like new again. Replace every 6 months and you are straight!</li>
            <li> Shaver delivers a much more comfortable shave with the new foil and cutter.</li>
            <li> This is a great improvement on the old foil &amp; cutter rom Braun. I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for 15 years and suddenly my old 8585 has new life. I&#x27;m now getting the closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever gotten with an electric razor. My only gripe is the cost, $30+ for these replacments seems excessive.</li>
            <li> I have an 8000 series, and after several years the foil broke.  I read a lot of bad reviews on this, but decided to try anyway since it seemed pretty straight forward.  The replacement fit perfectly, and I think it performs better than my original foil/cutter ever did.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Office Home &amp; student 2013 software as a disc for best down load but same came as a internet down load card much to my dismay.  Elmer</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Thank you</li>
            <li> The instruction sheet for the Braun 8000 series recommends that the foil and cutter be replaced every 18 months.  Replacing the foil and cutter made a significant improvement in the performance of the razor.  Since the performance of the original foil and cutter diminished so slowly over time, the degree to which the performance of the razor had diminished was not fully appreciated until compared to the performance of the replacements.</li>
            <li> Its like getting a new shaver.</li>
            <li> A few years ago when I asked Braun about upgrading to the \\&quot;360 Complete\\&quot; head for my Activator 8595 shaver, I was told it was not compatible.  Funny thing:  A couple years later the only replacement head offered is this one that magically fits all three generations of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the other Activator owners here I am also in for a painful experience whenever I skip a day of shaving.  The cutter grabs and pulls the long hairs -- something that never happened with the original Activator cutterheads even as they were wearing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you shave every day you&#x27;ll probably be OK.  I, on the other hand am too lazy for that.  And I never shave on my days off which means first day back to work: OUCH!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, short of ditching your $100 shaver and buying a new one, there&#x27;s really no choice.  We can only hope that someone from Braun will see these reviews and make a change.  I&#x27;m not holding my breath!</li>
            <li> These fit my braun series 5 razor and worked good. Good buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My razor originally came with a \\&quot;smart\\&quot; foil. This foil has apparently been replaced by the \\&quot;opti\\&quot; foil (garbage). Now my entire beard is irritated. I called and complained about the change and was promptly sent.... a replacement optifoil garbage foil and cutter. Big help....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just trash or sell your razor and buy another brand. Quality at Braun has apparently gone to pot.</li>
            <li> This product has the different net shape on the head compare the original one.&lt;br /&gt;but the quality is acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;good</li>
            <li> I bought up two sets just to keep my 4 year old shaver running. No one locally, no grocery store nor drugstore, local or big chain, has any of these anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a little over a year, I&#x27;ll have to get a new razor because I won&#x27;t be able to find these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note: Mine is the old 8 series, and these work PERFECTLY. Thanks to the reviewers who recommended this product as a replacement!</li>
            <li> i proboably only used the new blades 5-6 times and today two pieces of it broke apart. im getting a replacement for this</li>
            <li> This product is the exact same thing you can buy at the store. It works perfectly. We saved a lot of money. The product arrived very fast</li>
            <li> As expected, but not quite the same quality as the original foil; replacement foils seems to have less dense whole spacing, but work reasonably well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this replacement foil and cutter after using the original for nearly two years.  The improvement in shaving comfort was amazing.  Next time, I won&#x27;t wait so long to replace the parts.</li>
            <li> Makes my shaver work like new</li>
            <li> Product arrived fast. It fits very nicely on the Braun shaver. It does lack the 360 Complete inscription, but does not affect form or function.</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; shipped super fast!</li>
            <li> The Braun Series 5 blades was as advertised at a great price. I would use this company again to purchase products.</li>
            <li> Best price around. The description says replace every 18 months, but I find it needs to be replaced every 6-12 months.</li>
            <li> I dropped my razor onto the sink edge and broke a chunk out of my screen. After replacing the blade and screen it shaved better than new! it could be thanks to the Lectric Shave.&lt;br /&gt;Gotta Love the Free Shipping! Fast and exactly as stated. Braun Series 5 Razor replacement is tough to find in Canada. I had to get a US address @ Montana Shipping Outlet and drive across. Amazon.com would not ship into Canada. Amazon.ca was $30 more on 1 item! I saved $100 on my entire order by going into the US. Thanks MSO for making this possible.</li>
            <li> Not as close a shave as the the Braun 3, I thought going up in price and newer would be better ,but turned out the Braun 3 is better , I would like to try the Braun 7 but cant afford</li>
            <li> I squeezed 24 months out of my 8595 before changing. I finally had to accept that the shaver just wasn&#x27;t inclined to cut wiskers any more. Buying from the Amazon Marketplace saved about 25% over local retail, and the product as listed was the correct replacement. Once again, I now experience a great Activator / 360 Complete shave!</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this replacement for my Series 5 razor after reading quite a few negative comments on here, but I went ahead and purchased it anyway as I didn&#x27;t see any better alternative and the shave has definitely been deteriorating lately.  However, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the replacement and it&#x27;s actually better than what it originally came with!  I have no idea where the negative comments are coming from, but my best guess is that they&#x27;re coming from people who are replacing parts on older razors, not the Series 5 razors.  However, if you are replacing a Series 5 cutter and foil, then don&#x27;t hesitate on purchasing this for a second!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original razor came with the SmartFoil, which has apparently since been replaced with the OptiFoil (same as in the 7 series), and now only the Series 3 and below are using the SmartFoil.  I&#x27;ve admittedly only used this replacement for one day, but from what I can tell, the OptiFoil is a significant improvement over the SmartFoil.  The shave is much closer than it ever was previously, and by far the closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten from any electric razor. It also shaves closer without needing to go over the same place as many times and seems to do a better job of lifting hairs.  I also have a tendency to get a few ingrown hairs which I previously had to pluck out as the old foil didn&#x27;t lift them, but so far, this foil has lifted and cut them off.  From what I can tell, the cutter seems to be exactly the same as what originally came with the razor, although this one is obviously much sharper than the one that was well over a year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, extremely satisfied with this purchase, and very glad that I didn&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews, which I don&#x27;t believe are related to the Series 5 razor.  It&#x27;s an improvement over the original, and the best (and fastest) electric shave I&#x27;ve gotten.  If anything changes, I&#x27;ll update this review, but I highly recommend this replacement for the Series 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/5/12: I&#x27;ve now been using this foil and cutter for a couple of months and just wanted to confirm that it&#x27;s still working excellent!  I&#x27;m now used to the fact that it&#x27;s just much better than the old foil, so I don&#x27;t really notice anymore, but the shave remains closer than it ever was with the original foil with less passes./&gt;Update 4/5/12: I&#x27;ve now been using this foil and cutter for a couple of months and just wanted to confirm that it&#x27;s still working excellent!  I&#x27;m now used to the fact that it&#x27;s just much better than the old foil, so I don&#x27;t really notice anymore, but the shave remains closer than it ever was with the original foil with less passes.</li>
            <li> This item seems to cost more than it should but it&#x27;s worth it to get a virtually new shaver. Makes your shaver perform like the day you bought it.</li>
            <li> Replacement long overdue, for fast shaving; I waited too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Hint - Have a tool handy for opening adult-proof packaging.)</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for my Braun Electric Razor expecting it would perform as well as previous replacements I had purchased in the past. I Was Sorely Dissappointed!!! It does not cut the whiskers, rather it plucks them!!! This item is of Extremely Inferior Quality! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have the 360 complete model and wish the foil said that (like my old foil did) instead of \\&quot;Series 5\\&quot;; it&#x27;s not a big deal though. It cuts like new again.</li>
            <li> Been needing a new blade and screen for a while - shaves were starting to become random with too many whiskers needing multiple passes at the very least.  Given that the series 5 is a bit older, it&#x27;s hard to find these parts in the store anymore.  Greatly enhanced my razor&#x27;s function and extended its useful life indefinitely.</li>
            <li> I usually change out my heads every 12 months instead of the recommended 18. But I have thick, coarse facial hair. I really love changing out to a new head, makes the razor seem brand new</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, was almost tempted to buy the series 3 foil and cutter (head) but resisted and purchased this for my 8585. In my opinion, this is great, the shave is closer than the original design head, faster, and the shaver sounds quieter ( i replaced the heads pretty close to the schedule). I have a heavy thick, beard and sensitive neck skin but this seems good. For those who complained about pulling, see if it helps to follow the directions - don&#x27;t press down on your face and move the shaver slower, let it do the work.</li>
            <li> Used it as a replacement for my Braun Activator 8595 shaver foil/cutter block.  So far, so good.  Shaves feel and look at the same as with the 8000 series replacement foil/cutter, so not sure what all the complaints are about.  Shaves are near-perfect and like a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Finally, the right one for series 5 and it&#x27;s \\&quot;Made in Germany\\&quot;.  With all the \\&quot; made in China\\&quot; junk reviews I was reluctent to order.</li>
            <li> shiping &amp; sales it was very good, produd no so good. my  old replacement it was good tha the new.[[ASIN:B001VEK1IU Braun Series 5 Combi 51S Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 8000 360 Complete or Activator)]]</li>
            <li> Like having a new razor,packaging difficult to open.however super easy to install.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly best shave I&#x27;ve had in a while</li>
            <li> Everything worked out perfect. Good deal great service</li>
            <li> Yeah, the product works. The new foil and cutter actually feels like it trimmed my facial hairs and made my face smoother then the 2 yr old dull one it replaces. Thanks Braun for making these replacement items and selling them together. That may save me money, which surprises me. You have the chance to sell them separate and charge more money. But Braun, you felt for you customers, so you sold them together and made me feel I got a great deal. A big corporate company actually cares about my wallet. Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Received as expected.</li>
            <li> I have an older Braun 8595 Shaver that is going into it&#x27;s 9th year of daily use and still runs as well as the day it was new. It used the older 8000 series foil and cutter heads and I was a bit nervous trying this new 51S cutter given some of the reviews.  After 2 weeks of shaving there is no discernible difference between this model and the older 8000 series.  It cuts just as well, with no irriation and even comparing the two side by side - the appear to be almost identical.  I will buy these foil and cutters again.</li>
            <li> good product, fits original shaver, does a good job.  Vendor is a fast shipper, will use this vendor again</li>
            <li> I thought by replacing these for my husband that his razor would work like new. That is not the case. Looks like we are going to have to buy a new unit instead.  It just doesn&#x27;t cut as close as it used to.</li>
            <li> This product works fine with my 8985 series shaver.  I do not experience any of the problems reported by the others.  I shave daily, occasionally skipping a day, with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why only 4 stars?  I still feel that my last Panasonic shaver did better than this Braun, and I primarily attribute that to the foil/cutter design.</li>
            <li> braun website wanted 40+ for the same thing and this was genuine</li>
            <li> Great price for these replacement parts</li>
            <li> just what I needed and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Great product, I bought the replacement razor for my Braun Series 5 360 complete.  The package came with two replacement parts ( the razor itself and the grate guard that goes on top).  I only replaced the razors and kept my original guard.  The razor is like new again.  No issues, as promised.</li>
            <li> I received it on time, in good shape and works great, thank you.</li>
            <li> Makes my razor NEW again!</li>
            <li> Great price for what i purchased.  Fast shipping with prime.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.  thank you.</li>
            <li> I have bought several of these cutters over the past few years. It was getting harder and harder to find them so I decided to look on Amazon. I was surprised when I found it so easily and it was ten dollars less than anywhere I had priced it.</li>
            <li> This foil/cutter performs well and should last approximately one year before needing replacement. At approximately $25, the one I purchased was quite reasonable.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if it is any better than the original shaver foil and cutter that came with my shaver, as it performs similarly.  My old foil used to pull the occasional hair, but this one has not as of yet.  So, in essence, I guess it has had a bit better performance so far, but in only a fraction of the time that I had used my old foil and cutter.</li>
            <li> I used my original cutter and foil set for well beyond two years without significant decrease in effectiveness. Since I first started purchasing replacements, I have not managed to get even two months of use of each of 3 sets, and the effectiveness did not match that of the original even when first installed. The  most recent set I purchased will be my last, and I will be purchasing a new (non-Braun) shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I hope Braun eventually gets the message that they need to pay as much attention to the quality of replacement parts as they do of the original, as this is a huge black eye for a company that I&#x27;ve always regarded with respect.</li>
            <li> I used this foil and blade as a replacement for the 8595.  I used it three times and it pulled hairs and cut my face each and every time.  It is in the mail and is being sent back.  It is a junk replacement.  It is not anyway like the original blade/foil that came on the razor.  Do not waste your money on this model.</li>
            <li> Not quite the same quality as the original, but cuts my disgusting face admirably, and cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> Nice close shave. I wish they would stay sharp longer. Usually replace after 4-5 months</li>
            <li> I like the razor for several reasons.  Fast charge, fairly long lasting, easy to use, and has a set of 5 lites to show battery power left.  I have used most other popular brand razors and like this one the best.  However, the replacement pack doesn&#x27;t last very long before it starts to get dull.  Around 3-4 months to tell much change. I have a light beard, not too thick.  The initial cost and replacement pack cost is too high for it&#x27;s usability.  (around $150)  I do not know if I would buy another Braun like this, but maybe another Braun model.</li>
            <li> The foil and cutter performance appeared good at the start but within a very short time (about 6 weeks of shaving once per day) the amount of cuttings reduced.</li>
            <li> I had replaced my shaver heads every 18 months like the manufacturer said, but I got behind on this latest replacement.  I went 2 years with the same heads and what a relief it is now to put in the new blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaver hummed like I had just opened it from the original packaging.  I wrote the date down on a sticker that I put on the docking station for the shaver.  This time I will not miss the replacement.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to buy this replacement with all the negative reviews out there, but i had no problem - smooth shave, had a few nicks but no more than what i had with the original shaver - i have sensitive skin.  beautiful shave.</li>
            <li> I have owned a Braun shaver for years and have previously replaced thebroil and cutters by simply ordering from Braun. I recently decided to purchase some from Amazon and was excited to find them at what I thought was a fair price. There were two model numbers available  and I chose the 51 S ( manufactured by Braun). They were a little bit more reasonable than the other model number advertised. Not knowing the difference and assuming it was an item of same quality and  bought two sets. To my dismay I quickly realized that the 51 S is nowhere near the quality that the razor originally came with. This foil constantly snags my facial hair and has proven to be a horrible investment. I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone. In fact I am faced with buying yet another set in order to onve again shave comfortably and not have my face ripped off everythime I put the shaver to it. Save your money or invest in the more expensive foil and don&#x27;t look back.</li>
            <li> First couple shaves were good. Went down hill from there. Less than ten shaves later I&#x27;m thinking I should buy a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li> Easy to install. Makes razon work like new. However, change in stock numbers created some anxiety until it was installed.</li>
            <li> I have a Braun Series 5 razor. I have had it for a LONG time. I want to explain what some people are complaining about concerning this replacement blade set not being as good as the original. The first time I replaced the blades on this about 2 or more years ago, YES, they sucked. I called Braun before ordering this NEW set (foil and blades) and they informed me that it is now back to being the same as the original that came with the razor. IT IS! I still have the original blade and foil set AND the REPLACEMENT set that basically SUCKED. This NEW one is EXACTLY the same as the one that came with the razor. I think they tried to lower the quality a couple of years ago and didn&#x27;t realize that people were going to complain and then went back to the original design. Anyway, I installed this NEW set and trust me, it shaves GREAT. I have a HEAVY beard. I usually use this to shave with first and then use a conventional razor and shaving cream to get a REALLY close shave. I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at 4 o&#x27;clock. This new blade set gave me a REALLY nice shave after three days of not shaving. For me, that is like trying to shave strands of metal.&lt;br /&gt;SO, they are back to the ORIGINAL design. This is the same EXACT blade and foil set that came with my razor.  I WON&#x27;T be buying a Braun electric in the future because they are owned by Gillette. I hate that company. They DID try to cheapen the blades on this razor like I said, but obviously gave in to pressure when people complained. Gillette owns Braun. Procter and Gamble own Gillette. I hate that company. They have a monopoly on the shaving industry except for Panasonic. Panasonic electric razors are rated great in Consumer Reports so my next electric will be a Panasonic. First because I hate the Gillette company for outrageous over pricing and also because Panasonic has better ratings in consumer reports.  I DID NOT GET THIS PRODUCT FREE OR AT A DISCOUNT IN RETURN FOR A REVIEW</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s shaver was actually hurting him - replaced the baldes and it is like new again!  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> They were exactly as advertised.Ffit my razor, and it was so wonderful to be able to shave again without the pulling.</li>
            <li> Braun series 5 combi 51s foil and cutter replacement pack is good, only replace them every 6months and good price.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d ordered this years ago. My ten plus year old razor shaves like new after this little tune up.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Battery lasts a long time (4 or 5 shaves). Shave is very close, closer than old remington or norelco that I had.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the negative comments. I bought the new foil and cutter and when I used it for the first time I thought I made a mistake and put the old one in rather than the new one. There was no improvement from the old cutter and foil. I only wish that I hadn&#x27;t bought I years supply of the cleaner because now that will be a total loss as I now plan to look for a new razor (not a Braun).</li>
            <li> Good for shave due to quality</li>
            <li> Made my four year old shaver brand new</li>
            <li> My Braun razor was purchased quite a while back. For Amazon to stock it&#x27;s foil and cutting blade  plainly shows the depth of Amazon&#x27;s stock room. Seriously this razor is about ten years old. Well, it&#x27;s new now. And although they may have come from the stock room,the cutter(s)were as sharp as a blade can get, with no irregularities(nicks, shavings of metal, etc.) The foil was also in perfect condition, snapping on my razor sharply.&lt;br /&gt;I have seen this exact same package sell out of N.Y.C. for around $50, so I felt it was an amazing deal, almost bought two.</li>
            <li> I WAS BUMMED OUT TO READ THE REVIEWS OF THE BRAUN REPLACEMENT CUTTER/SCREEN FOR MY 8585 SHAVER WHEN IT WAS TIME TO REPLACE MINE. THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST SHAVER FOR MANY YEARS AND IT SOUNDED LIKE THEIR QUALITY WAS SHOT AND ALMOST TO THE POINT OF&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;PERHAPS IT&#x60;S TIME TO SWITCH BRANDS\\&quot; AND LOOKED AT THE PANOSONIC AND THOUGHT IT LOOKED LIKE A TRUCK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE PERSON WHO RECOMENDED THE 7000 SERIES (NOW 30B) REPLACEMENT AS YES, IT FITS AND WORKS PERFECTLY ON MY 8000 BRAUN, IS CHEAPER, SAYS MADE IN GERMANY ON PKG., IS BLACK NOT SILVER (BIG DEAL), AND AS SOMEONE REPORTED THE PLASTIC PROTECTIVE COVER DOES NOT FIT EXACTLY, BUT WILL STILL WORK, JUST DOES NOT SNAP IN PLACE.</li>
            <li> nice replacement blade</li>
            <li> It is a good replacement part. I just deduct a star, because these parts last much shorter now than some years ago.</li>
            <li> The PX can&#x27;t beat this price.</li>
            <li> I have owned the series 5 shaver about 3 years and never replaced the head befor.  I was pleased at the price and the new closer shave.</li>
            <li> Installation is simple.  The shave is quick and smooth.  Excellent product.  I would recommend it to anyone and I will purchase again when needed.</li>
            <li> This a replacement block and foil. Original Braun. What&#x27;s there to review? Works as it should. Fits my 8000 series shaver. That was the only doubt I had.</li>
            <li> These are the original replacement parts!!! Happy I found them, my razor feels like brand new!! I will be ordering another one.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I needed a replacement foil/cutter for my shaver. I could not find the right one in the retail store so I searched on-line and found this one. Everything about it was as described. Delivery was as described. No troubles throughout the process.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, nothing to rave about.&lt;br /&gt;Bought it once and the second time you raised the price, so that wasn&#x27;t very smart on your part</li>
            <li> Very good I did not know how bad a shave I was getting until shaving for the first time with the new foil and cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d.</li>
            <li> In the past there were many bad reviews for Braun replacement cutters.  I held off getting this, but when the price dropped, took a chance on it.  It works great.  It looks just like the previous cutter and is made in Germany.  It gives such a fast, comfortable shave it&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Braun changed the package and how they number their razors/refills.  I used this with my 8000 self cleaning razor, I think its an 8985 or 8595 or something.  In any case, as usual after replacing this stuff it shaves like new.  I purchased the razor in the spring of 2005 and change it about every 12 -14 months, still going strong.  I considered buying the new braun but changed my mind when I saw how much it was and knowing that with the new blade mine will be 94% as good as the new &#x27;improved&#x27; version.</li>
            <li> I, like others, was a bit put off by the difficulty that some users were experiencing with this replacement foil set. Since my foil/cutters were nudging 20 months (Braun recommending changing NLT than 18 months, IIRC) I was having a real tough go shaving. Cutters had definitely had it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no other options readily available, I ordered the 51S for my 8995 shaver (at least 5 years old?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package is marked Made in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil looks identical to the 360 Complete foil I removed except for the \\&quot;360 Complete\\&quot; logo. Cutters appear to be same size as original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installed the parts and the shaver cuts like new. I have a tough beard and I had forgotten how smooth this shaver can perform. What was taking 5-6 minutes is now back to 2-3 and with substantially less aggravation to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned. I need to change foil/cutter more often than the factory recommends. I am curious how well these parts will maintain their performance. That said, performance is lost so gradually, you compensate for it without realising it. eg pressing harder to make sure its cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using the 8000 series, 360 Complete style, I do not see a problem with this replacement.</li>
            <li> My last \\&quot;proper\\&quot; Activator kit in my 8585 was getting long in the tooth at nearly two years, and I&#x27;ve been putting off replacing it because of the bad reviews I&#x27;ve been reading on this new pack. Once I started noticing people having better experiences with the ones made in Germany, I decided to pull the trigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side-by-side, the blades on the 51S cutting block are much wider than the Activator block from my 8585, but I didn&#x27;t think it would be a huge deal. Similarly, the holes on the new 51S foil are much more uniform (if not a tad smaller) than the design of the foil on the original Activator foil. Nothing looked drastically different, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of comfort, the 51S felt great, like a new kit should. But something seemed a bit off. After shaving, I noticed that I had lots, and lots of stubble. Enough that it felt the same as 18 - 24 hours&#x27; growth. I did another pass with the 51S, and didn&#x27;t find different results. Then I put on my old block and foil, which knocked the stubble off with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if Amazon takes these back (it would be kind of gross if they did), so I&#x27;m going to go straight to complaining to Braun. Before buying the 51S, I was considering getting a new 700 series, but at this point, I&#x27;m starting to wonder if it&#x27;s worth considering a different brand altogether.</li>
            <li> Fit my 8000 series perfectly</li>
            <li> this is the second foil that i&#x27;ve bought for my older series 5 shaver. the shaver is a great product and i like that you only have to replace the foil every 18 months. i actually wait until almost two years (procrastinator) and the quality of shave does not suffer much even at that point. the foil is a bit pricey, but will continue to order more when required as i do not plan to get rid of my shaver.</li>
            <li> Good price for a quality product with prompt delivery. Will buy from them again.</li>
            <li> They fit. They worked and were as decribed, they came quickly. What more could you want? Buy them for any 5 series shaver.</li>
            <li> It took a little longer than usual, but it&#x27;s understandable when is coming from South Korea. No complains.The main thing is that I saved money.</li>
            <li> This set made in Germany.  I think it&#x27;s better.  I use with Williams Lectric Shave so the shaver glides over my skin..</li>
            <li> Good product as described. Good seller, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I pay for! Good value.</li>
            <li> Made my shaver like new.  Great</li>
            <li> Great purchasing experience. The product shipped in great time, was the right part without damage, and replaces the worn out parts as promised, and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This was the second order of the shaving head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; as always it was very good &amp; lo cost I thank you w hamlin..</li>
            <li> After reading many negative reviews of how this upgraded foil/cutter was worse than before I was nervous ordering it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing there is an update since that review. I&#x27;ve experienced none of the issues mentioned, quite the opposite. The cut is good. As good or better as when my last foil/cutter was new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine indicated made in Germany not China.</li>
            <li> I love my Braun 8585, but after the original cutter became dull, I bought this replacement. I was terribly disappointed to find that it did a poor job shaving my stubble. Making matters worse, it pulls and tugs my hair, making shaving a painful experience. Then I learned that the Braun 30B replacement cutter - which is actually made for the 7000 series shavers - fits perfectly on the 8585 and does an absolutely fantastic job. So do yourself a big favor and don&#x27;t buy the 51S. Instead, buy the 30B and enjoy smooth and comfortable shaves that are even closer than the original cutter head on the 8585.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> WELL WORTH THE MONEY, EXTREMELY CLOSE SHAVE AND YOU LOOK GREAT. I WOULD BUY AGAIN!  YOU CAN NOT GO WRONG WITH THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Like having a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Series 3 foil and cutter as well, and even though this one costs more, I think it&#x27;s worth it since I only replace about every 2 years.</li>
            <li> I replaced my existing blade / screen with this one. It pulls on my facial hair sometimes and makes it a lot harder to get a clean, painless shave. The screen is not like the one that came on my razor, but this is the listed replacement part. I would not buy this again. I almost want to switch back to the old one because it is slightly better even after being used for a year and a half.</li>
            <li> Replacement cutters work as meant to.  The Braun razor unit itself though never worked as advertized, tends to miss large portions of normal beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought a Panasonic ES-LA93-K Men&#x27;s 4-Blade instead.</li>
            <li> I read a few different reviews of this product. Some people gave it low marks saying it was a third-party product with questionable quality. Needing a replacement for my 8985 razor I ordered it anyway. I figured I would give it a try before I ended up buying a new razor all together. This was my second replacement foil/cutter for my razor. I bought the first replacement from the same place I bought the razor originally. This replacement is actually better than the first replacement I bought. So, would I buy this product again? Yes. Would I recommend it to a friend? Yes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that it would help so much and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> It is difficult for me to find replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s razor.  I decided to try Amazon, because I have been very satisfied with past transactions.  This was no exception.  The product was just what we expected, and the service was excellent.</li>
            <li> because I received two responses saying my cards were not good. they requested a third card number. after the second req, I did nothing . the product did show up on my door step, last week as was stated when I made first card number purch. that card wasnot billed my second was billed the correct amount.</li>
            <li> Bought the replacement cutter and screen for my Braun Shaver from Amazon because it was the best price I could find.  I saved $11.00 over Walmart price.  The cutter and screen has made my shaver shave closer.  I had not replaced the cutter and screen for over a year and a half.  Good price and Good product.</li>
            <li> Best price I have found on these bad boys, good ddeal</li>
            <li> It was time for a replacement foil, and the local department stores quit carrying this model. I was only able to get it on Amazon, and the razor once again performed like it was brand new.</li>
            <li> After replacing the old set (which was overdue) I could immediatley tell the difference. The shave went faster and closer.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is my second or third foil and cutter replacement.  This is a pretty good feature of the Braun Series 5 because the replacement essentially returns the shaver to near new condition.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and the product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The cutter replacement pack fit like a glove on my Series 5 razor and worked perfectly as expected.  No issues and experienced a close shave as expected.</li>
            <li> Best price for authentic brand replacement.  Fast ship.  Much nicer shave with fresh foil and cutter.  Will buy again as needed.</li>
            <li> Factory Braun replacement part, perfect fit. Don&#x27;t risk it, buy Braun Original replacements.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver,  wore out one head and this replacement head makes it like new again.  First head lasted 3 or 4 years.</li>
            <li> Last one of these only lasted four months- had some breakage in the blades - you can see holes under the foil where the blades are gone.  It can cut you if  a blade is missing.  I may have caused some the damage by cleaning with a brush.  The blades are very thin, so it is best just to use the liquid cleaner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to replace the blades in my Braun razor. It&#x27;s like I have a brand new razor! I love it, definitely worth the money to get new blades.</li>
            <li> Always great delivery by Amazon and Braun razors or replacement parts the best.</li>
            <li> After replacement my Braun series 5 was like new. My shave was closer and quicker without irritation.  Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Easy to replace.  I can&#x27;t remember ever getting a shave this good when the razor was new.  I had the razor for about two years and this is the first time I replace the cutter and foil.</li>
            <li> Saves like new again!</li>
            <li> Using it with my Braun 360 complete and works fine.</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as new.....but pretty close.</li>
            <li> blades and screen are perfect. I don&#x27;t have any cleaning solution but it works great and looks great. Was sent to me packaged pretty good as well so that was a plus.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the help, product is GREAT! ! !</li>
            <li> Great seller ! Awesome prices and fast delivery. A++++++</li>
            <li> Compl&amp;egrave;tement satisfaisant</li>
            <li> Works like new a close and smooth shave better then the 30b that others suggested cost little more but worth it for a close shave</li>
            <li> This product is really just as I expected...I&#x27;m getting &#x27;close-shaves&#x27; again!</li>
            <li> It might be more then 5 years since I replaced this but the point is it is very durable. Hope to get another 5 plus years.</li>
            <li> The replacements appear to work fine but time and useage will determine if they hold up and last as advertised or fall apart as badly as some of their other products .</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Items have restored my razor to the shaving comfort when it was brand new.</li>
            <li> no manufacturing defect.  tough plastic wrapper takes sharp knife to dig through, so I knew it was unused in a tamper proof package.</li>
            <li> I recently replaced my Braun Activator 8585 with the 51S foil and cutting block. Like others, I noticed that it is not the same as the original, so based on other reviews, I also picked up the 30b foil and cutting block. I&#x27;ve had a chance to try both of them now, and I much prefer the 51S for my 8585 shaver. Both gave me a comfortable shave, but the 51S gave me a closer shave faster. I also tried the 51S with longer stubble, and didn&#x27;t experience any discomfort or hair pulling. My 8585 now shaves like new, maybe better!</li>
            <li> Great shaver as long as I replace the cutters and head every year.  It is cheaper than any other shaving system.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good replacement for the Braun Series 5&lt;br /&gt;Easy to replacement, just as good as the original parts</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks now, and when I don&#x27;t shave on the weekends my hair grows out a little. Then when I shave Monday morning I have to move very slowly to reduce the pulling of facial hair. I have only experienced this before when I was shaving really fast or on a low charge. Not very happy with this new foil and cutter, but what are you going to do about it. It does shave close and a little smoother then my old cutter and foil that is now worn out. If you have thick facial hair you may want to consider another replacement.</li>
            <li> I have used this razor for many years and have used Amazon for ordering replacement packs because of easy accessibility and reasonable pricing. My only recommendation would be to have quicker delivery time. As long as the razor works well, I will probably reorder blades etc. from Amazon, until I decide to order a different razor.</li>
            <li> I also needed a 8000 series foil and read the horror stories about this replacement. It works. It may not be quite as good as the original but its not like it doesn&#x27;t work like the others have said. Been using it for about two months with out issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the 8585 since about 2004 and it&#x27;s been working great. The last time I ordered the foil and cutter block was from a 3rd party seller on amazon. I did order from the 8000 series page but received a package that looked different from what I had received in the past. I originally thought they sent me a fake one especially after I started using it since it hurt to use around my lower jaw area and chin. Since I thought it was a fake I came here (thinking of ordering another one) and read all the negative reviews and realized it was the newer version of the foil and cutter block that was just poorly made. I&#x27;m at the moment looking for the cutter block for the older models (Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack). I might risk getting it since it has good reviews. Once my current shaver gives up, I&#x27;ll be switching over to a different brand (probably panasonic). When companies start making stupid moves (why ruin something that worked perfectly in the past), it&#x27;s time to ditch them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wrote to Braun asking them if they were aware if \\&quot;Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack\\&quot; would work with the 8585 but they wrote back saying that they recommend only using the ones made for a particular model. They even offered to send me another 51S but I refused saying there&#x27;s no point of enduring more pain by using the 51S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw, I&#x27;ve been using my 51S for a few months (2-3) now, it has held up just fine, but it hurts when using it... I have to be extremely gentle especially when using around the lower jaw since it seems to hurt the most there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE 1 ***&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been communicating with a person who purchased the 30B (http://www.amazon.com/review/RPRFO9DLBSJM7/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_detup_redir?_encoding&#x3D;UTF8&amp;cdPage&#x3D;1&amp;asin&#x3D;B001VH6F9G&amp;newContentNum&#x3D;10&amp;store&#x3D;hpc&amp;newContentID&#x3D;Mx1FBNLU575B874#MxZJCE2GDWEFOT) and he confirmed the blades were thin as before. I went ahead and ordered the 30B and it arrived today and I put it on and everything looks fine so far (except for the looks and also that the travel case plastic cover doesn&#x27;t quite fit since there is no notch on the foil cover but both these are extremely minor). I will shave with the 30B next week and post my experience then. I&#x27;m quite sure this will work just fine and it it does I&#x27;ll order a few of the 30B in case Braun manages to ruin the 30B as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE 2 : The Shave Test ***&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 29 years and usually shave every Mon, Wed &amp; Fri. I last shaved on Wednesday and today is Sunday. I was originally planning on shaving with the 51S today and do the same next week and use the 30B next Sunday. But I decided to shave half with the 51S and half with the 30B. I started off with the 51S and it was just so painful to use. It was almost like pulling on my hair (it felt like I was poking myself with a needle) and I stopped soon after starting with it. I then switched to the 30B and it was a world of difference. I could hardly feel anything when shaving with it. If I had shaved half my face with the 51S, I probably would have landed up with half my face red and with several cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my strong recommendation is to avoid the 51S (I will most likely avoid Braun in general from now on) like the plague. However if you are unlucky like me to have the 51S and plan on using it until it&#x27;s advertised life, you might want to shave more often (like daily or every other day) else be ready for a very painful shave. Please also check out the 2 images I&#x27;ve uploaded (available in the customer images section).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE 3 : Test to determine which part is at fault ***&lt;br /&gt;Some people have stated that the new foil is at fault for the horrendous shave while I&#x27;ve firmly believed that it is the cutter block at fault. To find out, after shaving on Sunday, the next day I shaved was on a Wednesday. I first started off with the cutter block of the 51S and foil of the 30B. The shave was just as painful as before. I then switched to the cutter block of the 30B and foil of the 51S. It was just as smooth as using the earlier 8000 series or the 30B (cutter block and foil). According to me, the cutter block is the reason behind that horrible shave and Braun should be ashamed of putting such garbage out there.. I then switched to the cutter block of the 30B and foil of the 51S. It was just as smooth as using the earlier 8000 series or the 30B (cutter block and foil). According to me, the cutter block is the reason behind that horrible shave and Braun should be ashamed of putting such garbage out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun 8585 for years...I ordered the replacement cutterblock and foil and received this (it&#x27;s the new version of [[ASIN:B0002MQ9GK Braun 8000 Activator Combi-Pack Foil and Cutterblock Replacement Parts for Braun&#x27;s Activator Razor Models 8595 and 8585]]).  I found the shave quality decreased and the blades started pulling whiskers.  If I skipped a day shaving I paid the price the next time I shaved - a very painful shave with many pulls.  Also I was nicked more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally replaced the cutter and foil on my 8585 with this: [[ASIN:B001VH6F9G Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 4700,7000)]]. It fits perfectly and gives me an excellent shave. No more pulling, no nicks, and a closer shave. Definitely the way to renew an 8000-series razor.  Read my review of that product (http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BR8AFAHU584G/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B001VH6F9G&amp;nodeID&#x3D;&amp;tag&#x3D;&amp;linkCode&#x3D;) for more detail.  Just avoid the 51S and get the 30B!</li>
            <li> I got this for my stepdad for a present since he was complaining about his razor now pulling on his hair while he shaves.  It made his razor like new-so sharp that he wasn&#x27;t used to it in the beginning.  The replacement head was a wonderful investment!</li>
            <li> The above item was submitted as indicated above with information of address and credit card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dealer charged for above item then sent replacement for Norelco..</li>
            <li> Great product!  Cheaper here than buying at the store</li>
            <li> My husband is happy with the replacement parts on his razor</li>
            <li> This is an update to my previous one-star review. I&#x27;m happy to say that the problem with this product has been fixed and now it works exactly as I remember it working when my 360 shaver (model 8595) was new. I&#x27;m amazed at how close the shave is now and how much quicker it gets the job done. I had been using the [[ASIN:B001VH6F9G Braun Series 3 Combi 30b Foil And Cutter Replacement Pack (7000/4000 Series)]], which was acceptable, but seemed to bog down unlike the original or this one. Seeing newer positive reviews encouraged me to take a chance on this one and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they only seem to last for a year but less than a two years. And even though the series of these foil cutters is over 6 years old, they still tend to be a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Great Price, shipping and Product. The new Braun blades and foil seem to be superior to the original product. Keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Wow, what an upgrade over the old, patterned Activator foil. 3-days of facial hair growth without one pull. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Love this product: been using it for more than ten years.</li>
            <li> The foil and cutter makes my old razor like new again. This product does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I&#x27;ve had to replace these items on my razor occasionally and I have not yet been unhappy with any of the replacement parts.</li>
            <li> the best electric shaver available!</li>
            <li> They sure don&#x27;t make them like they used to. When I first started using Braun, I could get 2-3 years out of a foil. These last 6-8 months for an everyday shaver. Still, it&#x27;s a good shave. I just wish the manufacturer would concentrate a little less on obsolescence.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Will order more in future.</li>
            <li> Caution - This foil does not fit a Braun Series 5 723 shaver. The cutter does fit and seems to work ok with the old foil.</li>
            <li> The cutter worked fine, easy to install quickly.  The new screen does not fit my razor, and after several tries of installing, I just reused the old one on the new cutter. I am sure the new screen and cutter work better and shave cleaner when used together. Delivery was a little slow for Amazon, but then it was shipped from Ireland.</li>
            <li> The Braun Series 5 head doesn&#x27;t seem to last as well as it seems it should.  We are going to try a different brand.</li>
            <li> Just like what you&#x27;d buy at Target only half the price.  My razor is working like new again.</li>
            <li> Item completely satisfied my requirement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great replacement. I wish I didn&#x27;t wait as long as I did to buy a replacement.</li>
            <li> I replace my foil and cutter when the foil starts to tear, roughly after a year or so.  These breathe new life into the shaver.</li>
            <li> Provides a good shave.</li>
            <li> Works as expected from Braun</li>
            <li> I would recommend this replacement pack for anyone looking for a foil and cutter for Braun 8000 series electric razor.  Shaves like new.</li>
            <li> This replacement foil was quite in expensive as well as the cutting blades that came in the packaging as well. It&#x27;s funny, now with the replacement foil and blades my Braun 5 series legitamitely gives me a cleaner, and closer shave with less irritation than the original foil did. I believe that&#x27;s due to the different shaped holes in the grating of the replacement foil.  Either way that was a great purchase! Would definitely recommend if to men with fine to very coarse hair it cuts effortlessly.</li>
            <li> I have a Braun 8995 and this was the replacement for it, but it has changed.  The foil design is significantly different and although everything snapped in place the way it should, the foil appears to set down in the razor just a little bit deeper than the original.  The razor head ends protrude very slightly above the foil and the original set did not.  Have yet to shave with it since it is sanitizing in the cleaner station, but if it does not shave well, I&#x27;ll post an update.  Very confusing seeing a different foil design and heads/blades for most electric razors are over-priced and these are no exception.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews of this replacement set it was with some apprehension that I ordered and swapped them into my 5000 series Braun. However, there was no need for concern. The replacement screen and block are visually identical to what was on the shaver from the factory and the resulting shave is smooth, close, and comfortable. I don&#x27;t know if the product has changed since the poor reviews were written or if the 5000 series is \\&quot;more compatible.\\&quot; But, if you have a 5000 series Braun don&#x27;t worry about the folks that have had poor performance on the non-5000 series shavers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to have a close shave again.  Took me a while to find the replacement for my razor.  Thank you</li>
            <li> This feels like an exact replacement for my 5 series shaver. Its been 18 months since I purchased the shaver, and it feels like new again. I have had issues in  the past with the replacements not feeling as good as they should, but so far this one seems to be the right match.</li>
            <li> Finaly after toomany years I decided to replace my foil and cutter and... My razor is as new! Best 30 bucks ever spenton a product that is authentic and made in Germany.</li>
            <li> I needed to change the foil and cutterblock on my shaver as I wasn&#x27;t getting a close shave any longer. I purchased this instead of the normal model number I usually use as it said it works for my shaver (8000 series). Well, I don&#x27;t know if it doesn&#x27;t work well with my shaver, or it&#x27;s not very good, or my shaver&#x27;s getting old, but it didn&#x27;t improve the shaving in the slightest. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This cutting foil has a great life span. So happy to have it on auto ship, so I don&#x27;t have to try and remember when to pick them up. My husband is so pleased to have a new foil delivered every 6 months.</li>
            <li> Product works well as specified. Now I get a good smooth quick shave, no scraping or pulling.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these 51S foil and cutter replacements for my Braun 8985.  The first one lasted almost 10 months.  The second one lasted just under 4 months.  Both times, the 51S foil developed large holes in the mesh that made it painful to shave.  After reading several of the reviews here, I plan on trying the 30B foil and cutter replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Update.  I ordered the 30B foil and cutter replacement and it fits perfectly on my Braun 8985.  The 30B seems gentler than the 51S in that the 30B does not yank on the hair with the same force as the 51S.  I definitely recommend the 30B over the 51S.</li>
            <li> Great replacement for the Braun razor.  And so much easier than hunting all over locally for it.  Great price.  Will be ordering again in the future.</li>
            <li> The New replacement pack installs easy and made the shaver work like new. I recommend buying this product if your shaver has lost its edge.</li>
            <li> I have had my Braun razor so long they no longer produce this model, buy my model number converted to the newer model.  After years of use I would use this to trim my mustache and that was about it. I had never replaced the head in the eight years I have owned this product. This was money well spent for $39 I now have a like new razor that produces a great close shave.</li>
            <li> Ordered as a &amp;#34;paired&amp;#34;, this + this option from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This foil and cutter set was not the correct match (fit) for my new Series 5 razor.&lt;br /&gt;This pairing was a mistake by Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Product is probably fine for the appropriate razor model.</li>
            <li> This razor head is a hard to find item and it came in perfect condition and at a better price than the last time I had to replace it.</li>
            <li> Must be replaced often or shaver is not effective. The 3 head Norelco/Phillips style is more effective and simpler to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this in March this year. I though spending more means a better product but it last less than 5 months.  I have been using Braun shavers since 1969, so I know how to take care of their shavers and blades, don&#x27;t push it into your beard and keep it clean and all of that. I will select a different one, cheaper, and see how log it will last.</li>
            <li> Made shaving with my Braun much nicer after replacing the cutter and the price beats the only local store I could find that stocks it.</li>
            <li> new cartridge.  Was difficult to identify the one for my exact shaver but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s my own problem.  Price very high which is why 4 stars instead of 5</li>
            <li> Timely and good price</li>
            <li> Product is great, packaging is terrible, very hard to open and process.</li>
            <li> It was good, but a new razor was better.</li>
            <li> The foil and cutter replacement work absolutely great.  I don&#x27;t agree with the negative reviews.  I have had my razor for a long time, and this product makes it perform like new again.</li>
            <li> what can you say it is a replacement part of a worn out part it works like the original as by design.</li>
            <li> This is a razor head replacement and works just fine. Good product. BUT, why is it that when a person orders razor blade replacements for callous tools, they come packaged in simple paper and card stock boxes, but these things have to be contained inside mini plastic vaults? I hate the packaging on these things and I wish they could just sell them in paperboard or a simple foil bag with cornstarch foam. It is just overkill.</li>
            <li> Other reviews have mentioned that their old foil/cutter combination seemed to work better.  I have experienced the opposite, thankfully.  My first couple of shaves with this replacement did leave me nicked but that seems to have stopped and my shaves are back to being quite close and comfortable without the need for medical intervention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this pack again.  I&#x27;m assuming that my initial problem was either an installation issue or maybe a short break-in period.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacements that are hard to find in any local store.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal. It meets my need. Being unshaven is not favored at home. Having to pay big replacement costs for parts is annoying.</li>
            <li> This replacement pack worked fine on my 8000 series shaver.  I was a little nervous that it shows \\&quot;Series 5\\&quot; but rest assured it will work fine on your 8000 series 360 Complete model too.</li>
            <li> the first foil and cutter I installed did not line up properly and didn&#x27;t work correctly.  I had to replace it.  I have replaced the foil and cutter about 10 times and this is the first time I ever had a problem.  Hopefully it was just the one.</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality for your shave machine, I would advise to replace it once a year. I got it and then I felt my shave machine was like new.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews on here I decided to give this a shot for my Braun 8975 360 Complete. Changing it out is simple and the razor was as good as new when it was done. No problems at all with fit, or performance.</li>
            <li> By Marjorie&#x27;s husband:  Severely disappointed in this for my 8000 series Activator shaver.  The cutter block blades are thicker and the foil pattern isn&#x27;t as good as the original.  Only good thing is its cheaper. But that is small comfort for poor shave, takes a long time to get a close shave, parts fall off from unknown places after a few weeks of use. It has me shopping for a whole new shaver and I am hesitant to look at Braun products.  The original was great and while the cutter foil assemblies didn&#x27;t always last the 18 months promised, a lot of them DID and did well.  The one I&#x27;m using now, don&#x27;t know if I got it at Amazon, Walmart or Fred Meyer but its the poorest yet and only been attached for a couple months and already yanking whiskers. Love the shaver unit for long battery &amp; charge life, easy use but the plummeting quality of cutter replacement may force me to abandon it. And sadly when they can be located, the original cutter replacements are insanely expensive.  11-20-13 update.  Decided my face was chewed enough and opened a new cutter pack - surprise - I mistakenly bought one of the Series 3 models for the 7000 series.  Tried it anyway. The cutter in this one is more like the original for my Activator.  The foil screen doesn&#x27;t quite fit right but it will fit and the set works tho the shaver is a lot more noisy.  Maybe &#x27;cause its brand new it works quite well.  My face is smoother and not chewed - got the job done in a couple minutes and far fewer passes than the old Series 5 set. I&#x27;ll have to see how long this works. Since I had stock piled a couple cutter sets, I&#x27;ll run thru them before deciding to dump this old shaver or not. Biggest dilemma is what to go to if I change.  I&#x27;m sure wary of anything that uses the Series 5 set.</li>
            <li> Economical way to get replacement cutter.</li>
            <li> Went through three of these in the past year, no more, switched to Panasonic a couple of months ago and I&#x27;m not looking back.</li>
            <li> Not the right fit for my shaver.</li>
            <li> I love my Braun shaver, and this is a quality replacement pack, bringing the shaver back to new performance capability.  However, depending on how long you shave each day, this will NOT typically last 18 months . . . not even a year.  I really need to replace mine every 6-9 months . . . which is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I just replaced the foil and cutter of my 8000 series razor with the 51S. The cutter block fit fine but the foil wouldn&#x27;t stay on the head. It always popped right off. I tried to adjust the tension of the foil by gently compressing it. It broke. Although it looked like metal, it is made out of plastic. I am used to a good quality product and have used Braun shavers all my life. I don&#x27;t understand why it did not fit.</li>
            <li> Works like a new razor.</li>
            <li> Original and at a great price, delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I own a Braun 360 model 8985. This replacement was reasonably priced, arrived quickly and gave me a close, comfortable shave. I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit on my razor. Makes razor seem like new. Much cheaper than buying a new razor. Easy to replace.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s Braun razor works like new with the new Foil and Cutter replacement.  Saved us money by not having to purchase a new razor.</li>
            <li> If I replace the foil and cutter on my Braun shaver every six months then it cuts well enough for me. With this maintenance, it keeps my electric shaver working.</li>
            <li> Fit my razor perfectly. You don&#x27;t realize how dull your blade is until you replace it. I forgot that the hairs were not supposed to be ripped out at the root but finely cut. Much cheaper here than at the box store.</li>
            <li> Great price for this becoming hard to find replacement parts. Got my Braun 8000 series working like new again. I recommend replacing every 6 months rather than waiting a full year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good while it lasts but these things go bad in a about a yr. and a half. And they should&lt;br /&gt;be sold separately because the blades or cutter last much longer than the Foil.</li>
            <li> wrong one. Had to send back</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is my actual electric razor itself or replacing these Foil &amp; Cutters (which did improve my shaving). Though my previous one I noticed had a cut in the foil itself it was like 3 years old, I am lucky I did not keep using that. But I find the part on the back(Trimmer) is so weak now, the machine is pretty old though (prob 3-4 years old). It is supposed to be quick using an electric razor but this Braun series 5 RAZOR takes me about 30-45 minutes cause I am constantly going over spots i&#x27;VE TRIMMED.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with Braun shavers since 1984. I&#x27;ve tried most of the models over the years. I bought my most recent Braun 550 two years ago.  I just replaced the foil and cutter and WOW what a difference. The shaves are closer, quicker and more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;The 51S I received was made in Germany. The foil is slightly different than the original I think for the better. The original foil I had was the OptiFoil with random honeycomb shaped holes, this new 51S has more symmetrical circle holes (look at the picture carefully by zooming on the packaging and you will see). I think this new foil gives a closer and more comfortable shave, kind of like the previous generation 8000 series used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE one year later:  FIrst couple of months was great but it quickly degraded.  I can only tell the difference because I bought a new 590 series shaver I bought 1 year ago about the same time as I bought the replacement 51s foil.  I still have the original foiil and block on the 590. I alternate between the two, but this summer I used the replacement 51s foil entirely.  The original 590 foil that I use now that is now over a year old gives me a much smoother and gives me a less painful shave than the replacement foil.&lt;br /&gt;In summary I have about the same hours on both shavers and the original foil has lasted longer than the replacement 51s foil and block.</li>
            <li> This item will cost you double if purchased elsewhere! I should have gone straight to Amazon.com instead of wasting time looking for it on other websites.</li>
            <li> Why buy a new razor when you can buy a new head and have the old, familiar razor work like brand new? That&#x27;s what this new foil and head combo can do for you. Good price! Sign up for pre-scheduled deliveries and save EVEN MORE!</li>
            <li> This works very well and usually last me closer to 2 years since I don&#x27;t exactly have a heavy 5-O&#x27;Clock shadow.  It&#x27;s very easy to replace by popping the old one off with the button on the side of the head and then just slipping this one in it&#x27;s place.  I get a clean, close shave and it doesn&#x27;t tear up my skin.</li>
            <li> good price, and fast shipping</li>
            <li> The blade fit my razor but the foil didn&#x27;t. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just like a new shaver.</li>
            <li> After I learned the trick to clean the blade through running water instead of brushing it, it is difficult for me imagine when I will buy another replacement.</li>
            <li> I have had an 8585 for 6-7 years.  My last two foil and cutter replacements were from the same lot that people have been complaining about here -- some snags and discomfort on a 2-day beard.  I almost gave up on it, but then decided I don&#x27;t want to spend so much on a new razor right now; so I just ordered another foil and cutter with the idea that I could bear with it.&lt;br /&gt;Well...it looks like they fixed it, and more.  Perhaps Braun had a good idea with their cutter redesign but then had some bad early production runs.  What I just received is amazingly smooth; even better than I remember the original.</li>
            <li> My husband said the foil was quick and easy to replace. Much better shave now with new foil. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great price. We like this product</li>
            <li> My husband has been very pleased with it .</li>
            <li> This is exact&lt;br /&gt;Y what I needed</li>
            <li> Like a lot of things packaged these days this was a little hard to open but nothing that a pair of scissors couldn&#x27;t handle easily.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product, I do not remember it saying anything about a LONG delivery time.  Turns out this product ships from South Korea, and it must come by canoe given the length of time it took (over a month) to get here.  When they notified me of shipping, the delivery &amp;#34;date&amp;#34; was given as a two week window about 5 weeks away.  WHen your razor has a hole in the screen, who can wait 5 weeks for a replacement?  New screen worked just fine on my 8000 series razor, would have given it 5 stars except for the shipping problem.  THey should make it known UP FRONT on the listing that delivery will be longer than normally expected.  For me - I will find my next replacement locally.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical buying this online as my shaver is older and was not sure it would fit or work right.  After reading the reviews from others and seeing that it would fit with my shaver, I went ahead and purchased this replacement foil and cutter replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that my shaver works like the day I bought it and really does a great job of cutting the hairs.  I do not have to go over the same areas multiple times as I did in the past as my blades got old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy these in the future and the price on Amazon can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> it is important that you periodicly replace the screen and the blade. there really is no substitude around so they have you by the short hairs in regard to price. i think its way too high but if you want a good shave who are you going to complain to ...your president? he&#x27;s on a constant vacation...thank God so he can&#x27;t do any more damage.</li>
            <li> I really like my shaver but it was starting to not work like new, after replacing the foil and cutter it is like new again.</li>
            <li> I decided to give my old but very reliable 8585 cordless another year of use; so, I ordered this kit.  I&#x27;m really glad I did.  The foil and cutter assembly fits perfectly in the 8585, and my first shave was perfect, even with 3-4 days of growth. After regular use for over a month, I haven&#x27;t had any complaints: no redness, no nicks, no hairs getting &amp;#34;pulled&amp;#34;. One of the smartest buys I&#x27;ve made in a long, long time.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I waited to long to replace my last blade.you should replace at least every 12 to 18 months it does make a huge difference. the blades were cheaper but you should compare prices before you buy, I did find some blades online that were more than local retail.</li>
            <li> CUTTER AND SCREEN ARE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY AND THE PRICE WAS VERY REASONABLE. WILL PURCHASE AGAIN WHEN THESE ARE WORN OUT.</li>
            <li> The cutter block and foil on the original shaver was much better.  This new cutter block and foil are not as good but it is all you can find for my shaver.  Since Braun sold out to P&amp;G and now has Gillette making the cutter block, the shave is not nearly as good.</li>
            <li> The Braun Shaver head was very reasonably priced versus the Braun website that quite often charges a premium. I paid a fraction of the cost at about $20.00 for the replacement head. It was shipped in the plastic molded container and was easy to install onto the shaver. It is important to clean this head daily in order to prolong its life.</li>
            <li> I was about to buy my third set and read the reviews posted here.  I have been a Braun user for decades and have used a 5 series for about five years.  The reviews brought home how unsatisfied I have been since replacing the original block and foil.  My current set was about a year old and my wife mentioned that I wasn&#x27;t getting a good shave.  She was right.  Twice the effort for a poor result.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of buying the foil and block, I bought a new Panasonic high speed shaver for less than $100.  Braun needs to focus on retaining customer loyalty.</li>
            <li> It gives and excellent close shave for the first 2 months, then starts loses its edge after that time. It still give me a close enough shave in the morning, but if after 2 months of used I probably have to shave twice a day. Product says to replace every 18 months.</li>
            <li> I have the Braun 8585 with the cleaning system. I purchased this replacement foil &amp; cutter from Amazon back in May 2011. I read the reviews and was concerned about quality but found the reviews helpful about making sure to not push too hard for the best shave. The replacement worked fine for me. I noticed about 18 months later that I was working too hard to get a good shave so I just bought another replacement. Working great, don&#x27;t have to work hard, a light touch and I&#x27;m getting a close shave. Note that both times I purchased from Amazon, not a third party seller.</li>
            <li> Good product, but overprice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Braun 8000 series shaver for nearly 7 years and it&#x27;s still performing exceptionally.  I typically only have to buy these new blade replacements about once every 2 years.  I&#x27;m a daily user of the shaver as I use it to shave my head cue-ball style.  It&#x27;s a nice close shave and only takes about 5 minutes per day.  I&#x27;ve never tried using a regular razor to shave my head, but never thought I needed to since the Braun cuts the hair so close.  I would give it a 5-star rating for quality, but have to knock off 1 star due to the high price of these replacement blades.  Clearly, this is a particularly profitable item for Braun.  However, it&#x27;s certainly a lot cheaper than going to the barber every two weeks.  Have been using this replacement blade for many months now.  Has not lost its performance, even with minimal cleaning.</li>
            <li> What can I say , I get a good shave. Braun is one of the greatest shaver around. Owned this one for 8 years &amp; is still working.</li>
            <li> Works good, just wish Braun would make the Gillette heads again like what originally came with the 360 complete</li>
            <li> How did I let this go for so long.  A big difference in closeness and comfort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these replacement has now for about 2 to 3 weeks. The shave is fairly close, closer than the prior 7000 series replacement heads. I would recommend these heads. They seem to be the closest to the original.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as the original</li>
            <li> Perfect drop in replacement for my 8000 series</li>
            <li> I have replaced my screen and cutters twice now, and both screens developed holes after only a few weeks use. The original lasted 18 Months, as advertised! Worst replacement product ever...</li>
            <li> Great replacement for when the cutter gets dull and the foil gets damaged. It was time for a replacement because my dad&#x27;s electric razor&#x27;s foil got damaged and he never changed the cutter from when he first got it. I use his electric razor to edge up the back of my neck and ever since he changed it, there is a dramatic difference. It&#x27;s smoother and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation. This set comes with the foil and the cutter and although this is something you might change once every 6 months or once a year... or just never, it is pricey for what it&#x27;s worth because it can get dull really quick especially if you use this every day. This cost just about the same as an 8 pack of razors and doesn&#x27;t nearly give you a close enough shave as a razor.</li>
            <li> I have to go to multiple stores to try to find this replacement foil and cutter locally.  Amazon is an easy and affordable way to obtain these necessary parts.</li>
            <li> I entered Series 5700 in my search. The last time I ordered about 18 months ago, the product was stocked. Now only series 5 came up, so I hoped for a fit. Alas, not! The cutter worked but the foil design has changed and is no longer compatible with the older model razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would have been helpful if the ad had specified &amp;#34;not compatible with Series 5700 razors&amp;#34;. I had no way of knowing, without trying the product. I wasted half my money. My advice is to be cautious when purchasing replacement electric razor parts. Models can change with no warning,</li>
            <li> Inproved shaving for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> A standard foil/cutter package at at very good price. I was considering buying a new Braun, but when I saw they use essentially the same head, I just got this, and it works fine.</li>
            <li> perfect.  just like original.</li>
            <li> The original one lasted two years</li>
            <li> Worked on my razor perfectly. Installation was simple and directions straight forward.  I wish all of my purchases were like this.</li>
            <li> Great product Great Price</li>
            <li> As this is a replacement component of a product I&#x27;ve used for years - all I can say is this is the same as what I paid a lot more for in a local store</li>
            <li> like having a new razor</li>
            <li> great product love this razor and so happy to be able to get replacement parts</li>
            <li> This fits the bill if you need a exact replacement for the 360 complete buy this with confidence this my second purchase.</li>
            <li> I installed this in my Braun series 5 and was amazed as to how close the shaves now are. Once you get used to an older one you don&#x27;t realize what you are missing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why people are giving this such bad reviews. I only had this one for 4 days and its great. i had the different one  for my 8595 braun. this one cuts a lot smoother then the older version. The foil it self is a littler thicker then the last one so im guessing this one will last a lot longer. the older version did cut a littler closer then this one but all around this one is better in my opinon. i will update my post if i have any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard the 30b fits this shaver and i checked it out and the foil and cutter are the same as the older version that came with the shaver. so if you want the same thing then go with the 30b. 51s is better!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money if you think this will work on your Series 8000. It will tear your face to shreds. Do not call Braun for help. They will steer you in the wrong direction. Other reviewers will tell you the correct replacement. It is not this. I get a better shave with a $20 battery-operated shaver than I do with my 8595 using this foil &amp; cutter.</li>
            <li> I had overextended the original shaver head.  I love the smoothness of the new blades!  It is really quiet too.</li>
            <li> Just a replacement for my razor - since this is made by Braun then I would expect that it works as expected.. Now I add more test to reach the character count.</li>
            <li> Why did the big stores stop carrying this item?  Who knows?  Anyhow, I am glad to have run across this on Amazon.  I use it daily.  :-)</li>
            <li> There are no electric razors that can compare with Braun. The unit I have, I keep clean easily and replace the screen and head&lt;br /&gt;every year.</li>
            <li> This is about the third replacement blade I have bought for my razor and while the service was really very good with the parts arriving within 3-4 days it&#x27;s worth pointing out that that it looks like at some stage Braun changed the design slightly so that although the blade still fits my razor perfectly fine, the foil has been redesigned and therefore did not fit.&lt;br /&gt;Really annoying as i obviously can&#x27;t get the full benefit from the purchase, so check your particular model carefully!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these foil replacement heads for over 7 years now and the quality is excellent. Braun makes a good shaver and these foil heads make it shave even closer.&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon price is so good that I replace the heads annually instead of every 18 months. But these from Amazon and your wallets will have $$$&#x27;s left over to buy yourself some lunch.</li>
            <li> i waited way too long to replace these items, i just got accustomed to how it was performing. what a difference this made, i won&#x27;t hesitate again to buy this item and replace on the recommended schedule.</li>
            <li> this product made my old Braun razor feel like new. I have found that these need to be replaced about every 6 months in order to keep from getting bad razor rash and irritated skin. Although they are more expensive than I would expect for such a simple product design it is worth the money since it saves my skin from irritation and I avoid the cost of the disposable razors that I would need to buy.  This is a very simple product to remove from packaging, install, and begin immediate use. A frequent consumable for Braun Razors that does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> seems more expensive than it should be, but when you change this out after 1-1.5 yrs the difference is quite noticeable.</li>
            <li> what is there to say other than it is the replacement part for the Braun shaver, that it arrived in new condition and it works.</li>
            <li> Been ordering these Brain cutters for several years and they work fine, always arrive on time.</li>
            <li> I bought this replacement pack for my Braun Series 5 shaver.  I immediately noticed the improvement in quality over my older, worn-down foil/cutter set, especially when I used it after letting the hair grow for a couple days.  It only doesn&#x27;t rate 5 stars because even when used daily, there tends to be a small bit of unnecessary discomfort while shaving the neck region that I had not experienced with past shavers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure it&#x27;s as good as the original but it works fine especially considering the price compared to brick and mortar stores.  I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Braun replacement blades and cutter is like getting a new razor and lasts quite awhile, I replace them every 6 months</li>
            <li> Everything I&#x27;ve read on the newer shavers from Braun seems to indicate that there has been no real advancement in the shaver over my nearly decade old Braun.  Mmm, maybe ex-Apple engineers work there. ;) This basically gave me a cut like the day I purchased it and I&#x27;ll probably get another ten years out of the shaver as long as I can keep replacing the foil and cutter.</li>
            <li> I too had read many of the other reviews here that say how horrible this shaver replacement is, and I too was worried just like you probably are.  I put off ordering one since I didn&#x27;t want a piece of junk, I wanted a real replacement.  I haven&#x27;t replaced my foil and cutter in about 4 yrs (and they recommend doing it every 1.5yrs) and it was getting to where I really really needed to, even at the risk of getting what many here are calling a junk replacement.  Well, since I couldn&#x27;t find any others, I ordered the &amp;#34;Series 5, 51S&amp;#34; for about $30.  When it came I noticed the foil head had even-sized small holes throughout, whereas the last replacement I bought (~4 yrs ago) had more of a honeycomb look to the holes.  &#x27;Oh boy&#x27; I thought, &#x27;Maybe this will be a bad thing like so many others have said&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope, not a bad thing at all!  It works perfectly!  It is so smooth, so much quieter than what my other cutter/foil had become, it&#x27;s almost as if it&#x27;s a new razor  altogether.  I have a thick heavy beard, similar to Homer Simpson it seems I have a 5 &#x27;oclock shadow an hour after I shave.  I had a 3 day beard when this arrived and I started first on my neck.  It plowed through like it was a gas-powered lawnmower.  I went on to my face, same thing.  Beautiful!  It really made it quite clear how bad my other cutter had become.  Instead of 5 or 6 litle passes over the same spots, this one took care of the stubble in 1-2 passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a Braun 8985, BEFORE it was branded &amp;#34;360 Complete&amp;#34;, or Syncro, or any of that.  Mine has no LCD display on it, just the plain Braun 8985 from, if memory serves correctly, the early 2000s...not sure if this makes a difference in fit or performance.  The attached pic is exactly what mine looks like, but it&#x27;s a stock image for reference. This foil cutter fits it perfectly, and works flawlessly.  Honestly, I realize this sounds cliche, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  If memory serves me correctly, I paid double this for replacements in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the many negative reviews of this Series 5 replacement, perhaps other sellers are selling factory seconds, or perhaps there&#x27;s some slight fit problems with the newer models of the 8900 series such as Activator and 360, I don&#x27;t know.  But the one I got from this seller, &amp;#34;EveryDay-Shop&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;@ http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VEK1IU?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;od_aui_detailpages00&lt;br /&gt;was the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and I hope this is helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wont bore with other sahving details.  Suffice it to say, if you&#x27;re worried about all the other bad reviews saying how uncomfortable this setup is, youplacements in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the many negative reviews of this Series 5 replacement, perhaps other sellers are selling factory seconds, or perhaps there&#x27;s some slight fit problems with the newer models of the 8900 series such as Activator and 360, I don&#x27;t know.

            <li> My shaver was not working well and was getting sluggish. I assume this is all original equipment for my old Braun shaver. But I could no longer find these parts in our local stores. So I bought this and it works great. My shaver now works like it is brand new and I am soooo happy. Good Luck.</li>
            <li> Shaver works as well as it did when new. Would definately buy again.</li>
            <li> I was ready to purchase a new shaver, but thought I would take a chance on this kit.  It was so easy to replace the old parts and it feels like a new shaver!  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Now getting a close shave. I replace this item every 18 to 24 mo and it brings the old razor back to life.</li>
            <li> Braun series 5 foil and cutter replacement works fine on my model 8595. Supposed to last about 18 months, we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this replacement foil and cutter. Everything came as shown. I recommend this product. Just make sure you&#x27;re matching the correct foil to model number of your shaver.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected and much cheaper than big box stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again when I need another replacement foil and cutter.</li>
            <li> I needed this for my old Braun 8975 shaver.  I&#x27;ve had it for years and still works great.  It wasn&#x27;t CLEAR that this is a valid replacement part, but it appeared to be the case - and it is.  This costs about half of what I was paying at a somewhat nearby shaver shop.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this foil and cutter before.  I works well and gives a nice close shave.  Purchasing it through Amazon is about the best price I have found.</li>
            <li> Changing the Braun Series 5 Cutter Replacement Pack was a great move for me. It gave me a new razor. Very easy thing to do! I had my original blades for 18 months this change gives me a new Braun!!!</li>
            <li> Glad I was able to find this.  Thought I was out of luck when the local Walmart stopped stocking it. My husband has had this shaver for several years, and if you regularly change the foil and cutter, it works like new.  He&#x27;s been very happy with this system.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Thanks, it works great and shipping couldn&#x27;t have been better.</li>
            <li> This is my 1st replacement shaver foil. Don&#x27;t know how a product made in Germany can be bought for less in an Asian country. Hope its not a fake.</li>
            <li> The item was as I expected.  It&#x27;s actually a Braun product instead of a cheap knockoff the I had previously bought online elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Makes my shaver work like new again.  I have a tough job finding an electric razor that works well for me.  This is the only one that works well.</li>
            <li> My original Braun 8000 series razor is still going strong even if some of th epaint is wearing off.  The replacement foils and cutters are very durable as well. I&#x27;d complain about the cost but after comparing the cost of disposable heads like the Gillette Mach 3, I won&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Wrong size for shaver. Purchased as gift and return time expired before it was delivered. Numbering is confusing on Braun...be careful.</li>
            <li> I dont know when the last time i replaced my shaver head but this replacement pack is a huge improvement.  It is much smoother than the previous version.  I am very happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for several days now and i love it every time.  I find that there is less irritation as well.</li>
            <li> bought this replacement and as always delivery was on time and well protected.  worked well and continues to work properly with a clean easy shave.</li>
            <li> A replacement foil and cutter added new life to my razor!  I had gone a little long (2 years) to replace the foil and cutter.  Good value and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was expecting, thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun 8000 series shaver for more than 5 years now and like it. I&#x27;ve been using the recommended replacement cutting parts. I bought the 51S less than 1 year ago and the foil has come loose from the center support. So, the part is ruined in less than 12 months despite a recommended 18 month service life. I am going to try the 30b replacement this time.</li>
            <li> Razor cut like new again. I didn&#x27;t realize how dull it was until I replaced. This was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Braun 8995 for a number of years now.  I purchased it initially because of the awesome, smooth shave that the Gillette-branded blades provided.  After Braun switched to the new 5-Series branding the quality of the replacement heads declined quickly.  I have extremely sensitive skin and a curly beard, which has become increasingly more so as I&#x27;ve gotten older. I used to be able to shave once a day, but over time I&#x27;ve had to reduce to twice a week to avoid skin irritation and ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement 51S blocks I&#x27;d used in the past produced so much skin irritation, ingrown hairs, and tugging/snagging while I shaved that I gave up on them.  I even tried out alternative blades from the 3-Series razor which actually worked better for a time, but they dulled very quickly due to the much thinner blades in the cutting block.  In what I can only assume was a cost-cutting measure, I was soon unable to find those thinner-bladed 3-Series replacement blocks and stopped buying blades entirely for close to two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was heartened to see so many recent positive reviews of the replacement 51S replacement pack, and I noticed that they had returned to being produced in Germany, so I decided to give these blades one last try before replacing the razor entirely.  I&#x27;m so glad that I did.  These recent 51S blocks are a huge improvement over what they used to be.  I&#x27;m treated to a sharp, fast, close cut with minimal skin irritation on my neck where I usually get ingrown hairs. The new foil style really makes a difference in making sure that even the hairs growing parallel to the skin are raised and shaved.  I don&#x27;t have to keep going over and over the same spot to catch all the little stragglers.  My shaving time has reduced from 12-15 min down to 7-8 in most cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do still occasionally get a tug or a snag which is very uncomfortable. I have yet to figure out what causes this, but it doesn&#x27;t happen often enough for me to consider a different razor yet.  We&#x27;ll see how these blades hold up over the next few months.der a different razor yet.  We&#x27;ll see how these blades hold up over the next few months.</li>
            <li> I have the 590cc and this was a perfect fit/replacement for the original foil and cutter I&#x27;ve had for about a year and a half.  Works like a champ.</li>
            <li> This product makes my shaver like new again:  Smooth shave, and easy to install.  Price was better than my discount store.  Braun products rock!</li>
            <li> Purchase this item about every 8 months or so for my husbands shaver to keep it functioning at optimal performance. I usually shop the price as these can get pricey.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference so I&#x27;m assuming that it works fine so I can&#x27;t really rate it other than average so not bad or not great.</li>
            <li> I chose the  rating id did because of the ease of getting the old worn part out of the razor and the way the new part just sets in without the need for tools&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had been asked to rate the ease of getting the part out of the package it would have gotten less than one star</li>
            <li> The replacement set fit was perfect in my 4 year old 51s razor.  Very happy to have the razor performing like new on this old face.</li>
            <li> I bought three of them.  And one I am using is broken already.they should be better than this and  I wish to get the original ones</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this cutter and received what I expected; a cutter that fits like the old one and improves the shave. My old cutter was 5 years old and it took a long time to shave and the shave was no longer close and comfortable. The new cutter and foil is a much closer, faster and smoother shave. I have a Braun 360 degree shave and this cutter and foil came recommended as a replacement. I strongly agree!</li>
            <li> Amazon has asked me to rate this product. Therefore I will say the obvious, these replacement parts for my electric razor are German and they do what I expected them to do: they work. I suppose if they had surprised me with more I would have given them five stars. If they had disappointed me I would have given them no stars.</li>
            <li> I get the smoothest shave I ever had with the Braun foil and cutter. It is the greatest.Shaving is no longer a chore,</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase this item again and recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase this item again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Fits my Braun Series 8585 fine, no muss, no fuss. A little excessive packaging for just a cutting head and foil but that just my opinion.  Cutter and foil work great.  &#x27;nuff said.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews, that this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; setup was going to start yanking my beard hairs out or something, but after using it, I can&#x27;t detect a discernable difference from my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; ones, which were working just fine aside from a little hole in the foil. I looked this over at Walmart too, but came back to Amazon to save almost $13.</li>
            <li> Men don&#x27;t realize if they don&#x27;t change the foil and cutter in their Braun Series 5 they will end up cutting and tearing their skin. This product is so easy to change, don&#x27;t have to have a PhD. I make sure that my husband changes his foil and cutter replacement when he needs to. He didn&#x27;t even realize that I had been changing it for him, until he came out with his face looking like someone took a food chopper to it, bleeding from tiny cuts all over!!! Now, he is a convert, changes it when it is supposed to be done!</li>
            <li> The original foil broke and I did not want to throw away the shaver because it works very well.  Thanks to the replacement foil I don&#x27;t have to throw the shaver away and I have the pleasure of experiencing an excellent shave again.</li>
            <li> The braun shaver series to me are the best on the market. The heads and cutter get worn and have to be replaced.. I think there is more money to be made in replacement parts than the shaver purchase itself.. Its a necessary evil to me sorta.  Hi dollars for such a small part... There is really no choice&#x27;s in this area of shaving.. You only can get this part number to fit and its a matter of where you are going to purchase yours.. I got the best deal at Amazon..  I love it and rate it a 5 because it is in the braun fashion a superior quality item and it works awesome ..  Beware of the different prices on this thing.. It is listed in a couple of different packages for some reason and I bought one which was around $10 higher than the other.</li>
            <li> As stated, the new replacement head made my old shaver as good as when it was new. This is the second replacement pack I&#x27;ve purchased but the first on wasn&#x27;t this make (Braun). This is the one I&#x27;ll buy again. I thought I was going to have to buy a whole new electric shaver since mine is seven years old but luckily I found these replacement cutters and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Update Feb. 12 2014- My Braun 8585 shaver finally gave up completely after 7/8 years. I intended to buy the latest version Braun 7 Series but after reading the reviews I changed my mind. Decided to stay with what I know works; the 8585. Searched and found it here on Amazon for $599.00!! Found another for $499.00!! Finally found another one on USAWORLDSALES.com for $150.00 + tax/shipping &#x3D; $184.99 total. That&#x27;s $18.00 more than I paid for the first one but if I get the same service from it, it&#x27;s $ well spent. This replacement cutter/foil now costs less than it did when I purchased it in 2013.</li>
            <li> A great price for the Braun Series 5 Combi 51s Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack and so easy to order via subscription via Amazon every 6 months.  So easy to remember to change your foil when the replacement part comes right to your front door!  I&#x27;ve been using the Braun electric shavers for over 10 years and I love them!</li>
            <li> I wish I could return this horrific foil. Having used the same Braun for over 3 years, I decided to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to this foil from my original Activator 8000 series. What a mistake. I get razor burn every shave and the foil grabs my stubble making every shave extremely painful. The old foils didn&#x27;t do this after 18 months of use! This does it after 18 seconds! I am writing Braun in the hopes they will swap it with an old style 8000. AVOID THESE!</li>
            <li> It appears to be damaged material that was sold at a lower price.</li>
            <li> This worked very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun 8985 electric shaver for a few years now, and I&#x27;ve gone through several sets of cutting blocks and foils.  This is by far the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting block and foil sets are supposed to last about 18 months before you need to change them.  Replacing the set is supposed to return your shaver to like-new condition.  That&#x27;s what it says on the packaging.  My previous replacement sets were great and lasted me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one lasted one shave.  I don&#x27;t have an extremely thick beard or anything, but these blades couldn&#x27;t cut through my whiskers without yanking many of them out.  It also just refused to cut many patches on my face.  I was forced to go over and over many sections of my face until it was smooth.  The irritation was worse than if I used a 1-bladed disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if Braun switched manufacturers to save themselves some money, but this ruined a perfectly good electric razor.  And it was a huge waste of money, because it was more expensive than the other replacements I bought.  The other low reviews on this product show that I didn&#x27;t just get a defective one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could recommend a different replacement set for this, but apparently this is the only one.  If you&#x27;re looking to replace your foil and cutter, I&#x27;d suggest cutting your losses now.  Spend your money on a decent 5-bladed razor and a pack of refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Braun customer service about the poor quality of this set of blades. They seemed very apologetic, and actually sent me two free sets. I have yet to try the new ones they sent to see if they&#x27;re any better, but it was a very nice gesture and definitely appreciated, considering I purchased this set for almost $40.</li>
            <li> I got the 51s as a replacement for me 8000 series think I was do for a change after 3 years. To that point I couldn&#x27;t have been happier with my shaver.  The foil cutter is terrible.  I felt like i was going to my face with sandpaper and my shaves took 3x as long.  I was tempted to go through my trash been to find the old &#x27;beat&#x27; foil. I don&#x27;t even have a thick beard and it was a struggle several times through&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Alternative****&lt;br /&gt;I read on a few blogs that people had success using a \\&quot;30B; series 3\\&quot; replacement meant for a 4000/7000 series. I gave it a shot and my shaver is like new! It matches up perfect with the 8000 series, its just a different color plastic.  Its also cheaper.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to perk up a razor that was not cutting the hairs well and pulling in some cases..easy to swop it out.</li>
            <li> Oherwise, you&#x27;re sanding your face, not shaving it.  Love this razor when it&#x27;s new, but it doesn&#x27;t take long for it to dull and make it feel like you&#x27;re plucking the hairs off your race, rather than shaving.</li>
            <li> LOVE MY BRAUN SHAVER, SO I HAD TO REPLACE FOIL &amp; CUTTER AFTER 1 YEAR</li>
            <li> Brings new life to my shaver</li>
            <li> I am comletely satisfied with the product (working better than original one) and delivery on time(exceed my expectation). Recommended this side to my friend.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this replacement and I&#x27;m glad I did, no issues hubby said it felt great ,no hair pulling!</li>
            <li> I have used my Braun series 5 for two years and I just replaced the head. It made a big difference.</li>
            <li> Simply put it delivers a close shave the best I ever had with no razor burn.  Not sure how anyone can complain?</li>
            <li> You have to replace your foils every 18 months (and that is about right) and this is a good and economical way to do that.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. My current Braun did not shave as close after a few years. I thought I would have to buy a new one. But, I just bought this replacement package and it works like new. Thank you. And I received it in 4 days. Thanks again :)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to repair and tune up my razor, making it like brand new again.  I would buy another.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe what I was missing by now changing out the foil and cutter sooner. I shaved half my face with a razor and the other half with my braun and my wife could not tell which side was which. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Gradually, ever so gradually, it took me longer to shave.  Replacing the comb and blade made me realize I&#x27;d waited too long to do it.  Shaves now are much quicker and clean again.</li>
            <li> Just like a new shaver!</li>
            <li> I purchased my Braun razor about 11 years ago and it has worked wonderfully as long as I buy one of these each year so it stays sharp.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Manufactured where I had hoped and works well.</li>
            <li> Since my husbands shaver is a 8000 series I was a little hesitant to purchase this replacement. It fits great and is just what he wanted</li>
            <li> I replace this part every few months. Keeps my 8000 series working like new. This is the best price I&#x27;ve found for this item</li>
            <li> Easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality spare part.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for 12 months without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;The price is little bit higher</li>
            <li> these are hard to find in the stores. not sure if they discontinued them or Braun is not making them but it is great to find them online and avoid the big box stores.</li>
            <li> I have had about 4 replacement razor blades and screens.&lt;br /&gt;Great service from AMAZON and we all appreciate the closest shave out there.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;MARKO</li>
            <li> Believe the negative reviews.  This set of replacement parts gave me about one good shave and that&#x27;s it.  From then on, the shave is not efficient and has become painful.  I&#x27;m going to look to send them back as this is a total rip off.  If you look around and read some reviews, I believe I remember seeing people mentioning some alternative replacement heads that are not necessarily tagged as being specific to this razor.  Anyway - these are terrible.  Do not buy them.</li>
            <li> not a disappointment at all! works great on my model 8595 Braun shaver. It works now like it is brand new. These are often hard to find at stores and often more expensive than the Amazon price. I would recommend this as a replacement option for your 360 degree  Complete 8000 series shaver</li>
            <li> As mentioned in many other reviews this is not the true/correct replacement for a 8000 series shaver.  It installs fine but just doesn&#x27;t feel or sound the same.  Time will tell if it will last as long as the discontinued Series 8.</li>
            <li> Less than worthless. I bought this as a replacement for the original foil on my 8000 series razor. I figured it was time after 3 years or so. It wasn&#x27;t even cutting bad, but I figured it was worth freshening the cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been so frustrated with a product. After changing out the foil, it does not shave well at all. If you have more than a half day growth, it passes over whiskers without cutting, you pull and stretch your skin, and still it doesn&#x27;t get them. When it does catch them, it hurts. It pulls instead of cutting in the center section. I just spent 15 minutes and I can&#x27;t get all the whiskers cut no mater what angle and how many times I try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s useless and worthless and I&#x27;m just cynical enough to believe that Braun made a crappy replacement so that people would buy new razors. Well, now I&#x27;m in the market for a new one, but it won&#x27;t be a Braun...anyone have a suggestion on a good electric razor?</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain for the speed and price I got this at.  In my area this item would run you like almost $50 in a retail store.  Door to door service for less the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for six or seven years.  Normally a replacement foil/cutter lasts 70 or 80 shaves, minimum.  This became noticeably dull after less than 20 shaves, and the &amp;#34;Replace&amp;#34; light went on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last year or two, I&#x27;ve been wondering if the replacement cartridges were getting worse.  But this is ridiculous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I really like the Braun shaver, I may need to move to something else.  This is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to be able to replace parts instead of having to buy a whole new razor.  Very easy to do.</li>
            <li> Been using Braun for 20 years, wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way. NUF SAID!&lt;br /&gt;My son uses a Braun also and loves it.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for husbands razor &amp; arrived one day sooner than estimated.</li>
            <li> I always love the first week of a new shaver head, quick smooth shaves, then it goes longer and longer to get the same effect.  This has been the 8000, 360 and now Series 51.  The shaver dates to the early millennium and I&#x27;ll continue with the replacement heads as long as it survives, a great shave.</li>
            <li> The Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack fit my Braun razor perfectly; popped it in and I was in business.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Worked fine.  I did not notice any difference from what I had before in terms of nicking the face.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> As good as can be, though will never shave as close as original Eltron-Braun which is now 20 years new.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with replacement</li>
            <li> Great product and very fast service.</li>
            <li> I bought the replacement head on March 2 and I had to replace it by July 15th. Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> An excellent product, easy to install, lasts a long time--about 18 mos. the razor is now essentially brand new again!</li>
            <li> just the standard braun replacement foil and blades, used for my 51s braun.&lt;br /&gt; Original braun product nothing further to add.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun for about 10 years now, and my old foils would last many months (the first lasted two years!) THIS one is splitting (and therefore, it cut my face open) just two months after I replaced it!!!</li>
            <li> Not a lot you can say here, it either works or it doesn&#x27;t, received product in good time, was exactly what I ordered and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun shavers since 1999 and I am very happy with its performance. A year ago I purchased Braun Series 5 and the cutter lasted about a year. afyer reading others reviews I gave it a shot and bought the one they recommended ( Made in GERMANY) , not in China!..and so far so good. I hope it will last at least a year, the manufacturer recommends changing it every 18 months.</li>
            <li> My husband has had his razor for about 2 years now and I finally bought him replacement blades.  He was able to replace his blades without even looking at the instructions and says that it works like it is brand new.  Excellent!</li>
            <li> I think this razor and the pack works great best I ever bought! It gives me a close shave that lasts till evening,</li>
            <li> Purchased this product 2 weeks ago. Experienced same issues as others noted, doesn&#x27;t shave as close now and major irritation.  Called Braun and they&#x27;re sending another replacement pack which will most likely be the same problem. Why do manufacturers always change things that are not broken. If the new replacement doesn&#x27;t work better, I&#x27;m dumping razor and switching brands (so long Braun). If it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> I had recently somehow got a hole in the foil of my Braun razor. Had to work hard to keep that hole away from my beard. Instead of buying a new razor, I got the replacement kit, and it&#x27;s working fantastically. There was absolutely no break-in period. Right out of the box (once I discovered how to get the old blade off), it cut so smoothly. My face felt softer than it&#x27;s felt in years. I had 2 days growth when it arrived. My beard isn&#x27;t heavy, but I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> Quality product at a great price. Exact manufacturer&#x27;s replacement.</li>
            <li> I continue to order these.&lt;br /&gt;I have had the razor for a number of years and continue to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> The Braun replacement parts fit and work fine. My only complaint is the price. Guess the idea is to make as much profit on the replacement as on the entire razor.</li>
            <li> My shaver is probably over 10 years old now.  These are pretty expensive (most likely they are made of very durable metal that keeps their sharpness for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the quality is great and using it is like having a brand new shaver.</li>
            <li> Logically you would think that a brand new blade would make and old razor \\&quot;like new\\&quot; again.  While the new foil and cutter is an upgrade from my old, severly worn down one, it&#x27;s not nearly as comfortable a shave as I recall getting from the original. I&#x27;m thinking about just getting a whole kit because this just isn&#x27;t cutting it (no pun intended).</li>
            <li> This product has renewed my razor.  I can&#x27;t tell the difference from when I first bought the razor, crisp and close shaves are back.</li>
            <li> This is my third electric razor. First two were Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Series 5 does a very poor job of getting close and being consistent with shaving hair. You have to go over the same area several times and in various directions to get a close shave. The worst part is that it does not contain the shaved hair but rather &#x27;rains&#x27; it all over the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very poor design.</li>
            <li> good replacement same as in wal-mart no problems fits my 360 complete grate. would recommend.</li>
            <li> Got it on time and works exactly like my original!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good replacement for the original foil and cutter. It&#x27;s getting hard to find the original style foil with the multi-shaped holes. This one has all round holes but it still cuts well.</li>
            <li> Good prices and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for years &amp; think they are the best for me. The Amazon experience is always just fine. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Price was good, delivered sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I bought the Wrong one Stupid me</li>
            <li> Delivered and performed as expected</li>
            <li> It really could notice the difference when I inserted the new blade and shield.</li>
            <li> Just as described, excellent deal</li>
            <li> My razor is over 5 years old and had begun to pinch and pull! The replacement parts made it run like new!</li>
            <li> Getting these was like getting a new razor.  The Braun Series 5 is an expensive razor, so refurbishing it made perfect sense.</li>
            <li> I performed an experiment. I wanted to find out if you really needed to replace the cutters every 18 months; if there was a real difference between cutters that had been used and taken care of, and the new one. I could not see an appreciable difference.</li>
            <li> The first cutter foil did not fit securely over my razor and then when I sent it back and received another one I had the same problem again.</li>
            <li> Worked in my shaver and the price was right.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit for my dad to replace the worn out original parts. Everything seems to be working well - the shaver is as good as new!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my son who is in the Marines, he needs to be completely shaved smooth and he claims that it does NOT shave like it says not close enough needs to use an older one he had to finish not good very disappointed for the money I paid never expected from this brand</li>
            <li> Returned my shaver to like new quality. Do this before you buy a new shaver, and save some money at the same time.</li>
            <li> Product came as expected and in a timely manner. Would order again when necessary. I have been using the replacement for a month now with no problems.</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; so was price.</li>
            <li> It was just what I expected. Thank you.</li>
            <li> renewed my Braun to like new..</li>
            <li> My braun shaver works like new again after I replaced the foil/blade. Good price also! I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works fine. Same exact one that&#x27;s offered locally.&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviewers though, not sure it&#x27;s gonna last the 18 months like the last one I bought.</li>
            <li> Nice to get a descent price on this item.</li>
            <li> A perfect fit for my old razor.  Works like it&#x27;s brand new.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> These things easily last in excess of a year.  If you look at it in that light, it&#x27;s a pretty amazingly good buy relative to traditional razors.  I always find that the light comes on to replace the set a little bit earlier than needed, and a better method of figuring out when to replace it is to look at the actual foil itself and see if there are any holes or other issues going on there.  These will prevent it from effectively cutting your facial hair, but until there are holes in the foil, I would hold off on replacing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise though, this product is a great way to extend the life of your electric razor for another year or two at a time, especially with the ballooning costs of traditional shaving, this is a wonderful avenue.</li>
            <li> This one is the real deal!  It has been replaced at a year.  The new one doesn&#x27;t perform like this one does used!</li>
            <li> Works good and the price was right</li>
            <li> Great price. Great shave again.</li>
            <li> only cutter fits my shaver not the foil. ordered 2 by mistake.</li>
            <li> good price and fast service</li>
            <li> I have purchased this foil/cutterblock combo three times and the foil has broken on me all three times between 9 months and a year.  I shave every other day and clean once per week.  The foil develops a hole in it after 9 months and starts to cut my neck.  I had Braun send me a new combo once because it was still under warranty. I&#x27;m starting to think these products are not too good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same Braun series 5 raisor for the past couple years. I started to notice that my series 5 was pulling at my face when I was shaving. Replacing with the new shaver foil restored original performance</li>
            <li> The new design is awful. I have a 8000 and it was the best razor I ever had. The new foil design is razor burn hell. I will probably switch to another brand. Maybe the norelcos have got better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the reccommendations posted by other reviewers, I went ahead with the Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 4700,7000), and it works as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks everyone for pointing it out.</li>
            <li> Just echoing a lot of other people - This replacement does not stand up to the original. After 5 months, shaving has become a very long painful process.  In fact, nearly more of a hassle than shaving with a blade.  Heaven forbid you miss a day, it&#x27;s like using an Epilady on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed in Braun.</li>
            <li> Still waiting, it is a lot less than 18 months when I changed these previously. I hope it helps when I do because I spend a lot of time shaving now since I went electric. Going back would be faster but feels like I&#x27;m cutting my skin every time. I use a razor now.</li>
            <li> This is the first time in a couple of years that I bought a cutter block &amp; foil for my Braun 8585 Razor, and they definitely changed the design for the better. The foil is a more complex (usable) pattern and the center (whisker) cutters are larger and work better. But it&#x27;s the cutter block that&#x27;s undergone the most changes and which really help. Instead of the blades pointing up (which tends to dull them faster in any razor), they are now pointed to the sides...where each blade piece has to two ends. Which not only works better, but keeps the blades sharper (and hopefully longer). And it&#x27;s also the first cutter block I&#x27;ve purchased in quite a while that was so well balanced, that the noise level of my razor went down quite a bit. In the past, buying a new cutter block never really helped much, and so I only bought the combination when the foil failed. And generally I could hardly tell the diference with the new combo. But not this time. This time it was very noticeable better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how long it will last, but I very much like the results of the design changes.</li>
            <li> It is like receiving a brand new razor at a fraction of the cost. The cutter blades and foil fit perfectly and work marvelously.</li>
            <li> The work as expected and cost less than in any department store.&lt;br /&gt;I do not know if the ones in the stores are of any better quality and last longer.&lt;br /&gt;These last about one year each.</li>
            <li> Item works well.  The 3 weeks it took to get it sucked.</li>
            <li> These heads are getting harder and harder to find this restored my shaver and saved me a the price of a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Need to shave twice a day, razor at nite, series 5 in morning....Given my heavy shave requirements I think the 5 series is excellent...its not as quiet as some, but it is powerful and provides a close shave. It&#x27;s a workhorse.The 3 series is also an excellent shaver which I also had until my son absconded with it back to college..... and a lower price point.which makes it a good value</li>
            <li> If you have an older series 5 razor, you would think that this replacement part would fit, since there is nothing on the package or ad that says it is for a new type od series 5 razor! I unpackaged it and tried to install, but was unsuccessfulful, it does not fit the old series 5, and I could not find one that would fit! Wound up having to buy a Remington razor, which is ok, but it is not a Braum!  Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Got if quick and was perfect. The price was right too.&lt;br /&gt;No problems. Would buy from this again when I need it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item on here to replace previous cutter.  Works awesome, no issues and seems to last nearly a year.</li>
            <li> I use this Foil replacement for several month now and works well. I would suggest to anyone looking for a replacement Foil. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> it did not work as well as the original shipped with the braun. Seems lame that that should be so, and I think it should not be on the market</li>
            <li> This item is wearing through after 60 days of light use. Generally I would get up to 1 year of year on this foil. Not sure if this a legit Braun product???</li>
            <li> Ordering on line through Amazon makes it so much easier when it is hard getting out to see what stores might carry this replacement item.  Cost and the reviews always makes my ordering an item so much easier, knowing what others have to input on such item.</li>
            <li> Product as promised, and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Best pricing out there, excellent customer service and it works perfectly! Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Is definitely not a replacement for 800series!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a foil and cutter combo for your Braun Series 5 shaver, look no further.  This is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s OEM so I would have been VERY surprised had it not fit exactly as the original equipment did, but it does.  Works like a new razor now!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and easy to install. Works well.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my electric razor cutter and foil. I replace every 18 months. Great razor and great shave.</li>
            <li> Great bargain. Fast service. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> Just as describled.  I WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
            <li> They claim this will make you think you got a new shaver.  That is exactly what it does.</li>
            <li> This blade and cover are an exact replica of the original ones.  The items fitted perfectly without issues.  Shipping was also fast!  Will definitely purchase this same one when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Does a good job but not as good as my previous two purchases of foil/cutter from Braun that I would rate a five.</li>
            <li> product fit as advertised.  Got a clean shave after 5 minute switch out.</li>
            <li> Good price for hard to find item.</li>
            <li> What a difference a new blade makes...THANK YOU!!!</li>
            <li> have the Braun shaver for a number of years.  It is probably the best electric shaver made, having said that.  Blades wear and replacements become necessary.  There are two different Braun makes for it&#x27;s shavers.  These are good but not long lasting.</li>
            <li> great&lt;br /&gt;16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 more words required</li>
            <li> I read many negative reviews but needed a replacement so I took a chance.  After receiving it I wondered if I was using the same product.  It fit perfectly and even works with the plastic guard that came with my razor.  It was like shaving with a brand new razor.  No pulls or issues and a very close shave.  The original foil and cutter lasted 3 years before the foil broke but the quality did slowly go down.  This replacement is a cheap way to get that new shaver quality back.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this product has a few negative reviews. This seems the the perfect replacement for my Braun 8585.</li>
            <li> Item was damaged. I&#x27;ve made it work since I didn&#x27;t want to hassle with the return process. I&#x27;ve ordered this a few times and this was the 1st problem.</li>
            <li> Apparently, I got the German version, because it fits and works fine in my Braun 8985 shaver and heavy beard.</li>
            <li> If you like Braun razors this replacement cutter is the exact original, and works new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price and fits unit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is happening to the quality of these Braun replacement cutters and screens, but the last two that I have bought have lasted about 6 weeks before the screen starts to rip open in the corner. These things used to last me a year.  Series 5</li>
            <li> I bought this for use with my Braun 8985.  It fits perfectly and seems to cut just as well as the previous generations.  Also, I saved a bunch of money getting it from Amazon versus the local store.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I was looking for. Now my razor is like new.</li>
            <li> Kept my old razor cutting my beard.</li>
            <li> It makes my shaver as a new one.</li>
            <li> This was a perfect fit for the Braun series 5 razor! I had great service and quick mailing .No problems at all.</li>
            <li> Replacement for the worn one.</li>
            <li> this replacement is far better than what came with my shaver...  The blades are the same, but the foil is different, looking like the manufacturer learned from his mistake and improved his product...</li>
            <li> replaces and makes work better!!!!</li>
            <li> Best price , these foils wear out fast , and are expensive in local stores. I wish these companies would make a better foil that did not wear out so fast.</li>
            <li> This foil pack and cutter were replacements for the originals that came with the shaver when I bought it.  The originals lasted much longer than expected (roughly 7 years as opposed to the 18 month replacement recommendation by the manufacturer), so I was very pleased about that.  However, these new ones certainly made a difference in the feel and effectiveness of the shaver as a whole.  It makes every shave much smoother and less intrusive.  The old foil and cutter had somewhat corroded over time due to age and a bit of citric acid being in the cleaning solution (lemon scent).  Overall I am very happy with these replacements.</li>
            <li> I have had my Braun for three years and this is the third time I am changing my blades and foil, once every twelve months.  The last time I bought the replacement pack at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond and it was great, I actually was getting a better shave than with the original equipment.  This time, I just can&#x27;t believe the difference.  Absolutely poor quality that makes me want to switch back to a Norelco.  Something has absolutely changed, as others have pointed out.  Maybe I will try buying again from BBB, just hate to waste so much money for nothing!</li>
            <li> I have the Braun 570 in the 575 series.  This new foil fits great and gives a really close shave.  I dropped my shaver on vacation and broke the original foil.  My new part is made in Germany also.  I&#x27;ve only had the new foil for 6 weeks or so and cant yet speak of how long it will shave close but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how uncomfortable my razor had become before I bought the head and foil. What finally inspired me was a hole developed in the foil and I had to put tape over it to keep from being cut. Now it is like new. It took about a minute to install the new head and foil.</li>
            <li> I ordered this replacement head for my Braun 8585 back on March 7, 2011.  I read the reviews and figured how bad could it really be. Well, it&#x27;s bad. I spend double the amount of time shaving for 1/2 the result. The shave is not as close and the quality of the blade is very poor. And noisy. Don&#x27;t ask me why but after a while you&#x27;re tired of listening to the whole process. Totally disappointed with this product and I&#x27;ve starting shopping for a new razor. In reality there is nothing wrong with the working body of the razor it&#x27;s all in the quality or poor quality of the replacement head. If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this replacement foil and on the fence about it, as I was, I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  a completely viable replacement for the original parts, which really isn&#x27;t a surprise since it&#x27;s from the same mfg. Anyway, works fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to find replacement heads locally.  Amazon is a life saver.  I replace my heads every 6 months, and it&#x27;s like I have a new razor.  Love it</li>
            <li> Probably like most owners of a Braun Series 5 shaver, I have read the many critical reviews of the company&#x27;s replacement foil &amp; cutter (&#x27;51S&#x27;).  In reading the scathing reviews, though, I did notice that many/most of them were from 2010 or early 2011; I noticed that some recent reviewers were not experiencing the problems that others were reporting.  I took a chance that, maybe, Braun had taken notice -- and corrected -- the problems.  Guess what?  I think they have.  I purchased the replacement pack and the first thing I noticed were the words \\&quot;Made in Germany\\&quot; on the package.  A number of the critical reviewers commented that the products that they purchased were marked as \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot;.  Hmmm...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to report that I am delighted with the quality of the replacement cutter &amp; foil; with the replacement, the shaver is absolutely as good as it was originally.  Time will tell if it retains this quality but I strongly suspect it will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who buy this product, I would suggest to pay particular attention to the \\&quot;Made in...\\&quot; marking on the package.  High-volume retailers, such as Amazon, may have already cleared out most of the old, less-good, products but it wouldn&#x27;t be a bad idea to check before you open.</li>
            <li> I change my foil and cutter almost yearly and it is like getting a brand new electric shaver.  I also change the cleaning fluid and use that function frequently, it has kept my shave like new for 5 years now!</li>
            <li> This product was just what my husband needed.  He now can shave without the pulling and using Amazon.com to find the product was much easier and cheaper than trying to find it in a local store.</li>
            <li> I own an 8000 series Braun shaver (8985).  It works awesome.  When it comes to replacement cutters, the 8000 series shavers have two cutter &amp; foil options: The recommended 51s, or the 30b.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both replacement cutter/foils fit this shaver.  NO problemo.  They both cut whiskers well.  I have tried both, and I prefer the 30b. The 30b gives me a smoother, closer shave. All beards are different, so you may see/feel different results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun recommends replacing the cutter &amp; foil every 18 months.  I prefer to spend a little more for the extra comfort, and replace mine every 12 months.  Again different beards may get different mileage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why only 4 stars?  This product is great, but not perfect, so I am leaving room for improvement.  Kind of like scoring a perfect 10 in the Olympics...</li>
            <li> Did the job perfectly!</li>
            <li> Periodically I buy replacement parts.  This came on time, good price and is performing well.</li>
            <li> For some background, I have had a Braun 8995 for probably 4 or so years using the original foil/blade. I just ordered a replacement and am satisfied with the shave. The replacement foil/blade are made in Germany and seem similar to the original in performance. The blade looks identical, the foil is lacking the \\&quot;360\\&quot; logo as noted in other reviews. The foil also has a different hole pattern and middle blade than the original. It is difficult to describe the difference but this replacement foil appears simpler and is probably cheaper to manufacture. Overall I am satisfied with the performance and it has given the razor a good refresh. I can&#x27;t see anything overtly wrong with the replacement. I have fairly light stubble and shave every other day.</li>
            <li> These replacement parts arrived very quickly via mail. Installation was fast and easy. My razor is like new again. Works great.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping good item good good good</li>
            <li> Product arrives in promised time. Fits perfectly in razor.</li>
            <li> Great product. My husband said the cutter was sharper and cut better then the one that it origanally came with. We did the auto-ship for every six months. That way he won&#x27;t have to shave with a dull razor. The price was the best hands down between any store or online-site.</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to install</li>
            <li> Great foil and cutter</li>
            <li> It works fine and I am glad I can get these parts for my Braun 8585 shaver that I bought in December 2001.... still works great 13 years later!</li>
            <li> Great product and easy transaction.  Product is as advertised.  Shipped in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Best foil and cutter yet. I&#x27;ve pucrhased many of these but this one seems to cut the best.</li>
            <li> I received and installed the new replacement foil and cutter head, for the fourth time since I bought my Braun 8585.  It works fine; no discomfort and a close shave.  I read some of the negative reviews and don&#x27;t find the problems they discuss.</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I expected; new foil and cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is a great purchase and price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Aaron</li>
            <li> On time and good price.</li>
            <li> Very pleased. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Replaced the original equipment perfectly.  This was about the 5th time I have changed the screen and blades and this was as good a replacement of the others which I paid more for thru retail outlets.  It will be from Amazon from here on out.</li>
            <li> Item was a direct replacement part at a reasonable price.  Delivery was as promised.</li>
            <li> I have bought several of these blades for the new shaver and for the old Braun before it went DOA.</li>
            <li> This replacement pack met all my expectations.  With a very VERY simple replacement, my razor works as new.  Thanks to Braun for making the replacement so easy.</li>
            <li> Just what we need and much better price than in stores.</li>
            <li> Braun razors used to give relatively quick and very close shaves. Not anymore - this one takes a long time, misses lots of stubble on each pass, and as a result of having to go over and over, skin irritation occurs.</li>
            <li> worked good don&#x27;t send any more razor waring out</li>
            <li> good replacement for my worn out foil and cutter. does the job as expected</li>
            <li> Replacing these parts is much cheaper than buying a new razor. Works great and shaves close now. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Tried off-brand replacement products which did not measure up to the quality (or last as long) as Braun&#x27;s.  Buying Braun&#x27;s from now on.</li>
            <li> Replacement seem to result in the same close shave as original.</li>
            <li> I replaced the foil/cutter with this replacement. I am satisfied with its performance and it seems to work as well as the original one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> I was still using the original head after 3 years.  I thought it was still OK.  But decided to replace it.  I was amazed at how much better it shaved.  The old head had lost it&#x27;s effectiveness little by little.  I can shave in half the time now.</li>
            <li> My shaver works like brand new again!</li>
            <li> Exact replacement parts, very easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Nice to keep the old unit going.</li>
            <li> I am used to buying this and have no other option. I am happy using it anyways.</li>
            <li> This fit my shaver perfectly. Shipped fast too.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for, a bit confused since the model number changed, but the part fit perfect</li>
            <li> I have an older model 360 shaver, and this is the replacement cutter and foil.  It simply works great, and the price was much better than from other sources.</li>
            <li> The foil and cutter lost their sharpness to fast, I was quite surprised.Perhaps a new source for them should be found.</li>
            <li> Good replacement. Works great.</li>
            <li> Received quickly.  Open package, but appeared to be new.  Works great.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> They had a problem with these a couple years ago.  There was a Chinese verson that was awful and didn&#x27;t cut well, and a German version that did work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if they still have the Chinese version out there, but these are the German ones and do bring your razor back to original performance.  For me, these last about a year.</li>
            <li> you can always tell the difference when you replace the old cutter and heads with new ones. Shave is so much closer/smoother.</li>
            <li> I dutifully follow the instructions that came with my shaver 6 years ago to replace the screen and cutter every 18 months. Each time I think I&#x27;m going to now get these incredibly smooth shaves. Actually, the shaves have seemed a little better. But, I always wonder why I needed to spend that money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the delivery was on time. The product received was as expected. And, it works fine.</li>
            <li> My husband needed a new razor head and it works great</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong model #&lt;br /&gt;I need to know how to return and get the correct one !!!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews posted for this foil/cutter replacement I was a bit nervous about how this would work, but as another reviewer said, this seems to be the real deal.  It fits my shaver perfectly and the shave is smooth with no yanking of whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must have left my previous one on too long (difficult to remember when you last replaced it) because shaving now is so much smoother and with a better result than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is manufactured in Germany and I&#x27;m considering getting another one while I know what I&#x27;m getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to provide an update in the next month or so.</li>
            <li> The foil and cutter replacement is just what I wanted, there a two different foils and this one is the best. The holes are uniformilly drilled not a radom design.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this and that&#x27;s all that mattered. Works great.</li>
            <li> Just as requested !!!  Perfect.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised, best price on line. Came all the way from south Korea. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> The foil is what is inconsistent...it will wear out in less than a year.  I&#x27;ve had one wear out in six months.</li>
            <li> In my case, I feel rotary cutters are more appropriate.</li>
            <li> Cuts like they are suppose to</li>
            <li> GOOD PRICE, FREE SHIPPING, DON&#x27;T HAVE TO DRIVE AROUND TO FIND AND PAY MORE.</li>
            <li> Good value vs. the cost at a drugstore.</li>
            <li> I guess my Braun razor is going to last forever -- and now that I&#x27;m shaving some days with a regular razor blade, it may last twice as long as ME. This replacement foil really improved performance.</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery</li>
            <li> Good to use the right replacement parts.  This cutter restored original performance to my shaver.  As always, fast shipping and easy ordering from Amazon</li>
            <li> Just as described at a fantastic price!</li>
            <li> This new foil and cutter head have transformed my 3 year-old Braun shaver into a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Works just GREAT !</li>
            <li> Hubby says, &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The edge of this foil came apart after only a month. ;(</li>
            <li> Received on time and works as expected</li>
            <li> You need to replace your foil and cutter - minimum - every 18 months and this fits my Braun Series 5 550cc and works very well.</li>
            <li> the new one works fine</li>
            <li> Great price and long lasting.</li>
            <li> They take people for a ride, be careful.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 2 items, they have sent me just one but charged for 2. they have lied twice saying they have sent me the second one with post, but never received. Now amazon has promised to give me a credit, lets see how much of that is the truth.</li>
            <li> Series 5 is what my husband has in qhis braun razor, and these did not fit the machine!</li>
            <li> The best ever! This cutter block and screen are both a different design from the my originals. The ones that came with my shaver were made by Gillette, and they were too aggressive for my skin, so I dropped in a used cutter block from my old 5000 series shaver and it worked pretty well. But this new screen and cutter block design are better than anything I&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and fit with no problems.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is the exact parts needed.</li>
            <li> I own the Braun Series 5 electric shaver, model # 8995. I have been looking for the correct replacement head for my shaver for some time. It performs admirably.&lt;br /&gt;I was purchasing through a third party retailer via Amazon, but after processing my order and taking my payment they had no more in stock! Amazon Customer service helped me find the product through another avenue, and covered the extra cost for me! So Amazon Customer Service was excellent! P.S. I have always had good experiences with ordering from Amazon.[[ASIN:B001VEK1IU Braun Series 5 Combi 51S Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 8000 360 Complete or Activator)]]</li>
            <li> The Braun shaver head kit has become harder and harder to find in stores near me, so when I found it on Amazon with the opportunity to subscribe, I did so without a second thought. It&#x27;s improved my shaving immensely -- I no longer have to wait until the shaver starts pulling and missing, but can change to the new one while the old is still functioning. Recommended.</li>
            <li> the blades and the screen were great ,easy to install,once again i could have a clean shave  with the razor cutting myself,i would definatly would tell any body that has one ther shaves and is having trouble shaving to check it out they go a real good job</li>
            <li> To me this is either it works or doesn&#x27;t sort of thing, I bought this for my Braun 8985 and it works just fine. Even with shipping it was still cheaper than retail in Canada.</li>
            <li> The item did meet my expectations. I was a little disappointed that the price had gone up so much since my earlier purchase from you was $21.99 and this one was $33.99. What a shock! It had been less than a year.</li>
            <li> The cutters became dull after a few weeks of use.  I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers ever since I started shaving many decades ago and never had this happen before.  Usually, the cutters remain sharp for 6 months or more.  This particular vendor must have sold me defective cutters.</li>
            <li> Fits and lasts? Was unsure if this was the correct blade, but fits perfectly. Look to Amazon to maintain your razor at great prices.</li>
            <li> My previous razor head was no longer laying waste to the weekend build up of manliness I call my face. Stray hairs mocked me and stuck out like a bunch of little hairs giving me the finger in the mirror. Since I installed this new blade the lamentations of the hair have become my morning coffee fueling my conquest of the day so I may crush my enemies and see them driven before me.</li>
            <li> excellent will buy another</li>
            <li> I have ordered this before for my shaver and it works very well.  No problems!</li>
            <li> a1  service good product</li>
            <li> Nice, sharp, great replacement.</li>
            <li> does the job, exactly as advertised, fit my series 5 razor perfectly, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah</li>
            <li> I was able to get a really nice clean shave really smooth on the skin you feel like you just shaved with razor in soap</li>
            <li> Much more economical than the local stores, but of same quality!</li>
            <li> Fits perfect and the price was right!!</li>
            <li> It had been a while since I had changed the foil and had never changed the blades.&lt;br /&gt;It was like a brand new razor.  no more multiple multiple passes to get that close shave.&lt;br /&gt;It now requires very little pressure to get a great, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this razor for several years now, the replacement foil/cutter are a good price considering he replaces it about once a year.</li>
            <li> Item works fine, no issues with it. easy to install. was nicely packaged up. was a little expensive but that&#x27;s braun for you</li>
            <li> Easy to replace and works like new.  Definitely worth the purchase and my shaver will last at least another two years.</li>
            <li> works great and was easy to install. Cleanest shave and i will definately order more, if you have a series 5 this is the one to buy.</li>
            <li> Husband is really happy, He has had trouble finding  this and is delighted with the price.</li>
            <li> just what I expected love Braum</li>
            <li> I replace the cutter on my Braun Shaver periodically.  I guess I waited much longer this last time because when I put the new foil and cutter on the shaver it was just like new again.  Amazon had the product I needed and it was shipped promptly.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality - easy to install - faster than expected delivery.</li>
            <li> I was very concerned by the amount of negative reviews regarding this replacement part for my Braun razor. Numerous reviewers have complained that they&#x27;ve experienced significant irritation by the new product. I&#x27;ve had absolutely zero problems with this after installing the parts and trying them out, despite the fact that I&#x27;ve got somewhat sensitive skin. My Braun now works better than I can ever remember since the original date of purchase.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what it was described to be.  Works great and a dependable product.  Will use it again when needed.</li>
            <li> Pretty much the same as if I bought a new one. Works like a charm. Worth the 27-28$! Comes with the complete foil and the complete cutter.</li>
            <li> I was worried after reading reviews about the poor quality of Braun&#x27;s replacement foils, but was heartened by the comment on one that they had switched their manufacturing back from China. The replacement I received was not manufactured in China and has revitalized my razor. Well worth the replacement cost. A smooth, close shave, with no bite.</li>
            <li> My Braun razor is probably 6 years old. I replaced the foil/cutter about 5 years ago after about 18 months of use. I noticed little difference in performance. So now after another 4 years, I decided to replace the foil/cutter pack as it was taking too long and too much effort to get a satisfactory shave. When opening the replacement pack, I noticed that the foil design was somewhat different than the original. My first shave with the new foil/cutter was better than I had hoped. The bottom line is that the new foil/cutter performs better than when the razor was new.</li>
            <li> I have been using braun electric razors for 17 years. I know exactly what to expect when buying a replacement cutter and foil. This replacement made my current braun shaver like new.</li>
            <li> I have a Braun Series 5.  This replacement blade is not built exactly like the original blade.  The original blades has more space for facial hairs to enter the cutting area.  The replacement blades surface has more guide plate area than cutting holes.  Well built but takes serveral more passes to get the best shave.</li>
            <li> I had read reviews saying the 51S replacement foil and cutter were not as good as the original parts that come with the Braun Series 5 shaver. I&#x27;m glad that I ordered in spite of these reviews. The replacement foil and cutter work great. I did not notice any difference from the original parts.</li>
            <li> Foil and Cutter is great.</li>
            <li> On the first use of the new cutter and foil the cutter created a small hole in the foil rendering it useless for any additional shaves. I installed both correctly and was using it normally. My original foil lasted for years without a problem. This foil is of extremely poor quality!</li>
            <li> I had used my old foil for years, finally replacing it when it started to fall apart and cut me. It&#x27;s amazing how I managed for forget how well it shaved when new, or maybe this is better than it used to be. But it cut my shaving time in half from what it used to take with my worn out foil. I always took the foil off and cleaned the shaver in the self cleaner without it to get a better clean. However every time I did this it reset the change foil timer resulting in me never knowing when it was appropriate. I highly recommend this whenever yours starts to feel rough because it now is so smooth.</li>
            <li> I hate the Braun Series 5 Combi 51s Foil And Cutter Replacement Pack. it can&#x27;t used. And I like cable modems---SUB 5101,beaucase it nease to used.</li>
            <li> After two years he was thinking of buying a new shaver, but with this replacement pack it seems like he has one for much less money. Quite a deal!</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a series 5 360 - makes the razor like new again at a resonable price. I used the original well beyond the recommended life span ( the &amp;#34;replace foil/cutter&amp;#34; LED came on at least half a year ago) Hopefully this stands up as well.  It&#x27;s been in service for about a month now and all is well.</li>
            <li> While cheaper than the stores&#x27; offerings, this product frequently pinches. It works and I save money, but I don&#x27;t enjoy using the product.</li>
            <li> I like the Braun Series 5 shaver very much.  However, the shaving foils don&#x27;t seem to last very long.  My experience is about 4-5 months before they get a small hole in the cutting foil which cuts your face.</li>
            <li> I have had my Braun razor for about 10 years. I replace the cutter and foil every 12 months. This keeps the razor working properly.</li>
            <li> I needed the foil and cutter replacement set because my old one had holes in the screen I like the shaver because it gives a clean shave. recommend to anyone who needs a clean shave</li>
            <li> The Braun foil and cutter are a good investment to extend life of shaver for another year.  The old ones get blunt in 12 - 18 months</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase. It fits my 360 shaver perfectly and the price is the lowest I could find</li>
            <li> Braun Series 5 Combi 51s Foil served the purpose but expensive! The replacement message was gone and cleaning cycle works O.K.</li>
            <li> Great product as we all know but a really great price made it even better. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The foil is somewhat prone to easy damage if the foil is accidentally bumped into or banged into a sharp corner.. Does a good job of a smooth shave when new and undamaged.</li>
            <li> They last a little longer than 6 months.  Perfect for my face.</li>
            <li> wrong item. I have a 5000 series shaver. This replacement is for a 8000 series.</li>
            <li> Got this replacement for my husbands G5 series razor. It fit perfectly and works just as well as his last one. So I glad I saved $10 buying it through amazon, instead of at our local Kmart.</li>
            <li> Worked just like the original</li>
            <li> Met my expectations an wasn&#x27;t made in China.  Yea.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say that I have any complaints about this product. It was exactly as I expected, and my shaves have been much better since I replaced it with this product.</li>
            <li> This arrived very quickly and was as described. I needed a replacement for my razor and this worked perfectly. Great item.</li>
            <li> Product shipped and arrived as stated. Works like new !!!</li>
            <li> My third Braun electric razor.  I would have none other.</li>
            <li> My shaver worked over 10 years. The screen and the blade were worn out.  It scratched my face when shaving.  I ordered the replacement kit which arrived on time and worked smoothly.  I am happy again.  4-star rating for being too pricey, otherwise, it should get 5 stars</li>
            <li> exactly what the shaver needed to work like new again</li>
            <li> Quickly delivered and does the job.</li>
            <li> Good value and price on this replacement item</li>
            <li> THIS SHAVER/BLADES IS TERRIFIC!  WAS BOUGHT FOR WHEELCHAIR BOUND MAN.  CAREGIVERS AND MYSELF HAD NO TROUBLE WITH IT, NOR DID MY DAD EVER COMPLAIN IT WAS HURTING/PULLING.  KUDOS!!</li>
            <li> Made my Shaver like new again.I didn&#x27;t realize how dull the blades where untill I shaved with the new foil and cutter installed.</li>
            <li> Perfect and last forever</li>
            <li> HATEED IT.. supposed to do away with hair.. and very VERY painful to use.  wish i could return it.</li>
            <li> For a year I looked at my foil that had holes in it and at the blade that was missing parts of it. :)  So when I used my shaver I felt a few pinches here and there.  I thought about a new shaver but at over 100 bucks I said someone must sell parts and sure enough there they were right here on Amazon.  Perfect replacement and now my face is as smooth as a new born butt. What a difference!</li>
            <li> this blade and foil is not as good as the original one, and it is not the same as the original one.</li>
            <li> Feels like it did when it was new. To think I&#x27;ve had my shaver for 8 years now. Only thing that needed replacing was the power cord.</li>
            <li> Works well&lt;br /&gt;Lasts 4-6 montgs</li>
            <li> Product was new and as described. No issuess whatsoever... Recommended...  thanks A+ + + + + + + + +</li>
            <li> Great buy. item as indicated.</li>
            <li> This combi pack, made in Germany, seems a perfect replacement for the original foil and cutter of the Braun Model 8595.  It shaves and feels exactly the same as the original.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these any more.  I dropped down to the 300</li>
            <li> Watch out for Fakes!  I don&#x27;t know what it is that recently I find a version of this blade that is not even sharp!  I compared it to my original blade that came with shaver and it looks totally different than what I got from Amazon.  I returned it!</li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive buying parts for my Braun over the internet, but the description and information about the shavers it would fit was accurate and easy to understand.  The foil and cutter worked perfectly and fit into my shaver easily.  It&#x27;s amazing how good it feels to actually have your beard hair cut and not pulled out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend anyone in need of a new foil and cutter (BTW: always replace the two at the same time for best results) get these Braun parts.  They are as high quality Braun parts and you will very happy with them as I am and you&#x27;ll find that Amazon has them at a very good price.</li>
            <li> Package arrived Ok as scheduled</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok but trie to white me in french....bye.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the 5 series foil/cutter block has the Braun brand on it.  The most misleading part of this Amazon listing is (Formerly 8000 360 Complete Or Activator).  That is how I ended up with this piece of junk.  Yes it fits, but you might just as well throw out your 8 series if this is your only option.</li>
            <li> I purchased a replacement foil and cuter because my foil was damaged. I did not realize what a difference a new cutter would make. The shaver runs cooler, cuts more effectively, and pulls at the hairs less. Replace your cutter at least once per year!</li>
            <li> This item does a fine job of cutting beards, is fairly quiet, and is built well.  It is also compatible with the Braun cleaning system.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who has a very tough beard.  He says it is much better than the razor he was using.</li>
            <li> 2nd replacement and still going strong. Does great; no iiritation, smooth, and dependable. Will continue to use these replacements until the shaver itself finally gives up. (6 years and counting......)</li>
            <li> works really good. I enjoyed this product. and here&#x27;s me taking up more space ha ha ha ha ha ha</li>
            <li> After reading some reviews of iffy manufacturing of this foil, I decided to try to buy locally from Walmart.  I ended up with the same problem of the replacement not cutting very well.  It almost felt like it started off somewhat dull and got worse from there.  After only the few months I could put up with is I saw reviews on here had gotten better and ventured another shot at a newer pack.  The one that came in from Amazon cut like the first one that came with my Series 5.  It&#x27;s been months now of using this replacement and it is still going strong!  I&#x27;m so glad I reread reviews on here and found out the new shipment of packs had been re-upped in quality.  Definitely enjoying my shave again now.</li>
            <li> After 18 months, this brought my Braun back to like new performance.  Too expensive?  Probably, but it&#x27;s so worth it when you use it.</li>
            <li> My Braun&#x27;s at least 4 yrs old. 3rd replacement head. I was wary of the new 51s because of  the bad reviews but I think it&#x27;s closer than the previous Activator foil/cutter.</li>
            <li> This replacement pack was just the thing to completely rejuvenate my shaver.  This replacement pack was just the thing to completely rejuvenate my shaver.</li>
            <li> After 2 uses the center piece on the foil broke and sticks up on one end. Still usable, but have to push down every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned after reading the very mixed reviews about using this 51s foil and cutter pack for my older series Braun shaver.  I have had a lot of trouble in the past with electric shavers tearing up my neck.  I went ahead with the purchase, put this replacement combo in my Braun 8595 shaver, and I am very pleased with the results.  This works better than the foil and cutter that were replaced (as they should being brand new parts).  So, I&#x27;m voicing a big thumbs up on the 51s replacement combo.  For me it works just as well as the &amp;#34;Braun 8000 Activator Combi-Pack&amp;#34; that I used to buy (now discontinued).</li>
            <li> Just as good as the original.</li>
            <li> Braun recommends replacing the foil and cutter every 18 months.  Personally, given how much better it worked after I replaced them, I&#x27;m going to replace at 12 months from now on.  Replacement is dead easy.</li>
            <li> Fit and worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t replace the foil sooner.  I forgot how close a shave you get with a new razer</li>
            <li> Good buy and will make your rates are shaved like new.Quick shipping and delivery.</li>
            <li> Brought my old electric shaver Serie 5 back to life and my is skin no longer showing signs of a worn out screen.</li>
            <li> so, I went back to using the one that came with the shaver which I&#x27;ve been using for last 6 years.</li>
            <li> Noticeable improvement in shaving.  I will buy these again.  Works like I am using a new shaver.</li>
            <li> As advertised for Braun Series 5 shavers.</li>
            <li> Braun hasn&#x27;t learned their lesson. Why fix something that wasn&#x27;t broken? I don&#x27;t understand why they had to change design of the cutting block. It goes against all improvements they&#x27;ve done over the years.</li>
            <li> Restored my series 5 razor to brand new&lt;br /&gt;Greatly improved cut quality and comfort when shaving&lt;br /&gt;Much smoother and less violent shaving experience</li>
            <li> The new foil and cutter makes my Braun work like a new razor.</li>
            <li> Still delivers day after day and that for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Best price for the product I was able to find.</li>
            <li> How much can one say about a razor screen?  It&#x27;s a good shaver and the products seem to be well manufactured.</li>
            <li> this is slightly different from the original foil that is on my shaver, but it works just the same.</li>
            <li> Great cutters until my Braun shaver gave up.</li>
            <li> Fits my 550cc-4 type 5751.  I swapped out because the existing cutter was starting to nip at me.  So I would just recommend not holding out for the 18 month that that they recommend.  Maybe something between 12 and 15 instead.  I use the Braun clean and renew refills as well so between the two I expect a long life out of this shaver.</li>
            <li> we had no trouble installing it since it came in a different container.  it seems to work well recommend it</li>
            <li> Each time I order replacement blades for my razor I am amazed they are as expensive as they are. But once I finally caved in and ordered these I remembered why. Quick, Clean Shave each time with no scratches or nicks.</li>
            <li> The replacement foil and blade perform as they should.  No problems of any kind.  I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Best razor I have every owned.  Never had a problem with either the razor or the 51s Foil and Cutter.</li>
            <li> Shaver was not doing a good job, But now with the new blades. I have a new shaver......GREAT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappionted</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Replacement shaving heads.</li>
            <li> I get many stuff from Amazon and this is the first thing I get that is junk...it doesn&#x27;t work..what am saying..the new blade will not shave my face..at all..I get this blade before from Amazon. I live in a nursing home..am 66 of age..nothing wrong with my mind...but my hand and fingers and one leg..yes..so I get the blades so I could use my electric shaver..as it be much easy to hold too then a Razor Blade ( mach3 ) I get the new Cutter and Foil..fit great..turn it on...and try it on my face..didn&#x27;t cut down to my face and what it did cut, would hurt me. So I will never use that again and most my money go to this nursing home that I live in..so am back to the Mach 3 Razor..I have to get more blades for that...and it harder to hold with my hand and fingers..but it does shave my face and don&#x27;t cut the face...it just very hard to hold too with my bad fingers.</li>
            <li> Fantastic  product.  I purchased a  cutter replacement package 2 years ago for my Activator and it was inferior to this product.  This cutter head does not pull at my beard  like the prior product I purchased.  It moves very smoothly over my face. As a result, I  have been able to substantially reduce the time it takes me to shave.</li>
            <li> So far has totally met my expectations ... shaver is functioning as the day I bought it! Being used on a Series 5 ... 8975 ....</li>
            <li> Do have one of these razors?  Is not cutting as cleanly as you remember?  Replace the blades and foil.  Poof!  Like new again.</li>
            <li> Arrived as scheduled, no issues in receiving it &amp; is what we expected.</li>
            <li> fits my 8595 perfectly.</li>
            <li> The order arrived early.  Product is the usual great quality from Braun.  Will continue to order this product through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Some time ago I purchased a Braun electric razor.  My previous razor was leaving large tracts of facial skin untouched and, when my wife of fifty years of marriage, informed me of the fact, I knew that it was time for a new razor. I then bought the expensive Braun razor.  I used this razor daily for five years and the blade remained sharp to the end but it was taking marginally longer to shave so I decided to buy a new blade and foil.  This I did via the Amazon route and I have been luxuriating in an even smoother face than before although after fifty five years of marriage my wife has not noticed.  An excellent product received in a timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;Tonyell</li>
            <li> I replaced the old cutter and foil with these new ones. The razor shaves like it did when I first bought it! Very easy to switch old for new!</li>
            <li> I am not sure why Braun made the original replacement foil unavailable and instead is selling this Series 5 Combi 51s model, but it is terrible. It does not shave, it yanks the hairs out. I put up with this model for a while; then I had to buy a new razor altogether.</li>
            <li> I received it in a timely fashion.  It fit my shaver and does a good job of rejuvinating its performance.</li>
            <li> Old foil and cutter needed replacing</li>
            <li> This OEM replacement for Braun shaver was just what I needed to get back the close shave I had when I bought the shaver. Replace your blades every 18 months and you&#x27;ll keep getting a close shave.</li>
            <li> It came when it was supposed to and the new parts make the shave a lot nicer.  The pricing is a little expensive for my tastes, but since they aren&#x27;t generic replacement parts, Braun can pretty much charge what they want for them.</li>
            <li> After installing the new parts I could really feel a difference in the way my razor worked. I could feel the difference in the shave and I was happy I purchased the new parts. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> This came as a package deal with the Renew Refills.  The package saved a total of $12 over the best I could do anywhere else</li>
            <li> Good price and arrived earlier than expected.Exactly as ordered and half the price here in australia. No problems with order.</li>
            <li> Good buy ... would purchase again ,,, ,,, ,,,  ,,,&lt;br /&gt;Not much more to say about this purchase ... ...</li>
            <li> I own a Braun 8985 and needed a replacement foil and was nervous about buying this one after reading some of the reviews, but I have been using it for a month or so now with absolutely no complaints. I do shave every day so not sure if that makes a difference. When this one needs replaced I will definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> Despite having read the manual&#x27;s advice to replace the heads and foil every 18 months, I forgot or ignored it. After 2 years of use, I noticed that my Series 5 shaver was leaving me poorly shaven and my skin irritated. After going back to the manual, I realized I was overdue for this foil/cutter replacement. Wow! It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s brand new. I forgot how close a shave I could get from this.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product for years.  Works well.</li>
            <li> I have had a Braun Series 8000 for about 7 years now and have replaced the foil twice now. This product really regenerates my shaver and makes it feel almost like new. This is way better than buying one of those overpriced ($300!!) new Braun shavers.</li>
            <li> This replacement pack fits my Series 5 Braun shaver perfectly. It is well worth the price, cutter and foil will last.</li>
            <li> It fit perfectly on my 8960 and worked well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave it a four because I am not going to say &amp;#34;I Love it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Husband said the replacement parts work great would highly recommend to anyone, he reorders these parts when needed, saves on buying the complete shaver</li>
            <li> Cheaply made foil and cutter!</li>
            <li> Much closer shave after replacing the older cutter.</li>
            <li> My husband was very pleased with this replacement pack for his razor.  It saved us from having to purchase a new razor. We are very happy about that.</li>
            <li> I use my shaver everyday, recent head replacements including this one seem to wear out quicker than in the past.</li>
            <li> It cuts the whiskers off. I feel well shaved and I&#x27;m not looking for band aids.</li>
            <li> Really does return your old razor to like new condition. Personally I would shave with no other electric razor. Manufacturer recommends replacing cutter &amp; screen about every 18 months. Both are super easy to change and are cheaper then throwing out your old razor and buying new.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if what I received was an aberration, or that&#x27;s the normal product that is sold.  Nevertheless, the replacement pack I got was an imitation product instead of something that is manufactured in the US.  The cover foil was fragile and torn after a few usages.  I ended up having to go to a store to purchase the same product which has very different quality.</li>
            <li> There were some mixed reviews, but I replaced the old blade and this one cuts like butter.  Closer or equal to a blade.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about it - this is exactly as advertised, and a whole lot cheaper than buying it in a brick and mortar store.</li>
            <li> I have tried both and i must say this cutting block \\&quot;made in china\\&quot; is not a good as the 30b. why take a chance get the 30b</li>
            <li> Works great, and stays attached to my razor better than the original screen did :)  If you don&#x27;t want a new rasor, this is an excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> Got this a couple months ago. Shipped quickly and fit perfectly. Much better than the old one that broke. Didn&#x27;t realize I should replace them every decade. The old one lasted about 12 years.</li>
            <li> I was never so glad to get this  my  other one was shot and in 3 minutes I had old one out and new one installed headed for that clean shaved look. ty amazon.com</li>
            <li> Made my razor like new again.  Not much more to say. If you are not getting the close shave you are use to, just replace the blade and cutters and BAM - like new again.</li>
            <li> I have a Series 5 Shaver and this is the only Foil &amp; Cutter that fits it.  I use the Braun Series 5 because it the only shaver I ever found that gives me the shave I require.</li>
            <li> Braun is one of the best electric shavers on the market today and past years. The durabilty and quality that you get in this foil and cutter replacement pack will keep your shaver in mint condition for years to come.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, everything went great with the transaction</li>
            <li> Makes the shaver brand new again.</li>
            <li> Great replacement for the 8000 series. Will recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I really needed this. I thought the shaver was not working because I hadn&#x27;t changed the foil and cutter in quite a while. I was frankly amazed at how much difference it made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you order the right one for your shaver. I hunted around on the shaver before I finally found where it said what &amp;#34;series&amp;#34; it was. Mine is several years old, but still works well, so long as I follow the recommendations and replace this part regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation is easy, even for someone who is not known for having nimble fine motor skills.</li>
            <li> I had the Series 3 head for my 8000 series razor. It performed well for about 12 months and then needed a change. So I bought the series 5 head despite some earlier bad reviews. It has given me a close, comfortable shave so far and has cut down my shaving time by 30 seconds/shave, on average. Hopefully it will stay the course for longer than 12 months.</li>
            <li> This is the original replacement foil, and after using a knockoff foil and being completely disappointed, I am very happy to have purchased this. Shaving is much easier and less painful!</li>
            <li> Replacement kit works as expected, good buy!  Perfect fit for my 590 series shaver - as describribed.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> this piece was pricey.... however  - still cheaper than buying new electric razor...i wanted keep braun and i&#x27;m happy i purchased this replacement pack</li>
            <li> It does what it supposed to for the brand and model my dad has.  He is not complaining. Fair price.</li>
            <li> This shaver renewal package was over-priced in a local store.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, it wasn&#x27;t stocked when I needed to buy it!&lt;br /&gt;Braun series five doesn&#x27;t cut as close as the previous model;&lt;br /&gt;but, then too, it doesn&#x27;t cause &amp;#34;razor burn&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;The self-cleaning razor system flashes a light when 18 months&lt;br /&gt;has passed for the replacement of foil and cutter.</li>
            <li> I have always hated the idea of parts that wear out and need replacing.  But in this case, I think I had waited too long to replace my foil and cutter on my Braun Series 5 electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After swapping in the new product (very easy to do), man, did the shaving get a lot closer than it used to.  I get comfortable with what the worn our foil and cutter was doing and didn&#x27;t realize just how much smoother my skin would feel after a replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time around, I&#x27;m not waiting for the &#x27;replacement reminder&#x27; light to go off on me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bruce (aka, BruSimm)</li>
            <li> works great and would order again if needed.</li>
            <li> ve i ever hadworst sha</li>
            <li> It is like a new shaver</li>
            <li> it restored shaving quality and comfort.</li>
            <li> Fit like it should and was easy to install.  Can&#x27;t tell a great deal of difference with the new blade but my foil was damaged and had to be replaced anyway.  After 8+ years I guess it was about time :)</li>
            <li> I really like my Braun shaver and finding Amazon had the replacement heads was a real find for mew.  They are great.</li>
            <li> Replaced a broken foil/cutter.  Really does a good job.</li>
            <li> Fits my 8500 series without a glitch</li>
            <li> This foil and cutter work perfectly in my Braun 8995 razor.  On this razor, the rotating head is labeled Series 5, and the body is labeled 8000 series. The full model number is on the bottom front of the razor - same side as the on/off slider near the power connector. This can lead to a little confusion, so hopefully this helps identify the razor these work with.</li>
            <li> the razor cutter arrived faster than expected and is working well</li>
            <li> From my experience, all of Braun&#x27;s shaving equipment is excellent.  This blade set is the same, works great, feels good and shaves close.</li>
            <li> My series 5 razor shaves like new again.  Using it daily you don&#x27;t notice just how bad it needs a new set until it gets changed,then you&#x27;ll notice a huge difference.  They claim it lasts 18 months but I find it&#x27;s more like 6 to 8 at the very most.  This is the lowest price I&#x27;ve found anywhere by at least $10 difference.</li>
            <li> I do not know yet.  They just arrived.</li>
            <li> These never seem as good as the original, but still do the job well</li>
            <li> great product and great service thank you</li>
            <li> My husband thinks it is &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Fit perfect in my Series 5 - shaves like new.</li>
            <li> The quality of these Braun blades seems to be declining year after year.  The Cutter and Foil are marketed as good for a year before replacement.  However, I have noticed as of late that they don&#x27;t even last 6 months any more.  In fact, the last one I ordered was on September 26th, and by the end of of October it started to feel like an old blade.  Middle of November and its completely useless.  I have started shaving with shaving gel and a gilette again after 5 years.  simple because of the poor quality of this product.</li>
            <li> If youre considering buy a new razor in the Beaun line, none that I have tried of the new model cuts like this repl head. I recommend this highly. Good shave</li>
            <li> Shaves like new again, it worked fine.</li>
            <li> FOIL ARRIVED DAMAGED AND IS NOT USABLE.  Shipment packaging was not damaged and it looked like it was a manufacturing defect.</li>
            <li> Blades are excellent and are a better shave than the last set I purchased.  Don&#x27;t know the difference but they are good.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in August 2014 and it is supposed to last 18 months ,but today 4/3/2015 the replace foil cutter came on!&lt;br /&gt;This means it only lasted 8 months maximum&lt;br /&gt; I will try to contact Braun customer service if i can find their telephone, #</li>
            <li> Product as expected, good price and prompt delivery to Australia!</li>
            <li> I love Braun razors. I have only had a couple. Upgrading was out of want not so much need, I would recommend this to anybody that likes electrics.</li>
            <li> Amazon is our &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; for this replacement product. Always exactly what we need. The product fits perfectly into Dad&#x27;s shaver.</li>
            <li> I really am at a loss for words.  I purchased Braun Shaver Series 5 590cc on July 31, 2011.  In between that time Braun USA has decided we do not need the proper replacement for the shaver with the Optifoil configuration.  This foil and head is the Original Braun shaver and head used previously used for over 10 years.  I know I upgraded to the Braun Shaver Series 5 590cc in order to get upgraded foil cutting geometry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased this \\&quot;Replacement\\&quot; over a year ago to keep my shaver working like new.  If you zoom in on the photo of the shaver the foil is not the same as the current Optifoil head on the shaver sold here at Amazon for YEARS.  Look at the much hyped pictures on the Braun Shaver Series 5 590cc shaver page they look nothing like the foil head here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received it in the mail I didn&#x27;t really think anything of it.  But after a month of getting this Replacement head people were telling me it looked like I hadn&#x27;t shaved.  I was taken aback as it takes me a good 10 minutes to shave every morning.  I went back to shaving with a razor.  Then I remembered that my shaver foil didn&#x27;t look like the original one on the Braun Series 5 590cc.  I had chucked the old one in my cabinet and lo and behold the OLD ORIGINAL foil works 10 times better than this GARBAGE replacement they are selling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured after ANOTHER year they would get around to make a fully compatible replacement for the Braun Shaver Series 5 590cc but OH NO the only thing for sale is this REFUSE.  I even checked Baun&#x27;s official site for the Series 5 590cc which touts the Optifoil Geometry which in my case gets my coarse hairs, and then you go to the replacement parts and it says to purchase THIS!</li>
            <li> This replacement foil and cutter was easy to install and worked perfectly in my 565c shaver: smooth shave and no irritation. Opening the bubble pack packaging was the hardest part and required a sharp knife! Foil and cutter quality looks good. I need to shave with it for a year or so to judge durability, but so far so good. The package label indicates this product is made in Germany. I guess that&#x27;s one of the reasons it is so pricy.</li>
            <li> Perfect condition! Glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using braun electric shavers for over 25 years and love their products. Pricing on amazon.com is best I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> The new cutter and foil makes the electric razor feel better than it did when it was new.</li>
            <li> This is the exact replacement from the factory for my shaver. The package is annoying to open but does protect the item.</li>
            <li> A little less expensive than at the store but I am finding some stores sell the razor but not the replacement packs.This is the second or third Braun I have had they are good razors but I Have to change out the foil and cutter about every 6 months and that is expensive.</li>
            <li> Removal of the old blade and installation of the new blade and cover were easy. Like having a new razor again.</li>
            <li> I replace the foil and cutter in my razor every 18 months for improved performance and comfort; the replacement process couldn&#x27;t be easier</li>
            <li> I wished there was just the screen for sale and not both screen and cutter.  The screen was all i really needed.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive alternative to more expensive replacements you see in stores.  This replacement cutter &amp; foil fit really good.  Made my razor feel like new (especially since I had cracked the old foil cover and was using that way for months before buying this).</li>
            <li> I was way overdue on replacing my electric shaver head... this was perfect. At first I was unsure of it being the correct part; but was quickly assured with not only the description; but other responses. Quality and price was excellent.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Braun Series 5 razor actually a couple years ago. Recently I&#x27;d noticed a diminishing quality of shave. After some searching I found that other users had purchased this blade/foil replacement and seen positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new blade/foil replacement did wonders for my shaver-- it&#x27;s practically new again! If you&#x27;re having any issues with the quality of shave I encourage you to purchase this! It&#x27;s much less than purchasing a new razor and you&#x27;ll have like- new results.</li>
            <li> Very good replacement part for my shaver. Replacement is very easy and fits like it was originaly installed. I highly recomend this replacement.</li>
            <li> I have used Braun shaving products for 20 years, and they are the very best.  The replacement foil and cutter replacement packs are very easy to install and last more than 6 months each time I replace them.</li>
            <li> I have a Braun 8975 model and purchased this replacement pack just recently.  I had waited too long to do this (over 2 years) and now wish that I would&#x27;ve done so a long time ago. The installation was a breeze and the shaving experience is now again like it once was when I first bought the shaver. From now on I&#x27;ll be following the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation and replacing the foil and cutter every 6 months.</li>
            <li> makes my razor feel like new again, great price compared to retail stores, will buy in another year or so</li>
            <li> Love the whole concept of the electric shaver.  But after about 14 months or so the foil wears.  I think this pack offers excellent value</li>
            <li> Keeps my Braun 5 series shaver working perfectly.  Spend way less on this than I did buying premium disposable razors</li>
            <li> If there were 1/2 stars it would be a two and a 1/2. The head itself is fine and it works ok. It is not the same one that the razor came with.  That one lasted about 20 months.  These only last 12 at best and I don&#x27;t have a course or thick beard.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly on my Braun as expected. They are durable and last forever so I hardly ever replace them (even after a year).</li>
            <li> Braun is utterly ridiculous.  I&#x27;m sure this foil works for the right razor.  The problem is figuring out what works with your razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for my 5775 type 5724 and it did not fit.  So, I contacted Braun to ask for help.  They said they had 3 DIFFERENT models of the 5775.  So, I needed the &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; which is 5724 for mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This method is utterly stupid.  Just call the 3 different types of 5775 models 5775, 5776 and 5777.  Then, you know what foil fits your razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I eventually found the 31s work with my 5775 type 5724 razor.  The 31B foil is the same I heard, just black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, will I buy another Braun if this one craps out????  No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the Braun because I know they last and you can get replacement parts.  In my chat with Braun, they said they are not making the 31S or 31B replacement foils anymore.  So, there goes that theory on spending a little more on Braun to get a razor that will last longer</li>
            <li> This is something that I have a hard time buying. I use my shaver heads till there pulling out hair, ouch. That is not a good idea but who wants to spend money on this. So when I found this on Amazon for the price I did I was a happy guy. Braun razors are the best but only with sharp shaving heads and foil.</li>
            <li> exactly what i needed</li>
            <li> Great value and long lasting.  My boyfriend&#x27;s original foil and cutter lasted just under 2 years before it needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous about ordering this replacement for my 8585 shaver - based on some of the negative reviews here.  I&#x27;ve been using the new Series 5 Combi 51S Foil/Cutter for a few weeks now and have no complaints.  I did notice a slight tendency of the blades to &#x27;grab&#x27; when I first started using it so I do not doubt other&#x27;s negative reactions.  But for me any &#x27;pulling&#x27; is minimal and I do not notice it anymore.  Full disclosure - I have a light beard / light stubble so those with thicker facial hair may have a different experience.  FWIW, my package was labeled &amp;#34;Made in Germany&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Item as described. Rapid delivery. Fits perfectly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Brauns&#x27; for more than 40 years, do I need to say more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paal</li>
            <li> Was a new cutter and foil and fit my shaver fine.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I needed for my Braun Shaver. It came sooner then expected so I have been quite happy with the company. Keep up the good work. I would rate them 5/5.</li>
            <li> Delivered on-time.  No problems</li>
            <li> What can I say? Fit perfectly, works fine.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly well. It essentially turned my perhaps 9 years old 8585 shaver into a brand new one again.</li>
            <li> Sorry buddies. Gotta shave, every day. Discipline, starts early, make time. Every limp Richard celeb sporting an uber trimmed chin, or disheveled ignored nest, they just didn&#x27;t want to bother. Is that twenty words?</li>
            <li> back to new the best shave ever fit braun series 5 perfect screen and blades see you in 9 months</li>
            <li> I replace the cutter head on my 8000 series shaver about every 18 months. This is the first time with this new series 5 and the result has been very good.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement for two different razor models.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but I need it</li>
            <li> Just as described... works great!!</li>
            <li> Replaced all the past on my Braun series 5 shaver today with the new parts.  Everything fits and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It works, but Amazon charges postage and handling, and the actual supplier does the same.  I paid about $5.00 too much for this item.</li>
            <li> Thankful, I can still buy this online.  My BrAun is the best shaver I have owned.  Like the self cleaning and happy to find it online.</li>
            <li> Fits great and works as expected.</li>
            <li> This foil and cutter replacement pack does not fit my Braun 5614 shaver and the company I purchased it from Hazlo Trading in Dublin Ireland does not answer my email inquiries to them.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet,original was excellent</li>
            <li> The foil &amp; cutter replacement made shaving 100% better.  I was so satisfied with the replacement pack that I immediately ordered another to have as a backup.  Amazon&#x27;s price was the best I could find &amp; the price was even lower when I ordered the second pack!</li>
            <li> It made a HUGE difference in the shave I get from my old razor. I&#x27;ll always replace the cutter on a regular basis from now on.</li>
            <li> Best price i found on what I needed</li>
            <li> factory replacement, fast and works perfectly. Will by again is a great price for the right fit.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement</li>
            <li> the shaver works like brand new again</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed my Braun Series 5 shaver for over 5 years and have only replaced the foil and cutter 2X.  Fits perfect and works like a charm.  Please continue making this replacement pack.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Just what i needed to renew my razor.  It saved me a trip to the store.</li>
            <li> Foil did not last very long, about 3 months, had to replace again with another vendor.</li>
            <li> great deal for my daily shaver</li>
            <li> The replacement foil and cutter does make your razor work better.  Also the Amazon price was much better than buying this in store.</li>
            <li> this foil and cutter are so fine tuned that the unit is quieter in-use than I can ever remember; it performs like new too!</li>
            <li> arrived fast, easy to change,new sharp blade makes shaving easy and a lot&lt;br /&gt;faster. you shouldn&#x27;t wait so long to replace.&lt;br /&gt;Big difference,razor like new again.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Bob</li>
            <li> In my experience the foil design of the 30b is FAR superior to the foil design of the 51s. The larger hexagon shaped holes in the 51s seem to allow a little &amp;#34;wiggle&#x27; in the hair shaft as the block is cutting it, thereby creating a tugging/pulling force on the hair rather than cleanly shearing it. For me, the foil pattern on the 30b does a MUCH better job holding/stabilizing the hair so the block/blade below can make a clean cut without any tugging/pulling. Of course, this problem becomes more and more noticeable with longer intervals between shaving and/or as the blade edges deteriorate over time. If you&#x27;re a daily shaver and/or change the block/foil frequently there&#x27;s probably no discernible difference between the two but for anyone who, like me, goes a couple days between shaving and/or likes to maximize the life of the blade then the 30b is superior.</li>
            <li> Foil and cutter hard to find a good one for this razor, but this works great.  Shaves good, cleans good, wish I had purcased more of them, hope they still have some when I go to reorder.</li>
            <li> Although it is expensive, a new cutter and foil make the razor seem like new.  Less expensive than buying a replacement. Arrived  on time as predicted.</li>
            <li> I was floundering on whether to get this or not. After reading specific model numbers on each review, I decided to go ahead and get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an 8985 which seems to be different than the other 8XXX series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked great! Close shave and absolutely no hair-pulling as described in other reviews. It&#x27;s like a new razor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit from Amazon because, as usual, they had the best&lt;br /&gt;price by far; but I was disappointed in it.  It wasn&#x27;t comparable to the&lt;br /&gt;original that came with my shaver in either looks or performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few months, I purchased the Braun 30B on the advice of someone&lt;br /&gt;in the Amazon reviews even though this is NOT the head Braun recommends&lt;br /&gt;for my shaver.  It is a far superior product in every way than the 51s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Activator 360 for nearly 5 years now and it seems that each time I need to replace the blade Braun has &#x27;conveniently&#x27; changed the design/packaging and most frustratingly the name of my foil/cutter. Well I finally found this and despite the difficulty determining which was for my razor it is by far the best version to date. Cuts more efficiently and slightly closer than previous versions. Thanks!</li>
            <li> As most people, I read the negative reviews first.  I&#x27;ve got an 8000 series and saw the bashing of the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; version of the same foil and cutter.  First, I have to confess, I think I&#x27;ve used the same foil and cutter for at least 4 years...seriously.  The foil finally ripped and forced me to look for the replacement.  I found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once it arrived, I briefly compared the old and new.  They looked the same to me.  Then I shaved.  Same.  Not better, not worse than my 4+ year old cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is just a replacement and it fit just fine.  Don&#x27;t read into it as being better or worse.  It is the same and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> worked great for what we needed, replacement for a ripped old head and a new blade, made a new life out of my razor</li>
            <li> New foil and block arrived very fast. Set for my 8595 series Braun perfectly. Made my shaver perform like New. Price was average for the same product at the time but shipping was free and fast.</li>
            <li> Shaver works like new again.&lt;br /&gt;This is the correct replacement cutting block for the Series 5 550cc. It looks, fits, and works just like the original.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered on time and in new condition as advertised.</li>
            <li> A quality product. Have used these for years. There is Braun and all the rest. A close shave.  Great price</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly on my Braun Shaver and returned it to a nice close shave (never as good as a blade, but close).  Recommend following the 18-month replacement schedule.</li>
            <li> Braun recommends replacing the foil and cutter every 18 months.  I unfortunately don&#x27;t remember the purchase dates, so I wait for my razor to alert me.  Noticeable difference in my shave after the foil and cutters were replaced.  Besides the batteries in the unit, it is like getting a new razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for about 5years. Their replacement parts are excellent, just like the originals. I&#x27;ve gotten my last 2 replacement screen and cutter block at Amazon. Excellent price and service.</li>
            <li> I bought this replacement part for my razor. When I opened the package, it looked as if the replacement part was far lower quality than the one I had. But, it needed to be replaced so I went ahead and replaced it. A month later, it is broken and I had to go to Target to get a new one so I can shave tomorrow. Bad news on this though - even the ones Target sell are the low quality model. The foils had been lasting me 12 - 18 months and this new model lasted just a few days more than one month. Braun needs to restore the quality or I will be finding a better company to purchase razors from.</li>
            <li> The replacement foil and cutter arrived very promptly.  I have had the Braun shaver for several years and I need to replace cutter and foil every 6-9 months.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t realize how dull my razor had become until i replaced my foil and cutter. this gets 5 stars from me for essentially giving me a brand new razor. replacement is very easy and worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Given all the negative reviews, I was pleasantly surprised that it works well; does not pinch/pull my hairs, even after not shaving for two full days.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying that this was the correct part and did work properly, but it took forever to receive.  It was shipped from China, so had to go through customs, etc.  I bought a new razor in the meantime, so this will be a backup razor.</li>
            <li> My razor wasn&#x27;t cutting very well, bought a new replacement and it did not cut much better, I guess I&#x27;m not an electric razor man.</li>
            <li> Braun Series 5 Combi 51s Foil And Cutter Replacement Pack was just as the description. New in the package.  And fitmy braun series 5 perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works fine...But don&#x27;t expect this Braun Cutter to last 18 months (as indicated by Braun). I&#x27;ve spoken to the Braun factory representative and they say &amp;#34;sorry&amp;#34;. It&#x27;ll last, with an average beard, about 5-6mths.</li>
            <li> The replacement made a world of difference..</li>
            <li> As always I was greatly satisfied with product and service</li>
            <li> People have stated that this cutter may have recently changed for the better--the answer is NOPE.™ I ordered these on June 1, 2015 and it&#x27;s the same exact blade I&#x27;ve been using for at least 3 years. Despite being brand new, it still PULLS my hair out of my face. Do you get how much that sucks? It&#x27;s not fun to have hair being ripped out of your cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not even talking about a thick beard -- I couldn&#x27;t grow a beard to save my life. Thin, short, white peach fuzz and this cutter can&#x27;t even handle it. Are you nuts?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the Braun 360 model 8985 that says &amp;#34;Made in Germany&amp;#34; on the back that I bought sometime in 2007 or so and the original blades I had in it as everyone said were perfect. Can anyone with confidence tell me where I can buy an ACTUAL good replacement cutter for this model? I&#x27;ve had enough of misinformation and I&#x27;ve had enough of bracing myself for pain each time I shave. Unacceptable. Please, someone, anyone, direct me to the Quality Cutters.™</li>
            <li> This saved me from buying a whole shaver!  Now I just buy the foil and cutter replacement and I am good to go, just like new!</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a good close shave with very little irritation as long as you replace the foil and cutter regularly. I think the product packaging suggests replacing every 18 months. I find I need to replace sooner than that because if I don&#x27;t it does start to irritate a little, but all in all a good product. It also helps to use the cleaning station with the liquid that also needs to be replaced regularly. They say every month. I can let it go longer than that with no problem and it cleans the shaver well, and seems to help keep it sharp.</li>
            <li> I ordered this replacement foil/cutter set with a little bit of concern after reading some negative reviews.  Received it, installed and put to use.  I should have run it through a cleaning cycle first as I got a little harmless residue on my face with the first use, but that aside, it performed just as good as when the razor was new.  After a cleaning cycle I had no other problems and it performs flawlessly, still the closest electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and I have no intention of buying a new electric until this one completely bites the dust, as long as I can get these replacement foil/cutters and the rest of the razor holds up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will order this product again next time this foil/cutter is worn out, provided it is still made.  (1st one lasted well over two years, I might add.)  Don&#x27;t let the bad reviews keep you from ordering this.</li>
            <li> Was as exactly as expected. Arrived quickly. Recommend it to any one who needs new shaver head. Last one lasted longer than reccommended.</li>
            <li> Product is very sharp and noticeably better at trimming my facial hair than the older blade is. It was 100% Brand New!</li>
            <li> Ours electric razor Combi 51s &#x27;s foil &amp; cutter went dull. So we need a  foil &amp; cutter replacement fast.  Now it shaves very well and close.</li>
            <li> It was a good price but never seem to last as long as they say.  They only last about two months.  I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for a long time and always buy my replacment head on Amazon.  Just really don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the ones as I buy in the store.  It says up to a year.  Never, no way.  I don&#x27;t have a thick beard nor lots of hair.  The head wears out and gets holes in them and can tear up your face..  Jsut saying the pice is good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun for years without a problem, but this particular shaver seems to occasionally pull my hairs out. It&#x27;s pretty painful. Doesn&#x27;t happen a lot, but when it does, ouch. Maybe like 1-3 times a week. Feels like my face is being cut, but I think it&#x27;s just pulling out a beard hair or two. Must be a design flaw.</li>
            <li> Great works well. Good clean close shave. Its not exactly as close as straight razor but pretty close and a lot easier on your skin.</li>
            <li> After using the Braun 8000 every day, the edges no longer give the same quality cut. The cutting head snaps out and the replacement pack restores the blade sharp quality.</li>
            <li> This gift is for my dad for Christmas so it was exactly what I ordered and it will fit his razor!</li>
            <li> The only place my husband can find these cutter heads at a reasonable price.  Wouldn&#x27;t go any where else for this.</li>
            <li> Fits my older Braun 8975 model and makes the shaver work well again.</li>
            <li> Glad I got this.  Easy off and on replacement.  Shaver works much better</li>
            <li> My old Foil &amp; Cutter Braun Series 5 was almost 3 years old. The new one takes less time to shave with the best result. It took only three days to deliever it to my door.</li>
            <li> Delivers what was advertised</li>
            <li> Gift, well made stuff</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found a better electric yet...</li>
            <li> I have been using the foil and cutter replacement for years. It appears that once they changed it from the \\&quot;8000 360 Complete\\&quot; to the \\&quot;Series 5 Combi 51S\\&quot; I am not getting as many shaves from it as I would have. They still do a good job of shaving, but they tend to last just over 1-1/2 months. I will continue to use them until the actual shaver stops working.</li>
            <li> Forget Norelco and Remington. Braun is THE best. Nothing gets put on this mug but Braun.</li>
            <li> The item was shipped in time, and now the shaver works as good as new. When I will need another one, I wil purchase again.</li>
            <li> Braun has been going downhill for the last couple of years.  I have a series 8000 Braun Clean and Renew system (8781) I bought many years ago which served me well up until about 2 years ago.  When I began replacing the foil/cutter with the series 5 replacement items I began to have unsatisfactory results such as pinching, poor cutting action, insufficient beard removal, etc.  I had to start replacing cutters at 6 month intervals instead of the 18 months recommended.  With the last replacement foil 51s bought just a couple of weeks ago, it doesn&#x27;t hardly cut at all.  If you look at the spacing between the metal ridges, the newer foil has visibly closer spacing than the older ones, which might be the problem, but I am so disgusted with the trend and increasing replacement expense for this razor, I am tossing the whole mess out and going with another electric razor company, haven&#x27;t decided which, yet.  In the meantime, have gone back to safety razor and realize just how satisfying a really good, close shave can be.  Maybe I&#x27;ll just stick with the old technology and live without the convenience of an electric.  I will advise anyone who asks NOT to buy a Braun product.</li>
            <li> As at least one other reviewer has mentioned, earlier shipments seem or have been from elsewhere, but mine, which arrived a few days ago, was stamped with Angela Merkel&#x27;s seal of approval.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve gotten replacement cutters and foil for a shaver I received about 14 months ago. For anyone who wears glasses, if you remember the shock at the first time you ever put on a pair after months or years of having gotten used to the blurry world around you, you know how I&#x27;ve felt again about the morning shave.</li>
            <li> The product met the requirements and the need for my personal use. It arrived in perfect conditions and in working conditions.</li>
            <li> Great replacement.  I don&#x27;t have the cleaning base anymore so I manually clean my shaver after each use.  These replacement foil and cutters last me over a year before I start to notice that the shave isn&#x27;t quite as close anymore.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> My shaver foil developed a small hole--ouch. Well, no shaver is fun with the blade hitting skin. Ordered the Series 5 foil and cutter block. Back to smooth, easy shaves. Been Braun for more than 30 years.</li>
            <li> This is the fifth or sixth foil and cutter I have bought for my Braun.  I change them every 18 months as suggested.  I have never had any issue with them so I give them five stars.</li>
            <li> Thank you amazon for having these! Made my husband happy!</li>
            <li> It is the way that is supposed to be</li>
            <li> These are great to renew my electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Exactly the refill i was after for my Series 5.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and cutter block and foil works quite well.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my husband&#x27;s 6 yr old Braun Activator series.  He says it&#x27;s like having a new shaver.</li>
            <li> The foil that came with the razor lasted for years.  The last one I got didn&#x27;t last a year.  This third one will tell the tale.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. It fit my razor just fine. It came in the mail on time. I forgot how good new blades are. I have a much faster and cleaner shave now.</li>
            <li> Good product but not quite as good as it should be.</li>
            <li> Original product with a much cheaper price than local stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten new cutter replacements every year.  This time the new cutter assembly did not fit my razor and there was no instructions concerning it. I&#x27;m unhappy and I&#x27;m switching to a different razor.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this item to replace the foil head, which does wear thin and can start to nick one&#x27;s face.  But there is no doubt that the new blades, also part of the package, make a great difference to the closeness of the shave.  Not cheap, but well worth doing to rejuvenate your Braun.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to make my Braun shaver work like new, so I can get years of service from it.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the original product, fast delivery, would recommend to anyone very, very good original spare parts braun taken Amazon</li>
            <li> This is the original OEM replacement foil and cutter for my Braun.  Works perfectly and does exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> Not the same screen that came with my 5000 series when I bought it. Right away I didn&#x27;t get a good shave. It&#x27;s pulled my whiskers several times. Ouch! I&#x27;m going back to my Norelco . Braun is trying to get away cheap by not offering the same screen but a screen for various models.</li>
            <li> Replacing the foil makes this shaver a new shaver every time.  I replace the foil once each year. I would not buy another shaver. Braun is the best!</li>
            <li> Although the review history of this item gave me some anxiety, I went ahead and purchased one for my Braun 8985. The original foil and cutter had been in use for over 5 years. The difference was quite dramatic. The chatter I&#x27;d grown used to ceased at once, and shaving became much more pleasant. I&#x27;ve had it in use for a few months now and absolutely no complaints. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it works.</li>
            <li> Once I was able to break the foil and cutter free from the packaging it was a snap to install.  But the packing will literally stop a HEAT round.  If this is Proctor &amp; Gamble&#x27;s idea of preventing counterfeiting all they&#x27;re doing is annoying their customers...</li>
            <li> I think Braun has it down.  Probably last brand of razor I ever buy.  I have too much other stuff to think about.  This cuts closely, cleanly, etc., etc.</li>
            <li> As advertised and received in time.</li>
            <li> Do not buy. This is completely useless: you won&#x27;t be able to shave after installing this &amp;#34;replacement&amp;#34;.  The problem is the cutter, not so much the foil. The new cutter simply does not cut. You can hear when the shaver is working: There is noise of beard being cut while you move it on your skin. With this &amp;#34;cutter&amp;#34;, there is no cutting noise at all. I had to retrieve my old cutter from the garbage so I could shave. Don&#x27;t know what I will do now, it seems my Braun shaver has become useless if I can&#x27;t find reasonable replacement foil and cutter.</li>
            <li> On the positive side, this replacement cutter for the Series 5 shaver is a perfect fit for the razor. It also allows for a much closer and quicker shave. Now the big negative that many others have commented on: Upon changing the foil, I noticed immediately that the pattern/design of the foil was NOT the same as the one that came standard with my Series 5 unit. The openings for the hair to go through are larger. The problem with this is that you get several painful pulls of hair while shaving. This would be maybe a couple times a month I&#x27;d get pulling with the old foil, now I get it with every shave and usually multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand how this can be sold as the same foil as the one I received with my Series 5 shaver when it very clearly is not.</li>
            <li> Not cutting close.  We probably should buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> Smooth, close shaves!  I love mine!!!</li>
            <li> I combined this product with the cleaning solution to remember to clean my razor properly. This is great and saves time.</li>
            <li> What a difference after putting this new foil &amp; cutter on my Braun, like a car with a new set of tires. Shaves as good or better than new!</li>
            <li> Perfect fit.  Improved shave.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I wanted within a few days.  Better than going to a store and finding it not there!</li>
            <li> Razor shaves like new now.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not a Braun fan you&#x27;re missing the best shave on the market.  I&#x27;ve gone through the 3-headed revolving cutters, the look-alikes, the also-rans.  They cut hair.  Braun does far more than that.  With the Series 5 blades they give you a &#x27;close shave&#x27; - what other brands attempt to do.  Next to a five-blade razor blade with lots of soap . . . well, Braun does just about as good with these Series 5.  Good purchase, fair price, excellent product.</li>
            <li> it is Braun of course, everything perfect, right product, delivered on time, good price</li>
            <li> PROS:  Good shave quality.  Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  I&#x27;m hoping this is just an anomaly and not the norm, but when I changed out the cutter and head for my shaver to this product and started shaving with it, I received quite a surprise.  When shaving, I started seeing like a black soot or dust or something from the shaver on my face.  It was turning my face grey or black.  Thankfully it washed off.  I put the shaver into the cleaner and tried it again on the bare part of my arm just to see if that fixed the problem.  Thankfully it did, but I was not happy with it turning part of my face black.  I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars because I was able to get it cleaned up and back to working how it should, but having this black stuff coming out of the head or the cutter is not right.  Never had this problem with other units.  So I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s just an oddity with this particular package.</li>
            <li> took intirely too long too get once ordered, thats my only complaint item preforms well and im happy with it</li>
            <li> These Braun shaver foils are a license to print money,  almost $60 at my local drug store,  I paid less than half that on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Works as expected.</li>
            <li> A very good replacement. Too expensive and in retrospect it was a dumb idea to purchase this shaving system altogether. Blades do a better job and are cheaper.</li>
            <li> Was a little tentative in ordering this item with all the bad reviews, but I did so thinking I could return it if unsatisfactory. It arrived promptly &amp; I was more than happy with the purchase. It shaves me very comfortably &amp; gives me a very close shave even with a few days heavy growth. Absolutely no irritation. The one I received was made in Germany. Definitely reccommend!!</li>
            <li> My old foil and cutter had worn out completely, so had to replace with a new one that I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon. Else would have ended buying a new shaver system. My shaver system is good to go again now. :-)</li>
            <li> I was not getting a close shave from an older cutter and foil for my 8585 activator, so I ordered this series 5 set.  It would now take about a half an hour to shave my face!  Too late to get a refund, but beware...it is not the original blade or foil, so it does not work with the original (high end) Activator.  Total waste of money and time.  I would give it 0 stars if it were possible</li>
            <li> My husband likes to replace his foil and cutter ever 3 months. With subscribe and save this is a good price and I don&#x27;t have to think about when I need to get it!  I live S&amp;S items!</li>
            <li> I love the razor, and the cutter/foil that come with it. These replacements are considerably lower quality than what comes with the razor, but seem to be the only game in town. With the reviews here, I looked all over before ordering the first replacement 6 months ago. I just received my second replacement as the fist has worn out. I wish Braun were a better company...</li>
            <li> Used this razor for 10 years. Already dreading the day it breaks</li>
            <li> Braun always has good quality and long lasting sharpness.</li>
            <li> Good Job!!&lt;br /&gt;Bob G.</li>
            <li> is everything very good but 35 $ for that is too much and the photo in the description should be taken a little bit better.</li>
            <li> The new screen and cutter block once again made my 5- year old Braun like new. I change the blade about on e every 18 months and this genuine Braun replacement was priced right and works great.</li>
            <li> I need it in my shaver,thanks, once &amp;#60;i buy this machine &amp;#60;i knew&amp;#60;i nedd this replacement.Tanks a lot,&amp;#60;i will need more</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement part</li>
            <li> I have used series 5  for  many  years, and I like it a lot.  I am a Braun shaver customer for life</li>
            <li> meets my expectations</li>
            <li> The foil snapped in half after about 2 months--and past the return date.  Had to order a new one.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It simply came damaged and I could not use it in my shaver. Now I need to return the item and buy another one. Too much work for a cheap item. I&#x27;guess I am going to ask for refund and buy another one in a shop.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor that I have had for years. Every two years I replace it with this replacement cutter. No problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This item was a replacement part for one that was in the shaver and had worn out due to use. The improvement was noticeable right away.  I have always used Braun replacement parts and have never been disappointed with their quality.</li>
            <li> What amazes me at times is when Amazon asks for a review on something like this.  This is a basic replacement pack for a shaver.  Nothing exceptional.  You don&#x27;t buy generic for Braun.  You buy Braun for Braun.  Therefore, this Braun replacement pack for my Braun shaver does what it is supposed to do.  End of story.</li>
            <li> Change the foil and cutter once a year or so and my Braun works like new.</li>
            <li> After replacing my blade, my Braun worked like new!  Very satisfied!  Braun quality fit and finish made changing blade simple and quick!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve put in these replacement parts.  A little light on the razor indicates it&#x27;s time to replace.  It is, literally, a snap to replace the blades. Mere seconds.  I was surprised at how much quieter the new set was compared to the old set.  The only difficult part of the process is opening the silly plastic container without incurring a serious laceration.</li>
            <li> I have used Braun shavers for over thirty years and have had very satisfactory results. I heartily recommend this product to anyone that is looking for realia- bility and quality performance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often write reviews, but I had read some poor reports on this product and wanted to set the record straight. I put off replacing the screen and blades on my Braun 360 for as long as I could because of the negative reviews I had read. The screen finally wore through and I ordered this set from Amazon. I realize that different men have different beards and may experience different results so I can only speak for myself. The screen looks different than the original but it gives me a closer, smoother shave than the original without any pulling or discomfort. I wish I had gotten this earlier. It gives the best shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I love the Braun series 5 and shave both my head and face with it 2-3 times per week. The original foil lasted about 18 months. This replacement has gone 2 so far and still like new...</li>
            <li> Husband was excited to get this for Christmas!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and works well.  This series replacement pack is had to find in a store at a comparable value.</li>
            <li> great nice and sharp, shipped right out</li>
            <li> Exactly the way described!!!</li>
            <li> I buy a set of these annually, about the same price as local, but a lot easier to shop for.  OEM works well.</li>
            <li> Very pleased and price was very good.  And the shipping was prompt.</li>
            <li> Item arrived damaged.</li>
            <li> Bought this replacement cutter and screen for a spare.  Arrived quickly and is perfect.</li>
            <li> always works great....</li>
            <li> I got this cutter replacement and it&#x27;s perfect fit for my husband braun series 5.</li>
            <li> razor works much better freshened up, closer and faster shave</li>
            <li> Basic product.  Works as designed and expected.  Braun has good products:  well designed and manufactured with good QC.  Works as expected and cheaper here than in retail stores.</li>
            <li> My razor is an older model,so it&#x27;s harder to find replacement heads.  I will keep my old razor till it wears out as long as you carry the replacements. Thanks</li>
            <li> This is exciting as a set of replacement foils can be. Would buy again</li>
            <li> I was thinking this summer that my beard was going faster.  DUH, needed to change the head and block; the head &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34; cheaper but works quite great</li>
            <li> It just does not give me a shave that is really close. This is the second one I have purchased and they have only lasted about 3 months.</li>
            <li> I noticed some people say the shaver pulls. I havent noticed the same but this is my second shaver and the fist one used to irritate my face so from my perspective it does the job. I have a random directional growing beard. the foil makes it easier for me to shave with less passes.</li>
            <li> My husband has had his Braun Series 5 shaver for over 3 years now and it is great.  The replacement pack was a gift for him to continue enjoying his shaver.  It was delivered on time as promised and everything was intact.  The blades last and are of such good quality.</li>
            <li> Makes for a remarkable upgrade when the blades get dull.  Easy to install and a must after many shaves.  Certainly a must to get.</li>
            <li> Great razor, so I have to keep it going.</li>
            <li> I have the 8995 and this is perfect.  Instantly noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun for many years. It works great. Just need to replace the foil ever couple years or so.</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest and easiest way to replace your cutter.  It&#x27;s nearly impossible to find the correct replacement in the stores, and they are very expensive--almost not worth replacing.</li>
            <li> better than a cheaper replacement that I think was made in China and came from Korea</li>
            <li> The products I ordered seem to work fine.  My only complaint was that it took too long to deliver from South Korea to New York.</li>
            <li> It works as antitcipated!!</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s face is smooth again! A new foil and cutter made his Braun seem new again.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re all happy.</li>
            <li> The replacement foil and cutter are exactly the same as original. No problems with the product. The price is lower than buying it at any store.</li>
            <li> Used my old set for many many years and never replaced it.  I finally did and wish I would have sooner.  One thing I will say is that these things last a while if you take care of them.  Make sure you clean them often and they will last.</li>
            <li> Nothing to get too excided about here. I did notice how well my razer worked after changing it out. I think I waited too long before I changed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t make the mistake I did and wait to long on replacing these.</li>
            <li> Like having a new shaver</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading the negative reviews of this product but I haven&#x27;t had any of the issues mentioned. In fact it seems that I&#x27;m getting a better shave now than I did when the razor was new.</li>
            <li> I have an old Braun Shaver and this screen and cutter was said to fit it.  The cutter fits, but the mesh screen does not</li>
            <li> bought for my dad- way cheaper than in store.  razors are unnecessarily expensive, so it is nice to get them at a lower price.</li>
            <li> Amazon should be ashamed of themselves.  This replacement is obviously some sort of fake -- it doesn&#x27;t cut well, not anywhere close to the original, and is no better than the worn down foil I replaced.  The only reason I haven&#x27;t returned it is because it&#x27;s been used a number of times and I can&#x27;t in good conscience return something for a refund that&#x27;s been used.  Run -- do not walk away from this replacement.  Just go to the store.</li>
            <li> Made my shaver shave like new again!</li>
            <li> I received the Braun Series 5 foil and cutter in time frame promised but the product is completely unusable.&lt;br /&gt;I foil is completely broken and useless.  I have included photos to show the problem.&lt;br /&gt;The lateral support on one end of the foil was not attached properly and the side panel just flops around.</li>
            <li> helpful product. does just what it says</li>
            <li> Works great.  I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my old foil and cutter was.</li>
            <li> I used straight razors for the first 34 years of my life, but my wife bought me this razor a couple of years ago. I was starting to complain that the electric razor simply wasn&#x27;t capable of a smith and quick shave, but when my wife ordered the replacement head, I was shocked by how much faster and better the shave was.  Like all razors, these machines must get new heads on occasion.  I&#x27;d say every 8 months or so.  If you have a sharp blade, the razor works like a champ.</li>
            <li> Previous reviews have noted that units manufactured in Japan did not meet the German standards, however, my foil and cutter replacement for my Braun shaver shaves close and without pull.  I do recommend using a pre-shave lotion.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely horrible replacement foil/cutter block. I have had my 8995 since 2006, replaced a few of the foil/cutter blocks. They have all gotten progressively worse, with the latest being the worst (series 5 combi 51s), for 8995. I gave it a full three months before deciding that it was indeed the foil/cutter block, that was the problem, and not me :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave that this gives is so bad that in a meeting on the day i shaved, (a video-conf meeting), the guy on the other side was joking - \\&quot;maybe you need a new blade\\&quot; - no i am not making this up!&lt;br /&gt;and now, after 1.5 months, the shaver now says \\&quot;reset foil\\&quot; all the time, with each shave, just horrible. I used to do every other day, i tried every day as well, nothing helps. Looks like the design itself is bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews, i am not sure if i should buy the series 3 30B either. Looks like the geniuses at Gillete managed to mess that up as well.</li>
            <li> wrong thing ,doesnt fit, returned</li>
            <li> I procrastinated replacing the Foil and Cutter because I think I can remember when I would pay only a little more to buy an entirely new electric razor (not a Braun) for only a little more.  However my Braun was making a lot of noise, not shaving well, and using up the charge on the razor extremely fast.  Finally I got the new foil.  I was a fool to wait so long!  The razor cuts 5 times better (just a guess, but much much better), is quieter, and now my razor stays charged much longer.  The old Foil and Cutter were definitely worn out.  I hope that in about a year and a half I&#x27;ll remember to not wait so long to get a replacement!</li>
            <li> You get at most 4 good months of shaving then you need to replace them again...pathetic. Braun should do better by its customers.</li>
            <li> One star is too much for this item! Both this second time from the same seller . First time last no longer than 1 month(start cracking and cutting my skin). I thought \\&quot;ok... it happens\\&quot;, so order a second time. I got exactly the same thing : less than one month start cracking and pulling the metal part. This is unexplainable! The first two primal blades holed 4-5 months! What the hell I have to pay 30$ for the s***ty product if it&#x27;s the same as paying for 6 blades from cvs.</li>
            <li> Fit me series 5 perfectly, generally these last me 1 year before replacing.</li>
            <li> IT HELPED ALOT.I WAS THINKING I WOULD HAVE TO GET A WHOLE NEW SHAVER.. SO NOW I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO SPEND THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> Want the Best this is it,  my father would use no other than this Braun, won&#x27;t be  disappointed,  highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is so unbelievable because it instantly eases any abrasive shaving. It also is affordable and was shipped to me quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> Works great and great price.</li>
            <li> Replacement for shaver, still like it.</li>
            <li> The Braun Series 5 replacement pack is much better than the previous replacement pack purchased 2 years ago. It cuts better and gives a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> Great cut at a decent price!</li>
            <li> Cutter is Perfect and I am using it in my razor; Foil did not fit and so I have to continue using the old one</li>
            <li> Great OE product.&lt;br /&gt;Fit perfectly and made shaving a joy again&lt;br /&gt;Recommend genuine Braun parts for your razor&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase this again</li>
            <li> The price was excellent</li>
            <li> All purchases met expectations.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  I have a heavy beard and that&#x27;s why I like a Braun Shaver.  But, performance of the new cutter and foil was just not up to the original.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly which I needed to bring shaver back to original performance. Pricing and  delivery was excellent, will definitely order again when needed.</li>
            <li> I just got another replacement blade and its so nice and sharp I love the way just shaved my face so quickly and easily in the morning its way better than using a blade and shaving cream and hot water etc etc and cheaper too</li>
            <li> Restored my Series 5 to like new condition.  These, combined with the cleaning packs has the shaver working like new.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed and perfect fit and price. The screen and cutter were an exact  OEM fit. Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t changed the cutter head assembly since 2009....my mistake!  I wondered why I wasn&#x27;t getting a good shave. After installing the 51s I am getting shaves just like a new razor.I read the reviews on the 51s and wasn&#x27;t pleased, however I note this assembly was made in Germany, not China. It&#x27;s really great!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these before, and they have always fit my razor like the original did. This shipment came in when it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> The Braun replacement foil and cutter head works very well. It was easy to install. Will reorder again in 18 months.</li>
            <li> the head and cutter work like they should and I would recommend this product to anybody who needs a replacement for their 8000 series braun.</li>
            <li> The screen guard metal is so fragile,  once it lasted 1 week, hoping to last more than a month.  Used to last 1 year.</li>
            <li> The worse replacement foil and cutter I have ever bought. Don&#x27;t buy BrAun Series 5 (they changed the style of the foil)</li>
            <li> Work as good as the one I bought as the local store.&lt;br /&gt;It fit my 8000 series and it very sharp.</li>
            <li> would have given 5 stars - only downfall is that the product is not properly cleaned after manufacture/testing? - some black residue is left on my face after a wet shave. But this easily washed off.</li>
            <li> I have the Braun Activator 8585.  I&#x27;ve had this electric razor for the better part of a decade now, but these blades keep it running just as good as the day that I bought it.  Perfect fit and no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I purchased an open-box item from Amazon Warehouse</li>
            <li> The improvement in shaving results only lasts a couple of weeks - then it&#x27;s about the same as 6 month old blades.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and low price.</li>
            <li> HOW CAN YOU REVIEW THIS? HAVE TO HAVE IT AND IT SHAVES ME</li>
            <li> Has given an mproved performance of my Braun razor</li>
            <li> Foil arrived broken.  Was able to use old foil with new cutter.  Too big of a hassle to return and wait for a new one.</li>
            <li> I wet shave with a double edge razor most days but use my Braun electric when I&#x27;m in a hurry.  The slow decline of my old foil and cutter had me convinced that it was time to through the Braun away.  I decided to try replacing the foil and cutter and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  My years old electric cuts like a *dream* again.  Also...my original order did not show up.  I used the customer service chat to let them know and Amazon took care of everything.  I&#x27;m pleased with the product and pleased with Amazon&#x27;s customer service.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with the replacement cutter and screen. I am also pleased that the price has been reduced.</li>
            <li> Replacing the foil and cutter on my 5 year old razor makes it feel like its brand new.  And the price was the lowest around.</li>
            <li> should have bought it sooner. Works great and great price as well</li>
            <li> This item is a direct replacement for my Series 5 shaver.  Actually it may be an improvement over the original foil.  The center strip seems to cut better than my original.</li>
            <li> Had the original foil for about two years. It had been pulling instead of cutting lately. This completely solved that problem.</li>
            <li> Brought my shaver back to being able to cut again!</li>
            <li> What can I say these are necessary replacements for the worn out parts. I need a good shave. Blah Blah</li>
            <li> Good product and good price.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how dull the old cutter was until it started pinching in spots and wouldn&#x27;t cut very close. New foil and cutter are definitely what I needed.</li>
            <li> Great price on this item that sells for $20 more in local stores.</li>
            <li> Awesome price, especially when you really need one once a month as I do as my facial hair is rated at the same streng as steal of the same diameter instead of copper had it tested after just destorying hundreds of disposables and a few electrics even this does not give the closet shave but when you face produces the equivlant to a steel scotch bright pad, you are not going to get perfect. So these are grade A for me.</li>
            <li> I bought the Braun series 5 with instant clean holder.  My Father has a habit of taking things apart that shouldn&#x27;t be taken apart.  I thought this would be the best product for him.  He has gone through 5 shavers in the last 3 years!!!  I know my Dad, so I did order extra foil replacement packs.  Unfortunately I have had to change the foil already!  But it easy for me to change the foil replacement for him!</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my razor.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a sharp clean blade again. Smooth shave!</li>
            <li> Great replacement pack!!!</li>
            <li> Worked fine. Just like the original. A bit pricey but works like new</li>
            <li> Rubbing a cheese grater over my face would be a preferable experience to what this cheaply engineered and manufactured replacement head puts me through every morning. This is a complete waste, as the rest of the razor is still excellent. After about ten years, the motor works as it did the day I bought it, the battery still holds a charge that easily takes me through a week, and the cleaning system continues to do a great job. But it seems Braun decided to outsource the manufacturing of their replacement heads for this older model to Larry, Moe, and Curly. If this is some sort of scheme to force people to replace an older electric razor with a newer one, well bravo! I&#x27;m shopping for a new razor today. I guarantee it will not be a Braun.</li>
            <li> New blades a new foil are great to have every year.</li>
            <li> foil broke after minimal use</li>
            <li> needed a new foil and cutter, i bought my 5 series in 2008 and it fit it well....this fit perfect, feels like it was right outta the box. now my base unit is dying so am gonna have to upgrade shortly.</li>
            <li> SMOOTH  CLEAN  ON MY FACE</li>
            <li> Great replacement my razor is over 10 years old</li>
            <li> Bought one in April to replace a foil that had worn out after two years of daily use. The replacement lasted only 2 months before the foil was again worn out. The manufacturer recommends replacing them at 18 month intervals, so I knew it should have lasted more than two months. So I ordered another one in July. It lasted about three months until the foil was worn out. At about 30 dollars per replacement, I just wasn&#x27;t going to try again. Which is a shame because my Braun razor has worked like a champ for close to ten years with no problems.</li>
            <li> Once you own an electric shaver as fine as the Braun Series 5, you owe it to yourself to keep it in top running condition by replacing the foils and cutters periodically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This replacement pack gives you the feel of a brand new razor--  just like the day you bought your Series 5--  so don&#x27;t delay!  If you&#x27;ve been using the same foils and cutters for a year or more, it&#x27;s time to make the change!</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement.  Much improved shave quality</li>
            <li> Nice, fast and just as it was described.</li>
            <li> It was a week late in arriving.  Amazon was good at overnighting it to me once I brought it to their attention.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I have had it less than a month, and one of the foils has already developed holes in it.</li>
            <li> my husband buys these off Amazon regularly...best price anywhere</li>
            <li> This was a more inexpensive part than the one made specifically for the Braun Activator Shaver and works perfectly--both cutter and screen.</li>
            <li> The Braun Series 5 Foil &amp; Cutter that I purchased worked well and the price was reasonable. I would purchase this product again. I strongly recommend it. Everyone else was so much more expensive and wanted to charge outrageous amount of money for shipping. It is a very simply and light product to ship. This product was authentic.</li>
            <li> I have a model 8985 Braun and it does not have a series 5 designation.  It looked like a match but I was not sure.  But it fits and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Exact replacement. at a good price. Restores function to like-new.</li>
            <li> It looks like a clone of the Series 5 foil/cutter block my shaver came with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried , based on the other negative reviews I read, but it&#x27;s fine for the Series 5.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery, product as adverised</li>
            <li> Worked just as well as the original for the 360 complete. I would buy more of these because this electric razor works the best</li>
            <li> When you finely put new blades in, it works great.&lt;br /&gt;The replacement blades seem to work better then when it was new.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> I wish it would last longer and seems to have a problem collecting whiskers as they end up on my shirt</li>
            <li> Got this a couple weeks ago. Shipped quickly and they fit perfectly ok my razor. Much better than the old one that started to break. Didn&#x27;t realize I should replace them every year. The old one lasted like 4 years.</li>
            <li> Upgraded foil pattern over the original that came with my Braun.  Made my older Braun feel and work like a brand new shaver.</li>
            <li> What can I say, this is the OEM replacement for my Braun razor. I replace each year and it feels as good as new! Recommended</li>
            <li> Although I do not love the razor that this product goes with the best, the Braun Series 5 provides a decent shave however it takes some pressure to get the shave to have a close look. The foil tends to collect debries easier then I would like. It is overall a decent entry level razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the razor anymore....</li>
            <li> These work with Braun shaver model 8585. I&#x27;ve had no problems and recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This replacement foil/cutter pack was really cheap compared to my local stores. Actually surprised they are still being made/sold because my shaver is pretty old. Maybe the parts fit several different models? In any case, work perfect and great price. Shaver feels like new again !</li>
            <li> Fit my Braun 8000 series perfect.  Cuts great too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the replacement foil and blade for the Braun Series 5 Combi 51s razor.  It works as it suppose to because it was from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Description says your supposed to replace the blad every 18 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blade didn&#x27;t even last 5 months before breaking and giving me a nice red scrape on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial foil and blade on my series 5 was fantastic and durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No such luck on this, and Im not aware of a good alternative....dont buy a Braun next time I guess.</li>
            <li> My Braun Razor now works like it did when it was new.  Shaves lilke a dream. There is nothing more to say.</li>
            <li> The online &amp;#34;Purchased With...&amp;#34; was incorrect. I needed the 52S</li>
            <li> Since I could not find this in the store, this was the perfect place to find my replacement cutters!&lt;br /&gt;I should have looked here first since the price was better.</li>
            <li> But, as I remember,  it doesn&#x27;t shave quite as closely as the original set that came with my Braun 360 complete. Or maybe beards get tougher with age.</li>
            <li> He has been using the same Electric razer for years.  He loves these blades.  It&#x27;s the only affordable ones that cuts closest to his skin.  He would recommend this!</li>
            <li> Received item as described.  OEM product that works perfectly as a replacement foil and cutter for my Braun 8985.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints at all.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I have been ordering these razor blades for several years now for my son.  Very good product and razor blades last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Braun 8000 series for a few years now, and I think it&#x27;s great quality, but just like other reviewers I&#x27;m not happy with the high prices for anything that the product needs to run properly. That is the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 .....</li>
            <li> This product fit my razor, even though I have an older model.  It is exactly what is stated on line.  I would recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> Correct unit, replaced in my 8000 series shaver with no problem and I fully expect that it will work fine.</li>
            <li> I put off this purchase thinking it was not necessary.  I was amazed at the  improvement that it made.  I will not wait as long again.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed!  The previous foil on the razor had a tear in it.  Glad Amazon had this, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> The Braun series cutter and foil work very well. I an perfectly satisfied with my purchase. I wil purchase other products.</li>
            <li> Excelent received as a described. Thanks</li>
