            <li>Works great for making buns.</li>
            <li>On a happy note, they do hold the hair in a bun fairly well.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to like them, but while they are good to start putting my hair up my hair won&#x27;t STAY up.</li>
            <li>Loved the idea of these, and saw them suggested on a very reputable fashion site.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, great product!</li>
            <li>I am sure though that they would be great for thicker hair.</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>They hold my hair better than any elastic tie or bobbie pin!</li>
            <li>I love these!  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to put my hair in a bun successfully</li>
            <li>Why doesn&#x27;t everyone use these, they are seriously magical!  </li>
            <li>Seriously magic!</li>
            <li>I love Spin Pins!  </li>
            <li>Best tool for easy and quick buns!</li>
            <li>These pins are amazing.</li>
            <li>I shed bobby pins like they are some kind of skin layer.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair, so one can hold all of it into a nice bun (which would take like 30 bobby pins or 2 elastics)</li>
            <li>where you want it, happily stuck to your super chic, non-bobby-pin-spewing head.</li>
            <li>They spin in and out of the hair very easily and don&#x27;t pull.  </li>
            <li>All-day hold with no adjusting throughout the day, and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>However, I did not find that they were good for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>It was so easy!  </li>
            <li>Just twist your hair into a bun, then corkscrew these into the but and it will hold all day, very comfortably.  </li>
            <li>I find them to be very comfortable to wear all day.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t pull at my scalp, don&#x27;t hurt, and they stay in place - and that&#x27;s huge!</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m glad i&#x27;ve got them</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to do updos.</li>
            <li>some miracle, these things twist in and catch all of most of my hair in the knot that I want, and make it stay in place.</li>
            <li>Anywhere I go, I am sure to leave bobby pins.</li>
            <li>Maybe I will get better at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am SO glad I decided to buy these babies.</li>
            <li>The only tips for use I can impart are: spin your bun and spin the pins clockwise for the best hold</li>
            <li>Idk why some people love these.</li>
            <li>Better than an elastic.</li>
            <li>Instead of using 15 bobby pins and still having my bun fall out, I use two of these and it feels so secure!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I figured out my mistake.  </li>
            <li>Held up most of my hair in a bun, but hair did not stay in tact as well as I&#x27;ve heard from the product.</li>
            <li>I probably just need some more practice.</li>
            <li>Still, way better than using all those bobby pins.</li>
            <li>I tried to use bun makers to shape my hair better</li>
            <li>at the most inopportune moments.</li>
            <li>Just hair, lovely hair,</li>
            <li>I have a love affair with them.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure it would hold.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of these pins.</li>
            <li>It needs more than just two spin pins to stay orderly.</li>
            <li>It is working for me much better than just bobby pins alone.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to wear a bun in my hair before now.</li>
            <li>So you can imagine the pile on top of my head when trying to create a bun.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you twist patiently when you take them out to avoid tangles.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure at first that they would be as good as they claim</li>
            <li>Not the most comfortable sleeping companions, I&#x27;ll admit, but you&#x27;re not looking for a pillow, here.</li>
            <li>These spin pins are super easy to use!  </li>
            <li>Best of all, you can&#x27;t even see the little buggers hiding in there, working their hair magic.</li>
            <li>These make it SO easy.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sturdy, stay in place, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>and I can put my hair up with these easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to put in and take out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So easy to use, and 1 or 2 will do what used to require a dozen bobby pins.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use, but it takes a bit to figure out how many you need and their placement for each style.</li>
            <li>but those are easy to just secure in place with bobby-pins.</li>
            <li>Love these things for putting my hair into a quick bun.</li>
            <li>an easy way to get a nice up do without too much hassle</li>
            <li>Even my slippery hair stays in place comfortably all day with these pins.</li>
            <li>I am a nurse so having my hair secured comfortably is important to me.</li>
            <li>but overall iâ€™m really happy with this product.</li>
            <li>With these I just have to wrap my hair around in a bun and secure it</li>
            <li>The mini ones are great for thinner hair or smaller buns and detail work.</li>
            <li>These, however, are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Quick, easy, and the bun stays in place.</li>
            <li>(I have accidentally done this, but truthfully it didn&#x27;t become a first world problem at all.</li>
            <li>Product arrived in a dinged up, smashed in original packaging.</li>
            <li>The Spin Pins are the most amazing thing I have discovered for keeping my hair pulled back and in control.</li>
            <li>The concept is great and if my hair was dry</li>
            <li>fun, easy to use and versatile</li>
            <li>:) In conjunction, for additional hold, I was also constantly buying the best top quality bobby pins at salon shops and they&#x27;d still end up being disposable all the time, eventually losing their tight grip and stretching.</li>
            <li>These are pretty comfortable &amp; are easy to put in your hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s true that they are a bit pricey, specially compared to bobby pins, but no, you cannot compare.</li>
            <li>I have really thick hair, and these work great!</li>
            <li>I am only able to use the special &amp;#34;thick hair&amp;#34; elastics; everything else is too lose or breaks and snaps too easily.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair and this works great.  </li>
            <li>For a secure hold, twist the first spin pin deep into your updo, catching the hair against your head</li>
            <li>After putting them in my hair for the gazillionth time, I again felt the urge to preach from the rooftops the unabashed joy I feel to have these little devices in my life...</li>
            <li>, they are totally worth it</li>
            <li>Wow i can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m reading threes reviews and people actually love these.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a simple design, it&#x27;s brilliant.  </li>
            <li>I would say they are worth trying.</li>
            <li>you just simply twist a pin on the top and another on the bottom of your bun and your hair is secure.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist was able to use 4 spin pins and 2 bobby pins to do my wedding up-do, which stayed secure the entire day and night without any problems.</li>
            <li>My hair fell right out.</li>
            <li>I have these in my hair right now.</li>
            <li>I was convinced either I was bun challenged or I was not blessed with the right</li>
            <li>I have long thick hair and had high hopes based on another review of twisting up my hair, letting it dry, and having perfect beautiful waves..</li>
            <li>I even put my hair up with these pins straight after blowdrying and I get nice, pretty waves after I take the pins out an hour or two later.</li>
            <li>They are so comfortable, hold all my hair easily, are so fast to and simple to use, and actually make my bun look better than when using hairbands.</li>
            <li>I doubt that I could go water-skiing or sky-diving and not lose a strand or two, but since that&#x27;s not what I do on a regular basis, I think I&#x27;m pretty safe.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for carrying these!</li>
            <li>I was very dissappointed!</li>
            <li>But tiring it up it a hair tie first helped a lot.</li>
            <li>spin those pins with a bit of fortitude making sure to catch the hair and pin against your scalp (not just through the hair itself) and for me, it made a big difference in the staying power all day and are not bothersome to me whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Try them -- even for just making a quick bun far easier and neater, they are worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I was able to make a messy bun very quickly.</li>
            <li>and I put my hair in a bun a lot for work so after reading some positive reviews I thought I would give them a shot.</li>
            <li>slightly pricey, but worth it to order from the original manufacturer vs. a cheap knockoff.</li>
            <li>Okay, I have really long hair.</li>
            <li>I have long hair that is pretty thick and still realized that the bun it makes is way better if I tease my hair a bit first, people with less hair may want to/have to do a fair amount of teasing to make a nice bun.</li>
            <li>Really easy to use after a short practice session.  </li>
            <li>and my waves weren&#x27;t as nice looking as just towel scrunching my hair and letting it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>Pinterest has some great ideas as well for different styles and things to try with these little Goody beauties.</li>
            <li>I really like having my hair up in a bun</li>
            <li>That wouldn&#x27;t be a real problem, but you can&#x27;t get 50 of these for two bucks like you</li>
            <li>in all, I highly recommend these if you wear your hair up a lot, or would like to if updos were easier!</li>
            <li>I recommend having damp hair or having some day-old product/dirty hair to get it to really hold.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder length straight layered hair</li>
            <li>I have just past the shoulder length fine, easily tangled straight hair and like to have my hair up at times.</li>
            <li>The color of the pins doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>I would have saved so much time and money, bobby pins will just not cut it after using these.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something easy to conceal, easy to use, delicate on the hair, with holding power, this is for you.</li>
            <li>I bought these after reading the reviews, and they work better than expected!</li>
            <li>If you are an athlete or a busy mom or someone who simply wants your freaking hair to stay where you put it in the first place, PLEASE do yourself a favor and buy these things.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that they come in different colors, so you barely can&#x27;t see them in your hair.</li>
            <li>and they are very easy to use, just a few twists in and out</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how well these would work in fine thin hair, they might be slippery, but I really can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and a great way to put up your hair for work when you&#x27;re having a bad hair day</li>
            <li>Just got my first set of spin pins and am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve gotten older</li>
            <li>first quick tries with</li>
            <li>the spin-pin were just ok and the bun didn&#x27;t seem that tight or hold like I thought it would.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving these a &#x27;whirl&#x27;.</li>
            <li>My new go-to hair accessory...</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without these pins.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>/&gt;i actually already owned a set, but decided to buy another to try out some other hair style ideas :)</li>
            <li>I have very thick long hair, Bobbie pins fly out and can&#x27;t hold it.</li>
            <li>These are really strong and good quality, but unfortunately, if you have really smooth hair, it can slip right out of them, especially if your hair isn&#x27;t long enough to twist around a few times when making a bun.</li>
            <li>Love these, but wish they were a little bigger.</li>
            <li>I have thick, heavy hair and these do a great job of securing a bun in place.</li>
            <li>It will give you a much tighter hold and guarantee that you won&#x27;t have to fix it or tighten it later.</li>
            <li>I tried it once for my straight Asian hair and it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>These actually work really well.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>They hold very well, my only gripe is that my bun is a bit looser than iâ€™d like</li>
            <li>Even in my extremely sensitive, curly hair...</li>
            <li>For most of my life, there was not a day that I didn&#x27;t need to redo my hair at least three or four times.</li>
            <li>Just take a complete stranger&#x27;s two cents.</li>
            <li>and I think the layers just don&#x27;t quite &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; well enough to fully stay in - even with the addition of adding a couple more bobby pins to tame flyaways and reinforce the bun.</li>
            <li>These would probably work really well for people with long, curly hair.</li>
            <li>Normally I need like 15-20 bobby pins for a simple bun.</li>
            <li>When I undid my hair after 12 hours, it was still pretty wet</li>
            <li>(it only takes a few seconds) and you&#x27;re pin free.</li>
            <li>I have extremely thick hair and an abundance of it, and i am constantly piling my hair on top of my head and securing it with an elastic.</li>
            <li>Twist my hair, tuck the end under, screw one spiral pin down from the top and the other up from the bottom, and viola!</li>
            <li>My hair is super thick and pretty long.</li>
            <li>I have extremely thick hair that defeats bobby pins and every other kind of clip imaginable.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves these as well and doesnâ€™t complain about these like she does with regular old hair ties</li>
            <li>If I kind of carelessly put them in, my hair might droop a bit from the bun</li>
            <li>My hair is thin and super straight</li>
            <li>I have long straight hair, and I use these almost daily- especially in the summer to keep my hair off my neck!  </li>
            <li>I was definitely on the fence before buying these because I have tried (as I&#x27;m sure so many of us have) a lot of different hair clips that are uncomfortable and/or not effective.</li>
            <li>Got completely tangled in my long wavy hair, I had to have my husband disentangle me.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much a waste of money</li>
            <li>A high bun, high braided bun, low buns, to assist french twists, to pin up braids into messy buns...</li>
            <li>I think they could certainly hold a bun for people with normal hair (maybe not waist-long thick hair like me).  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t mean you are stuck with it up for the rest of the day, as most other techniques end up doing.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re less likely to lose these, like bobby pins, too haha</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>They stay in, but they&#x27;re kind of hard to twist into thick hair.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am SO glad I decided to buy these babies.</li>
            <li> The only tips for use I can impart are: spin your bun and spin the pins clockwise for the best hold</li>
            <li> Idk why some people love these.</li>
            <li> Better than an elastic.</li>
            <li> Instead of using 15 bobby pins and still having my bun fall out, I use two of these and it feels so secure!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I figured out my mistake.  </li>
            <li> Held up most of my hair in a bun, but hair did not stay in tact as well as I&#x27;ve heard from the product.</li>
            <li> I probably just need some more practice.</li>
            <li> Still, way better than using all those bobby pins.</li>
            <li> I tried to use bun makers to shape my hair better</li>
            <li> at the most inopportune moments.</li>
            <li> Just hair, lovely hair,</li>
            <li> I have a love affair with them.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure it would hold.  </li>
            <li> I love the idea of these pins.</li>
            <li> It needs more than just two spin pins to stay orderly.</li>
            <li> It is working for me much better than just bobby pins alone.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to wear a bun in my hair before now.</li>
            <li> So you can imagine the pile on top of my head when trying to create a bun.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you twist patiently when you take them out to avoid tangles.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first that they would be as good as they claim</li>
            <li> Not the most comfortable sleeping companions, I&#x27;ll admit, but you&#x27;re not looking for a pillow, here.</li>
            <li> These spin pins are super easy to use!  </li>
            <li> Best of all, you can&#x27;t even see the little buggers hiding in there, working their hair magic.</li>
            <li> These make it SO easy.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sturdy, stay in place, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> and I can put my hair up with these easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to put in and take out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So easy to use, and 1 or 2 will do what used to require a dozen bobby pins.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, but it takes a bit to figure out how many you need and their placement for each style.</li>
            <li> but those are easy to just secure in place with bobby-pins.</li>
            <li> Love these things for putting my hair into a quick bun.</li>
            <li> an easy way to get a nice up do without too much hassle</li>
            <li> Even my slippery hair stays in place comfortably all day with these pins.</li>
            <li> I am a nurse so having my hair secured comfortably is important to me.</li>
            <li> but overall iâ€™m really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> With these I just have to wrap my hair around in a bun and secure it</li>
            <li> The mini ones are great for thinner hair or smaller buns and detail work.</li>
            <li> These, however, are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Quick, easy, and the bun stays in place.</li>
            <li> (I have accidentally done this, but truthfully it didn&#x27;t become a first world problem at all.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a dinged up, smashed in original packaging.</li>
            <li> The Spin Pins are the most amazing thing I have discovered for keeping my hair pulled back and in control.</li>
            <li> The concept is great and if my hair was dry</li>
            <li> fun, easy to use and versatile</li>
            <li> :) In conjunction, for additional hold, I was also constantly buying the best top quality bobby pins at salon shops and they&#x27;d still end up being disposable all the time, eventually losing their tight grip and stretching.</li>
            <li> These are pretty comfortable &amp; are easy to put in your hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s true that they are a bit pricey, specially compared to bobby pins, but no, you cannot compare.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair, and these work great!</li>
            <li> I am only able to use the special &amp;#34;thick hair&amp;#34; elastics; everything else is too lose or breaks and snaps too easily.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair and this works great.  </li>
            <li> For a secure hold, twist the first spin pin deep into your updo, catching the hair against your head</li>
            <li> After putting them in my hair for the gazillionth time, I again felt the urge to preach from the rooftops the unabashed joy I feel to have these little devices in my life...</li>
            <li> , they are totally worth it</li>
            <li> Wow i can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m reading threes reviews and people actually love these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a simple design, it&#x27;s brilliant.  </li>
            <li> I would say they are worth trying.</li>
            <li> you just simply twist a pin on the top and another on the bottom of your bun and your hair is secure.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist was able to use 4 spin pins and 2 bobby pins to do my wedding up-do, which stayed secure the entire day and night without any problems.</li>
            <li> My hair fell right out.</li>
            <li> I have these in my hair right now.</li>
            <li> I was convinced either I was bun challenged or I was not blessed with the right</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and had high hopes based on another review of twisting up my hair, letting it dry, and having perfect beautiful waves..</li>
            <li> I even put my hair up with these pins straight after blowdrying and I get nice, pretty waves after I take the pins out an hour or two later.</li>
            <li> They are so comfortable, hold all my hair easily, are so fast to and simple to use, and actually make my bun look better than when using hairbands.</li>
            <li> I doubt that I could go water-skiing or sky-diving and not lose a strand or two, but since that&#x27;s not what I do on a regular basis, I think I&#x27;m pretty safe.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for carrying these!</li>
            <li> I was very dissappointed!</li>
            <li> But tiring it up it a hair tie first helped a lot.</li>
            <li> spin those pins with a bit of fortitude making sure to catch the hair and pin against your scalp (not just through the hair itself) and for me, it made a big difference in the staying power all day and are not bothersome to me whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Try them -- even for just making a quick bun far easier and neater, they are worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I was able to make a messy bun very quickly.</li>
            <li> and I put my hair in a bun a lot for work so after reading some positive reviews I thought I would give them a shot.</li>
            <li> slightly pricey, but worth it to order from the original manufacturer vs. a cheap knockoff.</li>
            <li> Okay, I have really long hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is pretty thick and still realized that the bun it makes is way better if I tease my hair a bit first, people with less hair may want to/have to do a fair amount of teasing to make a nice bun.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use after a short practice session.  </li>
            <li> and my waves weren&#x27;t as nice looking as just towel scrunching my hair and letting it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> Pinterest has some great ideas as well for different styles and things to try with these little Goody beauties.</li>
            <li> I really like having my hair up in a bun</li>
            <li> That wouldn&#x27;t be a real problem, but you can&#x27;t get 50 of these for two bucks like you</li>
            <li> in all, I highly recommend these if you wear your hair up a lot, or would like to if updos were easier!</li>
            <li> I recommend having damp hair or having some day-old product/dirty hair to get it to really hold.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length straight layered hair</li>
            <li> I have just past the shoulder length fine, easily tangled straight hair and like to have my hair up at times.</li>
            <li> The color of the pins doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> I would have saved so much time and money, bobby pins will just not cut it after using these.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something easy to conceal, easy to use, delicate on the hair, with holding power, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I bought these after reading the reviews, and they work better than expected!</li>
            <li> If you are an athlete or a busy mom or someone who simply wants your freaking hair to stay where you put it in the first place, PLEASE do yourself a favor and buy these things.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that they come in different colors, so you barely can&#x27;t see them in your hair.</li>
            <li> and they are very easy to use, just a few twists in and out</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well these would work in fine thin hair, they might be slippery, but I really can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and a great way to put up your hair for work when you&#x27;re having a bad hair day</li>
            <li> Just got my first set of spin pins and am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve gotten older</li>
            <li> first quick tries with</li>
            <li> the spin-pin were just ok and the bun didn&#x27;t seem that tight or hold like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving these a &#x27;whirl&#x27;.</li>
            <li> My new go-to hair accessory...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without these pins.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> /&gt;i actually already owned a set, but decided to buy another to try out some other hair style ideas :)</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair, Bobbie pins fly out and can&#x27;t hold it.</li>
            <li> These are really strong and good quality, but unfortunately, if you have really smooth hair, it can slip right out of them, especially if your hair isn&#x27;t long enough to twist around a few times when making a bun.</li>
            <li> Love these, but wish they were a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I have thick, heavy hair and these do a great job of securing a bun in place.</li>
            <li> It will give you a much tighter hold and guarantee that you won&#x27;t have to fix it or tighten it later.</li>
            <li> I tried it once for my straight Asian hair and it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> These actually work really well.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> They hold very well, my only gripe is that my bun is a bit looser than iâ€™d like</li>
            <li> Even in my extremely sensitive, curly hair...</li>
            <li> For most of my life, there was not a day that I didn&#x27;t need to redo my hair at least three or four times.</li>
            <li> Just take a complete stranger&#x27;s two cents.</li>
            <li> and I think the layers just don&#x27;t quite &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; well enough to fully stay in - even with the addition of adding a couple more bobby pins to tame flyaways and reinforce the bun.</li>
            <li> These would probably work really well for people with long, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Normally I need like 15-20 bobby pins for a simple bun.</li>
            <li> When I undid my hair after 12 hours, it was still pretty wet</li>
            <li> (it only takes a few seconds) and you&#x27;re pin free.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair and an abundance of it, and i am constantly piling my hair on top of my head and securing it with an elastic.</li>
            <li> Twist my hair, tuck the end under, screw one spiral pin down from the top and the other up from the bottom, and viola!</li>
            <li> My hair is super thick and pretty long.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair that defeats bobby pins and every other kind of clip imaginable.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these as well and doesnâ€™t complain about these like she does with regular old hair ties</li>
            <li> If I kind of carelessly put them in, my hair might droop a bit from the bun</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and super straight</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair, and I use these almost daily- especially in the summer to keep my hair off my neck!  </li>
            <li> I was definitely on the fence before buying these because I have tried (as I&#x27;m sure so many of us have) a lot of different hair clips that are uncomfortable and/or not effective.</li>
            <li> Got completely tangled in my long wavy hair, I had to have my husband disentangle me.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much a waste of money</li>
            <li> A high bun, high braided bun, low buns, to assist french twists, to pin up braids into messy buns...</li>
            <li> I think they could certainly hold a bun for people with normal hair (maybe not waist-long thick hair like me).  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean you are stuck with it up for the rest of the day, as most other techniques end up doing.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re less likely to lose these, like bobby pins, too haha</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> They stay in, but they&#x27;re kind of hard to twist into thick hair.</li>
            <li> A tip if you&#x27;re going to be in the water: wet your hair completely first and then twist and insert the Spin Pins rather than doing this step dry and then getting your hair wet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those who have had a problem with the spin pins keeping your &#x27;do&#x27; in it&#x27;s original position, the last simple helpful hint below might be a game changer for some hair types.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thick hair and thought that these may not be enough to hold my hair, but they do the job pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I needed three spin pins and some bobby pins to keep my hair in a bun, and the bun didn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> (the only downside is that they only come in twos), and for a lot of styles two are sufficient to hold my hair tight without movement, but occasionally I use a third.</li>
            <li> These little gadgets look like they should belong in the old man&#x27;s toolbox, like some spring coil for an engine.</li>
            <li> I have seven of them in various sizes, and hopefully I can pretend they are made of diamond and be really careful not to lose them, because they aren&#x27;t super-cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long medium-thick hair</li>
            <li> long.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s also reasonably long.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, straight hair.</li>
            <li> fast forward a few hours when Iâ€™ve gotten a headache and want to let my hair down, Iâ€™ve got hairpin headache and a crease in my hair.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have experience with any other brands, but from the reviews I&#x27;ve read of knock-off spin pins, Goody is the only way to go.</li>
            <li> I know I sound overly dramatic, but these little miracles have been LIFE-CHANGING.</li>
            <li> I was  a bit confused at first</li>
            <li> I set it once and forget it; there&#x27;s no fussing or anything coming loose.</li>
            <li> but then when I started walkng around, they would become loose and eventually my hair would just fall.</li>
            <li> I have not had them work themselves loose yet either.</li>
            <li> Total let down.</li>
            <li> They are a little expensive for just 2 pins, but I don&#x27;t see how you would need anymore than 2 packs, I&#x27;m getting a long with one pack just fine.</li>
            <li> Goes half way to my back.</li>
            <li> I fought hair ties endlessly when I wanted to do something active which required constant readjusting, retightening, etc.  </li>
            <li> Found these for basically $5 and picked up a new set; seriously, if you like wearing buns, these are a must-have.</li>
            <li> I wanted so bad to love these things</li>
            <li> Have I mentioned also spraying my &#x27;do&#x27; with gorilla extra firm super-duper hair spray for hold?</li>
            <li> /&gt;The gal who was in the dark entirely to long and is still sulking about it.</li>
            <li> If you use two you have to be careful not to lock them together.</li>
            <li> Now, when most people say they have thick hair, they mean they have thick hair.</li>
            <li> and I was getting very frustrated, but I heard that these were good</li>
            <li> I held out on getting these when they first came out because they were expensive.</li>
            <li> Then I lost my first set and held out again in replacing them because they are expensive.</li>
            <li> I split my hair in half and wore one in each half of my hair and wore them for 12+ hours after my shower to let my hair dry.  </li>
            <li> To give you a sense of how thick, it takes anywhere from 3-6 hours to air dry depending on how long it is.</li>
            <li> Very little of it is visible once it&#x27;s in, especially if you do a messy bun.</li>
            <li> These completely changed my hair game.</li>
            <li> I have thinner hair and a lot of other hair clips will not work to keep my hair secured tightly.</li>
            <li> I have insanely thick hair that goes half-way down my back.</li>
            <li> Rubber bands slip down my head or break on me</li>
            <li> When I say it, I mean that my hair breaks hairbrushes on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser told me about these several years ago, and I find that they even work on my slick hair!  </li>
            <li> I think they do less damage to the hair than a rubberband hair tie.</li>
            <li> Takes less than a minute.</li>
            <li> I think these should also be less damaging to the hair than elastics.</li>
            <li> I typically use three for my buns.</li>
            <li> Very little slipping with Spin Pins.</li>
            <li> Disappointed a bit, but they serve the purpose advertised.. will just expect them to hold a bun in place moving forward, not offer me fabulous waves.</li>
            <li> I have medium- long moderatly thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> have long, thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> They hold my thick and long hair all day.</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t have a lot of faith in these little doodads, which look like they might have come out of my stepdad&#x27;s toolbox by mistake.</li>
            <li> These little doohickeys are miracle workers.</li>
            <li> It can be very hard to get it all up into a ponytail or especially a bun, and then they slip all day.</li>
            <li> - my hair is coarse and curly/wavy, and very thick.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and big volumed hair, the pins hold up quite well.</li>
            <li> but they were a waste if my $7.00.</li>
            <li> tangles), or without the last wind-up of the elastic, my buns would droop and there&#x27;s nothing worse than drooping buns.</li>
            <li> I am having a bit of a hard time getting them to work in my long thick hair.</li>
            <li> down--- NO DAMAGE!!  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick, a little curly, and below my bra line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m the problem</li>
            <li> NO MORE 10 bobby pins trying to hold my hair up in a bun.</li>
            <li> and you can usually still see the clips.</li>
            <li> and usually I can&#x27;t keep it up for anything</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly thick and goes past my waist, so I always have trouble tying it up.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that only 2 of these funny-looking bobby pins would hold my hair up, but they do!</li>
            <li> I was doubtful because I have super thick, slippery hair.</li>
            <li> I either had to wind my ponytail holder so tight, it was tough to remove at days end (</li>
            <li> They are hard for me to twist out.</li>
            <li> It is hard to believe these twisty things work so well.</li>
            <li> Que the spin pin, these little metal squiggles are a game changer.</li>
            <li> For me, they may not \\&quot;do the work of 20 bobby pins,\\&quot; but they fill in for at least 10 of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My back and side bun attempts have always been somewhat disastrous, whether trying to attempt a structured or messy bun.</li>
            <li> At least it did for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I like wearing my hair in a bun, but my hair is thick and wavy and doesn&#x27;t hold well with just an elastic.</li>
            <li> works well for thick hair.</li>

            <li> So easy to use and a great way to put up your hair for work when you&#x27;re having a bad hair day or you just ran out of time to do your hair. I work with kids and the spin pins can hold up my bun all day (works great with my medium length hair).</li>
            <li> I love these! I have think hair so these work well!</li>
            <li> These pins are the best, I use them almost every day.&lt;br /&gt;Only one it&#x27;s enough for me for an every day bun and they are very easy to use, just a few twists in and out and you are done.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been struggling a lot with my hair when going to the gym or running with buns and pony tails and these pins made my day, even without using a hair band.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s true that they are a bit pricey, specially compared to bobby pins, but no, you cannot compare. I wasn&#x27;t sure at first that they would be as good as they claim but i&#x27;m glad i&#x27;ve got them, they are totally worth it</li>
            <li> This is absolutely useless. One will do nothing, it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair, and still with two it&#x27;s lose. This is not for people with a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> Love these things for putting my hair into a quick bun. I think they do less damage to the hair than a rubberband hair tie.</li>
            <li> They hold my hair better than any elastic tie or bobbie pin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for about 3 years now. I have extremely thick, straight hair. At its longest, it was at my rear and at its shortest, it was about mid-back. I am only able to use the special &amp;#34;thick hair&amp;#34; elastics; everything else is too lose or breaks and snaps too easily. To give you a sense of how thick, it takes anywhere from 3-6 hours to air dry depending on how long it is. I fought hair ties endlessly when I wanted to do something active which required constant readjusting, retightening, etc.  The Spin Pins are the most amazing thing I have discovered for keeping my hair pulled back and in control. I set it once and forget it; there&#x27;s no fussing or anything coming loose. I&#x27;ve tested these on land while hiking and running, in pools, and in the middle of oceans with pummeling waves and currents. I have scuba dived multiple times with these and have never had to fuss with them, even when I was doing my certification which required me to constantly enter and exit the dive boat with a big splash or removing and replacing my mask.  I find it works best for me when I insert them at the 3 and 9 o&#x27;clock positions. A tip if you&#x27;re going to be in the water: wet your hair completely first and then twist and insert the Spin Pins rather than doing this step dry and then getting your hair wet. It will give you a much tighter hold and guarantee that you won&#x27;t have to fix it or tighten it later.</li>
            <li> Love these. I was doubtful because I have super thick, slippery hair. I&#x27;ve never been able to do updos. These make it SO easy. They actually work. Wish I would have gotten them sooner. They are a little expensive for just 2 pins, but I don&#x27;t see how you would need anymore than 2 packs, I&#x27;m getting a long with one pack just fine. They&#x27;re sturdy, stay in place, and easy to use. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> It hurts and tangles my hair. I tried it once for my straight Asian hair and it didn&#x27;t work so I never wore it again.</li>
            <li> Okay, I have really long hair. My go to styles when I was younger included ponytails, braids, stuff like that. Now that I&#x27;ve gotten older I really like having my hair up in a bun so it doesn&#x27;t get in my way. I can&#x27;t use regular hair pins. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m the problem or if my hair is so slippery but it&#x27;s impossible to keep regular hair pins in my hair. These Spin Pins work. I use two and only two. My hair stays up if I have the pins arranged just so. If I kind of carelessly put them in, my hair might droop a bit from the bun but the pins still stay in so there&#x27;s no worries you&#x27;ll lose them if you&#x27;re walking.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair, and these work great! Now, when most people say they have thick hair, they mean they have thick hair. When I say it, I mean that my hair breaks hairbrushes on a regular basis. So I didn&#x27;t have a lot of faith in these little doodads, which look like they might have come out of my stepdad&#x27;s toolbox by mistake. I stand corrected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By some miracle, these things twist in and catch all of most of my hair in the knot that I want, and make it stay in place. If not, I try a second time and I get it. I doubt that I could go water-skiing or sky-diving and not lose a strand or two, but since that&#x27;s not what I do on a regular basis, I think I&#x27;m pretty safe. What can I say - they work! For me, they may not \\&quot;do the work of 20 bobby pins,\\&quot; but they fill in for at least 10 of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides I see are the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I shed bobby pins like they are some kind of skin layer. Anywhere I go, I am sure to leave bobby pins. I am afraid that I&#x27;m going to lose these. They are probably already lost. In fact, I should go check on them. That wouldn&#x27;t be a real problem, but you can&#x27;t get 50 of these for two bucks like you can with bobby pins. I have seven of them in various sizes, and hopefully I can pretend they are made of diamond and be really careful not to lose them, because they aren&#x27;t super-cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) They are hard for me to twist out. Yes, I know - righty-tighty, lefty-loosey. Somehow, in my hair, it just doesn&#x27;t feel like left is the \\&quot;right\\&quot; way to turn the pin to get it out. Maybe I will get better at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I highly recommend these if you wear your hair up a lot, or would like to if updos were easier!</li>
            <li> I love these!  I wish I had had them for the last 10 years!</li>
            <li> I was definitely on the fence before buying these because I have tried (as I&#x27;m sure so many of us have) a lot of different hair clips that are uncomfortable and/or not effective. I have long medium-thick hair and I put my hair in a bun a lot for work so after reading some positive reviews I thought I would give them a shot. I am SO glad I decided to buy these babies. They are so comfortable, hold all my hair easily, are so fast to and simple to use, and actually make my bun look better than when using hairbands. I also like that you can&#x27;t see the pins at all when they are in your hair. The only tips for use I can impart are: spin your bun and spin the pins clockwise for the best hold and when you want to take them out just unpsin the pins counterclockwise (it only takes a few seconds) and you&#x27;re pin free. Thanks Amazon for carrying these!</li>
            <li> Wow! My sister (who is a hair dresser) introduced me to these and it changed my life. NO MORE 10 bobby pins trying to hold my hair up in a bun. I just screw a couple of these puppies in and BOOM.. bun held solid.</li>
            <li> If I could give this zero stars I would! Wow i can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m reading threes reviews and people actually love these. My hair is super thick and pretty long. Goes half way to my back. These did not work at all!!!! My hair fell right out. I even tried putting it in a ponytail to just to see if that would work. Nope! I wanted so bad to love these things but they were a waste if my $7.00. I will be returning them. They did nothing at all!!! Not to mention they pulled my hair out when I got them out. Idk why some people love these. Maybe they work on their hair but def didn&#x27;t work on mine. Total let down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Spin Pins for years and they WORK.  My hairdresser told me about these several years ago, and I find that they even work on my slick hair!  I have long straight hair, and I use these almost daily- especially in the summer to keep my hair off my neck!  I recommend having damp hair or having some day-old product/dirty hair to get it to really hold.  Just twist your hair into a bun, then corkscrew these into the but and it will hold all day, very comfortably.  Better than an elastic.</li>
            <li> Loved the idea of these, and saw them suggested on a very reputable fashion site. Maybe it&#x27;s me, but I&#x27;ve tried to use these several times, and they literally just fall out of my hair. I have medium- long moderatly thick hair. I was very dissappointed!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like them, but while they are good to start putting my hair up my hair won&#x27;t STAY up. I have shoulder length straight layered hair and I think the layers just don&#x27;t quite &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; well enough to fully stay in - even with the addition of adding a couple more bobby pins to tame flyaways and reinforce the bun.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to put my hair in a bun successfully and I was getting very frustrated, but I heard that these were good, so I thought I&#x27;d give them a try...&lt;br /&gt;LIFE CHANGING!  It was so easy!  Why doesn&#x27;t everyone use these, they are seriously magical!  Instead of using 15 bobby pins and still having my bun fall out, I use two of these and it feels so secure!  My friend only has to use one! Seriously magic! Buy them!</li>
            <li> These actually work really well.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It&#x27;s such a simple design, it&#x27;s brilliant.  Even my slippery hair stays in place comfortably all day with these pins.</li>
            <li> These spin pins are the best hair gadgets ever invented! I have fine, thin hair and I can put my hair up with these easily. They don&#x27;t pull at my scalp, don&#x27;t hurt, and they stay in place - and that&#x27;s huge!</li>
            <li> I have these in my hair right now. I am here to buy another set. I have had the ones I am currently using for over a year. I am a nurse so having my hair secured comfortably is important to me. My hair is thick, a little curly, and below my bra line. All I do is twist my hair into a low bun and then twist these in. Takes less than a minute. To remove I simply twist them back out. I find them to be very comfortable to wear all day. The ends of the coils have a rubber tip (like bobby pins) and have never scratched my head. I twist them together to store them so I don&#x27;t lose one. I don&#x27;t know how well these would work in fine thin hair, they might be slippery, but I really can&#x27;t say for sure. I would say they are worth trying.</li>
            <li> These pins are great.  I have a lot of thick hair and thought that these may not be enough to hold my hair, but they do the job pretty well.  And the do stays in place without a problem.  Since my hair is in layers, I get some lose strands in the bun... but those are easy to just secure in place with bobby-pins.</li>
            <li> I held out on getting these when they first came out because they were expensive. But finally got some and they are awesome. Then I lost my first set and held out again in replacing them because they are expensive. Found these for basically $5 and picked up a new set; seriously, if you like wearing buns, these are a must-have.</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair, Bobbie pins fly out and can&#x27;t hold it. These work great. I have used them twice and they have held my hair up all day.</li>
            <li> Best tool for easy and quick buns!</li>
            <li> I use these all the time to tie up my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Its an easy way to get a nice up do without too much hassle</li>
            <li> These spin pins are super easy to use!  These are pretty comfortable &amp; are easy to put in your hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair and this works great.  You simply screw it into place, and then unscrew it the opposite direction to take it out.  I was  a bit confused at first when I thought I could just pull it out.  I&#x27;m so glad that I figured out my mistake.  I would have tossed it in the trash otherwise (that is after I untangled my hair).  If you are looking for something easy to conceal, easy to use, delicate on the hair, with holding power, this is for you.</li>
            <li> Got completely tangled in my long wavy hair, I had to have my husband disentangle me.  Didn&#x27;t even hold my updo meanwhile!  Pretty much a waste of money</li>
            <li> Held up most of my hair in a bun, but hair did not stay in tact as well as I&#x27;ve heard from the product. But tiring it up it a hair tie first helped a lot.</li>
            <li> Sadly, my hair is too thin for these and you can usually still see the clips. They work fantastically, though. My hair is thin and super straight and usually I can&#x27;t keep it up for anything but I haven&#x27;t had a problem with these, and I wear them around the house almost every day.</li>
            <li> I am having a bit of a hard time getting them to work in my long thick hair. I probably just need some more practice. But it could also be because of my layers. They hold well enough to keep trying though.</li>
            <li> These are great for me! My hair is fairly thick and goes past my waist, so I always have trouble tying it up. Normally I need like 15-20 bobby pins for a simple bun. I actually ordered two packs of these (the only downside is that they only come in twos), and for a lot of styles two are sufficient to hold my hair tight without movement, but occasionally I use a third. Still, way better than using all those bobby pins. Easy to put in and take out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have experience with any other brands, but from the reviews I&#x27;ve read of knock-off spin pins, Goody is the only way to go. The metal part doesn&#x27;t catch at all, and the pins do the job well.</li>
            <li> Just got my first set of spin pins and am pleasantly surprised. I have extremely thick hair and an abundance of it, and i am constantly piling my hair on top of my head and securing it with an elastic. fast forward a few hours when Iâ€™ve gotten a headache and want to let my hair down, Iâ€™ve got hairpin headache and a crease in my hair. ugh. Que the spin pin, these little metal squiggles are a game changer. you just simply twist a pin on the top and another on the bottom of your bun and your hair is secure. They hold very well, my only gripe is that my bun is a bit looser than iâ€™d like but overall iâ€™m really happy with this product. My daughter loves these as well and doesnâ€™t complain about these like she does with regular old hair ties</li>
            <li> These are easier to use than bobby pins, but more difficult to remove from the hair.  It is hard to believe these twisty things work so well.</li>
            <li> These little gadgets look like they should belong in the old man&#x27;s toolbox, like some spring coil for an engine. They&#x27;re in my hair tool kit now. I have just past the shoulder length fine, easily tangled straight hair and like to have my hair up at times. My back and side bun attempts have always been somewhat disastrous, whether trying to attempt a structured or messy bun. I either had to wind my ponytail holder so tight, it was tough to remove at days end (tangles), or without the last wind-up of the elastic, my buns would droop and there&#x27;s nothing worse than drooping buns. :) In conjunction, for additional hold, I was also constantly buying the best top quality bobby pins at salon shops and they&#x27;d still end up being disposable all the time, eventually losing their tight grip and stretching. Have I mentioned also spraying my &#x27;do&#x27; with gorilla extra firm super-duper hair spray for hold? I was convinced either I was bun challenged or I was not blessed with the right hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first quick tries with the spin-pin were just ok and the bun didn&#x27;t seem that tight or hold like I thought it would. My hair volume and length only needs 2 standard size pins. Then I had a revelation and read the helpful hints on the packaging. Go figure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have had a problem with the spin pins keeping your &#x27;do&#x27; in it&#x27;s original position, the last simple helpful hint below might be a game changer for some hair types. At least it did for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Do not interlock spin pins. (I have accidentally done this, but truthfully it didn&#x27;t become a first world problem at all. They were removed just fine)&lt;br /&gt;* No ponytail holder necessary. (This is true)&lt;br /&gt;* Spin clockwise into your style.&lt;br /&gt;* Spin counter clockwise to release from style&lt;br /&gt;* For a secure hold, twist the first spin pin deep into your updo, catching the hair against your head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just spin those pins with a bit of fortitude making sure to catch the hair and pin against your scalp (not just through the hair itself) and for me, it made a big difference in the staying power all day and are not bothersome to me whatsoever. Pinterest has some great ideas as well for different styles and things to try with these little Goody beauties. I carry a set of 2 in my purse and have another set at all times in my makeup bag. I highly recommend giving these a &#x27;whirl&#x27;.</li>
            <li> These completely changed my hair game. Try them -- even for just making a quick bun far easier and neater, they are worth the money.</li>
            <li> These are great for putting your hair up in a formal style or just up in a &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; bun. I have thinner hair and a lot of other hair clips will not work to keep my hair secured tightly. With these I just have to wrap my hair around in a bun and secure it and it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li> These pins are amazing. I like wearing my hair in a bun, but my hair is thick and wavy and doesn&#x27;t hold well with just an elastic. I tried to use bun makers to shape my hair better but I was sick of the endless bobby pins I had to keep sticking in there to hold it.    I bought these after reading the reviews, and they work better than expected! These two spirals do the work of twenty bobby pins. Don&#x27;t know how I managed to leave the house before I had these.</li>
            <li> These are great - my hair is coarse and curly/wavy, and very thick. It can be very hard to get it all up into a ponytail or especially a bun, and then they slip all day. Very little slipping with Spin Pins. And they allow for styles that simple elastics don&#x27;t. Wish they were a bit cheaper, I&#x27;d get a dozen.</li>
            <li> I love Spin Pins!  My new go-to hair accessory... I have curly hair, so one can hold all of it into a nice bun (which would take like 30 bobby pins or 2 elastics) It is not the easiest thing to keep in a pocket, but it isn&#x27;t too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing is, when you take your hair down--- NO DAMAGE!!  And no indentations! Even in my extremely sensitive, curly hair... Which means putting it up doesn&#x27;t mean you are stuck with it up for the rest of the day, as most other techniques end up doing.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair. For most of my life, there was not a day that I didn&#x27;t need to redo my hair at least three or four times. My hair will spew forth bobby pins like an uncapped blender. Rubber bands slip down my head or break on me (guhhh!!!) at the most inopportune moments. *Nothing* could support the weight of my mop. I know I sound overly dramatic, but these little miracles have been LIFE-CHANGING. I use five or six at a time, but let me tell you, my hair does not even *begin* to slip out anymore -- all. day. long. I can sleep in them and wake up with my updo totally intact. Not the most comfortable sleeping companions, I&#x27;ll admit, but you&#x27;re not looking for a pillow, here. Best of all, you can&#x27;t even see the little buggers hiding in there, working their hair magic. Just hair, lovely hair, where you want it, happily stuck to your super chic, non-bobby-pin-spewing head. {Goody should pay me for this. Sigh.}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered spin pins about two years ago and have been wearing them almost daily since. I have a love affair with them. After putting them in my hair for the gazillionth time, I again felt the urge to preach from the rooftops the unabashed joy I feel to have these little devices in my life... so I came here to release. I know. I have a problem. Just take a complete stranger&#x27;s two cents. If you are an athlete or a busy mom or someone who simply wants your freaking hair to stay where you put it in the first place, PLEASE do yourself a favor and buy these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;The gal who was in the dark entirely to long and is still sulking about it.</li>
            <li> Love these, but wish they were a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and had high hopes based on another review of twisting up my hair, letting it dry, and having perfect beautiful waves.. um.. no, that didn&#x27;t happen at all.  On a happy note, they do hold the hair in a bun fairly well.  I split my hair in half and wore one in each half of my hair and wore them for 12+ hours after my shower to let my hair dry.  They each fell out one time and when I put them back in, they stayed.  I think they could certainly hold a bun for people with normal hair (maybe not waist-long thick hair like me).  They spin in and out of the hair very easily and don&#x27;t pull.  The concept is great and if my hair was dry and I did one bun with 2 pieces in the same bun, I&#x27;m sure it would hold.  When I undid my hair after 12 hours, it was still pretty wet and my waves weren&#x27;t as nice looking as just towel scrunching my hair and letting it dry naturally.  Disappointed a bit, but they serve the purpose advertised.. will just expect them to hold a bun in place moving forward, not offer me fabulous waves.</li>
            <li> These are really strong and good quality, but unfortunately, if you have really smooth hair, it can slip right out of them, especially if your hair isn&#x27;t long enough to twist around a few times when making a bun. I often have to supplement them with regular bobby pins. These would probably work really well for people with long, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of these pins. However, I did not find that they were good for my fine hair. They would stay in initially but then when I started walkng around, they would become loose and eventually my hair would just fall. I am sure though that they would be great for thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that only 2 of these funny-looking bobby pins would hold my hair up, but they do! My hair is shoulder length with layers and I was able to make a messy bun very quickly. I think these should also be less damaging to the hair than elastics. I would recommend always twisting them clockwise when you put them in, so you know to turn counter-clockwise to remove them. They come out without tangling that way. The color of the pins doesn&#x27;t really matter. Very little of it is visible once it&#x27;s in, especially if you do a messy bun.</li>
            <li> I have thick, heavy hair and these do a great job of securing a bun in place.</li>
            <li> Works great for making buns. I have very thick and big volumed hair, the pins hold up quite well. I thought I could never make buns for my hair, but this product make it happen!</li>
            <li> I always keep spin pins in my purse in case I feel like putting my hair up. Quick, easy, and the bun stays in place. I even put my hair up with these pins straight after blowdrying and I get nice, pretty waves after I take the pins out an hour or two later. I just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive because I keep losing them!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great product!</li>
            <li> fun, easy to use and versatile&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i actually already owned a set, but decided to buy another to try out some other hair style ideas :)</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a dinged up, smashed in original packaging. However, the product was unharmed!&lt;br /&gt;(Also, I think it would&#x27;ve been cheaper to buy them at Target or someplace else.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, thick, curly hair. It needs more than just two spin pins to stay orderly. That would get pricey, so I am making do with the 2 spin pins and a handful of bobby pins. It is working for me much better than just bobby pins alone.</li>
            <li> works well for thick hair. slightly pricey, but worth it to order from the original manufacturer vs. a cheap knockoff.</li>
            <li> They stay in, but they&#x27;re kind of hard to twist into thick hair. If you use two you have to be careful not to lock them together.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how grateful I am to have found these. I bought them on a whim in a department store without having read any reviews and they truly have been a game changer! I have never been able to wear a bun in my hair before now. Multiple hair bands, numerous bobby pins, combinations of both - NOTHING would hold my hair up. I have insanely thick hair that goes half-way down my back. So you can imagine the pile on top of my head when trying to create a bun. These little doohickeys are miracle workers. Twist my hair, tuck the end under, screw one spiral pin down from the top and the other up from the bottom, and viola! I have not had them work themselves loose yet either. Give them a try!</li>
            <li> These pins are genius! So easy to use, and 1 or 2 will do what used to require a dozen bobby pins.</li>
            <li> Spin Pins are a life saver! I wear them all the time, and for all sorts of styles. A high bun, high braided bun, low buns, to assist french twists, to pin up braids into messy buns... I have rather thick, medium length hair, and these have no issue holding. I can put them in and they&#x27;ll be there all day! Super easy to use, but it takes a bit to figure out how many you need and their placement for each style. I typically use three for my buns. The mini ones are great for thinner hair or smaller buns and detail work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got absurdly thick hair that&#x27;s also reasonably long. I needed three spin pins and some bobby pins to keep my hair in a bun, and the bun didn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d hoped. However, it lasted a while, and without the spin pins, I would have needed a ridiculous amount of bobby pins.    UPDATE 12/9/14: My hair stylist was able to use 4 spin pins and 2 bobby pins to do my wedding up-do, which stayed secure the entire day and night without any problems. She&#x27;s now trying to see if she can get her salon to buy them in bulk.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use after a short practice session.  Makes a solid bun that will last. I have long hair that is pretty thick and still realized that the bun it makes is way better if I tease my hair a bit first, people with less hair may want to/have to do a fair amount of teasing to make a nice bun.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without these pins. What used to be 30 bobby pins for me is now replaced by mere 3-4 of these. They hold my thick and long hair all day. I love that they come in different colors, so you barely can&#x27;t see them in your hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair that defeats bobby pins and every other kind of clip imaginable. These, however, are fantastic. All-day hold with no adjusting throughout the day, and very easy to use. Just make sure you twist patiently when you take them out to avoid tangles.</li>
            <li> Genius. If only I had heard about these earlier in my life! I would have saved so much time and money, bobby pins will just not cut it after using these. You&#x27;re less likely to lose these, like bobby pins, too haha</li>
