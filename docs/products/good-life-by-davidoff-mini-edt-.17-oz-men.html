            <li> Tiny, Tiny little bottle.  I thought it was a joke!  I misread the .17 oz., thought it was 1.7 oz smells good, but mis represented just a little bit.  My fault, I should have read it better.</li>
            <li> Great scent that is super hard to find.  I received several compliments in regards to wearing this fragrance.  This is a fresh, lasting and moderate scent that you can wear anywhere and anytime.</li>
            <li> I love Good Live ! And they had just what I needed in stock . I will defiantly use them again .</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance in the world!</li>
            <li> So glad to find this item!  Easy to search for and service/processing was excellent.  Definitely recommend shopping this way for almost anything!</li>
            <li> Smells common. Decent but over priced.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it he used to wear it all the time but they stopped selling it in the stores so he really enjoyed his Christmas.</li>
            <li> Good Life is one of my favorite, if not the favorite fragrances. i wante  to wear it on my wedding day but,It is so hard to find now. im thankful that Amazon was able to help me find it. And  my day that much more complete..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used if for years and love it. Disappointed it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd bottle of Good Life that I have given to my husband.  I love the fragrance and he likes it too.  It is not over whelming but has a fresh subtle, soft and pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> Really small bottle, but I bought it Christmas 2011 and he is still using it 8 months later, he wears it most days. Luckily with cologne you don&#x27;t have to wear very much... at least you shouldn&#x27;t. :)</li>
            <li> Excellent cologne,just as I remember it from yrs ago. The only complaint is the size of the bottle. Plus they want way to much for the bigger bottles. Almost a hundred dollars a once. Price gouging at it&#x27;s best.</li>
            <li> This was a sample that even said on its box, you get charged for it.</li>
            <li> My husband wore this while we were dating and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  Then I found it on here, and I love it! Smells great!!</li>
