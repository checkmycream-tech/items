            <li>Awesome product!</li>
            <li>Great price!!!</li>
            <li>I do highlights in my hair, and this does a wonderful job of repairing the split ends.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but just not as awesome as the &amp;#34;Girl&#x27;s Toys&amp;#34;...if anybody knows of something that is a comparable substitute, that would be wonderful.</li>
            <li>Good price too!</li>
            <li>Great product for frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>It smells great as well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li>tames those fly aways</li>
            <li>Great product for controlling frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>TIGI was great to respond to my inquiry on their Facebook page, and suggested this.  </li>
            <li>Great product and service</li>
            <li>hair is darker now, but I still use this quite often as it adds a very nice element with no weight or greasiness.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>the best product of many I have tried to control the hair frizz</li>
            <li>The smell is sugary, pleasant, and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve loved it.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and great pricing!  </li>
            <li>so I knew it had to be good to own,</li>
            <li>Glaze haze is a good name, because it kind of reminds of donut glaze.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing for your hair.</li>
            <li>Sticky and didn&#x27;t smell as good as most Bed Head products....</li>
            <li>I liked the smell and performance of Girl Toys compared to the &amp;#34;Glaze Haze&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m not about to pay $40 for a 2-oz bottle on ebay.  </li>
            <li>non-greasy, smells great, does a great job of keeping my hair straight and not frizzy even in very humid conditions.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something that would smooth out the frizz and make my hair feel nice.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>, I also tried it after washing  and towel drying it and it seemed to work better.</li>
            <li>and my hair feels healthy and looks more healthy rather than without the product.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>love this and my salon uses it also which is Toni and guy</li>
            <li>It was healthy for how processed it was, but the ends lacked a bit of shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on the scent and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A big plus is that it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>must faster, is shiny, smooth, and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>It is fine and has a nice smell but is also very oily on the hand and hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff works good, also has a nice smell that is not overpowering or bland.</li>
            <li>I am sure there are products that can work a bit better, but I am satisfied with the overall results and would consider buying this product again.</li>
            <li>It works great to give your hair a smooth and shiny finish, when applied to wet hair, and before drying.</li>
            <li>Just be sure you don&#x27;t use to much.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy to see it on Amazon for half the price.  </li>
            <li>I like this serum, and thinks it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for taming my frizzy curly hair but not too heavy.</li>
            <li>Good enough, but lacking since I know they&#x27;ve made better stuff in the past.</li>
            <li>The two together made my hair so shiny, healthy looking, and soft that even the hair stylists want to know how my hair is so soft.</li>
            <li>, this really helps with frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>, it seemed to last forever, it really helped control my frizzy and fly-aways and whatnot, it did decrease my dry time, it smells pleasant, and it does not leave your hair (especially at the roots) oily.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida where it is very humid</li>
            <li>Helps my hair dry faster and keeps it frizz free.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend you give it a try -</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Only a drop or two is required for soft smooth hair and also works well as a flat iron protectant.</li>
            <li>I always put this in after I get my hair wet (after a quick run through with a towel) and brush it through</li>
            <li>but, the only downside of this is that the smell wasnt as strong as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>I really like the extra shine and smoothness</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soooo soft.</li>
            <li>I tried this product first on dry hair and it worked</li>
            <li>It is very difficult to find in stores, so I was happy to find it online.</li>
            <li>I have a full head of Level 10 bleached hair (I&#x27;m naturally a 6/7), so there&#x27;s quite a bit of damage to be fixed or at least concealed.  </li>
            <li>I love that it decreases my drying time and helps keep my hair shiny and healthy looking, however it&#x27;s a little hard to come by as far as the brand that I prefer, I usually have to order it from my stylist, so for convenience sake</li>
            <li>It extends the life of my the clear glaze that I get on my hair at the salon, and one tiny bottle lasts for months!</li>
            <li>I prefer the old TIGI &amp;#34;Bed Head Girl Toys Shine Serum&amp;#34; in the small blue round bottle, which is no longer available.  </li>

            <li> ; in my hair closest to the roots cause it can be a bit much and make your look heavy and flat.</li>
            <li> a tiny little bit (smaller than a pea) smoothed out all the frizzies near the end of my hair and made it shine, plus it smells like candy!</li>
            <li> My hair dried in half the time it normally takes which was a major surprise</li>
            <li> My medium thick hair drys so much faster, totally recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a sleeker shine with blow dry.</li>
            <li> One bottle lasta a really long time.</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse and over processed due to lots of hair color over time, but it is not completely damaged .</li>
            <li> I have curly dry hair</li>
            <li> I swear by Moroccan Oil, my hair holds alot of moisture and takes forever to dry, so</li>
            <li> My hair is quite long and before Glaze Haze it took me forever to blow dry!  </li>
            <li> I have hair down to my collar bone and only use 1/2 to 3/4 of a pump at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it both on wet and dry hair</li>
            <li> I previously had very blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I work the Glaze into my hair wet before styling.</li>
            <li> It does everything I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Just use a pea size and only use it about halfway down the shaft to the tips (could be too heavy on roots.)</li>
            <li> -- my hair feels smoother than my virgin hair without it being weighed down.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived but had been previously opened.</li>
            <li> I let my towel soak up the water from my hair few a few minutes, then put a few pumps of this in my hand and scrunch it into my hair.</li>
            <li> I am not exactly sure ow to use this product.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Even after going in the ocean, I simply throw one pump of this stuff through and my hair doesn&#x27;t get that awful crunchy straw texture.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smooths my hair and smells like candy!  LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Great product for frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> The product arrived but had been previously opened.</li>
            <li> Sticky and didn&#x27;t smell as good as most Bed Head products....</li>
            <li> Helps my hair dry faster and keeps it frizz free.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says. It smells great as well but, the only downside of this is that the smell wasnt as strong as I expected it to be. Regardless I would recommend it if your trying to decide if you want to purchase or not.</li>
            <li> non-greasy, smells great, does a great job of keeping my hair straight and not frizzy even in very humid conditions. Found it on clearance at Ulta and decided to give it a try. Amazon&#x27;s price matches the Ulta clearance price. It&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! My medium thick hair drys so much faster, totally recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a sleeker shine with blow dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff works good, also has a nice smell that is not overpowering or bland. Will buy again when I need it.</li>
            <li> tames those fly aways</li>
            <li> I really like the extra shine and smoothness the Glaze Haze adds to my hair. The smell is sugary, pleasant, and not overpowering. Tip: One bottle lasta a really long time. I have hair down to my collar bone and only use 1/2 to 3/4 of a pump at a time. I work the Glaze into my hair wet before styling.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have used a lot of Bed Head products.  I was looking for a hair serum of theirs that was in an orange bottle and could not find it so I tried this one.  I live in Florida where it is very humid, this really helps with frizzy hair.  I hope they continue to carry this on Amazon.  Great price!!!</li>
            <li> I have curly dry hair and I use this every time I wash my hair. I let my towel soak up the water from my hair few a few minutes, then put a few pumps of this in my hand and scrunch it into my hair. Makes my hair soooo soft. Just be sure you don&#x27;t use to much. Like anything else it will make it look greasy. I also mix this with Tresemmes Nourishing Ritual. The two together made my hair so shiny, healthy looking, and soft that even the hair stylists want to know how my hair is so soft. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and great pricing!  Great product for controlling frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for taming my frizzy curly hair but not too heavy.</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse and over processed due to lots of hair color over time, but it is not completely damaged . I wanted something that would smooth out the frizz and make my hair feel nice. I tried this product first on dry hair and it worked okay, I also tried it after washing  and towel drying it and it seemed to work better. My hair dried in half the time it normally takes which was a major surprise and my hair feels healthy and looks more healthy rather than without the product. I don&#x27;t put any of the &amp;#34;glaze&amp;#34; in my hair closest to the roots cause it can be a bit much and make your look heavy and flat. I use 2-3 pumps and it is just enough. I am sure there are products that can work a bit better, but I am satisfied with the overall results and would consider buying this product again.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best product of many I have tried to control the hair frizz I experience living in Florida. Amazing!</li>
            <li> I swear by Moroccan Oil, my hair holds alot of moisture and takes forever to dry, so I love that it decreases my drying time and helps keep my hair shiny and healthy looking, however it&#x27;s a little hard to come by as far as the brand that I prefer, I usually have to order it from my stylist, so for convenience sake I ordered this from Amazon and I love it, it seemed to last forever, it really helped control my frizzy and fly-aways and whatnot, it did decrease my dry time, it smells pleasant, and it does not leave your hair (especially at the roots) oily. Highly recommend you give it a try - I&#x27;ve used it both on wet and dry hair and I&#x27;ve loved it. (I also recommend Bed Head hairsprays - volume and flexibility through the roof!)</li>
            <li> Love this product! I can&#x27;t say enough about it. Only a drop or two is required for soft smooth hair and also works well as a flat iron protectant.</li>
            <li> Recently bought at my hair salon and I&#x27;m so happy to see it on Amazon for half the price.  I have a full head of Level 10 bleached hair (I&#x27;m naturally a 6/7), so there&#x27;s quite a bit of damage to be fixed or at least concealed.  I always put this in after I get my hair wet (after a quick run through with a towel) and brush it through -- my hair feels smoother than my virgin hair without it being weighed down.  Even after going in the ocean, I simply throw one pump of this stuff through and my hair doesn&#x27;t get that awful crunchy straw texture.  I swear by this stuff, it&#x27;s the only styling product I use regularly!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing for your hair. Seriously.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is very difficult to find in stores, so I was happy to find it online. It works great to give your hair a smooth and shiny finish, when applied to wet hair, and before drying. I ordered two, and they arrived promptly and as described. Good price too!</li>
            <li> Bed Head Girl Toys Shine Serum, rumor has it, might be discontinued.  TIGI was great to respond to my inquiry on their Facebook page, and suggested this.  It&#x27;s good, but just not as awesome as the &amp;#34;Girl&#x27;s Toys&amp;#34;...if anybody knows of something that is a comparable substitute, that would be wonderful.</li>
            <li> I prefer the old TIGI &amp;#34;Bed Head Girl Toys Shine Serum&amp;#34; in the small blue round bottle, which is no longer available.  I liked the smell and performance of Girl Toys compared to the &amp;#34;Glaze Haze&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m not about to pay $40 for a 2-oz bottle on ebay.  Good enough, but lacking since I know they&#x27;ve made better stuff in the past.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  Because I just can&#x27;t quit my stylist and she is 3 hours away...I only get my hair done every 12 weeks.  My hair is quite long and before Glaze Haze it took me forever to blow dry!  Now it dries must faster, is shiny, smooth, and healthy looking. It extends the life of my the clear glaze that I get on my hair at the salon, and one tiny bottle lasts for months! Just use a pea size and only use it about halfway down the shaft to the tips (could be too heavy on roots.)</li>
            <li> I am not exactly sure ow to use this product. I apply it after washing my hair on the edges to moisturize them. It is fine and has a nice smell but is also very oily on the hand and hair.</li>
            <li> love this and my salon uses it also which is Toni and guy so I knew it had to be good to own, would recommend to anyone with thicker hair like me</li>
            <li> Great product and service</li>
            <li> Glaze haze is a good name, because it kind of reminds of donut glaze. Not impressed. Greasy AND sticky. How is that even possible??</li>
            <li> I previously had very blonde hair. It was healthy for how processed it was, but the ends lacked a bit of shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Glaze Haze...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a tiny little bit (smaller than a pea) smoothed out all the frizzies near the end of my hair and made it shine, plus it smells like candy! I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on the scent and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is darker now, but I still use this quite often as it adds a very nice element with no weight or greasiness. Though, I don&#x27;t recommend using it too close to your scalp.</li>
            <li> I like this serum, and thinks it works pretty well. It doesn&#x27;t do the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; of stopping frizz to the degree that I thougth it would.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! It does everything I expected it to. I do highlights in my hair, and this does a wonderful job of repairing the split ends. Also helps with the smoothness and frizz. A big plus is that it smells wonderful!</li>
