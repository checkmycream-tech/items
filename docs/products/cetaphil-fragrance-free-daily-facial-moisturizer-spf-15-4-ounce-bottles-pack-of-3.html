            <li>My face has never felt better!  </li>
            <li>It goes on with a nice creamy consistency and does not leave my oily.</li>
            <li>nice weight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too oily, doesn&#x27;t break me out, and works wonderful to cover up dryness, or completely moisture my face.</li>
            <li>It seems to be more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>not helping, its making the faded/brown spot shows more.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, doesn&#x27;t irritate my rosacea and doesn&#x27;t leave a white mask!!</li>
            <li>a moisturizer like this one may give me the better skin I desire.</li>

            <li>Not too much is needed to moisturize, and if the appropriate amount is used it is not too greasy.</li>

            <li>I also love that it has sunscreen built into it, so I get a little extra sun protection even if I don&#x27;t put on regular sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Definitely would recommend for sensitive / rosacea prone skin</li>
            <li>While the leak is minor, the seller may consider at least taping the top of the bottles and putting the bottles into individual zip loc bag</li>

            <li> Have used it for several years.  I don&#x27;t leave the house without it on.  Using this product along with the Cetaphil gentle cleanser has keep my skin youthful and fresh  : )</li>
            <li> I use this daily and can assure you that you will not break out, or have oily skin from this. My face feels good when I use it and now it is never is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Cetaphil bar soap to wash my face first before using this.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle facial lotion.  Not too much is needed to moisturize, and if the appropriate amount is used it is not too greasy.</li>
            <li> It is one of the best face lotion i have used.&lt;br /&gt;My face keep wetted all the day although i work in air condition room</li>
            <li> I switched from a similar product by Olay, and I like this one better. It seems to be more moisturizing. It goes on with a nice creamy consistency and does not leave my oily. Plus it&#x27;s recommended by the Environmental Working Group. I will keep using this!</li>
            <li> Great bargain! Terrific moisturizer for my husbands face and bald head!</li>
            <li> nice weight. moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The bottles were simply placed in a brown envelope with no additional packaging. When the 3 bottles arrived, 2 were leaking a bit at the top, and 1 was turned to the Open position. While the leak is minor, the seller may consider at least taping the top of the bottles and putting the bottles into individual zip loc bag (that&#x27;s how other online retailers do it). All said, the price is good.</li>
            <li> Rubs in well.  Does not leave a ghost.  Does not separate when you put makeup over it.  ITs not grease free but sinks it well.  Great for a daily for the kids also.  Same price as target so no money saver buying bulk.</li>
            <li> not helping, its making the faded/brown spot shows more. Quit using this product. I&#x27;m using something else.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Good price too.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the Cetaphil lotion for my face.  It doesn&#x27;t have a smell to it and makes my face very soft and I don&#x27;t break out from it.  I would recommend it for a face cream.</li>
            <li> The product has great quality and price. I recomnedo the seller.</li>
            <li> Best face lotion out there.  Not oily and greasy, great price for a 3 pack</li>
            <li> I use Cetaphil cream and so thought this would be a good option for my face, but I guess I must be allergic to it (I have very sensitive skin) as it burns when I put it on and sometimes makes me eyes water.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I use it every morning before putting on my makeup. It&#x27;s not too oily, doesn&#x27;t break me out, and works wonderful to cover up dryness, or completely moisture my face.</li>
            <li> This is a product recommended by my dermatologist. It has FPF 15 which I use because of a history of skin cancer. The daily moisturizer also helps.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, doesn&#x27;t irritate my rosacea and doesn&#x27;t leave a white mask!! Definitely would recommend for sensitive / rosacea prone skin</li>
            <li> I bought three in a pack. Still Too pricey for buying 3 units in one purchase. I will consider other brand, organic and more reasonably priced next time.</li>
            <li> This is a nice light lotion and seems to work quite well so far.  I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and am always searching for products to make my skin appear younger as well as protect from further sun damage.  I refuse to even consider Botox (check into the production of Botox--a very cruel process that should be banned), so a moisturizer like this one may give me the better skin I desire.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  My face has never felt better!  I do feel like I have to wash my hands after applying it though.  It feels too &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; on my hands, but feels great on my face.  I also love that it has sunscreen built into it, so I get a little extra sun protection even if I don&#x27;t put on regular sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I buy this 3 pack every few months on Amazon.  Both my husband and I use it daily as our face lotion.  It is not greasy and is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Use all the Cetaphil products ... Use the facial moisturizer with sun screen before going out into the sun each day</li>
