            <li>Very nice brush.</li>

            <li>Nice brush and price!</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>My scalp is tingling from all the brushing - in a good way.</li>
            <li>It is a good brush for the money and serves me well, but I don&#x27;t like the inaccurate description.  </li>
            <li>The quality feels good.</li>
            <li>It is a really good brush with sturdy bristles.  </li>
            <li>Have been on a seemingly never-ending search for a good brush that won&#x27;t cost me $100 (Mason Pearson, I&#x27;m looking at you) and this is IT.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I got a brush this good for this price.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare the quality since I don&#x27;t own the MP one, but this one works very nicely.</li>
            <li>It has a good amount of boar to nylon ratio, and it&#x27;s comfortable to hold and is attractive in appearance.</li>
            <li>LOVE This brush, it&#x27;s a must have!</li>
            <li>I love this brush!  </li>
            <li>Totally love it!</li>
            <li>Love this brush!</li>
            <li>I love brushing my hair at night with this brush, it smooths it out and feels silky!</li>
            <li>Amazing brush for healthy scalp and shiny hair!</li>
            <li>This brush manages to smooth out my wavy/fine/tangled hair into a voluminous and attractive shape.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>They really liked them too.</li>
            <li>I have a Mason Pearson Popular Boar Bristle &amp; Nylon brush.</li>
            <li>The brush itself has a nice rubberized feel to it, too.</li>
            <li>It brushes nicely through my hair without breaking my hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have it my budget to splurge on a Mason Pearson Popular brush (a mix of nylon and boar bristles)</li>
            <li>, she has been a quick convert and is so happy that she didn&#x27;t spend $150+ for the Mason brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful looking brush, and very gentle</li>
            <li>It also is perfect for my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>It adds a bit more sheen to my hair as well, which is always a nice benefit.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best brush I have owned.</li>
            <li>It has so far been one of the best brushes for getting out unruly tangles.  </li>
            <li>received it and the Denman and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I was using a great paddle brush that I loved, but it was losing it&#x27;s luster and was kind of old....</li>
            <li>Super Amazing Brush!</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and great grip when using.</li>
            <li>hair for sure has more sheen.</li>
            <li>love this</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS BRUSH.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this brush.</li>
            <li>I have never used the Mason Pearson brush, but I can&#x27;t imagine that it can be much better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to get out my magnifying glass and check. :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m buying 2 more.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite brush that I have owned.  </li>
            <li>I bought one and reordered more for my 3 grown-up daughters.</li>
            <li>I have been so pleased with my Spornette&#x27;s Luxury Cushion hairbrush that I purchased one for my daughter-in-law just before she purchased a Mason Pearson.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it would work very well to style a hair-do, but for detangling and grooming before bed or after drying, this works great.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>i guess one would have to spend more $ for a softer feel.</li>
            <li>But that is okay, with this brush I no longer need the comb which is 100% better for my hair anyway.</li>
            <li>but it builds so much static frizz</li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>For many years, I used a Spornette Porcupine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still be enjoying it 10 years from now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this one.</li>
            <li>and this looked to be the next best thing</li>
            <li>My 5 star justifies how pleased I am with this brush.</li>
            <li>It creates static and an undesirable texture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed it, and tried spraying the bristles with this aloe/water spray I use &amp; it still causes static.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brush.  </li>
            <li>so* many brushes feel like stinging needles--horrible).  </li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>and I like this one even better.</li>
            <li>Much bigger, feels wonderful, does a great job on my hip-length hair and really massages my scalp.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t actually *enjoyed* brushing my hair for awhile.</li>
            <li>but I was expecting more.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and its perfect to get the rats out before washing.  </li>
            <li>Everybody wants their own!</li>
            <li>These bristles are a lot softer than my old brush and it smooths and detangles beautifully.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so excited that I did!  </li>
            <li>This brush a perfect for my very long, medium thickness hair.  </li>
            <li>This brush is amazing for this price ; so gentle on the scalp yet stimulating and effective.  </li>
            <li>So glad I found this one at such a good price!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t snag my hair or give me static and it is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my hair so shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is as good as the mason and pearson that costs so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great at redistributing oils, going through tangles gently, and quickly giving my hair shine and body.</li>
            <li>This brush is very well made and I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of a superior brush but can not afford the superior price...</li>
            <li>I just pulled out the plastic bristles and now have a full on boar bristle brush!</li>
            <li>Other than that, its a perfect brush!</li>
            <li>Other than that it is very good quality!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easily cleaned and works just as well as the day I got it.</li>
            <li>This brushes through easily and feels great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush is not an exact match by any means, but is amazing given the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty great at smoothing and overall making my hair look nice.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great brush and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>, it brushes smoothly and the bristles massage your scalp.</li>
            <li>The grip is looser than the mason pearson which is great for my coarse curly hair and didn&#x27;t give me the splits I got from the mason pearson which ripped through my hair instead of glidding through my hair.</li>
            <li>I think it is a fabulous product for the money.,</li>
            <li>This comb will make your hair so smooth and silky</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is light weight.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic brush.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smooth as well as a Mason Pearson.  </li>
            <li>I just purchased this brush and so far, so good.</li>
            <li>Very well made and simply luxurious for a great price!</li>
            <li>The brush is able to smooth my hair whether I wear it straight or wavy.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was the best you could own, WRONG.</li>
            <li>At the young age of seven, I mentioned in tears that it never hurt to have my hair brushed when staying over at my best friend Jills house.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually a review writing kind of person.</li>
            <li>perfect combination of soft face and harder bristles make brushing the knots out of my hair  after a  motorcycle ride easy.</li>
            <li>A nice large oval cushion brush with comfortable satin finished handle and mixed nylon boar bristles, great for adding shine by distributing your hair&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
            <li>love this brush i order for everyone i know (thanks prime).</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think would hang onto one for the many years it deserves, I decided to get her one of these because I heard they are very comparable.</li>
            <li>I love the style of the brush,looks very 1950s.</li>
            <li>She likes it just fine, but she says it isn&#x27;t much better than her old super cheap conair brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I gave Spornette another try, I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair but a lot of it, and this detangles it easily, makes it look spectacular, plus massages my scalp and doesn&#x27;t hurt when it does so</li>
            <li>I love this brush and would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>This hair brush is so nice and a great deal, especially compared to other comparable hairbrushes in terms of quality.</li>
            <li>I had an M-P brush for a very long time and never thought anything would be as good, even after it started losing tufts.</li>
            <li>The bristles are strong enough to get through her hair but are not the straight plastic kind that seem to get tangled and hurt.  </li>
            <li>Great brush but a little too pointy</li>
            <li>The brush itself is very lightweight and comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>It really makes its way through my hair, stimulates the scalp and leaves my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I really love this brush, it doesn&#x27;t cause my naturally wavy hair to frizz if I decide to brush it out after it air dries.</li>
            <li>Good brush, works as expected.</li>
            <li>I love how soft it makes my hair.</li>
            <li>thst finally needed replacement after 20+ years, so I was thrilled to see this brush.  </li>
            <li>(I get a lot of flyaways) and that it doesn&#x27;t break off pieces of hair, even when I brush right after towel drying.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it has a very strong plastic smell.</li>
            <li>I wish I had found this great brush before I spent so much on a new Mason Pearson.  </li>
            <li>Works great on her hair and detangles quicker than usual.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the new Spornette is fantastic.</li>
            <li>i also own a mason p brush but wasnt going to buy a second one for that much for my work.</li>
            <li>If you hve curly, coarse, and thick hair you will love this more than the mason pearson popular which is over 10x the price.</li>
            <li>My wife said that this brush is great and she is hard to please.</li>
            <li>Well, I have no comparison as this is the first brush I buy in the last 5 years that costs more than $3</li>
            <li>Only a spaced comb that detangles is able to accomplish that feat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve recently been able to \\&quot;pay-</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>As soon as I tried it, I realized that, at one tenth the cost, it works exactly as well.  </li>
            <li>Sadly it is not.</li>
            <li>This brush seems to only brush the top layers of my hair.</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair that tangles and this is a real winner to smooth and shine.</li>
            <li>I have great, long, strong, lovely blonde hair (if I do say so myself) but this brush made my hair &amp;#34;furry&amp;#34; and fuzzy, and just overall gross.</li>
            <li>But for the price, it really does comb through my head of fine, but tons of wavy, curly nearly waist length hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cute but not worth the money.</li>
            <li>Maybe it won&#x27;t last 30 years like the M-P, but I probably won&#x27;t live that long anyway, lol.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality hairbrush but it definitely works better on thinner hair.  </li>
            <li>And I love it to blow dry</li>
            <li>I blow dry it most days.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome hairbrush if you have medium to long, medium or thick hair.</li>
            <li>If you have thick hair or textured hair, I would probably stay away from this brush as it probably won&#x27;t do the job, but if you have fine and straight hair, this is the brush for you!!!!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>so I chose this one for the smoothness and also how it really gets into my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was even able to use it on my wet hair this morning, without any issues.</li>
            <li>and I should have really replaced it after 6 months of use.  </li>
            <li>I love it for detangling when wet, too.</li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>and I do not like it so much</li>
            <li>my hair straight b/c</li>
            <li>This brush ever so gently smooths them out without hurting at all.  </li>
            <li>There are a lot of bristles which really seems to help get the tangles out.  </li>
            <li>very similiar to a Jean Pierre brush I have had for 20 years.  </li>
            <li>but this brush makes my hair really greasy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m very paranoid about hair breakage/damage) on my hair.</li>
            <li>My family loves this brush so much that this is the 4th one I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>I treat my things very well, and did nothing that should have caused this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and does the job.</li>
            <li>I really like this hair brush</li>
            <li>My daughters and I have  a lot of long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>It feels amazing on the scalp of second day hair and instead of making my hair feel puffy and gross like other brushes, it makes my hair feel smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Even though I have no comparison I tried to compare the description with the other, more famous brand that makes a similar brush (and sells it for 10 times the price) and the description was almost the same -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush has enough give to it that it&#x27;s firm but feels good on your scalp.</li>
            <li>I have long, straight, fine hair, but lots of it....and was having a hard time finding a good hair brush that didn&#x27;t pull all my hair out when I brushed it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>So while it feels like a high quality brush, the fact that she couldn&#x27;t use it leaves it sitting around in a box</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Comparable to any high end brush.</li>
            <li>Have always used the brushes with more sparse bristles and the little balls on the end.</li>
            <li>I recommend this brush for anyone who wants soft, silky hair and a brush that can detangle like nobody&#x27;s business.</li>
            <li>It even brushes good through my daughters mixed tiny curl rough hair without it hurting her.</li>
            <li>My last brush broke right where the paddle and the handle met.  </li>
            <li>It is able to get down to my scalp, but my 5-year old brushed my hair one day as an alternative to driving Hot Wheels cars through it, and this brush meant it didn&#x27;t hurt at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She had beautiful thick red hair and it is the only brush she uses to get her snarls out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been needing a new brush.</li>
            <li>because I don&#x27;t even want to risk losing a $150 brush, this will be my new go to and travel brush.</li>
            <li>It makes my scalp feel good and works well on my short thick hair.</li>
            <li>As far as detangling it works fine, but so do my other hair brushes.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very soft and detangles.</li>
            <li>Most brushes are either too stiff (like a vent brush or porcupine brush) or else too soft to get through my hair and lift it (example of this problem is with a boar bristle brush).</li>
            <li>I like the brush because my 100% boar hair brush that I left at a family members house could not even begin to get close to my roots/scalp and it only brushed the top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used spornette for about 16 years... and though my old old brush is still kicking, I wanted something new.</li>
            <li>I love this for working product through wet or dry hair as you&#x27;d use  a denman.</li>
            <li>Unlike pure boar bristle brushes, it actually gets through all of my hair...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really wanting a second Mason Pearson brush for my purse, but didn&#x27;t want to shell out another $100 bucks.</li>
            <li>BUT I do not like the rubbery soft plastic handle.  </li>
            <li>Is it soft plastic or rubber?  </li>
            <li>It prevents breakage and also leaves hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend was so surprised at how well it combed that he took it and started combing my hair until I had to make him stop.</li>
            <li>it-forward\\&quot; by spreading the word to my friends with young girls who had been battling brushing time.  </li>
            <li>It helps to distribute the natural oil throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>I like the combo of the natural and nylon bristles, too, it&#x27;s soft on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to give it to my mom to try, but won&#x27;t be surprised if it ends up in the trash:/</li>
            <li>I needed a much fuller boars hair brush and larger paddle.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to get very tangled, and this brush definitely detangles without hurting my head.  </li>
            <li>(I have a sensitive scalp &amp;</li>
            <li>and she was skeptical, but when it came and she tried it out she said it is just as good as her Marilyn Uptown...</li>
            <li>This brush goes right through it without damaging my hair, even if it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li>I used to use the classic Spornette brush like this with the wooden handle (nylon and boar bristle).</li>
            <li>It really is a high quality, low price option.</li>
            <li>hands down will NOT go back to my old brush that was just a normal-everyday-nothing special sbrush...</li>
            <li>Mine is long, medium-thick, and straight or wavy.</li>
            <li>Even though I recently purchased a new Mason Pearson brush, I saw this brush advertised and decided to try it as a backup.  </li>
            <li>It was smaller than my new Spornette, too.</li>
            <li>I used to have a similar style brush I purchased at Target that I thought I loved, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li>The quality is high, but unless you have thin, fine hair, I would pass on this brush.</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair and this brush does not add static</li>
            <li>I am very passionate about my hair and that makes me particular about the products that I use</li>
            <li>I finally realized my old one that I&#x27;ve used for years was breaking my hair as well as pulling it out.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft against your scalp but have just enough stiffness to get into the under-layers of hair and separate the hair.</li>
            <li>I shy away from these kind of bristles.</li>
            <li>My old brush made my fine, thin hair lay even flatter.</li>
            <li>- it can get through my thick hair, with minimal static, and after -/+ two weeks of using has made my hair noticeable shinier.</li>
            <li>This brush was bought for someone with very, very, thick hair that knots easily.  </li>
            <li>I have medium/thick very long straight hair,  which does not normally become staticy at all.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, very thick hair.</li>
            <li>I have a lot to get done in the mornings, so to me, any time saver is helpful and this brush works quite gently and efficiently wet or dry.</li>

            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> My scalp is tingling from all the brushing - in a good way.</li>
            <li> It is a good brush for the money and serves me well, but I don&#x27;t like the inaccurate description.  </li>
            <li> The quality feels good.</li>
            <li> It is a really good brush with sturdy bristles.  </li>
            <li> Have been on a seemingly never-ending search for a good brush that won&#x27;t cost me $100 (Mason Pearson, I&#x27;m looking at you) and this is IT.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I got a brush this good for this price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare the quality since I don&#x27;t own the MP one, but this one works very nicely.</li>
            <li> It has a good amount of boar to nylon ratio, and it&#x27;s comfortable to hold and is attractive in appearance.</li>
            <li> LOVE This brush, it&#x27;s a must have!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  </li>
            <li> Totally love it!</li>
            <li> Love this brush!</li>
            <li> I love brushing my hair at night with this brush, it smooths it out and feels silky!</li>
            <li> Amazing brush for healthy scalp and shiny hair!</li>
            <li> This brush manages to smooth out my wavy/fine/tangled hair into a voluminous and attractive shape.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> They really liked them too.</li>
            <li> I have a Mason Pearson Popular Boar Bristle &amp; Nylon brush.</li>
            <li> The brush itself has a nice rubberized feel to it, too.</li>
            <li> It brushes nicely through my hair without breaking my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have it my budget to splurge on a Mason Pearson Popular brush (a mix of nylon and boar bristles)</li>
            <li> , she has been a quick convert and is so happy that she didn&#x27;t spend $150+ for the Mason brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful looking brush, and very gentle</li>
            <li> It also is perfect for my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> It adds a bit more sheen to my hair as well, which is always a nice benefit.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best brush I have owned.</li>
            <li> It has so far been one of the best brushes for getting out unruly tangles.  </li>
            <li> received it and the Denman and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I was using a great paddle brush that I loved, but it was losing it&#x27;s luster and was kind of old....</li>
            <li> Super Amazing Brush!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and great grip when using.</li>
            <li> hair for sure has more sheen.</li>
            <li> love this</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS BRUSH.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this brush.</li>
            <li> I have never used the Mason Pearson brush, but I can&#x27;t imagine that it can be much better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to get out my magnifying glass and check. :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m buying 2 more.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite brush that I have owned.  </li>
            <li> I bought one and reordered more for my 3 grown-up daughters.</li>
            <li> I have been so pleased with my Spornette&#x27;s Luxury Cushion hairbrush that I purchased one for my daughter-in-law just before she purchased a Mason Pearson.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would work very well to style a hair-do, but for detangling and grooming before bed or after drying, this works great.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> i guess one would have to spend more $ for a softer feel.</li>
            <li> But that is okay, with this brush I no longer need the comb which is 100% better for my hair anyway.</li>
            <li> but it builds so much static frizz</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> For many years, I used a Spornette Porcupine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still be enjoying it 10 years from now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this one.</li>
            <li> and this looked to be the next best thing</li>
            <li> My 5 star justifies how pleased I am with this brush.</li>
            <li> It creates static and an undesirable texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed it, and tried spraying the bristles with this aloe/water spray I use &amp; it still causes static.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush.  </li>
            <li> so* many brushes feel like stinging needles--horrible).  </li>
            <li> Love this brush.</li>
            <li> and I like this one even better.</li>
            <li> Much bigger, feels wonderful, does a great job on my hip-length hair and really massages my scalp.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually *enjoyed* brushing my hair for awhile.</li>
            <li> but I was expecting more.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and its perfect to get the rats out before washing.  </li>
            <li> Everybody wants their own!</li>
            <li> These bristles are a lot softer than my old brush and it smooths and detangles beautifully.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so excited that I did!  </li>
            <li> This brush a perfect for my very long, medium thickness hair.  </li>
            <li> This brush is amazing for this price ; so gentle on the scalp yet stimulating and effective.  </li>
            <li> So glad I found this one at such a good price!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t snag my hair or give me static and it is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my hair so shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is as good as the mason and pearson that costs so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great at redistributing oils, going through tangles gently, and quickly giving my hair shine and body.</li>
            <li> This brush is very well made and I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of a superior brush but can not afford the superior price...</li>
            <li> I just pulled out the plastic bristles and now have a full on boar bristle brush!</li>
            <li> Other than that, its a perfect brush!</li>
            <li> Other than that it is very good quality!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easily cleaned and works just as well as the day I got it.</li>
            <li> This brushes through easily and feels great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush is not an exact match by any means, but is amazing given the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty great at smoothing and overall making my hair look nice.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great brush and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> , it brushes smoothly and the bristles massage your scalp.</li>
            <li> The grip is looser than the mason pearson which is great for my coarse curly hair and didn&#x27;t give me the splits I got from the mason pearson which ripped through my hair instead of glidding through my hair.</li>
            <li> I think it is a fabulous product for the money.,</li>
            <li> This comb will make your hair so smooth and silky</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is light weight.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic brush.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smooth as well as a Mason Pearson.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased this brush and so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Very well made and simply luxurious for a great price!</li>
            <li> The brush is able to smooth my hair whether I wear it straight or wavy.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was the best you could own, WRONG.</li>
            <li> At the young age of seven, I mentioned in tears that it never hurt to have my hair brushed when staying over at my best friend Jills house.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually a review writing kind of person.</li>
            <li> perfect combination of soft face and harder bristles make brushing the knots out of my hair  after a  motorcycle ride easy.</li>
            <li> A nice large oval cushion brush with comfortable satin finished handle and mixed nylon boar bristles, great for adding shine by distributing your hair&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
            <li> love this brush i order for everyone i know (thanks prime).</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think would hang onto one for the many years it deserves, I decided to get her one of these because I heard they are very comparable.</li>
            <li> I love the style of the brush,looks very 1950s.</li>
            <li> She likes it just fine, but she says it isn&#x27;t much better than her old super cheap conair brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I gave Spornette another try, I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair but a lot of it, and this detangles it easily, makes it look spectacular, plus massages my scalp and doesn&#x27;t hurt when it does so</li>
            <li> I love this brush and would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> This hair brush is so nice and a great deal, especially compared to other comparable hairbrushes in terms of quality.</li>
            <li> I had an M-P brush for a very long time and never thought anything would be as good, even after it started losing tufts.</li>
            <li> The bristles are strong enough to get through her hair but are not the straight plastic kind that seem to get tangled and hurt.  </li>
            <li> Great brush but a little too pointy</li>
            <li> The brush itself is very lightweight and comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> It really makes its way through my hair, stimulates the scalp and leaves my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I really love this brush, it doesn&#x27;t cause my naturally wavy hair to frizz if I decide to brush it out after it air dries.</li>
            <li> Good brush, works as expected.</li>
            <li> I love how soft it makes my hair.</li>
            <li> thst finally needed replacement after 20+ years, so I was thrilled to see this brush.  </li>
            <li> (I get a lot of flyaways) and that it doesn&#x27;t break off pieces of hair, even when I brush right after towel drying.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it has a very strong plastic smell.</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this great brush before I spent so much on a new Mason Pearson.  </li>
            <li> Works great on her hair and detangles quicker than usual.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the new Spornette is fantastic.</li>
            <li> i also own a mason p brush but wasnt going to buy a second one for that much for my work.</li>
            <li> If you hve curly, coarse, and thick hair you will love this more than the mason pearson popular which is over 10x the price.</li>
            <li> My wife said that this brush is great and she is hard to please.</li>
            <li> Well, I have no comparison as this is the first brush I buy in the last 5 years that costs more than $3</li>
            <li> Only a spaced comb that detangles is able to accomplish that feat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently been able to \\&quot;pay-</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> As soon as I tried it, I realized that, at one tenth the cost, it works exactly as well.  </li>
            <li> Sadly it is not.</li>
            <li> This brush seems to only brush the top layers of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair that tangles and this is a real winner to smooth and shine.</li>
            <li> I have great, long, strong, lovely blonde hair (if I do say so myself) but this brush made my hair &amp;#34;furry&amp;#34; and fuzzy, and just overall gross.</li>
            <li> But for the price, it really does comb through my head of fine, but tons of wavy, curly nearly waist length hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super cute but not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Maybe it won&#x27;t last 30 years like the M-P, but I probably won&#x27;t live that long anyway, lol.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality hairbrush but it definitely works better on thinner hair.  </li>
            <li> And I love it to blow dry</li>
            <li> I blow dry it most days.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome hairbrush if you have medium to long, medium or thick hair.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair or textured hair, I would probably stay away from this brush as it probably won&#x27;t do the job, but if you have fine and straight hair, this is the brush for you!!!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> so I chose this one for the smoothness and also how it really gets into my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was even able to use it on my wet hair this morning, without any issues.</li>
            <li> and I should have really replaced it after 6 months of use.  </li>
            <li> I love it for detangling when wet, too.</li>
            <li> but I really like it.</li>
            <li> and I do not like it so much</li>
            <li> my hair straight b/c</li>
            <li> This brush ever so gently smooths them out without hurting at all.  </li>
            <li> There are a lot of bristles which really seems to help get the tangles out.  </li>
            <li> very similiar to a Jean Pierre brush I have had for 20 years.  </li>
            <li> but this brush makes my hair really greasy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m very paranoid about hair breakage/damage) on my hair.</li>
            <li> My family loves this brush so much that this is the 4th one I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I treat my things very well, and did nothing that should have caused this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and does the job.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair brush</li>
            <li> My daughters and I have  a lot of long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> It feels amazing on the scalp of second day hair and instead of making my hair feel puffy and gross like other brushes, it makes my hair feel smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Even though I have no comparison I tried to compare the description with the other, more famous brand that makes a similar brush (and sells it for 10 times the price) and the description was almost the same -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush has enough give to it that it&#x27;s firm but feels good on your scalp.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight, fine hair, but lots of it....and was having a hard time finding a good hair brush that didn&#x27;t pull all my hair out when I brushed it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So while it feels like a high quality brush, the fact that she couldn&#x27;t use it leaves it sitting around in a box</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Comparable to any high end brush.</li>
            <li> Have always used the brushes with more sparse bristles and the little balls on the end.</li>
            <li> I recommend this brush for anyone who wants soft, silky hair and a brush that can detangle like nobody&#x27;s business.</li>
            <li> It even brushes good through my daughters mixed tiny curl rough hair without it hurting her.</li>
            <li> My last brush broke right where the paddle and the handle met.  </li>
            <li> It is able to get down to my scalp, but my 5-year old brushed my hair one day as an alternative to driving Hot Wheels cars through it, and this brush meant it didn&#x27;t hurt at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She had beautiful thick red hair and it is the only brush she uses to get her snarls out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been needing a new brush.</li>
            <li> because I don&#x27;t even want to risk losing a $150 brush, this will be my new go to and travel brush.</li>
            <li> It makes my scalp feel good and works well on my short thick hair.</li>
            <li> As far as detangling it works fine, but so do my other hair brushes.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very soft and detangles.</li>
            <li> Most brushes are either too stiff (like a vent brush or porcupine brush) or else too soft to get through my hair and lift it (example of this problem is with a boar bristle brush).</li>
            <li> I like the brush because my 100% boar hair brush that I left at a family members house could not even begin to get close to my roots/scalp and it only brushed the top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used spornette for about 16 years... and though my old old brush is still kicking, I wanted something new.</li>
            <li> I love this for working product through wet or dry hair as you&#x27;d use  a denman.</li>
            <li> Unlike pure boar bristle brushes, it actually gets through all of my hair...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really wanting a second Mason Pearson brush for my purse, but didn&#x27;t want to shell out another $100 bucks.</li>
            <li> BUT I do not like the rubbery soft plastic handle.  </li>
            <li> Is it soft plastic or rubber?  </li>
            <li> It prevents breakage and also leaves hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend was so surprised at how well it combed that he took it and started combing my hair until I had to make him stop.</li>
            <li> it-forward\\&quot; by spreading the word to my friends with young girls who had been battling brushing time.  </li>
            <li> It helps to distribute the natural oil throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> I like the combo of the natural and nylon bristles, too, it&#x27;s soft on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give it to my mom to try, but won&#x27;t be surprised if it ends up in the trash:/</li>
            <li> I needed a much fuller boars hair brush and larger paddle.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to get very tangled, and this brush definitely detangles without hurting my head.  </li>
            <li> (I have a sensitive scalp &amp;</li>
            <li> and she was skeptical, but when it came and she tried it out she said it is just as good as her Marilyn Uptown...</li>
            <li> This brush goes right through it without damaging my hair, even if it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> I used to use the classic Spornette brush like this with the wooden handle (nylon and boar bristle).</li>
            <li> It really is a high quality, low price option.</li>
            <li> hands down will NOT go back to my old brush that was just a normal-everyday-nothing special sbrush...</li>
            <li> Mine is long, medium-thick, and straight or wavy.</li>
            <li> Even though I recently purchased a new Mason Pearson brush, I saw this brush advertised and decided to try it as a backup.  </li>
            <li> It was smaller than my new Spornette, too.</li>
            <li> I used to have a similar style brush I purchased at Target that I thought I loved, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> The quality is high, but unless you have thin, fine hair, I would pass on this brush.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this brush does not add static</li>
            <li> I am very passionate about my hair and that makes me particular about the products that I use</li>
            <li> I finally realized my old one that I&#x27;ve used for years was breaking my hair as well as pulling it out.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft against your scalp but have just enough stiffness to get into the under-layers of hair and separate the hair.</li>
            <li> I shy away from these kind of bristles.</li>
            <li> My old brush made my fine, thin hair lay even flatter.</li>
            <li> - it can get through my thick hair, with minimal static, and after -/+ two weeks of using has made my hair noticeable shinier.</li>
            <li> This brush was bought for someone with very, very, thick hair that knots easily.  </li>
            <li> I have medium/thick very long straight hair,  which does not normally become staticy at all.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have a lot to get done in the mornings, so to me, any time saver is helpful and this brush works quite gently and efficiently wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It left her hair frizzy and less controlled than her normal plastic bristled brushes.  </li>
            <li> This is slightly larger than my old one, but the cushion is wonderfully soft - like my old broken in brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other boar bristle brushes that I didn&#x27;t like so much but at least they wouldn&#x27;t make my thick hair a static mess.</li>
            <li> I also have thick, straight Asian hair.  </li>
            <li> Despite the pliability of the bristles, it really does get through my thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, color treated hair that dries wavy.</li>
            <li> I use this brush for brushing my long coated dog.  </li>
            <li> She has long medium thickness hair</li>
            <li> All the bristles completely bent, making the brush pretty useless.  </li>
            <li> So if you use it with a blowdryer, or have thick straight hair like me, I wouldn&#x27;t use this brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, bone straight, and never tangles or frizzes.</li>
            <li> We both have very thick hair and this brush moves right through it.</li>
            <li> I have very long,</li>
            <li> The nylon fibers are a little too sharp for those who have a sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li> However, I do have to say, my thick hair gives this brush a run for its money because where the thickness of the top of my head begins, the brush is unable to reach my scalp fully, and never mind any further down the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> I even blow dry my hair wet with this brush and none of the bristles have yet to melt on me.</li>
            <li> she was on her third Marilyn uptown brush in less than a year</li>
            <li> I have had far fewer breaks during brushing without the time consuming effort of combing my hair, which is long and thick.</li>
            <li> She needs this type of brush due to her long hair.  </li>
            <li> This one has a slightly bigger surface area, so it goes a little faster with this one for my waist-length hair.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected and would not buy again.  </li>
            <li> However, that is expected and it is not the brush&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m sad about is the fact that I spent well over $100 on a pearson mason brush first.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mason Pearson brushes for years, because they were the only brushes that could handle my long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> if it lasts like my other Spornette brushes...</li>
            <li> the other brush did.</li>
            <li> Every time I use it my hair becomes extremely staticy &amp; I have to spray it and recomb it with my other brush to fix it.</li>
            <li> but they feel sharp.</li>
            <li> I still need to use my other brush to get through the hair.</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff enough to pull through hair but not to stiff that they hurt.</li>
            <li> I liked the design but was disappointed that the bristles were so hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that it didn&#x27;t last long especially since i barely used it.</li>
            <li> I hate to say it, but it might be better.</li>
            <li> The LX-1 seems to lift it up to give volume instead of smash it down.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull your hair out, it DOES get all the way down to the scalp of your head, it doesn&#x27;t rip/scratch/tear/irritate your scalp...</li>
            <li> One for me and one for my other daughter!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t rip your hair out and gets through thick and thin hair gently.</li>
            <li> It still takes time - just less time.</li>
            <li> it just weighed less and was not a wood handle.  </li>
            <li> , I tried a wide comb, tried soap, even emailed the company which was not able to give me a valid solution to my problem (although they suggested soap).</li>
            <li> I specifically needed a brush for thick, long hair.  </li>
            <li> I have medium thick, medium long hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9 yo daughter who has very long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> its nothing that a little hand smoothing can fix up.</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting a larger brush if you have very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Felt like it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I have had this brush for a few years</li>
            <li> I tried heavy conditioners and anti-frizz hair products to solve the problem but nothing helps.</li>
            <li> I just got it a few days ago, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly a tragedy the few times when I&#x27;ve forgotten to pack this brush on trips----and</li>
            <li> So, this purchase was a waste of time and money for me.</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday day.</li>
            <li> I used this brush everyday for blow drying</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s going to tun into sticky mess in a few years.  </li>
            <li> The handle on this brush unlike the mason pearson and angelo david is thick and not flimsy/thin/ and glass like plastic that breaks in half once dropped on the floor.</li>
            <li> I was blessed with hair that requires very little upkeep.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money !</li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> No, this isn&#x27;t a luxury brand name that costs a ton of money, but it does its job well, and does it painlessly, for a small fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Initially, she was skeptical, however</li>
            <li> I think I hung on to it for sentimental reasons.</li>
            <li> If you have extremely thick hair this may not be the brush for you, not really sure.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, but I have a LOT of it, and it&#x27;s just wavy enough that I get terrible snarls, especially at the base of my neck.  </li>
            <li> I had bought another Spornette that was smaller and only had nylon bristles, and I hated it.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> As a child, I had long hair that I loved---I just hated getting it brushed</li>
            <li> Also, the smell is not pleasant and it transfers to my hair.</li>
            <li> now if she loses this one I can deal with the price of the replacement!  </li>
            <li> Poor quality</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is difficult to clean, dust collected at the base of the bristles and it is impossible to get it out</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this brush for someone with thin hair and who has a tender scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Our moms got to talking, and we discovered this brush was the secret.  </li>
            <li> &quot; snarl at the base of the neck is inevitable in the winter---this brush always painlessly does the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> I and my family was spared any future painful hair brushing episodes!  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> I hate the brushes with the ball tips on the bristles but finding one like this in the stores is almost impossible.</li>
            <li> very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> but its awful.</li>
            <li> I did my research about this one before I bought it and needless to say the girl who said the bristles were like Unicorn eyelashes , I 1000% agree with you!!!!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love this brush i order for everyone i know (thanks prime). i think its helped my hair grow too... hair for sure has more sheen. i also own a mason p brush but wasnt going to buy a second one for that much for my work. love this it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> LOVE This brush, it&#x27;s a must have!</li>
            <li> I work in the beauty industry and this brush is the best of the best!! Don&#x27;t pay $100 for the celebrity version! Get the travel size for your purse!!</li>
            <li> Good product. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been needing a new brush. I finally realized my old one that I&#x27;ve used for years was breaking my hair as well as pulling it out. My hair has also been thinning so I chose this one for the smoothness and also how it really gets into my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had this brush for a short while and it is a big difference! My old brush made my fine, thin hair lay even flatter. The LX-1 seems to lift it up to give volume instead of smash it down. My scalp is tingling from all the brushing - in a good way. I&#x27;m hoping this will make for a healthier scalp. I was even able to use it on my wet hair this morning, without any issues. LOVE THIS BRUSH. I&#x27;m going to buy the smaller one to put in my purse. I paid 1.5x the amount charged on amazon, will order from here in the future.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money ! Poor quality especially if you Blowdry your hair with it a funky rubber smell</li>
            <li> I ended up replacing my brush 9 months in - and I should have really replaced it after 6 months of use.  I used it every day; maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have used it with a blowdryer.  I also have thick, straight Asian hair.  All the bristles completely bent, making the brush pretty useless.  So if you use it with a blowdryer, or have thick straight hair like me, I wouldn&#x27;t use this brush.</li>
            <li> very disappointed with this purchase. Not what I expected and would not buy again.  Felt like it was a waste of money. Sorry</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this brush. I used to use the classic Spornette brush like this with the wooden handle (nylon and boar bristle). This one has a slightly bigger surface area, so it goes a little faster with this one for my waist-length hair.</li>
            <li> This brush manages to smooth out my wavy/fine/tangled hair into a voluminous and attractive shape. It has a good amount of boar to nylon ratio, and it&#x27;s comfortable to hold and is attractive in appearance.</li>
            <li> I have never used the Mason Pearson brush, but I can&#x27;t imagine that it can be much better.  This brush a perfect for my very long, medium thickness hair.  The brush is able to smooth my hair whether I wear it straight or wavy.  It also is perfect for my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Despite the pliability of the bristles, it really does get through my thick, coarse hair. I notice my hair lays flatter (I get a lot of flyaways) and that it doesn&#x27;t break off pieces of hair, even when I brush right after towel drying. I have a lot to get done in the mornings, so to me, any time saver is helpful and this brush works quite gently and efficiently wet or dry. It adds a bit more sheen to my hair as well, which is always a nice benefit. Overall, it&#x27;s a great brush and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best brush I have owned. What I&#x27;m sad about is the fact that I spent well over $100 on a pearson mason brush first. I thought it was the best you could own, WRONG. This inexpensive brush is our go to brush now. The pearson sits at the bottom of the hair supply box now. What a waste! You won&#x27;t regret buying this at all. I love it for detangling when wet, too. I use it for all of us and we all have different hair texture. Easy to clean and great grip when using.</li>
            <li> Great brush but a little too pointy if you don&#x27;t have enough hair.</li>
            <li> Well, I have no comparison as this is the first brush I buy in the last 5 years that costs more than $3 but I really like it. I feel like it doesn&#x27;t break my hair, it brushes smoothly and the bristles massage your scalp. Even though I have no comparison I tried to compare the description with the other, more famous brand that makes a similar brush (and sells it for 10 times the price) and the description was almost the same -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have had this brush for a few years and I do not like it so much anymore.&lt;br /&gt;It is difficult to clean, dust collected at the base of the bristles and it is impossible to get it out, I tried a wide comb, tried soap, even emailed the company which was not able to give me a valid solution to my problem (although they suggested soap). Also, the smell is not pleasant and it transfers to my hair.</li>
            <li> Really great brush, for a fraction of the cost of others. I just pulled out the plastic bristles and now have a full on boar bristle brush! Hair loves it.</li>
            <li> I like this brush a lot. It makes my scalp feel good and works well on my short thick hair. HOWEVER, it does NOT have any boar bristles, only nylon bristles.  It is a good brush for the money and serves me well, but I don&#x27;t like the inaccurate description.  Perhaps Spornette put one boar bristle in each \\&quot;tuft\\&quot; of bristles??? I&#x27;ll have to get out my magnifying glass and check. :)</li>
            <li> If you hve curly, coarse, and thick hair you will love this more than the mason pearson popular which is over 10x the price. The handle on this brush unlike the mason pearson and angelo david is thick and not flimsy/thin/ and glass like plastic that breaks in half once dropped on the floor. The grip is looser than the mason pearson which is great for my coarse curly hair and didn&#x27;t give me the splits I got from the mason pearson which ripped through my hair instead of glidding through my hair. I even blow dry my hair wet with this brush and none of the bristles have yet to melt on me. I love this for working product through wet or dry hair as you&#x27;d use  a denman. Though I prefer this over the denman. And I love it to blow dry my hair straight b/c my hair is left smoother w/ no frizz.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  I used to have a similar style brush I purchased at Target that I thought I loved, but I was wrong.  My hair is fine, but I have a LOT of it, and it&#x27;s just wavy enough that I get terrible snarls, especially at the base of my neck.  This brush ever so gently smooths them out without hurting at all.  It is able to get down to my scalp, but my 5-year old brushed my hair one day as an alternative to driving Hot Wheels cars through it, and this brush meant it didn&#x27;t hurt at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: No, this isn&#x27;t a luxury brand name that costs a ton of money, but it does its job well, and does it painlessly, for a small fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9 yo daughter who has very long thick hair.  The brush itself is very lightweight and comfortable to hold.  The bristles are strong enough to get through her hair but are not the straight plastic kind that seem to get tangled and hurt.  There are a lot of bristles which really seems to help get the tangles out.  She loves is and I&#x27;m buying 2 more.  One for me and one for my other daughter!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brush that I have owned.  It really is a high quality, low price option. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> very similiar to a Jean Pierre brush I have had for 20 years.  Got this for my granddaughter who wanted a brush like Grams. She loves this brush.  She had beautiful thick red hair and it is the only brush she uses to get her snarls out.</li>
            <li> I chose this brush because of the reviews it received.  I specifically needed a brush for thick, long hair.  Though I have a tender scalp, I have a lot of hair and I like to &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; the bristles of a brush on my scalp.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this brush for someone with thin hair and who has a tender scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I like that the paddle and the handle are one, molded piece.  My last brush broke right where the paddle and the handle met.  I just purchased this brush and so far, so good.</li>
            <li> This is as good as the mason and pearson that costs so much. I think it is a fabulous product for the money.,</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon the Spornette brush when I was searching for a cheaper alternative to a Mason Pearson.  I really love this brush, it doesn&#x27;t cause my naturally wavy hair to frizz if I decide to brush it out after it air dries. It doesn&#x27;t snag my hair or give me static and it is comfortable to use. This is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for all types of hair! I require all of my clients who have hair extensions to order one for home use. Gentlest detangling brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a replacement brush like this for years. I hate the brushes with the ball tips on the bristles but finding one like this in the stores is almost impossible. I finally looked online and took the chance of finding one like this and I&#x27;m so excited that I did!  My daughters and I have  a lot of long, fine hair. If you have extremely thick hair this may not be the brush for you, not really sure. The bristles are stiff enough to pull through hair but not to stiff that they hurt. The brush has enough give to it that it&#x27;s firm but feels good on your scalp. Love it!!</li>
            <li> The quality is high, but unless you have thin, fine hair, I would pass on this brush. I have medium-to-thick hair and the brush doesn&#x27;t have enough force to actually brush through my hair.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful brushes.  I bought one and reordered more for my 3 grown-up daughters. They really liked them too. Don&#x27;t rip your hair out and gets through thick and thin hair gently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used spornette for about 16 years... and though my old old brush is still kicking, I wanted something new. This is slightly larger than my old one, but the cushion is wonderfully soft - like my old broken in brush. Totally love it! I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive brushes and I just keep coming back!</li>
            <li> This is a high quality hairbrush but it definitely works better on thinner hair.  My wife has thicker hair and she used this but it didn&#x27;t work as well as she wanted it to.  It left her hair frizzy and less controlled than her normal plastic bristled brushes.  So while it feels like a high quality brush, the fact that she couldn&#x27;t use it leaves it sitting around in a box somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you have thinner hair, it feels sturdy as can be.</li>
            <li> Good brush, works as expected.</li>
            <li> I ignored the reviewers because I didn&#x27;t see how a brush could do it but this brush makes my hair really greasy. I can&#x27;t explain why but its awful. Definitely do not buy this.</li>
            <li> I have been so pleased with my Spornette&#x27;s Luxury Cushion hairbrush that I purchased one for my daughter-in-law just before she purchased a Mason Pearson.  Initially, she was skeptical, however, she has been a quick convert and is so happy that she didn&#x27;t spend $150+ for the Mason brush. She has already recommended it to friends.</li>
            <li> This hair brush is so nice and a great deal, especially compared to other comparable hairbrushes in terms of quality. It feels amazing on the scalp of second day hair and instead of making my hair feel puffy and gross like other brushes, it makes my hair feel smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Great brush for the price!</li>
            <li> I have a Mason Pearson Popular Boar Bristle &amp; Nylon brush. My niece loves it. Since she is a tween and I don&#x27;t think would hang onto one for the many years it deserves, I decided to get her one of these because I heard they are very comparable. I tried it and love it!!!!!!!!!! I am buying one for myself. I hate to say it, but it might be better. I don&#x27;t like to take my Mason Pearson when I travel  because I don&#x27;t even want to risk losing a $150 brush, this will be my new go to and travel brush. It is fantastic!!!!! You cannot go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to care about brushes, but this brush is AWESOME. I have long, color treated hair that dries wavy. This brush goes right through it without damaging my hair, even if it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really wanting a second Mason Pearson brush for my purse, but didn&#x27;t want to shell out another $100 bucks. This brush is not an exact match by any means, but is amazing given the price. I recommend this brush for anyone who wants soft, silky hair and a brush that can detangle like nobody&#x27;s business. So happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This looks just like the Mason Pearson brushes that sell for over a hundred dollars -- I can&#x27;t compare the quality since I don&#x27;t own the MP one, but this one works very nicely. I feel like I&#x27;m pampering myself when I brush my hair at night now! I don&#x27;t think it would work very well to style a hair-do, but for detangling and grooming before bed or after drying, this works great.</li>
            <li> I use this brush for brushing my long coated dog.  Best bristle brush I have had for this chore.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice brush, but beware the scratchiness!  The nylon fibers are a little too sharp for those who have a sensitive scalp.  That being said, I kinda like it scratchy.  It&#x27;s pretty great at smoothing and overall making my hair look nice.  The brush itself has a nice rubberized feel to it, too.</li>
            <li> It combs through hair like a Mason Pearson BUT I do not like the rubbery soft plastic handle.  Is it soft plastic or rubber?  Not sure if it&#x27;s going to tun into sticky mess in a few years.  But for the price, it really does comb through my head of fine, but tons of wavy, curly nearly waist length hair.</li>
            <li> Super Amazing Brush! I love how soft it makes my hair. It even brushes good through my daughters mixed tiny curl rough hair without it hurting her.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing. I bought one for myself and one for my son. We both have very thick hair and this brush moves right through it. This brush is very well made and I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of a superior brush but can not afford the superior price...</li>
            <li> I liked the design but was disappointed that the bristles were so hard. I was looking for something softer. i guess one would have to spend more $ for a softer feel.</li>
            <li> Great quality! It brushes nicely through my hair without breaking my hair.</li>
            <li> This brush was bought for someone with very, very, thick hair that knots easily.  It has so far been one of the best brushes for getting out unruly tangles.  It still takes time - just less time.</li>
            <li> Great quality. I have long hair and its perfect to get the rats out before washing.  Feels great on your scalp.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I like the brush because my 100% boar hair brush that I left at a family members house could not even begin to get close to my roots/scalp and it only brushed the top. I bought this in an emergency and had it delivered the same day. However, I do have to say, my thick hair gives this brush a run for its money because where the thickness of the top of my head begins, the brush is unable to reach my scalp fully, and never mind any further down the back of my head.  However, that is expected and it is not the brush&#x27;s fault. Only a spaced comb that detangles is able to accomplish that feat. So, I still have to part-and-brush my hair. But that is okay, with this brush I no longer need the comb which is 100% better for my hair anyway.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! I have had far fewer breaks during brushing without the time consuming effort of combing my hair, which is long and thick. I am very passionate about my hair and that makes me particular about the products that I use and I would definitely recommend this brush. It prevents breakage and also leaves hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Nice brush and price! I have very thick hair and this brush does not add static like I thought it may.</li>
            <li> This comb will make your hair so smooth and silky you won&#x27;t even need to shower again.  My boyfriend was so surprised at how well it combed that he took it and started combing my hair until I had to make him stop.</li>
            <li> I like this brush but it builds so much static frizz that my hair literally stands up in the air, and that happens for days after washing it. I tried heavy conditioners and anti-frizz hair products to solve the problem but nothing helps. I&#x27;ve had other boar bristle brushes that I didn&#x27;t like so much but at least they wouldn&#x27;t make my thick hair a static mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually a review writing kind of person. But, I&#x27;m in love. I have fine, very thick hair. For many years, I used a Spornette Porcupine. I stopped using it because the heads on the nylons bristles would rip the tangles out of my hair. This brush is the perfect solution. Unlike pure boar bristle brushes, it actually gets through all of my hair... No extra pulling. It&#x27;s fantastic. The quality feels good. It is light weight. I just got it a few days ago, but if it lasts like my other Spornette brushes... I&#x27;ll still be enjoying it 10 years from now.</li>
            <li> this is an amazing brush! received it and the Denman and this is by far the best. i have frizzy hair and it gets to the scalp without hurting it and it feels so great. so happy. wanted a mason pearson but didn&#x27;t want to put the money to it</li>
            <li> This brush is really great! I love how it makes my hair so shiny and smooth. I call this my \\&quot;princess\\&quot; brush because it makes my hair look like that of a princess. I love the style of the brush,looks very 1950s. The only downside is that it makes my hair a touch staticky, but its nothing that a little hand smoothing can fix up. Other than that, its a perfect brush!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a brush that was similar to the Mason Pearson brush and after reading the reviews, I decided to try this one.  It is a really good brush with sturdy bristles.  So glad I found this one at such a good price!</li>
            <li> I love brushing my hair at night with this brush, it smooths it out and feels silky! Stimulates the scalp and leaves it tingly. Very well made and simply luxurious for a great price!</li>
            <li> I was blessed with hair that requires very little upkeep. It&#x27;s thick, bone straight, and never tangles or frizzes. It doesn&#x27;t require brushing (the occasional comb through is all the maintenance it needs). However, I&#x27;ve been growing it out recently, and felt like a brush was in order. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this one. It&#x27;s a beautiful looking brush, and very gentle (I&#x27;m very paranoid about hair breakage/damage) on my hair. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have it my budget to splurge on a Mason Pearson Popular brush (a mix of nylon and boar bristles) and this looked to be the next best thing - it can get through my thick hair, with minimal static, and after -/+ two weeks of using has made my hair noticeable shinier. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This Spornette brush was a great bargain. A nice large oval cushion brush with comfortable satin finished handle and mixed nylon boar bristles, great for adding shine by distributing your hair&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
            <li> As a child, I had long hair that I loved---I just hated getting it brushed and it was always a battle.  At the young age of seven, I mentioned in tears that it never hurt to have my hair brushed when staying over at my best friend Jills house.  Our moms got to talking, and we discovered this brush was the secret.  I and my family was spared any future painful hair brushing episodes!  Even growing up in the midwest where a \\&quot;rats nest\\&quot; snarl at the base of the neck is inevitable in the winter---this brush always painlessly does the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward 31 years---that faithful Spornette brush of mine finally met it&#x27;s demise when the plastic on the handle cracked.  I was happy to stock up here!  It&#x27;s truly a tragedy the few times when I&#x27;ve forgotten to pack this brush on trips----and I can&#x27;t bear to use any plastic tipped brushes you find at mass retailers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently been able to \\&quot;pay-it-forward\\&quot; by spreading the word to my friends with young girls who had been battling brushing time.  Peace has been restored to their households, their daughters have beautiful sleek manes---and their moms are benefiting as they use the brushes themselves too!</li>
            <li> Great size for medium thickness hair. I would recommend getting a larger brush if you have very thick hair.  Otherwise, for the price this brush is great quality.</li>
            <li> My wife is constantly losing hair brushes....she was on her third Marilyn uptown brush in less than a year and they cost around 30 bones.  She told me to order another one, but I wasn&#x27;t having it and decided to do some research and came across this one instead.  It cost about third of what the Marilyn brush cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told my wife that I ordered this brush and she was skeptical, but when it came and she tried it out she said it is just as good as her Marilyn Uptown...it just weighed less and was not a wood handle.  She has long medium thickness hair and she said it worked great....now if she loses this one I can deal with the price of the replacement!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Got it for my wife. She likes it just fine, but she says it isn&#x27;t much better than her old super cheap conair brush.</li>
            <li> My 5 star justifies how pleased I am with this brush. I think this is one of the best choice you can make for your hair. It will appreciate your decision.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush. It helps to distribute the natural oil throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mason Pearson brushes for years, because they were the only brushes that could handle my long, thick hair.  Even though I recently purchased a new Mason Pearson brush, I saw this brush advertised and decided to try it as a backup.  As soon as I tried it, I realized that, at one tenth the cost, it works exactly as well.  It really makes its way through my hair, stimulates the scalp and leaves my hair smooth and shiny.  I wish I had found this great brush before I spent so much on a new Mason Pearson.  I now plan to purchase a purse size one as well.</li>
            <li> I have great, long, strong, lovely blonde hair (if I do say so myself) but this brush made my hair &amp;#34;furry&amp;#34; and fuzzy, and just overall gross. It creates static and an undesirable texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for only 4 or 5 months now. It was not used daily and it is already falling apart. The bristles are falling out and then some of them are just breaking off. I&#x27;m disappointed that it didn&#x27;t last long especially since i barely used it. It&#x27;s super cute but not worth the money.</li>
            <li> My family loves this brush so much that this is the 4th one I&#x27;ve purchased. Everybody wants their own!</li>
            <li> I had bought another Spornette that was smaller and only had nylon bristles, and I hated it.  I&#x27;m so glad I gave Spornette another try, I really like this brush.  I have very long, wavy hair and this brush is perfect.  I like the combo of the natural and nylon bristles, too, it&#x27;s soft on my scalp.  It doesn&#x27;t scratch at all like the other brush did.</li>
            <li> I did my research about this one before I bought it and needless to say the girl who said the bristles were like Unicorn eyelashes , I 1000% agree with you!!!!!!!! It doesn&#x27;t pull your hair out, it DOES get all the way down to the scalp of your head, it doesn&#x27;t rip/scratch/tear/irritate your scalp...hands down will NOT go back to my old brush that was just a normal-everyday-nothing special sbrush...I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> perfect combination of soft face and harder bristles make brushing the knots out of my hair  after a  motorcycle ride easy.Works well on my beard also</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic brush.  I had another spornette brush thst finally needed replacement after 20+ years, so I was thrilled to see this brush.  These bristles are a lot softer than my old brush and it smooths and detangles beautifully.  I love this brush and would highly recommend.  I have long fine hair that tangles and this is a real winner to smooth and shine.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome hairbrush if you have medium to long, medium or thick hair. Mine is long, medium-thick, and straight or wavy. I blow dry it most days. Most brushes are either too stiff (like a vent brush or porcupine brush) or else too soft to get through my hair and lift it (example of this problem is with a boar bristle brush). This is the perfect in-between brush. The bristles are soft against your scalp but have just enough stiffness to get into the under-layers of hair and separate the hair. I already purchased a second one to have on hand, and also the travel size one.</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews I thought this would be the brush for me. Sadly it is not. As far as detangling it works fine, but so do my other hair brushes. Every time I use it my hair becomes extremely staticy &amp; I have to spray it and recomb it with my other brush to fix it. I&#x27;ve washed it, and tried spraying the bristles with this aloe/water spray I use &amp; it still causes static. I have medium/thick very long straight hair,  which does not normally become staticy at all.  Also, after the 2nd time using it 4 of the bristles have already fallen out. I treat my things very well, and did nothing that should have caused this. So, this purchase was a waste of time and money for me. I&#x27;m going to give it to my mom to try, but won&#x27;t be surprised if it ends up in the trash:/</li>
            <li> My wife said that this brush is great and she is hard to please.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. I needed a much fuller boars hair brush and larger paddle.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight, fine hair, but lots of it....and was having a hard time finding a good hair brush that didn&#x27;t pull all my hair out when I brushed it. I was using a great paddle brush that I loved, but it was losing it&#x27;s luster and was kind of old....bought brush after brush with no luck, till I came across this one! I love it. It&#x27;s gentle and does the job. If you have thick hair or textured hair, I would probably stay away from this brush as it probably won&#x27;t do the job, but if you have fine and straight hair, this is the brush for you!!!!</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s shredding my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t smooth as well as a Mason Pearson.  I need to stick to the classics.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair brush and I use it everyday day. The only problem is that it has a very strong plastic smell. Other than that it is very good quality!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush.  My hair tends to get very tangled, and this brush definitely detangles without hurting my head.  It also feels like it gives my scalp a massage every time I use it!</li>
            <li> Have been on a seemingly never-ending search for a good brush that won&#x27;t cost me $100 (Mason Pearson, I&#x27;m looking at you) and this is IT.  I have long, fine hair but a lot of it, and this detangles it easily, makes it look spectacular, plus massages my scalp and doesn&#x27;t hurt when it does so (I have a sensitive scalp &amp; *so* many brushes feel like stinging needles--horrible).  Can&#x27;t recommend enough, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing for this price ; so gentle on the scalp yet stimulating and effective.  Perfect!  Don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
            <li> Comparable to any high end brush. I&#x27;ve used my Spornette for years and it&#x27;s easily cleaned and works just as well as the day I got it. It&#x27;s great at redistributing oils, going through tangles gently, and quickly giving my hair shine and body.</li>
            <li> I shy away from these kind of bristles. I have thick curly hair. Have always used the brushes with more sparse bristles and the little balls on the end. This brush works GREAT on my hair all the way to the scalp. Leaves hair very soft and detangles. I need to purchase a backup!</li>
            <li> Love this brush. I have medium thick, medium long hair. This brushes through easily and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a different Spornette brush for years and I like this one even better.</li>
            <li> Bristles hurt. Does the job but they feel sharp.</li>
            <li> I had an M-P brush for a very long time and never thought anything would be as good, even after it started losing tufts. It was smaller than my new Spornette, too. I think I hung on to it for sentimental reasons. Anyway, the new Spornette is fantastic. Much bigger, feels wonderful, does a great job on my hip-length hair and really massages my scalp. I haven&#x27;t actually *enjoyed* brushing my hair for awhile. I can&#x27;t believe I got a brush this good for this price. Maybe it won&#x27;t last 30 years like the M-P, but I probably won&#x27;t live that long anyway, lol.</li>
            <li> Best brush for the money x100. My daughter loves it, my GF loves it... It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush for healthy scalp and shiny hair! Was a Denman loyalist until this came along - great purchase.</li>
            <li> I used this brush everyday for blow drying but I was expecting more. I still need to use my other brush to get through the hair. This brush seems to only brush the top layers of my hair.</li>
            <li> She needs this type of brush due to her long hair.  Works great on her hair and detangles quicker than usual. Which is the point.  Not that I know anything about hair since I&#x27;m a cueball myself.  But I do style my face hairdos.</li>
