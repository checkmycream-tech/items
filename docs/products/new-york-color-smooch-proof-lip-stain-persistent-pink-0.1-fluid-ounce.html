    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Its bright and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>stars because it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>Color was great and the stain lasted most of the work day.  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I wanted a bubblegum color (which is what it looked like in the pic), I don&#x27;t look nice with any reddish hue on my lips</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Was not even able to get any color from the tip with a drop of water added as another user suggested.  </li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>Finally, a stain that works as a precision lip liner and provides excellent coverage and color without drying out my lips.  </li>
            <li>I already ordered 2 more since my Mom and bff both want one too.</li>
            <li>It is great for a natural look, apply over chapstick so your lips are moist.</li>
            <li>kind of smells fun too.</li>
            <li>I love this color, but compared to another one I bought it ran out really</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think this is going to give you bright pink lips.</li>
            <li>Great concept, but don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, worth the couple of dollars.  </li>
            <li>I had a cheap cover-girl product like this that was better and seemed to last forever.</li>
            <li>I love this color, but compared to another I bought from a major chain store it ran out incredibly quickly.</li>
            <li>then I had initially expected it to be, however I decided to use a bright pink lipliner under it over the entire lip and when I put it over it it turned out gorgeous and lasted for many hours like that.</li>
            <li>Would be worth paying a little more for a better brand though...</li>
            <li>It just makes your lips slightly darken which is great for lips like mine that don&#x27;t have much color in them.</li>
            <li>I was able to barely use it 1 time and</li>
            <li>I was able to snap it back on and it still worked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than the color I do like the product, it works very well.</li>
            <li>I am white with light skin tone.</li>
            <li>but the colors are very translucent.</li>
            <li>This was amazing as far as the color and lasting power went, but barely lasted a week.  </li>
            <li>The coverage runs dry quickly</li>
            <li>I love the color makes my lips look naturally pink and it  stays on long,  if you don&#x27;t eat and don&#x27;t rub it off.</li>
            <li>This is a natural looking lip stain.</li>
            <li>At least it goes on easy &amp; looks fairly natural which is what I did want.</li>
            <li>The color is absorbed like a marker upside down so to prevent it drying so you can apply it</li>
            <li>so keeping it in my purse is a waste if I want to quickly apply.</li>
            <li>I like the product overall, but this one must have been old.</li>
            <li>Never dry lips and colors say on</li>
            <li>Color barely showed and tip is dry so barely an color is released.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I use this stain pretty regularly, but it doesn&#x27;t last long. :/</li>
            <li> It did not last that long.</li>
            <li> My three complaints are it&#x27;s not long lasting &amp; also not much product in the tube itself.</li>
            <li> I like using this, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not drying at all and lasts surprisingly long.</li>
            <li> As others have stated, this product was dry upon receipt.  </li>
            <li> I tested it on my skin &amp; it was sort of a rosey pink with a slight hint of red, which is not what i wanted.</li>
            <li> I just dab a little lip gloss and the color lasts several hours.</li>
            <li> Persistent Pink delivers a saturated matte flush of rosy pink to your lips.</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally.  </li>
            <li> The marker tip dried out even with the cap closed and</li>
            <li> I recommend storing it tip side down.</li>
            <li> so I have to put the tip facing down before I can finish covering my lips.</li>
            <li> no amount of wetting it or storing with the tip down would save it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you must keep it upside down...</li>
            <li> These $5 lip stains are hidden gems.</li>
            <li> So apparently it&#x27;s a guessing game anyways of what color it will be on your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> This product ended up disappointing me somewhat.</li>
            <li> Too bad the stain status on</li>

            <li> Love it i just wish it would last longer</li>
            <li> This product ended up disappointing me somewhat. It was way lighter then I had initially expected it to be, however I decided to use a bright pink lipliner under it over the entire lip and when I put it over it it turned out gorgeous and lasted for many hours like that.</li>
            <li> I like using this, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on long. I have to reapply it often. This is my second tube so I do like it. My three complaints are it&#x27;s not long lasting &amp; also not much product in the tube itself. Also I dropped it and the tip came off. I was able to snap it back on and it still worked. I recommend storing it tip side down. The coverage runs dry quickly so I have to put the tip facing down before I can finish covering my lips. I do like it though.</li>
            <li> I love this color, but compared to another one I bought it ran out really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It kind of smells fun too. :/</li>
            <li> These $5 lip stains are hidden gems. Persistent Pink delivers a saturated matte flush of rosy pink to your lips. It&#x27;s not drying at all and lasts surprisingly long. Go out and buy one of these!</li>
            <li> Foolishness..waisted my money...would never buy this again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the color at all. I tested it on my skin &amp; it was sort of a rosey pink with a slight hint of red, which is not what i wanted. I wanted a bubblegum color (which is what it looked like in the pic), I don&#x27;t look nice with any reddish hue on my lips so yeah, not going to be using this. I did try it on my lips too and it just made them look reddish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the color I do like the product, it works very well. At least it goes on easy &amp; looks fairly natural which is what I did want. I guess I&#x27;ll just be choosing the shades in store, but actually, the tube color is different from what showed up on my lips because I compared them. So apparently it&#x27;s a guessing game anyways of what color it will be on your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because it&#x27;s a good product I just don&#x27;t like the color.</li>
            <li> This is a natural looking lip stain. It just makes your lips slightly darken which is great for lips like mine that don&#x27;t have much color in them. I am white with light skin tone. It is great for a natural look, apply over chapstick so your lips are moist. Don&#x27;t think this is going to give you bright pink lips.</li>
            <li> As others have stated, this product was dry upon receipt.  I was able to barely use it 1 time and after that no product. Was not even able to get any color from the tip with a drop of water added as another user suggested.  Great concept, but don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I love the color makes my lips look naturally pink and it  stays on long,  if you don&#x27;t eat and don&#x27;t rub it off.</li>

            <li> I use this stain pretty regularly, but it doesn&#x27;t last long. :/</li>
            <li> Color barely showed and tip is dry so barely an color is released.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother. After about 4 uses the tip started to fall out. The color is absorbed like a marker upside down so to prevent it drying so you can apply it you must keep it upside down...so keeping it in my purse is a waste if I want to quickly apply. Too bad the stain status on but the colors are very translucent.</li>
            <li> Applicator did not work properly.</li>
            <li> After trying over a dozen different lip stains, I came across this one as an \\&quot;add on\\&quot;.  Figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it out at such a low price.  Finally, a stain that works as a precision lip liner and provides excellent coverage and color without drying out my lips.  I just dab a little lip gloss and the color lasts several hours.</li>
            <li> I love this color, but compared to another I bought from a major chain store it ran out incredibly quickly. I couldn&#x27;t preserve it by adding water. I like the product overall, but this one must have been old.</li>
            <li> It did not last that long. I had a cheap cover-girl product like this that was better and seemed to last forever.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Its bright and beautiful.  I already ordered 2 more since my Mom and bff both want one too.</li>
            <li> It doesnt last long, additionally it has odd smell and is very matte so u have to gloss it up</li>
