            <li>I&#x27;m impressed. :)</li>
            <li>I am so excited to tell everyone about this product!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the magic pads!</li>
            <li>Performance wise</li>
            <li>they were also surprisingly good. .</li>
            <li>I feel so good about myself</li>
            <li>I loved them once my face went through the purging phase and this pulled out even under the skin acne.</li>
            <li>And I LOVED that it eventually helped with ingrown hairs on my chin.</li>
            <li>and it does a mostly good job on those.</li>
            <li>These are good.</li>
            <li>Good value</li>
            <li>had heard good things about these pads, I decided to try them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to cover my acne with make up anymore because my skin looks so good after a week of using these.</li>
            <li>Good product, five stars.</li>
            <li>People are always amazed that I&#x27;m not wearing any make up because of how good my complexion looks.  </li>
            <li>and I do need to use a good moisturizer after using the pads.</li>
            <li>Not a cure but saw really good results.</li>
            <li>It seems like it&#x27;s as good as putting just water on your face.</li>
            <li>People have even commented on how good my skin looks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oil control is fair</li>
            <li>Good product  </li>
            <li>but id say a good 50% has.</li>
            <li>This product is a good replacement for my toner.</li>
            <li>Understand that the pads used for this product are fairly abrasive, this may or not be to your liking - I like it.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and fantastic customer service.</li>
            <li>and I felt like they were trying to buy a good review.</li>
            <li>They are really awesome and super affordable.</li>
            <li>These pads are very refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the pads.  </li>
            <li>Feels great using them as they aren&#x27;t loaded with alcohol like most astringent pads.  </li>
            <li>The Magic Pads are a great addition to my skin care routine.  </li>
            <li>While there are some great exfoliants out there, there is nothing on the market as convenient as The Magic Pads.</li>
            <li>however, The Magic Pads worked great to minimize any post-shave breakout.</li>
            <li>During times of stress I often break out and these did a great job of immediately stopping the breakout and preventing more.</li>
            <li>Works great, my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with the improvement of my skin.</li>
            <li>Love these as they have made a great difference to my skintone...</li>
            <li>Love the magic pads!!</li>
            <li>Looking forward to more improvement!! :)</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>This product really is magic!</li>
            <li>Additionally, my complexion has never looked better!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>The magic pads have made a noticeable difference in my complexion!</li>

            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t recommend them any more for clearing up skin!</li>
            <li>I was bummed when I ran out but immediately ordered two more jars!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>One swipe, after I wash, before I lotion, once a day, and my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li>Love the Maic Pads!</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE them!</li>
            <li>Combo of the pads and coconut oil, my face as never looked and felt better!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s improved my skin way better than Proactive or Nutragina!</li>
            <li>I do feel like the best results were in the first week and if nothing else it was an non-irritating remover of any remaining makeup on my cheeks after washing my face.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than it has in years!</li>
            <li>Just like magic!</li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a problem with acne to begin with, so I can&#x27;t speak to their effectiveness for that, but they exfoliate nicely</li>
            <li>I am an Esthetician and was looking for a glycolic pad that would be good for most everyone.</li>

            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t meant to be used as makeup remover wipes, but more like astringent wipes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what these truly magic pads do for my skin in a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Magic Pads for over two months</li>
            <li>My skin feels softer with better texture</li>
            <li>Love &#x27;em.</li>
            <li>Havent had any more breakouts since I started using.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Magic Pads.</li>
            <li>In the morning I use a noncomedogenic wash in the shower and Magic Pads after.</li>
            <li>When I use the Magic Pads, there is still dirt on my face.</li>
            <li>These actually worked, which is marvelous.</li>
            <li>I love the tingle sensation when I use them.  </li>
            <li>I love using this product and my skin has never felt smoother and softer since I began using The Magic Pads.  </li>
            <li>Nothing magic about them</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re ok</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>The name says it all,  it works like magic.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not to say they didn&#x27;t work at all, just that they didn&#x27;t work any better.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years, and I am so in love.</li>
            <li>My friend told me about magic pads</li>
            <li>Nothing worked magic like magic pads.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>The Magic Pads are okay.  </li>
            <li>Love the pads and planning on continuing to use them.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I came across these.</li>
            <li>but I think I&#x27;ll keep using them to make sure it stays that way.</li>
            <li>And I take them with me no matter where I go in the country! :)</li>
            <li>I have been using every day since then, and my skin has cleared, and looks better than ever.</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t want their night time cleansing and moisturizing routine to be easier and produced better skin ?</li>
            <li>after two weeks my skin looked and felt even better.</li>
            <li>love magic pads</li>
            <li>I have used about 15 pads already and it has worked a charm on my face and has made me even more confidence.</li>
            <li>But I just wasn&#x27;t impressed enough to buy it again.</li>
            <li>Love&#x27;em</li>
            <li>Magic pads is a skin-saver.</li>
            <li>The Magic Pads control oiliness without drying out.</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed these.</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t order more Magic Pads and within 3 days my skin began to break out again.</li>
            <li>Be sure to order these a couple days before you run out because you don&#x27;t want to miss a day (but shipping to my apartment</li>
            <li>I am in love with the magic pads, they have saved my life and my wallet.</li>
            <li>(most products just don&#x27;t do anything)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, Clearasil, and many others and this product</li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li>You can fo your face knees elbows and heels for sure.</li>
            <li>I am for sure adding this to my regimen.</li>
            <li>I used most of the container, once or twice a day, and didnt experience anything magical.</li>
            <li>I bought Magic Pads hoping for help with my skin after having my son.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended them to everyone in my family, and could literally not give more of an endorsement of a product.</li>
            <li>I am a master esthetician so skincare is something I know and love.</li>
            <li>EXCEPT that I use BHA and I broke out after using Magic Pads.</li>
            <li>I get better results from a 5 dollar jar of stridex pads.</li>
            <li>It seems to exfoliate my skin and help my moisturizer work better.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling softer and looking like it has a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>Been using the magic pads for a week now.</li>
            <li>Thank you Magic Pads</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a life-time acne sufferer (been on two rounds of Accutane and many OTC options as well).</li>
            <li>Literally, my skin felt better WITHIN 24 HOURS.</li>
            <li>:)).  </li>
            <li>I really love.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I started using Magic Pads, I thought &#x27;what do I have to lose?&#x27;</li>
            <li>freaking love this product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with sensitivities, and i love the way my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>Like many others I heard Bianca del Rio was using this product</li>
            <li>Never again will I use one of these magic pads.</li>
            <li>The Magic Pads helped soothe my irritated skin.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the Magic Pads, and they work.</li>
            <li>I love how they make my skin so smooth!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these pads.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best product out there!</li>
            <li>I have recommended The Magic Pads to all of my friends and have bought them for family members.  </li>
            <li>Effective but cheap.</li>
            <li>I love they way the pads take all the dirt off as well.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>So much more convenient than face wash and doesn&#x27;t have the alcohol smell and drying of acne pads.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s an all-in-one product.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you grab one pad and not two.</li>
            <li>The Magic Pads were recommended to me by my daughter.</li>
            <li>This works way better than my proactive trial.</li>
            <li>The Magic Pads smoothed them out within 3 days.  </li>
            <li>Give The Magic Pads a shot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This, like most everything, didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>It is more about the regimen itself than the products they sell</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a big statement from me as I&#x27;m rarely impressed with beauty products.</li>
            <li>These pads worked better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried for acne.</li>
            <li>Glad I could return it.</li>
            <li>These pads didn&#x27;t seem too magical to me.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a lot better than the salicylic acid pads I see in stores all the time.</li>
            <li>I love the exfoliating side.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using The Magic Pads for about 6 months</li>
            <li>And now during the summer time, I don&#x27;t want to have &amp;#34;backne&amp;#34; when wearing cute summer dresses.</li>
            <li>My skin was never terrible but as soon as I started using these my skin cleared up and has stayed that way!</li>
            <li>Make your skin so smooth and glowing!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to see more reduction in my acne breakouts, but hopefully that will come with more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will purchase again and again now :)</li>
            <li>These pads work great,much better results.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t tell you how much I love these.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love these and have even raved about them on my blog.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really enjoyed these...</li>
            <li>I see a difference in my complexion for the better.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>It is also not as drying as many products.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of using Magic Pads, there were no improvements on my face.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more pads soon.</li>
            <li>I absolutely Love these Pads ❤</li>
            <li>After using Magic Pads for one day I noticed the tissue was breaking up.</li>
            <li>Thank you Bianca Del Rio..and THE MAGIC PADS...</li>
            <li>I love these Magic pads.  </li>
            <li>My teenage daughter is using them too and is so happy with the results!  </li>
            <li>My makeup goes on easier, looks better, and stays on longer.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Seems fabulous!</li>
            <li>I love how this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I really do love this product.</li>
            <li>Been using it for a couple of months now and love what I see in the mirror...</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have been using this for a week and our faces look better.</li>
            <li>Store bought products worked hit and miss, but mostly miss.</li>
            <li>The magic pads have been a relief for my wife and I because it has taken the guess work out of helping our teens control /</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li>i love the THE MAGIC PADS ..</li>
            <li>Again if its good for the drag queens its good for me!</li>
            <li>Best acne treatment ive had so far after using the original proactiv line, X-Out, acne</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, and so far, so good!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Smell is nice, not too strong, not too medicine like; it&#x27;s a light refreshing smell.  </li>
            <li>They make my skin feel freshy and clean !&amp;#34; So I have just ordered 2 more jars.  </li>
            <li>, so I use w couple of these magic pads and my face feels clean!</li>
            <li>These are great and easy AND gentle.</li>
            <li>Magic Pads feel very mild and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more convenient than glycolic acid in a vial, but since it&#x27;s not as strong, would be applied much more often.  </li>
            <li>Looking forward to clear beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>The results I&#x27;ve seen since using them are pretty good.</li>
            <li>or so it does pretty good</li>
            <li>Because a lot of people do see pretty good results with these, I figured I&#x27;d give them a try.</li>
            <li>I have used benzoil p. for years with pretty good results, but I decided to give a glycolic acid product a try - this one.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend The Magic Pads!!</li>
            <li>These are nothing more than just cotton pads soaked in rubbing alcohol with a cool name!</li>
            <li>I had sensitive and sometimes acne-prone skin, and I think The Magic Pads are great.</li>
            <li>That makes me worry about all the good reviews here, who wouldn&#x27;t want free stuffs right?   </li>
            <li>Guess it&#x27;s fine with me :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other pads before the magic pads and wasn&#x27;t really impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>I can get more uses from My La Roche Posay Effaclear Clarifying Solution and a better clean.</li>
            <li>I have just started using the pads, but I am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>I love Bianca Del Rio, which is where I heard about these, but I didn&#x27;t notice a difference to my skin, unless you have to use like 5 pads each time, which would not be cheap.  </li>
            <li>It was worth the purchase as it did exactly what I was expecting with great results.</li>
            <li>tried another brand of pads with a higher concentration of glycol acid, just to see if I liked something better.</li>
            <li>They are great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Love that there are organic ingredients and its cruelty free.</li>
            <li>I find it very helpful to use a good exfoliating face scrub each day helps as well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and good product.</li>
            <li>They work just as good as proactive but are much cheaper.</li>
            <li>They were nicely saturated and just the right size for my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I still, on occasion, break out, but when I use Magic Pads, the redness is significantly reduce and the heal time is practically doubled.</li>
            <li>I swear by The Magic pads for a FRESH FACE!</li>
            <li>Tried this for the first time and love it!</li>
            <li>I used to do demos for organic skincare products, so I was familiar with the ingredients in Magic Pads.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re almost too easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easily irritated by strong products.</li>
            <li>These pads are easy to use and accomplish just what I need the, to.</li>
            <li>I definitely love that the ingredients are clean.</li>
            <li>They are easy to pack with me</li>
            <li>I found it to be too strong for my face.</li>
            <li>They are very gentle but highly effective</li>
            <li>Good so far!!</li>
            <li>Its amazing , after the first day I saw results .</li>
            <li>Everyone who tries these pads falls in love with them and for good reason!  </li>
            <li>From the ingredients down to the texture of the pads, everything would have been perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Arrived fine.</li>
            <li>Magic Pads restored balance, glow, and general happiness to my skin.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and works better than drugstore brands</li>
            <li>and so it&#x27;s super embarrassing to still have acne!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was quick - no problems whatsoever!</li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s thanks to Magic Pads!</li>
            <li>These really are magic!</li>
            <li>Absolutely awesome…doesn&#x27;t cause dryness or irritation - makes skin lovely!</li>
            <li>Thanks Magic Pads!</li>
            <li>My skins tone is more even and super smooth</li>
            <li>But MAGIC does happen when you stay consistent with them!</li>
            <li>and I can tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Thank you for having such a great product available and for making it affordable.</li>
            <li>but cos of the willow bark and the light usage of glycolic acid</li>
            <li>I use one at night before bed and they are gentle yet effective.  </li>
            <li>I am cheap when it comes to buying products like this and never believe in the claims they make.</li>
            <li>They are also great at preventing future breakouts!</li>
            <li>Just impatiently waiting for them to arrive, lol!</li>
            <li>Its fantastic and</li>
            <li>I definitely see improvements, and I&#x27;m really happy</li>
            <li>I experienced a noticeable reduction in acne, facial redness, and pore size.</li>
            <li>The pads keep my face acne free and have done wonders with removing any scarring I had from when I did have issues with acne.  </li>
            <li>Also they sent me an email saying if I rate this 5 stars they would send me another one for free .</li>
            <li>Not only do they save time, but my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this great in ages.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why this product has such great reviews when it&#x27;s not doing anything at all.</li>
            <li>I love it amazing soft and smooth pads</li>
            <li>free..</li>
            <li>It was smooth and soothing.</li>
            <li>Feels like a good product, but causes mild-to-medium irritation for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin, and I was a bit worried about using these, but I had read some good reviews about them,</li>
            <li>Since then, I have “forced” so many friends to use them as they are awesome!</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m loving the magic pads.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had good skin, but the Magic Pads take it to the next level.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally found something easy and effective for clearing and renewing my skin!</li>
            <li>I ordered more, and it cleared right up.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Magic Pads!</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for you, magic pads!</li>
            <li>Magic pads smell nice and leave my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Magic Pads have helped calm my acne breaks outs and has significantly cut the amount of oil on my face.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li>Leaves my face oil free and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I like using this type of product because it&#x27;s quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy and quick to use too.</li>
            <li>With the arrival of hot weather here, these feel really refreshing.</li>
            <li>Original Review:</li>
            <li>I feel they clean my skin very well and are quick to use, which is nice at night.</li>
            <li>I feel like my comexion has significantly improved</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for two months and wouldn&#x27;t exactly call them &amp;#34;magic.&amp;#34; The magic seems to wear off.</li>
            <li>The number blackheads on my cheeks and nose have dropped significantly.</li>
            <li>I originally bought these just because Bianca Del Rio posted about them.</li>
            <li>Will buy more soon ;)</li>
            <li>On that recommendation I picked up this product and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve used it more consistently</li>
            <li>They are SO worth the money!</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased the aztec clay with it but realized he doesn&#x27;t even need to use that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the pads for a month now, and they have significantly improved the quality of my skin.</li>
            <li>&amp; I have already seen a significant improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>Well I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>They are effective but gentle and really helped with stress breakouts!!</li>
            <li>Normally I buy products and end up being less than impressed with them, but I LOVE these pads.</li>
            <li>In just a week it cleared up spots that I had and my skin looks and feels clean.</li>
            <li>clean--</li>
            <li>I can feel confident that I wont get any breakouts from sweat on my forehead, and its such a nice feeling.</li>
            <li>but it did keep ny face clean</li>
            <li>I think that one of my issues is that my skin is so oily that it never gets to exfoliate properly on its own - Magic Pads has allowed a rejuvenating process to begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My pores feel clean, and my skin feels refreshed after using them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had my face be so clean.</li>
            <li>great product no complaints...been using it 2 weeks no new out breaks and skin looking refreshed.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for wrinkles afer watching a Dr. Oz show about Glycolic acid and absolutely love it, it has shrunk my large pores on my nose and smoothed my face.  </li>
            <li>The queen was right!</li>
            <li>There was absolutely nothing special or magic about these pads.</li>
            <li>Not too much tingle just refreshing.</li>
            <li>just so glad that after years of dealing with acne, I found a product that can keep my face so much clearer.</li>
            <li>They leave your skin feeling super clean and tighter.</li>
            <li>The real reason I know The Magic Pads really work are through the compliments I have received from friends and family about how much better my face looks since I started using them.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like there is anything on the pads, no stickiness, no stinging or burning of the skin, it really does seem like magic-</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>Good at removing excess dirt but definitely not &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I personally know someone who was paid to write a good review about this product.</li>
            <li>The true test for me was post-shaved skin...</li>
            <li>Love them they really make a difference.</li>
            <li>I work over a deep fryer for a good perron of my day and these make my skin feel fresh and clean</li>
            <li>Just be sure to use a good moisturizer as they have ingredients that are a little bit drying.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it and cannot live without it!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a tremendous difference in my skin</li>
            <li>Purchased for my son, has helped tremendously....</li>
            <li>Face felt super cleansed after using pad.</li>
            <li>My main issue was that I had MANY breakouts along my forehead</li>
            <li>I was AMAZED who quickly the pads worked.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more, but I wish there were more than 50 in each bottle.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about these at first, but they really seem to work!  </li>
            <li>They arrived really quickly.</li>
            <li>I feel it would help those with mild skin problems.</li>
            <li>He has mild acne</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin that gets irritated very easily and these pads have worked wonders.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for the magic pads.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for the Magic Pads.</li>
            <li>A person that spends time putting on tons of make-up knows the right products to keep their pores clean.</li>
            <li>Overall very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>After seeing such good reviews I was hoping for a near magical experience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using First Aid Beauty&#x27;s Facial Radiance (very pricey!), and found these Magic Pads to be an amazing substitute.</li>
            <li>It reduced my acne greatly and faded my black spots</li>
            <li>I wish I could say I experienced &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; results with these pads, but my daughter and I both used them and didn&#x27;t find them any more effective than similar pads we had been using by Neutrogenia, just 3x more expensive.  </li>
            <li>Loved the way there is no burn and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too strong and my face wasn&#x27;t really irritated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It helps her easily control her acne and is much easier for me to get her to use then anythings else.</li>
            <li>You need a good mousterizer as they do dry your skin.</li>
            <li>My self esteem is so high right now. :)</li>
            <li>Overall, this is without a doubt a very good product that I highly recommend whether you have acne or not, these pads will definitely make your face look better.</li>
            <li>This product is nothing short of MAGIC!</li>
            <li>It has helped her soo much!!</li>
            <li>Love this product so far!</li>
            <li>Saw results after first use!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li>Works pretty well!</li>
            <li>I have tan oily skin fairly blemish free except for a little mild rosacea and a sun spot.  </li>
            <li>After that, I use one of these pads, and then I lightly apply pure tea tree oil to my face.</li>
            <li>one advantage i do like about these is that the pads are a bit thicker and are great little exfoliaters.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend The Magic Pads for all skin types, but especially for those of us with combination skin; it does a great job at controlling oily areas and moisturizing dry ones!</li>
            <li>They are no longer textured and exfoliating, they are just smooth pads and don&#x27;t seem to be the real deal at all.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it cleans my face and leave my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>I used these for about 2 weeks and didn&#x27;t really see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, I have my complexion back!!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>but they are totally worth it.</li>
            <li>The pads are convenient and clean off makeup and oil nicely but did seem to dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>The Magic Pads seem to be just the thing to keep my skin calm and clear.</li>
            <li>It does exfoliate well when the product is fresh.</li>
            <li>having tried everything from ProActiv to Accutane, this honestly has been the only thing that has dramatically and permanently cleared up my acne.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>and I had zits popping up more frequently.</li>
            <li>I also love using this product on my chest and shoulders when I get breakouts there, it really gets rid of them fast.</li>
            <li>Theses are named well because they really are magic for someone who has struggled with acne and scarring her whole life.</li>
            <li>They work magic on my 30 year old skin, making it cleaner and brighter.</li>
            <li>I am 72 years old and have a graveyard of lotions, serums, oils from so many companies I&#x27;ve lost count.</li>
            <li>clear, smooth and free of breakouts.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old son and I have used the Magic Pads now for a year.</li>
            <li>But, if it does work, what is that worth to you?</li>
            <li>This product is simple and effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it, trust me.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I was a bit skeptical about this product even though it has great reviews, yet I can assure you it works wonders.</li>
            <li>They are powerful, and don&#x27;t burn.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got super sensitive skin, but the Magic Pads are very gentle while still clearing up my blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Glycolic acid pads and these are great - gentle on my face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using Magic Pads for about a month and my blemishes are significantly reduced and the discoloration is diminished.</li>
            <li>I needed a skin product that would clean the impurities and leave it soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Improved my skin right away.</li>
            <li>It was the right thing to do.</li>
            <li>If you want not only a pimple free face but a blackhead free face with smaller pores buy The Magic Pads!</li>
            <li>My daughter has started using it and after 2 weeks it cleared her up all the way-so everyone&#x27;s skin is different-with all the positive reviews though, it works!</li>
            <li>Since using them, I noticed a positive change in my complexion and no breakouts!</li>
            <li>have found that I have to consistently use the pads 1-2 times a day to keep clear, healthy skin.</li>
            <li>First day, I had a more evened tone, smaller  pores, clean and fresh face.  </li>
            <li>I used it once or twice a day on my whole face, neck and chest after cleansing, and sometimes used it alone to clean my skin.</li>
            <li>These little things are amazing!</li>
            <li>While it has helped prevent major breakouts, my face seems more bumpy.</li>
            <li>Poreless, crystal clear and clean!</li>
            <li>They have even gotten rid of a dry spot that I have never been able to tackle before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Bianca Del Rio for your recommendation!</li>
            <li>I was skeptical but after reading so many great reviews I thought it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>After using them for about two months i am noticing a decrease in appearance of fine lines and it has never cause any breakout or reaction and i am very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Within the first week we saw dramatic results without redness and burning and at a great price!!!</li>
            <li>My skin felt clean, smooth, and a little more taught.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a huge acne problem, but my new workout routine was leaving my skin blotchy</li>
            <li>At first I did one a day, but when I knew I was going to breakout like right before my period</li>
            <li>Very soothing and really keep your face toned and smooth.  </li>
            <li>After a couple days of using them (one per day), my face was completely clear and has been easily maintained since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked them so much that I ordered another tub 2 weeks later b/c</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>I think the pads and the oil have actually helped me the most, and my skin has started to look really soft, bright, and younger.</li>
            <li>I will continue using this product and the shipping time was very fast.</li>
            <li>It was okay for me , i did not really notice any significant change</li>
            <li>other day I got an email that said if I leave a 5 star review on Amazon they&#x27;ll send me a free jar of Magic Pads.</li>
            <li>how young I look And how clean and fresh</li>
            <li>I have cystic acne due to PCOS and they have made a huge difference!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend washing your face first and then using the wipes.</li>
            <li>My skin is healthier, brighter and younger looking because of Magic Pads.  </li>
            <li>and my skin looks and feels better overall.</li>
            <li>I love the simple ingredients.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>Thanks to BDR!</li>
            <li>I am now a regular buyer of magic pads</li>
            <li>Currently, my face is acne free!</li>
            <li>I will definitely get more as I have seen the difference since I started using them.</li>
            <li>I first started using pads three times a day, and although I didn&#x27;t see results immediately, I continued trying them.</li>
            <li>After 3 months, my face was finally clear, and my skin was so smooth.</li>
            <li>first time in my life...</li>
            <li>Even after cleansing, I&#x27;m surprised with what these mighty pads pick up.</li>
            <li>I use it first thing in the morning and then before bedtime.  </li>
            <li>The glow to my skin is noticeable to the point that people compliment me on my skin on a regular basis, and mention the healthy shine.  </li>
            <li>after the first week i noticed my skin getting smoother</li>
            <li>my skin is so much better , my pores are smaller and all cleaned up.</li>
            <li>I heard about this product from Big Fat Vegan Radio, and I&#x27;m SO glad I did.</li>
            <li>Product does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>Nothing MAGIC here - No different than any of the pads you can pickup at Walmart for $7 or $10</li>
            <li>My teenage son and I have been sharing our Magic Pads and we&#x27;ve both seen improvements.  </li>
            <li>They must have left out the Magic in my jar.</li>
            <li>Left my face glowing. :-)</li>
            <li>I look forward to wiping my face with these pads since they get so much oil off and leave me feeling refreshed!</li>
            <li>These pads leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Bianca Del Rio for the recommendation!</li>
            <li>This works really well!</li>
            <li>They work significantly better than the $40 glycolic acid potions that I tried before; once I use the pads several days go by when I don&#x27;t have to use them, and my skin is radiant and glowing.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Bianca del Rio for posting about them!</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin soft and smooth to the touch with no redness - safe to use daily on face and neck without drying your skin out too!</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>At first I broke out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve introduced them into my already slightly complicated skincare regimen, and they work perfectly as a pre-treatment step.</li>
            <li>then waiting 15 min to put on a 2.5 peroxide lotion, then 15 more and putting on a regular moisturizing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I defintely need a product with a higher concentration of glycolic acid.</li>
            <li>I really like them!</li>
            <li>It did not improve my scars, but overall I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible by any means, especially for face solutions.</li>
            <li>Of course i didn&#x27;t see change the first time i tried it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Bianca Del Rio for the recommendation!</li>
            <li>I love this product, starting to see improvement already.</li>
            <li>These are an absolute God send!</li>
            <li>I was supposed to receive an extra set of these per &amp;#34;The Magic Pads&amp;#34; email.  </li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>The convenience also has me washing my face more religiously.</li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve been looking for an acne product that consistently works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using The Magic Pads for several months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Bianca DelRio, and when I saw her posting about using the magic pads, I had to have a jar for myself.</li>
            <li>and my skin isnt only clearer but more hydrated and smoother than its been in months.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten rid of my skin regimen (essentially a war chest) and now solely use Magic Pads.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>A family member works for El Rey Networks and saw a few gorgeous stars using it.  </li>
            <li>works on my super stubborn adult acne!!</li>
            <li>They are gentle and not harsh and don&#x27;t have a strong chemical smell like some others.  </li>
            <li>Now a graduate student in college, I needed an easy and gentle way to keep my skin clear with all the stress of work and school.</li>
            <li>Apparently judging by other reviewers, they work great for some people.</li>
            <li>My face feels very clean after using and I pair with a daytime facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;instantly&amp;#34; clearing it up, as I am on my second jar, but I am very confident that it will be clear very soon.</li>
            <li>So far we have felt like these are worth the money!</li>
            <li>However, they do leave your skin feeling soft and clean and didn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>He also likes the way they leave your skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is more even, less oily, and more clear.</li>
            <li>No need to add use lotion after use, they leave your skin feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed at how gentle the product is; I&#x27;m still using a moisturizer, but I&#x27;ve had no drying or uncomfortable peeling.</li>
            <li>The liquid in on pad is not enough to cover whole face so more would be used.</li>
            <li>Not only have the magic pads cleared up my breakouts it has completely made my malasma disappear!!!</li>
            <li>I love the way it leaves your skin clean and tight and is its odorless.</li>
            <li>And I quote &amp;#34; Hannah has been using them and her skin is super soft !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad my face is back to normal!</li>
            <li>The Magic Pads consistently works and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>BEWARE of all the positive reviews</li>
            <li>after one week of using these pads, i think i can tell a positive difference.</li>
            <li>Some positive improvement.</li>
            <li>I have tried a million products and I gave these a shot because of the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I was really patient and consistent with it.</li>
            <li>but I think this is better for my skin long term since it then becomes part of my treatment regimen.</li>
            <li>In the hot sun of summer and the dry wind of winter these pads really are MAGIC.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge change after my FIRST time using them, and received compliments on my skin after the second day.</li>
            <li>They also don&#x27;t dry my skin out, which I love.</li>
            <li>I suffer from chronic rosacea and as such my skin is easily irritated and reddened with bumps all over my t-zone.</li>
            <li>I have had combination, acne prone, AND super sensitive skin all my life, and have used just about any and every product out there.</li>
            <li>I have been using The Magic Pads for at least two years and it has cleared my skin without drying it out, leaving it feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t recommend it enough if you have trouble skin or just loved to have a clean face</li>
            <li>And very quick and simple to use..</li>
            <li>However, my 11 year old daughter quickly declared them her own.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oh plus I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My pores don&#x27;t seem as large, either.</li>
            <li>This has helped me with acne, large pores, and has given me a glow that I haven&#x27;t seen in years.</li>
            <li>These Magic Pads are the first product to completely combat my acne, nourish my skin, and improve its overall look/tone and texture all at once!</li>
            <li>and when I got back my typically unobservant boyfriend comments on how great my skin looked.</li>
            <li>I only use them once a day, but I believe they would be fine if you chose to use them twice a day.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t dry my face out and that&#x27;s pretty easy to do for me.</li>
            <li>After using them I feel clean and fresh but not too oily or too dry either.</li>
            <li>They keep your skin clear and exfoliated, while also keeping it calm and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It really cleans your skin of all residue.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be more careful when reading reviews</li>
            <li>These pads didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my acne prone skin after going through 2 containers of them.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Bianca Del Rio for the recommendation.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>These really helped with acne</li>
            <li>Thanks Bianca Del Rio for the heads-up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problem skin my whole life.</li>
            <li>I no longer get breakouts and have much clearer looking skin.</li>
            <li>This product has really helped solve my breakout issues.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
            <li>I really did like these</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t recommend trying this.</li>
            <li>so I am very picky about what I put on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Look forward to using it, as it leaves skin feeling very refreshed.</li>
            <li>it really works - use it on body blemish&#x3D;prone areas.</li>
            <li>After reading all the raving reviews, I expected more from this product.</li>
            <li>Well these &amp;#34;Magic Pads&amp;#34; are not so magic!&lt;br /&gt;They really strip your face.</li>
            <li>The texture of my skin has really improved and I haven&#x27;t had an acne flare up.  </li>
            <li>I really wish the blackheads on my nose would disappear, but hopefully over time they&#x27;ll go away.  </li>
            <li>Not irritating to skin.</li>
            <li>after 3 weeks I can really see the difference.</li>
            <li>It says you can use 1 or 2 at a time, but they aren&#x27;t very moist.</li>
            <li>Really disapointed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with acne my whole life.</li>
            <li>These didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li>So much so that I started using them while on a business trip (3 days)</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My skin has improved so much since I started using these.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest that you try these!</li>
            <li>use one pad at night after cleansing with a gentle hypoallergenic bar, and then apply a alpha-hydroxy moisturizer.</li>
            <li>These pads have cleared my acne at my chin and jawline and have made my skin much smoother.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t have nearly as much acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered these twice and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference....</li>
            <li>In a week, I noticed a much smoother surface to my face.</li>
            <li>It really minimized the blemishes and made his skin look clearer.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>These pads have really made a difference for my skin.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know where its been my whole life.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have an acne problem.</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product, but when it says stay out of the sun, DO IT.</li>
            <li>I broke out on my forehead for about 5 weeks straight</li>
            <li>They really are &amp;#34;Magic Pads.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t deliver what you hoped, you aren&#x27;t out too much money.</li>
            <li>Will absolutely continue to purchase these.</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d try this, since my favorite drag queen, Bianca Del Rio recommended it.</li>
            <li>My favorite drag queen Bianca Del Rio endorses them</li>
            <li>and since I don&#x27;t have acne, I can&#x27;t really say I&#x27;ve noticed a difference with my skin.</li>
            <li>It has a cooling tingling effect to it that really makes me feel like it is working.</li>
            <li>already sensitive spots became much more swollen and red after use.</li>
            <li>They are not too harsh, yet effective.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, I love that the ingredient list is short and sourced naturally.</li>
            <li>I started using The Magic Pads nearly a year ago and haven&#x27;t looked back!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and these pads are very gentle.</li>
            <li>These really are magic, they got rid of a pimple on my neck that wouldn&#x27;t go away after trying a lot of other products.  </li>
            <li>I am able to use one side at night and the other side in the morning.</li>
            <li>Always follow beauty advice from an award winning drag queen!</li>
            <li>Easy on the skin but definitely keeps it clear for me!</li>
            <li>I like these, they are easy to use and don&#x27;t dry out my hands/skin like some medications.</li>
            <li>My biggest problem is that the pad&#x27;s dry up very quickly I can not saturate the entirety of my face and don&#x27;t fell like i should have to use two.</li>
            <li>My problem is dullness and these pads really bring out a vibrant complexion.</li>
            <li>That being said, I am about halfway through my first jar and so far, I really like them.</li>
            <li>My breakouts have greatly reduced since using this product, but I have had to start using a moisturizer with this, as it does dry out my skin a little.</li>
            <li>My skin is acne prone but can get dried out very easily as well.</li>
            <li>They are strong enough to do a little exfoliating and leave my face feeing very clean without over-drying it.  </li>
            <li>Works really well for acne highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended and very affordable.</li>
            <li>These have really helped with my adult acne around my chin!!</li>
            <li>Even when I get one or two during shark week it clears up fast with no scarring and my old scars are GONE!!</li>
            <li>I have the most sensitive skin, and these don&#x27;t dry my skin out at all.</li>
            <li>The moment I applied the first pad to my face and elbows, I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin felt.</li>
            <li>I am surprised how much make up comes off on the pads AFTER I have cleansed !  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if my skin just healed on its own or if these helped at all.</li>
            <li>Much better than your average acne pads.</li>
            <li>the Magic Pads did not stop my breakouts nor did they exfoliate enough to clear any scarring from my old blemishes.</li>
            <li>I used a full set of these pads lasting approx 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Pores look like they did when I was young and skin is so much smoother and brighter!  </li>
            <li>So far I am really liking these pads!</li>
            <li>Since there are so many pads, I use them on the backs of my arms as well and when I use them on my face I bring the pad down across my neck and collar bone.</li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t listen to me listen to that famous drag queen-her skin is like buttah!!</li>
            <li>Not only are the convenient and easy (I am lazy), but they also make my skin feel healthy.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t and can&#x27;t live a day without them!  </li>
            <li>Very quick results, you can feel it working without the intense burn you get from some other products.</li>
            <li>My skin is very fickle when it comes to using new products</li>
            <li>Some worked but would eventually over-dry my skin which would then create a whole new problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;ve had less breakouts after using the magic pads.</li>
            <li>Something odd happened to my face when I hit my 30s;  I started to break out more often as though I was a teenager...</li>
            <li>Being 26 now, I still suffer from mild acne and the occasional breakout.</li>
            <li>I suffer from adult, cystic acne primarily on my chin and experience daily breakouts.</li>
            <li>Four days later sun damage and acne scars are noticeably lighter, skin is smooth and completely clear.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is not too harsh (my skin can be sensitive), but effective.</li>
            <li>After only one week of using magic pads after cleansing my face in the morning and night, I see a vast improvement.</li>
            <li>my most recent order seems to have a different formulation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Every night, I wash my face with a facial buff pad that has mild Olay cleanser on it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>It is strong enough, yet gentle enough for your face.</li>
            <li>I notice my skin is a little more glowy.  </li>
            <li>These little pads ARE magic.</li>
            <li>Definitely something I will purchase once my first order is over!</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>They actually work exactly as described!</li>
            <li>only wish these came in higher count bottles!</li>
            <li>They soothe but don&#x27;t dry me out And leave my skin super fresh, clear, and soft.</li>
            <li>The Magic Pads have the rare combination of materials that keeps me from breaking out without giving me the dry, patchy skin other products did.</li>
            <li>I saw that Bianca del Rio kept plugging them on her instagram, so I thought, if a drag queen is claiming these are fantastic, then they probably are (considering all the makeup they have to wear.)</li>
            <li>&amp; these pads have been really helpful with healing &amp; exfoliation to clear pores.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find they really work as advertised.  </li>
            <li>She had acne scars that were really making her self conscious.</li>
            <li>It is very cleansing, but not harsh.</li>
            <li>I wash my face with my normal face wash and use the pads afterward.</li>
            <li>I love these and intend on using them everyday for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>So I stopped for a few days until my face got better.</li>
            <li>Cleared up my skin in a few days :)</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend others buying this, it&#x27;s gentle on the skin and works better than I had expected.</li>
            <li>My skin glows, feels fresh, and the occasional pimple I get has been non existent!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already used up one container and ordered 2 more a few days ago.</li>
            <li>Her skin looks so much better just after a few days of use.  </li>
            <li>I will post before and after pics once we give it a few more months.</li>
            <li>I totally think they&#x27;re worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have used many products way more expensive than this, but I was pleasantly surprised to find this one works just as well.</li>
            <li>I purchased magic pads for my son and clearly u could tell he has less blackheads and breakouts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these on an every other day basis for nearly a month now and am really pleased so far.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is how instantly my face felt smoother and after a few weeks of daily use, my skin is clearer, my products work more efficiently, and I rarely break out now.</li>
            <li>And if I run out before getting a new jar, my face will start to break out again after about a week.</li>
            <li>I tried a new brand there are tons of glycolic pads.</li>
            <li>Been using twice a day for just under 2 weeks and having got any new break outs</li>
            <li>At this point, I was having a new break out EVERY DAY.</li>
            <li>That sent me to my computer in a hurry to place my new order.  </li>
            <li>After about 2 weeks, I noticed a lot of new acne, but I&#x27;m guessing this is all the clogs coming to the surface as the cells turnover.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m back to finally having my skin look as smooth as a china doll.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Yes, months after trying these pads I spent some more of my time on google and finally checked out their site.</li>
            <li>Bianca Del Rio, most recent winner of Drag Race talked about this product on his facebook feed</li>
            <li>Using these every other night gives me a great glow and helps clear up the small skin-tone bumps on my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was looking for a very gentle daily AHA to help with my hyper-pigmentation and clogged pores and since&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I like these-I have very sensitive acne prone skin  </li>
            <li>I have had acne for about 10 years and have tried everything from drug store products to high end to natural everything</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t cause me to break out before having my skin clear up!</li>
            <li>my skin has never looked so clear!</li>
            <li>I heard about them from Bianca del Rio and am amazed by how clear they keep my skin!</li>
            <li>These all natural pads have made the biggest difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if they are magic, but they help my skin.</li>
            <li>I got these with some skepticism, but was pleasantly surprised to find out how well they work!</li>
            <li>My face is FINALLY clearing up, not drying out, and looking so much better-even softer!</li>
            <li>The Magic pads were similar but received rave reviews over the more expensive product.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>All I have to say is WOW!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>So far it seems to be working!</li>
            <li>At first, I only used the pads once a day and wasn&#x27;t getting the results that I wanted.  </li>
            <li>this is the first and last time i&#x27;ll buy something because a celeb endorsed it.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Although these haven&#x27;t cured my acne completely, it did solve my cystic acne problems!</li>
            <li>my skin is so soft and my blemish issues have cleared up!</li>
            <li>feel like these would work better for someone who simply suffers from acne or generally clogged pores, as they did make my skin feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Have not used them long enough to give a accurate result fro using the pads.</li>
            <li>My face was breakout free within a week and half</li>
            <li>My pores are less congested, my fine lines are less noticeable, and my overall skin tone &amp; texture is discernibly better.  </li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s a good product but not good enough for my skin.</li>
            <li>I had these two HUGE pimples on either side of my face as well as one on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;Within 3 days of using these every night the redness went down considerably and the pimples shrunk quite a</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re worth every single penny.</li>
            <li>I could tell a distinct difference in the smoothness of my skin within the first couple days, with the added bonus of less oily t-zone issues!</li>
            <li>It does a great job of keeping my skin smooth and gets rid of those stupid little bumps that aren&#x27;t quite full pimples yet.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure if they are magic or how much improvement they are actually making on my acne.</li>
            <li>Not only have these pads improved my acne, they also have improved the texture of my skin and diminished old acne scars (I only have the flat red kind, can&#x27;t speak for pitting scars).</li>
            <li>I had some unusual scar tissue right under my bottom lip that embarrassed me and to cover the appearance I&#x27;ve grown my facial hair there for a long time.</li>
            <li>I saw noticeable improvement after the first jar &amp; major improvement after the 2nd.</li>
            <li>These pads make my dull skin look more luminess</li>
            <li>I used them for a few days and my pores got so huge that my face was looking like a pancake.</li>
            <li>No product has ever worked to consistently clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also had 3 people compliment my skin, MY skin, saying I looked so refreshed and clear</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get anything to clear</li>
            <li>They began to clear up my skin immediately.  </li>
            <li>After about two days the redness started to clear up.  </li>
            <li>I want clear skin and have it now</li>
            <li>For some crazy reason, I dunno.&lt;br /&gt;3) and most importantly the acne org regimen.</li>
            <li>I was clearly wasting my money elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I use them day and night after washing with salicylic acid cleanser to help clear out my pores.</li>
            <li>I use them morning and night, and they keep my skin clear without drying it out.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft blemishes disappearing rapidly.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, no acne break outs, and my skin tone is even.  </li>
            <li>No fading of old acne scars or anything</li>
            <li>This product has managed to eliminate the frequent breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have to start off by saying I really like these pads and definitely would suggest them.</li>
            <li>I have combination to oily skin, 31 years old, and skin is just slightly sensitive.</li>
            <li>I use twice per day after washing my face and have oily but sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the for the 2nd month, and really have not noticed a change yet.</li>
            <li>and it really does seem to make my pores seem smaller after just two weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Made my skin so soft and clear.  </li>
            <li>Also, my skin is too sensitive to use proactiv, or products like it.</li>
            <li>I also like that they are so natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid SO much money for dermatologist appointments, topical and oral medications, and even teas and food to try and fix my skin.</li>
            <li>I use this after I go on my daily runs, and my face feels so much cleaner and smoother than just washing alone.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive mile acne</li>
            <li>but I really needed something to put on the actual skin-</li>
            <li>WOW, buy it.</li>
            <li>Surprised it works so well</li>
            <li>I love these pads because above all else, they&#x27;re made with natural ingredients and aren&#x27;t harsh on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going on 27 years old</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see what the big fuss is about with these &amp;#34;Magic Pads&amp;#34; they did absolutely nothing for my face.</li>
            <li>So I have sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to acne...</li>
            <li>but this is all natural.</li>
            <li>As a 49 year old, I was looking for something that will reduce the signs of aging.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that this would do as advertised, however it actually made me break out</li>
            <li>Really gets rid of my breakouts and blackheads that I get occasionally.</li>
            <li>Cleanses and makes my faces feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensative skin and adult acne.</li>
            <li>Second jar and my skin is now HD camera ready.</li>
            <li>Hey, I&#x27;m 60 years old and breakouts are not in my life plan.</li>
            <li>I use them, as well as my 17 year old exchange student.</li>
            <li>For the 17 year old, they have drastically helped with his acne and redness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really found such a noticeable difference in the feel and appearance of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have razor burns on my face and have read that using glycolic acid is a natural way to treat it.  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought it once to at least give it a try.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>FAST results above anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and these didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t feel these were any different than $5.00 drugstore acne pads..</li>
            <li>It is not harsh or drying on the skin at all.</li>
            <li>product is so much easier than getting her to wash her face outside of being in the shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother and it&#x27;s definitely helped with breakouts!</li>
            <li>I knew he is too young to keep up with using proactive</li>
            <li>and when it was gone it had left darker spots from me picking at it so much.  </li>
            <li>They cause no irritation of my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>They have kept my skin soft and reduced blemishes.</li>
            <li>My 11 year old doesn&#x27;t wear make-up and they have reduced her pre-teen acne quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Ordered this for my 16 year old son and 13 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>So far, it has helped my acne problem.</li>
            <li>and it def is helping my old scars fade.</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth that I&#x27;m wearing foundation a lot less than I used to!  </li>
            <li>My skin always feels clean and tight after using.</li>
            <li>First thing in a long time that has worked for my skin!  </li>
            <li>I have dry skin and think that these are actually pretty hydrating.  </li>
            <li>A few months ago my sister gave me these Magic Pads to try as she loved how they not only cleaned but also exfoliated; I was skeptical since I have not only oily but also very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I found this listing on Amazon and saw other people&#x27;s success that I decided to give them a shot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 26 year old male that has struggled with acne since junior high.</li>
            <li>Like I&#x27;m getting more subtle blackheads.</li>
            <li>I normally only get pimples on my t zone, and mainly my chin.</li>
            <li>As an adult female with sensitive skin, I can only use certain ingredients.</li>
            <li>Unlike other pads, these pads don&#x27;t really sting or irritate my face, they actually are pretty soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li>(I have fair skin with red undertones) and I wear less and less make up each week!</li>
            <li>Other pads have a lot of chemicals and feel like you&#x27;re putting alcohol right onto the skin</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to all acne sufferers and will continue to use it regularly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product as an addition to your current face washing routine.</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth now and blemishes are a thing of the past.</li>
            <li>I used up a whole jar for minor breakouts I would get on my chest area and it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent so much time and money on creams,pills and doctor visits!  </li>
            <li>I decided to scrap my entire old routine, and have been using the magic pads along with a gentle non-foaming cleanser and a vitamin-c moisturizer, and I am shocked at how quickly I saw an improvement.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and acne scars and they are getting smaller and smaller each time I use a pad.  </li>
            <li>They are also fragrance free and have very few ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I used this for a whole month and it has helped a little bit with the skin smoothing, but not really anything special.</li>
            <li>I have only used these for a few days and can see a huge difference in my skin already.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t dry my skin out too much.  </li>
            <li>Bought Magic-Pads through amazon.com, after much research, for my teenage son who was battling moderate to severe acne.</li>
            <li>Also, I had to use several each day because there did not seem to be enough liquid on them to do my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li>It looks clearer, smaller pores, and much brighter overall!</li>
            <li>Finally starting to see a clear face again!</li>
            <li>I did not have a major problem before, but I notice when I start to get blackheads or a pimple in an area, it seems to subside.  </li>
            <li>I combine this with a mild anti-acne scrub and have found my skin clearing up dramatically after just a week and a half of use!  </li>
            <li>My face has been clear my whole life, until I reached my mid 20&#x27;s and started mysteriously having constant breakouts!</li>
            <li>They make my skin feel very smooth and are not the slightest bit irritating.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed after using this for 3 weeks, not always everyday, my skin seems more clear and less oily.</li>
            <li>and the next morning my old acne that usually takes weeks to fade- had faded significantly over night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 45 years old, with combination skin (oily in the t-zone, normal cheeks, very dry eye area).  </li>
            <li>I hardly have any blemishes, and my skin feels so smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>This is definitely something I&#x27;ll keep using because when you consider how many pads are in the container, this is actually less expensive than other AHA pads on the market, plus they&#x27;re effective and don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>plus I didn&#x27;t see any skin clarity, brightening, or any other purported positive effects.</li>
            <li>After a week or so of really bad skin, it is now looking great.</li>
            <li>This really does clear up dark blemishes.  </li>
            <li>After only a couple weeks using this product she is almost completely clear.  </li>
            <li>I was suffering from oil patches and blemishes and this cleared my skin up in just a week and left it clear, toned and smoother.</li>
            <li>They help clear up my blemishes, and skin feels tighter and younger.</li>
            <li>My cystic acne would finally be drawn to the surface of my skin and clear</li>
            <li>Definitely helped clear my skin.</li>
            <li>At 31, I still suffer from the occasional break out and hyper-pigmentation of old acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an instant change, but it has completely changed my skin.</li>
            <li>I can only use once a day so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 55 years old and skin is looking younger every day.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for two days, but so far it has reduced the redness on my face, and made it smoother.</li>
            <li>There is nothing magical about them; they make acne worse.</li>
            <li>Not magical but not bad either.  </li>
            <li>Having suffered from acne for nearly 20 years, this has been the only thing that has cleared my skin without irritation or redness, did not dry out my skin</li>
            <li>These made a big difference, and quickly (just a few days).</li>
            <li>My skin is combination and very sensitive, and I get blackheads, whiteheads, and the occasional deep cystic pimple.</li>
            <li>They gently exfoliate my sensitive skin, and dry up blemishes, but don&#x27;t dry out my skin .</li>
            <li>Does not dry out your skin!</li>
            <li>I got these without too much hope since nothing has worked thus far, and when I first began using them my skin was worse for about 10 days.</li>
            <li>This product works better for my sensitive skin than any of the other significantly more expensive products that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>If you look at the ingredients, you&#x27;ll notice it is all natural stuff which I really like, as opposed to weird chemicals which is what you find in most other stuff.</li>
            <li>I also like that this brand is made with pretty much mostly, if not all, natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>You can thank Bianca Del Rio for plugging this product on social media.</li>
            <li>Initially, my acne got worse before it got better, however, that was over a 2-3 day period.</li>
            <li>I have found that adult acne is waaaaay more difficult to treat than that of a teenager.</li>
            <li>I did not dry out.</li>
            <li>I think my skin became immune to all of the major acne products because they all share the same chemical ingredients.</li>
            <li>Other products were harsh and less effective.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because of all the great reviews and I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li>They help fade any dark spots and they really help with fighting blemishes.</li>
            <li>Around my period, I get occasional pimple or two, and the worst part is they take forever healing, but these pads work like magic, the healing only takes a couple days, I love them!</li>
            <li>By far the thing I have done for my skin in a long time!,You will NOT regret trying them.</li>
            <li>I have typically sensitive skin with dryness as a common side effect to any topical agent I apply, but the Magic Pads keep my skin wrapped tight.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these pads if you want to clear up your skin, and want to exfoliate without using harsh chemical products.</li>
            <li>My skin is clear without feeling dry.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin that always had some patchy dry spots on my cheeks, the sides of my nose, even near my eyes.  </li>
            <li>So far my skin is no better and no worse.</li>
            <li>This was something that heard about from various people via social media.</li>
            <li>My face has been looking much clearer since I started using them; less breakouts, pores even seem smaller.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to get smoother skin mostly because after clearing some breakouts, I had a little bit of an uneven skin tone and some rough spots.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m impressed. :)</li>
            <li> I am so excited to tell everyone about this product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the magic pads!</li>
            <li> Performance wise</li>
            <li> they were also surprisingly good. .</li>
            <li> I feel so good about myself</li>
            <li> I loved them once my face went through the purging phase and this pulled out even under the skin acne.</li>
            <li> And I LOVED that it eventually helped with ingrown hairs on my chin.</li>
            <li> and it does a mostly good job on those.</li>
            <li> These are good.</li>
            <li> Good value</li>
            <li> had heard good things about these pads, I decided to try them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to cover my acne with make up anymore because my skin looks so good after a week of using these.</li>
            <li> Good product, five stars.</li>
            <li> People are always amazed that I&#x27;m not wearing any make up because of how good my complexion looks.  </li>
            <li> and I do need to use a good moisturizer after using the pads.</li>
            <li> Not a cure but saw really good results.</li>
            <li> It seems like it&#x27;s as good as putting just water on your face.</li>
            <li> People have even commented on how good my skin looks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oil control is fair</li>
            <li> Good product  </li>
            <li> but id say a good 50% has.</li>
            <li> This product is a good replacement for my toner.</li>
            <li> Understand that the pads used for this product are fairly abrasive, this may or not be to your liking - I like it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fantastic customer service.</li>
            <li> and I felt like they were trying to buy a good review.</li>
            <li> They are really awesome and super affordable.</li>
            <li> These pads are very refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the pads.  </li>
            <li> Feels great using them as they aren&#x27;t loaded with alcohol like most astringent pads.  </li>
            <li> The Magic Pads are a great addition to my skin care routine.  </li>
            <li> While there are some great exfoliants out there, there is nothing on the market as convenient as The Magic Pads.</li>
            <li> however, The Magic Pads worked great to minimize any post-shave breakout.</li>
            <li> During times of stress I often break out and these did a great job of immediately stopping the breakout and preventing more.</li>
            <li> Works great, my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the improvement of my skin.</li>
            <li> Love these as they have made a great difference to my skintone...</li>
            <li> Love the magic pads!!</li>
            <li> Looking forward to more improvement!! :)</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> This product really is magic!</li>
            <li> Additionally, my complexion has never looked better!</li>

            <li> The magic pads have made a noticeable difference in my complexion!</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t recommend them any more for clearing up skin!</li>
            <li> I was bummed when I ran out but immediately ordered two more jars!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love these!</li>
            <li> One swipe, after I wash, before I lotion, once a day, and my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> Love the Maic Pads!</li>
            <li> I have been using The Magic Pads for three weeks now, and the difference is amazing!  </li>
            <li> First heard of them from Bianca Del Rio who always looks flawless</li>
            <li> Bought these after a recommendation from a friend... Love them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love!  </li>
            <li> I love the cost too!</li>
            <li> I love these pads!</li>
            <li> Try it and you&#x27;ll love it forever!</li>

            <li> Combo of the pads and coconut oil, my face as never looked and felt better!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s improved my skin way better than Proactive or Nutragina!</li>
            <li> I do feel like the best results were in the first week and if nothing else it was an non-irritating remover of any remaining makeup on my cheeks after washing my face.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better than it has in years!</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a problem with acne to begin with, so I can&#x27;t speak to their effectiveness for that, but they exfoliate nicely</li>
            <li> I am an Esthetician and was looking for a glycolic pad that would be good for most everyone.</li>

            <li> This one isn&#x27;t any magic.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t meant to be used as makeup remover wipes, but more like astringent wipes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what these truly magic pads do for my skin in a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Magic Pads for over two months</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer with better texture</li>
            <li> Love &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> Havent had any more breakouts since I started using.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Magic Pads.</li>
            <li> In the morning I use a noncomedogenic wash in the shower and Magic Pads after.</li>
            <li> When I use the Magic Pads, there is still dirt on my face.</li>
            <li> These actually worked, which is marvelous.</li>
            <li> I love the tingle sensation when I use them.  </li>
            <li> I love using this product and my skin has never felt smoother and softer since I began using The Magic Pads.  </li>
            <li> Nothing magic about them</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> The name says it all,  it works like magic.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not to say they didn&#x27;t work at all, just that they didn&#x27;t work any better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, and I am so in love.</li>
            <li> My friend told me about magic pads</li>
            <li> Nothing worked magic like magic pads.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> The Magic Pads are okay.  </li>
            <li> Love the pads and planning on continuing to use them.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I came across these.</li>
            <li> but I think I&#x27;ll keep using them to make sure it stays that way.</li>
            <li> And I take them with me no matter where I go in the country! :)</li>
            <li> I have been using every day since then, and my skin has cleared, and looks better than ever.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want their night time cleansing and moisturizing routine to be easier and produced better skin ?</li>
            <li> after two weeks my skin looked and felt even better.</li>
            <li> love magic pads</li>
            <li> I have used about 15 pads already and it has worked a charm on my face and has made me even more confidence.</li>
            <li> But I just wasn&#x27;t impressed enough to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love&#x27;em</li>
            <li> Magic pads is a skin-saver.</li>
            <li> The Magic Pads control oiliness without drying out.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed these.</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order more Magic Pads and within 3 days my skin began to break out again.</li>
            <li> Be sure to order these a couple days before you run out because you don&#x27;t want to miss a day (but shipping to my apartment</li>
            <li> I am in love with the magic pads, they have saved my life and my wallet.</li>
            <li> (most products just don&#x27;t do anything)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, Clearasil, and many others and this product</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li> You can fo your face knees elbows and heels for sure.</li>
            <li> I am for sure adding this to my regimen.</li>
            <li> I used most of the container, once or twice a day, and didnt experience anything magical.</li>
            <li> I bought Magic Pads hoping for help with my skin after having my son.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended them to everyone in my family, and could literally not give more of an endorsement of a product.</li>
            <li> I am a master esthetician so skincare is something I know and love.</li>
            <li> EXCEPT that I use BHA and I broke out after using Magic Pads.</li>
            <li> I get better results from a 5 dollar jar of stridex pads.</li>
            <li> It seems to exfoliate my skin and help my moisturizer work better.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling softer and looking like it has a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Been using the magic pads for a week now.</li>
            <li> Thank you Magic Pads</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a life-time acne sufferer (been on two rounds of Accutane and many OTC options as well).</li>
            <li> Literally, my skin felt better WITHIN 24 HOURS.</li>
            <li> :)).  </li>
            <li> I really love.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I started using Magic Pads, I thought &#x27;what do I have to lose?&#x27;</li>
            <li> freaking love this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with sensitivities, and i love the way my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> Like many others I heard Bianca del Rio was using this product</li>
            <li> Never again will I use one of these magic pads.</li>
            <li> The Magic Pads helped soothe my irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Magic Pads, and they work.</li>
            <li> I love how they make my skin so smooth!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these pads.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best product out there!</li>
            <li> I have recommended The Magic Pads to all of my friends and have bought them for family members.  </li>
            <li> Effective but cheap.</li>
            <li> I love they way the pads take all the dirt off as well.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> So much more convenient than face wash and doesn&#x27;t have the alcohol smell and drying of acne pads.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s an all-in-one product.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you grab one pad and not two.</li>
            <li> The Magic Pads were recommended to me by my daughter.</li>
            <li> This works way better than my proactive trial.</li>
            <li> The Magic Pads smoothed them out within 3 days.  </li>
            <li> Give The Magic Pads a shot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This, like most everything, didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> It is more about the regimen itself than the products they sell</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a big statement from me as I&#x27;m rarely impressed with beauty products.</li>
            <li> These pads worked better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried for acne.</li>
            <li> Glad I could return it.</li>
            <li> These pads didn&#x27;t seem too magical to me.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a lot better than the salicylic acid pads I see in stores all the time.</li>
            <li> I love the exfoliating side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using The Magic Pads for about 6 months</li>
            <li> And now during the summer time, I don&#x27;t want to have &amp;#34;backne&amp;#34; when wearing cute summer dresses.</li>
            <li> My skin was never terrible but as soon as I started using these my skin cleared up and has stayed that way!</li>
            <li> Make your skin so smooth and glowing!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to see more reduction in my acne breakouts, but hopefully that will come with more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will purchase again and again now :)</li>
            <li> These pads work great,much better results.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell you how much I love these.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> and I love them.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love these and have even raved about them on my blog.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed these...</li>
            <li> I see a difference in my complexion for the better.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> It is also not as drying as many products.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using Magic Pads, there were no improvements on my face.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more pads soon.</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love these Pads ❤</li>
            <li> After using Magic Pads for one day I noticed the tissue was breaking up.</li>
            <li> Thank you Bianca Del Rio..and THE MAGIC PADS...</li>
            <li> I love these Magic pads.  </li>
            <li> My teenage daughter is using them too and is so happy with the results!  </li>
            <li> My makeup goes on easier, looks better, and stays on longer.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Seems fabulous!</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I really do love this product.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a couple of months now and love what I see in the mirror...</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using this for a week and our faces look better.</li>
            <li> Store bought products worked hit and miss, but mostly miss.</li>
            <li> The magic pads have been a relief for my wife and I because it has taken the guess work out of helping our teens control /</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> i love the THE MAGIC PADS ..</li>
            <li> Again if its good for the drag queens its good for me!</li>
            <li> Best acne treatment ive had so far after using the original proactiv line, X-Out, acne</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and so far, so good!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Smell is nice, not too strong, not too medicine like; it&#x27;s a light refreshing smell.  </li>
            <li> They make my skin feel freshy and clean !&amp;#34; So I have just ordered 2 more jars.  </li>
            <li> , so I use w couple of these magic pads and my face feels clean!</li>
            <li> These are great and easy AND gentle.</li>
            <li> Magic Pads feel very mild and refreshing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more convenient than glycolic acid in a vial, but since it&#x27;s not as strong, would be applied much more often.  </li>
            <li> Looking forward to clear beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> The results I&#x27;ve seen since using them are pretty good.</li>
            <li> or so it does pretty good</li>
            <li> Because a lot of people do see pretty good results with these, I figured I&#x27;d give them a try.</li>
            <li> I have used benzoil p. for years with pretty good results, but I decided to give a glycolic acid product a try - this one.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend The Magic Pads!!</li>
            <li> These are nothing more than just cotton pads soaked in rubbing alcohol with a cool name!</li>
            <li> I had sensitive and sometimes acne-prone skin, and I think The Magic Pads are great.</li>
            <li> That makes me worry about all the good reviews here, who wouldn&#x27;t want free stuffs right?   </li>
            <li> Guess it&#x27;s fine with me :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other pads before the magic pads and wasn&#x27;t really impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> I can get more uses from My La Roche Posay Effaclear Clarifying Solution and a better clean.</li>
            <li> I have just started using the pads, but I am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> I love Bianca Del Rio, which is where I heard about these, but I didn&#x27;t notice a difference to my skin, unless you have to use like 5 pads each time, which would not be cheap.  </li>
            <li> It was worth the purchase as it did exactly what I was expecting with great results.</li>
            <li> tried another brand of pads with a higher concentration of glycol acid, just to see if I liked something better.</li>
            <li> They are great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love that there are organic ingredients and its cruelty free.</li>
            <li> I find it very helpful to use a good exfoliating face scrub each day helps as well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good product.</li>
            <li> They work just as good as proactive but are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> They were nicely saturated and just the right size for my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I still, on occasion, break out, but when I use Magic Pads, the redness is significantly reduce and the heal time is practically doubled.</li>
            <li> I swear by The Magic pads for a FRESH FACE!</li>
            <li> Tried this for the first time and love it!</li>
            <li> I used to do demos for organic skincare products, so I was familiar with the ingredients in Magic Pads.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re almost too easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easily irritated by strong products.</li>
            <li> These pads are easy to use and accomplish just what I need the, to.</li>
            <li> I definitely love that the ingredients are clean.</li>
            <li> They are easy to pack with me</li>
            <li> I found it to be too strong for my face.</li>
            <li> They are very gentle but highly effective</li>
            <li> Good so far!!</li>
            <li> Its amazing , after the first day I saw results .</li>
            <li> Everyone who tries these pads falls in love with them and for good reason!  </li>
            <li> From the ingredients down to the texture of the pads, everything would have been perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Arrived fine.</li>
            <li> Magic Pads restored balance, glow, and general happiness to my skin.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and works better than drugstore brands</li>
            <li> and so it&#x27;s super embarrassing to still have acne!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was quick - no problems whatsoever!</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s thanks to Magic Pads!</li>
            <li> These really are magic!</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesome…doesn&#x27;t cause dryness or irritation - makes skin lovely!</li>
            <li> Thanks Magic Pads!</li>
            <li> My skins tone is more even and super smooth</li>
            <li> But MAGIC does happen when you stay consistent with them!</li>
            <li> and I can tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Thank you for having such a great product available and for making it affordable.</li>
            <li> but cos of the willow bark and the light usage of glycolic acid</li>
            <li> I use one at night before bed and they are gentle yet effective.  </li>
            <li> I am cheap when it comes to buying products like this and never believe in the claims they make.</li>
            <li> They are also great at preventing future breakouts!</li>
            <li> Just impatiently waiting for them to arrive, lol!</li>
            <li> Its fantastic and</li>
            <li> I definitely see improvements, and I&#x27;m really happy</li>
            <li> I experienced a noticeable reduction in acne, facial redness, and pore size.</li>
            <li> The pads keep my face acne free and have done wonders with removing any scarring I had from when I did have issues with acne.  </li>
            <li> Also they sent me an email saying if I rate this 5 stars they would send me another one for free .</li>
            <li> Not only do they save time, but my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this great in ages.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this product has such great reviews when it&#x27;s not doing anything at all.</li>
            <li> I love it amazing soft and smooth pads</li>
            <li> free..</li>
            <li> It was smooth and soothing.</li>
            <li> Feels like a good product, but causes mild-to-medium irritation for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, and I was a bit worried about using these, but I had read some good reviews about them,</li>
            <li> Since then, I have “forced” so many friends to use them as they are awesome!</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m loving the magic pads.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had good skin, but the Magic Pads take it to the next level.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found something easy and effective for clearing and renewing my skin!</li>
            <li> I ordered more, and it cleared right up.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Magic Pads!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for you, magic pads!</li>
            <li> Magic pads smell nice and leave my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Magic Pads have helped calm my acne breaks outs and has significantly cut the amount of oil on my face.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves my face oil free and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I like using this type of product because it&#x27;s quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> Super easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy and quick to use too.</li>
            <li> With the arrival of hot weather here, these feel really refreshing.</li>
            <li> Original Review:</li>
            <li> I feel they clean my skin very well and are quick to use, which is nice at night.</li>
            <li> I feel like my comexion has significantly improved</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for two months and wouldn&#x27;t exactly call them &amp;#34;magic.&amp;#34; The magic seems to wear off.</li>
            <li> The number blackheads on my cheeks and nose have dropped significantly.</li>
            <li> I originally bought these just because Bianca Del Rio posted about them.</li>
            <li> Will buy more soon ;)</li>
            <li> On that recommendation I picked up this product and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve used it more consistently</li>
            <li> They are SO worth the money!</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased the aztec clay with it but realized he doesn&#x27;t even need to use that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the pads for a month now, and they have significantly improved the quality of my skin.</li>
            <li> &amp; I have already seen a significant improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> Well I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> They are effective but gentle and really helped with stress breakouts!!</li>
            <li> Normally I buy products and end up being less than impressed with them, but I LOVE these pads.</li>
            <li> In just a week it cleared up spots that I had and my skin looks and feels clean.</li>
            <li> clean--</li>
            <li> I can feel confident that I wont get any breakouts from sweat on my forehead, and its such a nice feeling.</li>
            <li> but it did keep ny face clean</li>
            <li> I think that one of my issues is that my skin is so oily that it never gets to exfoliate properly on its own - Magic Pads has allowed a rejuvenating process to begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My pores feel clean, and my skin feels refreshed after using them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had my face be so clean.</li>
            <li> great product no complaints...been using it 2 weeks no new out breaks and skin looking refreshed.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for wrinkles afer watching a Dr. Oz show about Glycolic acid and absolutely love it, it has shrunk my large pores on my nose and smoothed my face.  </li>
            <li> The queen was right!</li>
            <li> There was absolutely nothing special or magic about these pads.</li>
            <li> Not too much tingle just refreshing.</li>
            <li> just so glad that after years of dealing with acne, I found a product that can keep my face so much clearer.</li>
            <li> They leave your skin feeling super clean and tighter.</li>
            <li> The real reason I know The Magic Pads really work are through the compliments I have received from friends and family about how much better my face looks since I started using them.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like there is anything on the pads, no stickiness, no stinging or burning of the skin, it really does seem like magic-</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li> Good at removing excess dirt but definitely not &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I personally know someone who was paid to write a good review about this product.</li>
            <li> The true test for me was post-shaved skin...</li>
            <li> Love them they really make a difference.</li>
            <li> I work over a deep fryer for a good perron of my day and these make my skin feel fresh and clean</li>
            <li> Just be sure to use a good moisturizer as they have ingredients that are a little bit drying.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it and cannot live without it!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a tremendous difference in my skin</li>
            <li> Purchased for my son, has helped tremendously....</li>
            <li> Face felt super cleansed after using pad.</li>
            <li> My main issue was that I had MANY breakouts along my forehead</li>
            <li> I was AMAZED who quickly the pads worked.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more, but I wish there were more than 50 in each bottle.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about these at first, but they really seem to work!  </li>
            <li> They arrived really quickly.</li>
            <li> I feel it would help those with mild skin problems.</li>
            <li> He has mild acne</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin that gets irritated very easily and these pads have worked wonders.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for the magic pads.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for the Magic Pads.</li>
            <li> A person that spends time putting on tons of make-up knows the right products to keep their pores clean.</li>
            <li> Overall very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> After seeing such good reviews I was hoping for a near magical experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using First Aid Beauty&#x27;s Facial Radiance (very pricey!), and found these Magic Pads to be an amazing substitute.</li>
            <li> It reduced my acne greatly and faded my black spots</li>
            <li> I wish I could say I experienced &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; results with these pads, but my daughter and I both used them and didn&#x27;t find them any more effective than similar pads we had been using by Neutrogenia, just 3x more expensive.  </li>
            <li> Loved the way there is no burn and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too strong and my face wasn&#x27;t really irritated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It helps her easily control her acne and is much easier for me to get her to use then anythings else.</li>
            <li> You need a good mousterizer as they do dry your skin.</li>
            <li> My self esteem is so high right now. :)</li>
            <li> Overall, this is without a doubt a very good product that I highly recommend whether you have acne or not, these pads will definitely make your face look better.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing short of MAGIC!</li>
            <li> It has helped her soo much!!</li>
            <li> Love this product so far!</li>
            <li> Saw results after first use!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well!</li>
            <li> I have tan oily skin fairly blemish free except for a little mild rosacea and a sun spot.  </li>
            <li> After that, I use one of these pads, and then I lightly apply pure tea tree oil to my face.</li>
            <li> one advantage i do like about these is that the pads are a bit thicker and are great little exfoliaters.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend The Magic Pads for all skin types, but especially for those of us with combination skin; it does a great job at controlling oily areas and moisturizing dry ones!</li>
            <li> They are no longer textured and exfoliating, they are just smooth pads and don&#x27;t seem to be the real deal at all.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it cleans my face and leave my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> I used these for about 2 weeks and didn&#x27;t really see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, I have my complexion back!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> but they are totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The pads are convenient and clean off makeup and oil nicely but did seem to dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> The Magic Pads seem to be just the thing to keep my skin calm and clear.</li>
            <li> It does exfoliate well when the product is fresh.</li>
            <li> having tried everything from ProActiv to Accutane, this honestly has been the only thing that has dramatically and permanently cleared up my acne.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> and I had zits popping up more frequently.</li>
            <li> I also love using this product on my chest and shoulders when I get breakouts there, it really gets rid of them fast.</li>
            <li> Theses are named well because they really are magic for someone who has struggled with acne and scarring her whole life.</li>
            <li> They work magic on my 30 year old skin, making it cleaner and brighter.</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old and have a graveyard of lotions, serums, oils from so many companies I&#x27;ve lost count.</li>
            <li> clear, smooth and free of breakouts.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old son and I have used the Magic Pads now for a year.</li>
            <li> But, if it does work, what is that worth to you?</li>
            <li> This product is simple and effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it, trust me.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was a bit skeptical about this product even though it has great reviews, yet I can assure you it works wonders.</li>
            <li> They are powerful, and don&#x27;t burn.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got super sensitive skin, but the Magic Pads are very gentle while still clearing up my blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Glycolic acid pads and these are great - gentle on my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Magic Pads for about a month and my blemishes are significantly reduced and the discoloration is diminished.</li>
            <li> I needed a skin product that would clean the impurities and leave it soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Improved my skin right away.</li>
            <li> It was the right thing to do.</li>
            <li> If you want not only a pimple free face but a blackhead free face with smaller pores buy The Magic Pads!</li>
            <li> My daughter has started using it and after 2 weeks it cleared her up all the way-so everyone&#x27;s skin is different-with all the positive reviews though, it works!</li>
            <li> Since using them, I noticed a positive change in my complexion and no breakouts!</li>
            <li> have found that I have to consistently use the pads 1-2 times a day to keep clear, healthy skin.</li>
            <li> First day, I had a more evened tone, smaller  pores, clean and fresh face.  </li>
            <li> I used it once or twice a day on my whole face, neck and chest after cleansing, and sometimes used it alone to clean my skin.</li>
            <li> These little things are amazing!</li>
            <li> While it has helped prevent major breakouts, my face seems more bumpy.</li>
            <li> Poreless, crystal clear and clean!</li>
            <li> They have even gotten rid of a dry spot that I have never been able to tackle before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Bianca Del Rio for your recommendation!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but after reading so many great reviews I thought it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> After using them for about two months i am noticing a decrease in appearance of fine lines and it has never cause any breakout or reaction and i am very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Within the first week we saw dramatic results without redness and burning and at a great price!!!</li>
            <li> My skin felt clean, smooth, and a little more taught.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a huge acne problem, but my new workout routine was leaving my skin blotchy</li>
            <li> At first I did one a day, but when I knew I was going to breakout like right before my period</li>
            <li> Very soothing and really keep your face toned and smooth.  </li>
            <li> After a couple days of using them (one per day), my face was completely clear and has been easily maintained since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked them so much that I ordered another tub 2 weeks later b/c</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> I think the pads and the oil have actually helped me the most, and my skin has started to look really soft, bright, and younger.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this product and the shipping time was very fast.</li>
            <li> It was okay for me , i did not really notice any significant change</li>
            <li> other day I got an email that said if I leave a 5 star review on Amazon they&#x27;ll send me a free jar of Magic Pads.</li>
            <li> how young I look And how clean and fresh</li>
            <li> I have cystic acne due to PCOS and they have made a huge difference!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend washing your face first and then using the wipes.</li>
            <li> My skin is healthier, brighter and younger looking because of Magic Pads.  </li>
            <li> and my skin looks and feels better overall.</li>
            <li> I love the simple ingredients.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> Thanks to BDR!</li>
            <li> I am now a regular buyer of magic pads</li>
            <li> Currently, my face is acne free!</li>
            <li> I will definitely get more as I have seen the difference since I started using them.</li>
            <li> I first started using pads three times a day, and although I didn&#x27;t see results immediately, I continued trying them.</li>
            <li> After 3 months, my face was finally clear, and my skin was so smooth.</li>
            <li> first time in my life...</li>
            <li> Even after cleansing, I&#x27;m surprised with what these mighty pads pick up.</li>
            <li> I use it first thing in the morning and then before bedtime.  </li>
            <li> The glow to my skin is noticeable to the point that people compliment me on my skin on a regular basis, and mention the healthy shine.  </li>
            <li> after the first week i noticed my skin getting smoother</li>
            <li> my skin is so much better , my pores are smaller and all cleaned up.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from Big Fat Vegan Radio, and I&#x27;m SO glad I did.</li>
            <li> Product does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> Nothing MAGIC here - No different than any of the pads you can pickup at Walmart for $7 or $10</li>
            <li> My teenage son and I have been sharing our Magic Pads and we&#x27;ve both seen improvements.  </li>
            <li> They must have left out the Magic in my jar.</li>
            <li> Left my face glowing. :-)</li>
            <li> I look forward to wiping my face with these pads since they get so much oil off and leave me feeling refreshed!</li>
            <li> These pads leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Bianca Del Rio for the recommendation!</li>
            <li> This works really well!</li>
            <li> They work significantly better than the $40 glycolic acid potions that I tried before; once I use the pads several days go by when I don&#x27;t have to use them, and my skin is radiant and glowing.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Bianca del Rio for posting about them!</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft and smooth to the touch with no redness - safe to use daily on face and neck without drying your skin out too!</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> At first I broke out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve introduced them into my already slightly complicated skincare regimen, and they work perfectly as a pre-treatment step.</li>
            <li> then waiting 15 min to put on a 2.5 peroxide lotion, then 15 more and putting on a regular moisturizing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I defintely need a product with a higher concentration of glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> I really like them!</li>
            <li> It did not improve my scars, but overall I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible by any means, especially for face solutions.</li>
            <li> Of course i didn&#x27;t see change the first time i tried it.</li>
            <li> Thanks Bianca Del Rio for the recommendation!</li>
            <li> I love this product, starting to see improvement already.</li>
            <li> These are an absolute God send!</li>
            <li> I was supposed to receive an extra set of these per &amp;#34;The Magic Pads&amp;#34; email.  </li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> The convenience also has me washing my face more religiously.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been looking for an acne product that consistently works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using The Magic Pads for several months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Bianca DelRio, and when I saw her posting about using the magic pads, I had to have a jar for myself.</li>
            <li> and my skin isnt only clearer but more hydrated and smoother than its been in months.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten rid of my skin regimen (essentially a war chest) and now solely use Magic Pads.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> A family member works for El Rey Networks and saw a few gorgeous stars using it.  </li>
            <li> works on my super stubborn adult acne!!</li>
            <li> They are gentle and not harsh and don&#x27;t have a strong chemical smell like some others.  </li>
            <li> Now a graduate student in college, I needed an easy and gentle way to keep my skin clear with all the stress of work and school.</li>
            <li> Apparently judging by other reviewers, they work great for some people.</li>
            <li> My face feels very clean after using and I pair with a daytime facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;instantly&amp;#34; clearing it up, as I am on my second jar, but I am very confident that it will be clear very soon.</li>
            <li> So far we have felt like these are worth the money!</li>
            <li> However, they do leave your skin feeling soft and clean and didn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> He also likes the way they leave your skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is more even, less oily, and more clear.</li>
            <li> No need to add use lotion after use, they leave your skin feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed at how gentle the product is; I&#x27;m still using a moisturizer, but I&#x27;ve had no drying or uncomfortable peeling.</li>
            <li> The liquid in on pad is not enough to cover whole face so more would be used.</li>
            <li> Not only have the magic pads cleared up my breakouts it has completely made my malasma disappear!!!</li>
            <li> I love the way it leaves your skin clean and tight and is its odorless.</li>
            <li> And I quote &amp;#34; Hannah has been using them and her skin is super soft !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad my face is back to normal!</li>
            <li> The Magic Pads consistently works and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> BEWARE of all the positive reviews</li>
            <li> after one week of using these pads, i think i can tell a positive difference.</li>
            <li> Some positive improvement.</li>
            <li> I have tried a million products and I gave these a shot because of the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I was really patient and consistent with it.</li>
            <li> but I think this is better for my skin long term since it then becomes part of my treatment regimen.</li>
            <li> In the hot sun of summer and the dry wind of winter these pads really are MAGIC.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge change after my FIRST time using them, and received compliments on my skin after the second day.</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t dry my skin out, which I love.</li>
            <li> I suffer from chronic rosacea and as such my skin is easily irritated and reddened with bumps all over my t-zone.</li>
            <li> I have had combination, acne prone, AND super sensitive skin all my life, and have used just about any and every product out there.</li>
            <li> I have been using The Magic Pads for at least two years and it has cleared my skin without drying it out, leaving it feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t recommend it enough if you have trouble skin or just loved to have a clean face</li>
            <li> And very quick and simple to use..</li>
            <li> However, my 11 year old daughter quickly declared them her own.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh plus I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My pores don&#x27;t seem as large, either.</li>
            <li> This has helped me with acne, large pores, and has given me a glow that I haven&#x27;t seen in years.</li>
            <li> These Magic Pads are the first product to completely combat my acne, nourish my skin, and improve its overall look/tone and texture all at once!</li>
            <li> and when I got back my typically unobservant boyfriend comments on how great my skin looked.</li>
            <li> I only use them once a day, but I believe they would be fine if you chose to use them twice a day.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t dry my face out and that&#x27;s pretty easy to do for me.</li>
            <li> After using them I feel clean and fresh but not too oily or too dry either.</li>
            <li> They keep your skin clear and exfoliated, while also keeping it calm and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It really cleans your skin of all residue.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be more careful when reading reviews</li>
            <li> These pads didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my acne prone skin after going through 2 containers of them.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Bianca Del Rio for the recommendation.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> These really helped with acne</li>
            <li> Thanks Bianca Del Rio for the heads-up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problem skin my whole life.</li>
            <li> I no longer get breakouts and have much clearer looking skin.</li>
            <li> This product has really helped solve my breakout issues.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
            <li> I really did like these</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t recommend trying this.</li>
            <li> so I am very picky about what I put on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Look forward to using it, as it leaves skin feeling very refreshed.</li>
            <li> it really works - use it on body blemish&#x3D;prone areas.</li>
            <li> After reading all the raving reviews, I expected more from this product.</li>
            <li> Well these &amp;#34;Magic Pads&amp;#34; are not so magic!&lt;br /&gt;They really strip your face.</li>
            <li> The texture of my skin has really improved and I haven&#x27;t had an acne flare up.  </li>
            <li> I really wish the blackheads on my nose would disappear, but hopefully over time they&#x27;ll go away.  </li>
            <li> Not irritating to skin.</li>
            <li> after 3 weeks I can really see the difference.</li>
            <li> It says you can use 1 or 2 at a time, but they aren&#x27;t very moist.</li>
            <li> Really disapointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne my whole life.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li> So much so that I started using them while on a business trip (3 days)</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My skin has improved so much since I started using these.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest that you try these!</li>
            <li> use one pad at night after cleansing with a gentle hypoallergenic bar, and then apply a alpha-hydroxy moisturizer.</li>
            <li> These pads have cleared my acne at my chin and jawline and have made my skin much smoother.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have nearly as much acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these twice and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference....</li>
            <li> In a week, I noticed a much smoother surface to my face.</li>
            <li> It really minimized the blemishes and made his skin look clearer.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> These pads have really made a difference for my skin.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where its been my whole life.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have an acne problem.</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product, but when it says stay out of the sun, DO IT.</li>
            <li> I broke out on my forehead for about 5 weeks straight</li>
            <li> They really are &amp;#34;Magic Pads.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t deliver what you hoped, you aren&#x27;t out too much money.</li>
            <li> Will absolutely continue to purchase these.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d try this, since my favorite drag queen, Bianca Del Rio recommended it.</li>
            <li> My favorite drag queen Bianca Del Rio endorses them</li>
            <li> and since I don&#x27;t have acne, I can&#x27;t really say I&#x27;ve noticed a difference with my skin.</li>
            <li> It has a cooling tingling effect to it that really makes me feel like it is working.</li>
            <li> already sensitive spots became much more swollen and red after use.</li>
            <li> They are not too harsh, yet effective.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, I love that the ingredient list is short and sourced naturally.</li>
            <li> I started using The Magic Pads nearly a year ago and haven&#x27;t looked back!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and these pads are very gentle.</li>
            <li> These really are magic, they got rid of a pimple on my neck that wouldn&#x27;t go away after trying a lot of other products.  </li>
            <li> I am able to use one side at night and the other side in the morning.</li>
            <li> Always follow beauty advice from an award winning drag queen!</li>
            <li> Easy on the skin but definitely keeps it clear for me!</li>
            <li> I like these, they are easy to use and don&#x27;t dry out my hands/skin like some medications.</li>
            <li> My biggest problem is that the pad&#x27;s dry up very quickly I can not saturate the entirety of my face and don&#x27;t fell like i should have to use two.</li>
            <li> My problem is dullness and these pads really bring out a vibrant complexion.</li>
            <li> That being said, I am about halfway through my first jar and so far, I really like them.</li>
            <li> My breakouts have greatly reduced since using this product, but I have had to start using a moisturizer with this, as it does dry out my skin a little.</li>
            <li> My skin is acne prone but can get dried out very easily as well.</li>
            <li> They are strong enough to do a little exfoliating and leave my face feeing very clean without over-drying it.  </li>
            <li> Works really well for acne highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended and very affordable.</li>
            <li> These have really helped with my adult acne around my chin!!</li>
            <li> Even when I get one or two during shark week it clears up fast with no scarring and my old scars are GONE!!</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive skin, and these don&#x27;t dry my skin out at all.</li>
            <li> The moment I applied the first pad to my face and elbows, I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin felt.</li>
            <li> I am surprised how much make up comes off on the pads AFTER I have cleansed !  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my skin just healed on its own or if these helped at all.</li>
            <li> Much better than your average acne pads.</li>
            <li> the Magic Pads did not stop my breakouts nor did they exfoliate enough to clear any scarring from my old blemishes.</li>
            <li> I used a full set of these pads lasting approx 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Pores look like they did when I was young and skin is so much smoother and brighter!  </li>
            <li> So far I am really liking these pads!</li>
            <li> Since there are so many pads, I use them on the backs of my arms as well and when I use them on my face I bring the pad down across my neck and collar bone.</li>
            <li> and if you don&#x27;t listen to me listen to that famous drag queen-her skin is like buttah!!</li>
            <li> Not only are the convenient and easy (I am lazy), but they also make my skin feel healthy.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t and can&#x27;t live a day without them!  </li>
            <li> Very quick results, you can feel it working without the intense burn you get from some other products.</li>
            <li> My skin is very fickle when it comes to using new products</li>
            <li> Some worked but would eventually over-dry my skin which would then create a whole new problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;ve had less breakouts after using the magic pads.</li>
            <li> Something odd happened to my face when I hit my 30s;  I started to break out more often as though I was a teenager...</li>
            <li> Being 26 now, I still suffer from mild acne and the occasional breakout.</li>
            <li> I suffer from adult, cystic acne primarily on my chin and experience daily breakouts.</li>
            <li> Four days later sun damage and acne scars are noticeably lighter, skin is smooth and completely clear.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is not too harsh (my skin can be sensitive), but effective.</li>
            <li> After only one week of using magic pads after cleansing my face in the morning and night, I see a vast improvement.</li>
            <li> my most recent order seems to have a different formulation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every night, I wash my face with a facial buff pad that has mild Olay cleanser on it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> It is strong enough, yet gentle enough for your face.</li>
            <li> I notice my skin is a little more glowy.  </li>
            <li> These little pads ARE magic.</li>
            <li> Definitely something I will purchase once my first order is over!</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> They actually work exactly as described!</li>
            <li> only wish these came in higher count bottles!</li>
            <li> They soothe but don&#x27;t dry me out And leave my skin super fresh, clear, and soft.</li>
            <li> The Magic Pads have the rare combination of materials that keeps me from breaking out without giving me the dry, patchy skin other products did.</li>
            <li> I saw that Bianca del Rio kept plugging them on her instagram, so I thought, if a drag queen is claiming these are fantastic, then they probably are (considering all the makeup they have to wear.)</li>
            <li> &amp; these pads have been really helpful with healing &amp; exfoliation to clear pores.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find they really work as advertised.  </li>
            <li> She had acne scars that were really making her self conscious.</li>
            <li> It is very cleansing, but not harsh.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with my normal face wash and use the pads afterward.</li>
            <li> I love these and intend on using them everyday for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> So I stopped for a few days until my face got better.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my skin in a few days :)</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend others buying this, it&#x27;s gentle on the skin and works better than I had expected.</li>
            <li> My skin glows, feels fresh, and the occasional pimple I get has been non existent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already used up one container and ordered 2 more a few days ago.</li>
            <li> Her skin looks so much better just after a few days of use.  </li>
            <li> I will post before and after pics once we give it a few more months.</li>
            <li> I totally think they&#x27;re worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have used many products way more expensive than this, but I was pleasantly surprised to find this one works just as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased magic pads for my son and clearly u could tell he has less blackheads and breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these on an every other day basis for nearly a month now and am really pleased so far.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is how instantly my face felt smoother and after a few weeks of daily use, my skin is clearer, my products work more efficiently, and I rarely break out now.</li>
            <li> And if I run out before getting a new jar, my face will start to break out again after about a week.</li>
            <li> I tried a new brand there are tons of glycolic pads.</li>
            <li> Been using twice a day for just under 2 weeks and having got any new break outs</li>
            <li> At this point, I was having a new break out EVERY DAY.</li>
            <li> That sent me to my computer in a hurry to place my new order.  </li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks, I noticed a lot of new acne, but I&#x27;m guessing this is all the clogs coming to the surface as the cells turnover.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m back to finally having my skin look as smooth as a china doll.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Yes, months after trying these pads I spent some more of my time on google and finally checked out their site.</li>
            <li> Bianca Del Rio, most recent winner of Drag Race talked about this product on his facebook feed</li>
            <li> Using these every other night gives me a great glow and helps clear up the small skin-tone bumps on my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was looking for a very gentle daily AHA to help with my hyper-pigmentation and clogged pores and since&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I like these-I have very sensitive acne prone skin  </li>
            <li> I have had acne for about 10 years and have tried everything from drug store products to high end to natural everything</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t cause me to break out before having my skin clear up!</li>
            <li> my skin has never looked so clear!</li>
            <li> I heard about them from Bianca del Rio and am amazed by how clear they keep my skin!</li>
            <li> These all natural pads have made the biggest difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they are magic, but they help my skin.</li>
            <li> I got these with some skepticism, but was pleasantly surprised to find out how well they work!</li>
            <li> My face is FINALLY clearing up, not drying out, and looking so much better-even softer!</li>
            <li> The Magic pads were similar but received rave reviews over the more expensive product.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> All I have to say is WOW!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be working!</li>
            <li> At first, I only used the pads once a day and wasn&#x27;t getting the results that I wanted.  </li>
            <li> this is the first and last time i&#x27;ll buy something because a celeb endorsed it.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Although these haven&#x27;t cured my acne completely, it did solve my cystic acne problems!</li>
            <li> my skin is so soft and my blemish issues have cleared up!</li>
            <li> feel like these would work better for someone who simply suffers from acne or generally clogged pores, as they did make my skin feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Have not used them long enough to give a accurate result fro using the pads.</li>
            <li> My face was breakout free within a week and half</li>
            <li> My pores are less congested, my fine lines are less noticeable, and my overall skin tone &amp; texture is discernibly better.  </li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s a good product but not good enough for my skin.</li>
            <li> I had these two HUGE pimples on either side of my face as well as one on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;Within 3 days of using these every night the redness went down considerably and the pimples shrunk quite a</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> I could tell a distinct difference in the smoothness of my skin within the first couple days, with the added bonus of less oily t-zone issues!</li>
            <li> It does a great job of keeping my skin smooth and gets rid of those stupid little bumps that aren&#x27;t quite full pimples yet.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if they are magic or how much improvement they are actually making on my acne.</li>
            <li> Not only have these pads improved my acne, they also have improved the texture of my skin and diminished old acne scars (I only have the flat red kind, can&#x27;t speak for pitting scars).</li>
            <li> I had some unusual scar tissue right under my bottom lip that embarrassed me and to cover the appearance I&#x27;ve grown my facial hair there for a long time.</li>
            <li> I saw noticeable improvement after the first jar &amp; major improvement after the 2nd.</li>
            <li> These pads make my dull skin look more luminess</li>
            <li> I used them for a few days and my pores got so huge that my face was looking like a pancake.</li>
            <li> No product has ever worked to consistently clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had 3 people compliment my skin, MY skin, saying I looked so refreshed and clear</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get anything to clear</li>
            <li> They began to clear up my skin immediately.  </li>
            <li> After about two days the redness started to clear up.  </li>
            <li> I want clear skin and have it now</li>
            <li> For some crazy reason, I dunno.&lt;br /&gt;3) and most importantly the acne org regimen.</li>
            <li> I was clearly wasting my money elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I use them day and night after washing with salicylic acid cleanser to help clear out my pores.</li>
            <li> I use them morning and night, and they keep my skin clear without drying it out.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft blemishes disappearing rapidly.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, no acne break outs, and my skin tone is even.  </li>
            <li> No fading of old acne scars or anything</li>
            <li> This product has managed to eliminate the frequent breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have to start off by saying I really like these pads and definitely would suggest them.</li>
            <li> I have combination to oily skin, 31 years old, and skin is just slightly sensitive.</li>
            <li> I use twice per day after washing my face and have oily but sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the for the 2nd month, and really have not noticed a change yet.</li>
            <li> and it really does seem to make my pores seem smaller after just two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Made my skin so soft and clear.  </li>
            <li> Also, my skin is too sensitive to use proactiv, or products like it.</li>
            <li> I also like that they are so natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid SO much money for dermatologist appointments, topical and oral medications, and even teas and food to try and fix my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this after I go on my daily runs, and my face feels so much cleaner and smoother than just washing alone.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive mile acne</li>
            <li> but I really needed something to put on the actual skin-</li>
            <li> WOW, buy it.</li>
            <li> Surprised it works so well</li>
            <li> I love these pads because above all else, they&#x27;re made with natural ingredients and aren&#x27;t harsh on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going on 27 years old</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see what the big fuss is about with these &amp;#34;Magic Pads&amp;#34; they did absolutely nothing for my face.</li>
            <li> So I have sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to acne...</li>
            <li> but this is all natural.</li>
            <li> As a 49 year old, I was looking for something that will reduce the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this would do as advertised, however it actually made me break out</li>
            <li> Really gets rid of my breakouts and blackheads that I get occasionally.</li>
            <li> Cleanses and makes my faces feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensative skin and adult acne.</li>
            <li> Second jar and my skin is now HD camera ready.</li>
            <li> Hey, I&#x27;m 60 years old and breakouts are not in my life plan.</li>
            <li> I use them, as well as my 17 year old exchange student.</li>
            <li> For the 17 year old, they have drastically helped with his acne and redness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really found such a noticeable difference in the feel and appearance of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have razor burns on my face and have read that using glycolic acid is a natural way to treat it.  </li>
            <li> Glad I bought it once to at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> FAST results above anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and these didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t feel these were any different than $5.00 drugstore acne pads..</li>
            <li> It is not harsh or drying on the skin at all.</li>
            <li> product is so much easier than getting her to wash her face outside of being in the shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is much smoother and it&#x27;s definitely helped with breakouts!</li>
            <li> I knew he is too young to keep up with using proactive</li>
            <li> and when it was gone it had left darker spots from me picking at it so much.  </li>
            <li> They cause no irritation of my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> They have kept my skin soft and reduced blemishes.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old doesn&#x27;t wear make-up and they have reduced her pre-teen acne quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my 16 year old son and 13 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> So far, it has helped my acne problem.</li>
            <li> and it def is helping my old scars fade.</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth that I&#x27;m wearing foundation a lot less than I used to!  </li>
            <li> My skin always feels clean and tight after using.</li>
            <li> First thing in a long time that has worked for my skin!  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and think that these are actually pretty hydrating.  </li>
            <li> A few months ago my sister gave me these Magic Pads to try as she loved how they not only cleaned but also exfoliated; I was skeptical since I have not only oily but also very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I found this listing on Amazon and saw other people&#x27;s success that I decided to give them a shot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 26 year old male that has struggled with acne since junior high.</li>
            <li> Like I&#x27;m getting more subtle blackheads.</li>
            <li> I normally only get pimples on my t zone, and mainly my chin.</li>
            <li> As an adult female with sensitive skin, I can only use certain ingredients.</li>
            <li> Unlike other pads, these pads don&#x27;t really sting or irritate my face, they actually are pretty soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li> (I have fair skin with red undertones) and I wear less and less make up each week!</li>
            <li> Other pads have a lot of chemicals and feel like you&#x27;re putting alcohol right onto the skin</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to all acne sufferers and will continue to use it regularly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product as an addition to your current face washing routine.</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth now and blemishes are a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> I used up a whole jar for minor breakouts I would get on my chest area and it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent so much time and money on creams,pills and doctor visits!  </li>
            <li> I decided to scrap my entire old routine, and have been using the magic pads along with a gentle non-foaming cleanser and a vitamin-c moisturizer, and I am shocked at how quickly I saw an improvement.</li>
            <li> I have large pores and acne scars and they are getting smaller and smaller each time I use a pad.  </li>
            <li> They are also fragrance free and have very few ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I used this for a whole month and it has helped a little bit with the skin smoothing, but not really anything special.</li>
            <li> I have only used these for a few days and can see a huge difference in my skin already.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t dry my skin out too much.  </li>
            <li> Bought Magic-Pads through amazon.com, after much research, for my teenage son who was battling moderate to severe acne.</li>
            <li> Also, I had to use several each day because there did not seem to be enough liquid on them to do my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> It looks clearer, smaller pores, and much brighter overall!</li>
            <li> Finally starting to see a clear face again!</li>
            <li> I did not have a major problem before, but I notice when I start to get blackheads or a pimple in an area, it seems to subside.  </li>
            <li> I combine this with a mild anti-acne scrub and have found my skin clearing up dramatically after just a week and a half of use!  </li>
            <li> My face has been clear my whole life, until I reached my mid 20&#x27;s and started mysteriously having constant breakouts!</li>
            <li> They make my skin feel very smooth and are not the slightest bit irritating.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed after using this for 3 weeks, not always everyday, my skin seems more clear and less oily.</li>
            <li> and the next morning my old acne that usually takes weeks to fade- had faded significantly over night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 years old, with combination skin (oily in the t-zone, normal cheeks, very dry eye area).  </li>
            <li> I hardly have any blemishes, and my skin feels so smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> This is definitely something I&#x27;ll keep using because when you consider how many pads are in the container, this is actually less expensive than other AHA pads on the market, plus they&#x27;re effective and don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> plus I didn&#x27;t see any skin clarity, brightening, or any other purported positive effects.</li>
            <li> After a week or so of really bad skin, it is now looking great.</li>
            <li> This really does clear up dark blemishes.  </li>
            <li> After only a couple weeks using this product she is almost completely clear.  </li>
            <li> I was suffering from oil patches and blemishes and this cleared my skin up in just a week and left it clear, toned and smoother.</li>
            <li> They help clear up my blemishes, and skin feels tighter and younger.</li>
            <li> My cystic acne would finally be drawn to the surface of my skin and clear</li>
            <li> Definitely helped clear my skin.</li>
            <li> At 31, I still suffer from the occasional break out and hyper-pigmentation of old acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an instant change, but it has completely changed my skin.</li>
            <li> I can only use once a day so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55 years old and skin is looking younger every day.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for two days, but so far it has reduced the redness on my face, and made it smoother.</li>
            <li> There is nothing magical about them; they make acne worse.</li>
            <li> Not magical but not bad either.  </li>
            <li> Having suffered from acne for nearly 20 years, this has been the only thing that has cleared my skin without irritation or redness, did not dry out my skin</li>
            <li> These made a big difference, and quickly (just a few days).</li>
            <li> My skin is combination and very sensitive, and I get blackheads, whiteheads, and the occasional deep cystic pimple.</li>
            <li> They gently exfoliate my sensitive skin, and dry up blemishes, but don&#x27;t dry out my skin .</li>
            <li> Does not dry out your skin!</li>
            <li> I got these without too much hope since nothing has worked thus far, and when I first began using them my skin was worse for about 10 days.</li>
            <li> This product works better for my sensitive skin than any of the other significantly more expensive products that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> If you look at the ingredients, you&#x27;ll notice it is all natural stuff which I really like, as opposed to weird chemicals which is what you find in most other stuff.</li>
            <li> I also like that this brand is made with pretty much mostly, if not all, natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> You can thank Bianca Del Rio for plugging this product on social media.</li>
            <li> Initially, my acne got worse before it got better, however, that was over a 2-3 day period.</li>
            <li> I have found that adult acne is waaaaay more difficult to treat than that of a teenager.</li>
            <li> I did not dry out.</li>
            <li> I think my skin became immune to all of the major acne products because they all share the same chemical ingredients.</li>
            <li> Other products were harsh and less effective.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of all the great reviews and I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> They help fade any dark spots and they really help with fighting blemishes.</li>
            <li> Around my period, I get occasional pimple or two, and the worst part is they take forever healing, but these pads work like magic, the healing only takes a couple days, I love them!</li>
            <li> By far the thing I have done for my skin in a long time!,You will NOT regret trying them.</li>
            <li> I have typically sensitive skin with dryness as a common side effect to any topical agent I apply, but the Magic Pads keep my skin wrapped tight.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these pads if you want to clear up your skin, and want to exfoliate without using harsh chemical products.</li>
            <li> My skin is clear without feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin that always had some patchy dry spots on my cheeks, the sides of my nose, even near my eyes.  </li>
            <li> So far my skin is no better and no worse.</li>
            <li> This was something that heard about from various people via social media.</li>
            <li> My face has been looking much clearer since I started using them; less breakouts, pores even seem smaller.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to get smoother skin mostly because after clearing some breakouts, I had a little bit of an uneven skin tone and some rough spots.</li>
            <li> As an adult with cystic acne and plain old acne</li>
            <li> I recommend this to someone who likes a face product that&#x27;s quick to use and can afford it, but for myself I found a face wash with a few similar ingredients that is half the price and gives very similar results, so in the end I will stick with that.</li>
            <li> I really like that there is no strong scent to these pads</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with acne since high school and these definitely helped tame them.</li>
            <li> But for small pads that last us less than a month, it adds up quick.</li>
            <li> My skin looked pretty dull.</li>
            <li> Daughter is 10 yrs old with forehead with white heads, black head and some on nose.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to not cause a reaction and works hard enough to remove the grime from the day.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive dry skin, and I was worried looking at products that they might dry me out or cause other sensitivity related issues.  </li>
            <li> new skincare introduced to your skin takes a few weeks to show any results, so I waited three weeks before I could claim it worked or not.</li>
            <li> While it hasn&#x27;t completely cured my acne, it&#x27;s making it less noticeable</li>
            <li> My skin is now a lot smoother and clearer, my pores are smaller and it doesn&#x27;t dry me out.</li>
            <li> Has worked wonders on my teenage son&#x27;s skin and doesn&#x27;t dry his skin out.</li>
            <li> Use these daily and they are not too harsh and help my oily skin stay clear.</li>
            <li> A few weeks later and the protruding scar tissue is almost completely gone...</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not sure I would purchase this product again, as I normally use something different to cleanse my face; I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I went through a brief purging phase, and within 3 weeks realized I had NO NEW PIMPLES,</li>
            <li> Cured my embarrassing back acne and keeps my face clear and tight!</li>
            <li> Definitely helps dry up acne and makes it go away faster!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at the improvement of my skin, it looks so much for even toned and vibrant than it did merely a week ago.</li>
            <li> I was prepared to be skeptical but a week later my skin is in much better shape and without some of the rough side effects of other acne medications.</li>
            <li> I have a major hormonal issue though and only usually break out on my chin, these pads have helped immensely!</li>
            <li> After using makeup remover wipes, I apply a magic pad to my face and am always shocked at how much dirt and makeup my makeup wipes have been missing.</li>
            <li> How long dies it take for them to work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used glycolic acid peels before and they have been too harsh for my somewhat sensitive skin, this product is not.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old daughter has been having problems with acne on her forehead for a few months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in this anti-aging battle for a long time.</li>
            <li> I like these pads, overall, but you&#x27;re going to need a lot of them if you have a lot of &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; to be done and for almost $20.00 a pop, no thanks.</li>
            <li> considering I have used these in Minnesota all winter long and didn&#x27;t have any dryness or flaking.  </li>
            <li> My daughters acne has dried up considerably and she is not breaking out.</li>
            <li> It did not clear my acne</li>
            <li> In addition, my skin was dull and dry, and no matter how much I moisturized nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been less than a week, but I&#x27;ve been using them daily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been blessed (and I mean that) with oily skin my whole life and exfoliation has always been my bane.</li>
            <li> I use 2-3 pads in the morning and also at night, so it&#x27;ll get a little pricey and would only last 20 days or so.</li>
            <li> I just finished my second bottle of these little miracle workers and about to order my third.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other tips that helped me... change your pillowcase daily or every other.</li>
            <li> I finally have my acne under control with only the occasional small pimple showing up around the time of my period.</li>
            <li> I was worried that it would dry my skin out, but it doesnt at all.</li>
            <li> Both of our usually dry complexions are hydrated and glowing.  </li>
            <li> As someone with oily, acne prone skin, these pads get the job done but don&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t  dry her skin out.</li>
            <li> My skin feels cleansed and refreshed without feeling dry.</li>
            <li> and they also don&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry after use.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my face out, or burn when using.</li>
            <li> It helped dry up some zits, but nothing beyond that.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews unless something is a total waste of money or totally changed my life.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I don&#x27;t like them as much as the old one.</li>
            <li> I use a single pad once in the morning after cleansing and once in the evening after removing make-up with a make-up removing wipe.  </li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t terrible but I&#x27;ve always had mild acne and as I&#x27;ve gotten older large pores and patchy skin.  </li>
            <li> I use these in conjunction with the acne.org regimen, after the foaming cleanser I wipe my face down and allow to dry before moving on to the next step.</li>
            <li> They changed the actual pad itself and now this product is not useful to me.</li>
            <li> Due to the five star reviews I expected this to actually be &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; but it was not.</li>
            <li> fading scars, decreased pore size, and blackheads were much easier to remove (ah!ah!ah!</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d see at least a small difference,  wasnt expexting too much, but I am using it for weeks now and didn&#x27;t see any!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the pads are different or if it&#x27;s the actually formulation.</li>
            <li> The marionette lines from mouth to chin are less deep.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry</li>
            <li> Gets rid of those tiny little red marks or small pimples, and improved overall tone of face.</li>
            <li> First, these are a little on the expensive side, especially if use several pads per day.</li>
            <li> Since then I have tried numerous products with little to no relief.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like every other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I never had severe acne, but I had bad hormonal breakouts and giant bumps under my skin that hurt and never seemed to go away (chin and jawline, primarily).</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t a horrible product but isn&#x27;t a great one either.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this product would be something that would help me clear up or at least lessen my flareups, but alas, I didn&#x27;t really see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After having not had acne since I was a teenager, I suddenly found myself having constant breakouts in my late 20s.</li>
            <li> Use carefully, they stick together.</li>
            <li> There were absolutely no results with this.</li>
            <li> On my cheeks, forehead, chin, every week a different trouble spot.</li>
            <li> only used them for a few days</li>
            <li> Will buy again when product is empty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with cystic acne, breakouts and redness for the last few years - out of nowhere - and I&#x27;ve tried everything:</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no tingling sensation at all or improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li> When you need to find a product that helps cure and prevent breakouts, you go to one source: drag queens.</li>
            <li> my skin looks brighter and smoother after only few applies of this pads.  </li>
            <li> I actually ran out for a few days and think it is no coincidence that I broke out when I was without them.  </li>
            <li> I was curious if this would work.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so be wary of using these if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them if you&#x27;re having acne problems or dull skin, they are even reducing my sun spots!</li>
            <li> This jar will last me less than a month!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and in the past I used harsh washes and creams that would cause dryness and redness.</li>
            <li> certainly not &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts, my face is a little less red</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive combination skin and have found it difficult to find products that don&#x27;t further irritate my skin!</li>
            <li> I have used this 1-2 times daily for the past 4 weeks&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I suppose there is a &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; of the skin that occurs with these sometimes due to the glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the big rave is over these pads.</li>
            <li> Noticed no difference than other brands (including store brands)</li>
            <li> The results are extremely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them once a day or once every other day.</li>
            <li> I wish that I had deeper into some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I started using them every other day, now every day.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was looking for but helped.</li>
            <li> I am using them every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a person that has oily skin and is prone to breakouts but had problems with other medications drying my skin out.</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first but decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> The pads are very rough on surface</li>
            <li> Was having some trouble with clogged pores due to extra humidity in the air this year, but didn&#x27;t want anything too harsh.</li>
            <li> I am tired of having a new pimple every time I turn around.</li>
            <li> The Pads are for after makeup / with acids for brown spots / wrinkles / it not too harsh on my skin so face don&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> Not only did these pads not help with my face - they actually made it worse.</li>
            <li> It also gets off the extra make up on my face that simply washing with my face soap and water leaves behind.</li>
            <li> I love how they make my face feel and don&#x27;t leave behind a residue or a weird smell.</li>
            <li> I have always had troubled skin, and a life-time of studying and experimenting with diet and lifestyle have not left me completely adult-acne-free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about washing your face, twice a day for roughly 10 seconds (crazy, right?)</li>
            <li> It dried my skin out a little bit, and maybe helped active acne heal a little bit faster, but not enough for me to want to buy this product again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as if the constant layer of dull skin is now stripped.</li>
            <li> Product shipped fast, unfortunately did nothing for my acne.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is different but give it at least a week to see changes in your skin.</li>
            <li> I do think they aren&#x27;t as dark.  </li>
            <li> not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> have always had quite a few small blackheads on my forehead and would occasionally have some pimples pop up.</li>
            <li> one and only complaint is the price.</li>
            <li> My dark spots are fading away.</li>
            <li> I like it, not too harsh on my skin, but it has gotten rid of any rough patches.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of use my blackheads have decreased, I don&#x27;t have any pimples, my pores look smaller, and my normally dry skin is no longer requiring moisturizer.</li>
            <li> But all I can say is for once, i have not been let down.</li>
            <li> My pores went down as well</li>
            <li> Many of my friends and family that I&#x27;ve turned on to these will be very disappointed with their next order, you can bet.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that it is too expensive for my tight budget with the other beauty products I already like to buy regularly.</li>
            <li> I use these everyday, partnered with my other organics line.  </li>
            <li> it would either break me out more or dry out my skin so bad it would flake off and look even worse.</li>
            <li> : it is softer and smoother with visibly less blackheads.</li>
            <li> I typically used Glycolix pads but wanted to try these instead.</li>
            <li> The redness is reducing and the spot is fading in less than a month.</li>
            <li> and I had less discoloration.</li>
            <li> Maybe I broke out less while using?</li>
            <li> Seriously killing bacteria, however they&#x27;re not a daily face wash.</li>
            <li> Also purchased this for my teenager, who saw benefits in less than a week.</li>
            <li> No results like previous customers...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for less than a week and the difference is already so noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I also see less breakouts on my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li> areas where I previously had</li>
            <li> Blackheads are less noticeable; skin is moisturized, not oily.</li>
            <li> These have replaced my previous salicylic acid product that I had been using for years.  </li>
            <li> , I use to wake up with maybe 5-6 active pimples everyday</li>
            <li> It has been a hard and long battle with my skin, and I&#x27;ve literally tried everything you can buy for treating acne over the years.</li>
            <li> Ill finish the last few pads I have left but wont rebuy.</li>
            <li> After a little while the product does lose effectiveness even if capped tightly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad because people like us suffered long enough then get screwed over and over and over</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with these little deals</li>
            <li> and I think my skin just looks a little healthier.</li>
            <li> and I see a little difference.</li>
            <li> These may be a little pricey</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen fewer breakouts, and my skin seems clearer and a little tighter.  </li>
            <li> They work about as well as any other acne pad I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Bought them from my little brother struggling with acne he loves them already.</li>
            <li> now I just use a little concealer and a translucent powder.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it everyday because of that.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as I have suffered from acne since I was 14 years old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with acne issues for a few years...</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter who has been battling acne for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin will look like in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> waste of money gave me.more blemish</li>
            <li> I never had acne until I was about 20, and it has gradually gotten worse over the last 4 years.</li>
            <li> My kids have been using them and in a few days you can see the difference .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on bc, taking vitamin a and zinc supplements everyday, which are helping</li>
            <li> Even worse, I pulled it out to use it after storing it under the sink in my bathroom for a couple weeks, ( there were about 4 or 5 pads left) and now there is funky colored mold on it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few days now</li>
            <li> I am a senior citizen and my face is getting blotchy and uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I like the texture on the pads andtuse them everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m off to try another round of accutane.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now tried these pads for a few months.</li>
            <li> Been using them for a few weeks and my skin looks smoother.  </li>
            <li> About two years ago I completely changed my skincare routine and became obsessed with AHA and BHA exfoliants.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to waste one bit.</li>
            <li> WASTE of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I noticed results after just a few days.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is tired of all those breakouts.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I can atest that it does.</li>
            <li> and they aren&#x27;t as harsh as some pads and my skin has started to improve.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t use harsh ingredients on your acne skin, give this a try.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy these as part of my everyday skin routine.</li>
            <li> My skin does not feel irritated or dried out after I use these pads</li>
            <li> I imagine it was due to hormonal changes in my late 20&#x27;s, which was the pits.</li>
            <li> May not work for you, or may cause a temporary response wherein toxins make their way to the skin&#x27;s surface and create little pustules (I have read a small percentage of reports claiming this), but for me there have been no unwanted side-effects.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually get small little pimples along my forehead from wearing a baseballl cap all day.  </li>
            <li> I unfortunately have bad skin and have tried sooo many products.</li>
            <li> My acne isn&#x27;t totally gone, but I don&#x27;t have problems with excessive redness or with painful cystic acne clusters anymore, which is enough of an improvement to warrant a 4-star review from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone with oily or dull skin or anyone looking to give their skin a little pick me up.</li>
            <li> It cleans dirt and my makeup off well...but did very little to get rid of blemishes.</li>
            <li> I really hope this is a bad batch</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t feel too harsh and I like that!</li>
            <li> Literally wipes away the dirty old layer of skin.  </li>
            <li> My existing breakouts are vanishing and no more have appeared.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about these actually working.</li>
            <li> No more skin problems,</li>
            <li> Not sure what to think.  </li>
            <li> And although I thought I would be past breakouts at this age, I&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li> and no more blackheads.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> im not sure there is anything on them except water.</li>
            <li> No magic here.......</li>
            <li> Broke my face out, weird since I do a regular glycolic peel once every 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Not sure how my wife came across these, but she did and ordered a canister</li>
            <li> Had quite a few blackheads on my nose, those are fading away slowly.</li>
            <li> At the time I started this product about 1 month ago, I was very concerned about how bad my skin had become, and was seriously considering another trip to the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Left a bad impression with me, therefore, review is knocked down to 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for quite awhile and have a hard time finding something that works.</li>
            <li> These may help with acne and skin texture but its hard to tell a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I decided not to leave a review until I had been using these for, at least, a week.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and grab at least two of these.</li>
            <li> The pads used to be textured and thick so that they would help with blackheads.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been slow</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slow to emerge difference</li>
            <li> No more large painful bumps!</li>
            <li> I decided to try these out after having some issues with my skin because I was unable to always wash my face due to health issues/bedridden.</li>
            <li> Not magical at all, I&#x27;m sorry I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> They do not have an unpleasant smell and they make my face feel like I actually got everything off of it.</li>
            <li> The pad is very small and does not have an exfoliating texture.</li>
            <li> No medication, no more dermatologist, no more expensive prescriptions.</li>
            <li> Not only that, but any break outs or annoying bumps started clearing up within a few days, as well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these pads did nothing to help my acne and even made be break out a little as well.</li>
            <li> (little obsessed, I know.)</li>
            <li> I am sorry I wasted my money on these pads.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m EXTREMELY disappointed and sending them back for a refund.</li>
            <li> When I first started using the pads I had horrible persistent acne on my jawline.</li>
            <li> In the past year I have been suffering from horrible adult acne, I swear I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there-</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blame the product though, as its hormonal acne that&#x27;s tough to combat...</li>
            <li> But then I thought I&#x27;d try again because I&#x27;ve never used a product that made my face worse</li>
            <li> A bunch of poor saps are paid hourly to leave reviews for products like these.</li>
            <li> &amp; I think it has decreased # of pimples, as well as redness.</li>
            <li> However, my skin broke out worse than ever.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> my skin unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;ve received an IMPOSTER or what, but you&#x27;ve gone from 50 to 60 pads and the TEXTURE IS ALL WRONG.</li>
            <li> - they are obviously fake.</li>
            <li> I knew that I needed a product that didn&#x27;t require a lot of complicated steps, and this is it.  </li>
            <li> Was not impressed.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but decided to give them a try.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> but I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s troubled skin is healing</li>
            <li> recommend you give this a try, even if it seems expensive.</li>
            <li> Now it is a very thin non-textured pad.</li>
            <li> It was very frustrating.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed that the formula is so weak.</li>
            <li> I had suffered from bad skin and terrible acne all through my teenage years.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid to rub on my face</li>
            <li> My pores are crazy...</li>
            <li> I was afraid to run out.  </li>
            <li> No noticing a difference with my skin :(&lt;br /&gt;Might don&#x27;t think they are &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; but they are expensive.</li>
            <li> Try them, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> WRONG MOVE!</li>
            <li> even the product given to me by a very expensive dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Bad.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my son because he has been breaking out extremely bad.</li>
            <li> $20 bucks for 50 pads isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> (My skin gets severely dried-out and cracks painfully.)</li>
            <li> Like gigantic, cystic, painful, and</li>
            <li> oh so ugly zits.</li>
            <li> Week 2 and no change... Disappointed</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed I promise.</li>
            <li> Contains glycolic acid, organic willow bark, hyaluronic acid and vitamin E in an organic aloe vera juice base.</li>
            <li> If you have bad scarring, try using in conjunction with tamanu oil!</li>
            <li> But when I used this, I was shocked!</li>
            <li> if I hated them, my niece would like them (y&#x27;know...).  </li>
            <li> These are worthless!</li>
            <li> The worst of all worlds.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it!  It really cleans your skin of all residue.  I use it at night before my serums.</li>
            <li> This one isn&#x27;t any magic. It doesn&#x27;t work at all. I&#x27;m going to be more careful when reading reviews cos some companies they write reviews for their products.</li>
            <li> This product really is magic! I wanted to start using these cos I saw that Bianca del Rio kept plugging them on her instagram, so I thought, if a drag queen is claiming these are fantastic, then they probably are (considering all the makeup they have to wear.) I decided not to leave a review until I had been using these for, at least, a week. I love them. My skin is very fickle when it comes to using new products but cos of the willow bark and the light usage of glycolic acid my skin has improved! In just a week it cleared up spots that I had and my skin looks and feels clean. As for people claiming there isn&#x27;t enough solution in these, I beg to differ. I actually use one pad twice before I toss it. I wash my face with my normal face wash and use the pads afterward. I am able to use one side at night and the other side in the morning. These aren&#x27;t meant to be used as makeup remover wipes, but more like astringent wipes. I would recommend washing your face first and then using the wipes.</li>
            <li> I like these, they are easy to use and don&#x27;t dry out my hands/skin like some medications. I am not sure if they are magic or how much improvement they are actually making on my acne. Use carefully, they stick together.</li>
            <li> Omg I love these!!! I have only had these for two days. My face is already clearing up. I can&#x27;t wait to see what these truly magic pads do for my skin in a week. Looking forward to clear beautiful skin. Will be buying again and again.My skin is soft blemishes disappearing rapidly. Extremely happy customer</li>
            <li> What a great product! Gentle enough to not cause a reaction and works hard enough to remove the grime from the day. Bianca Del Rio (thank you, Queen!) may have recommended them, but I&#x27;ll definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Magic Pads for over two months and I&#x27;ve noticed a tremendous difference in my skin: it is softer and smoother with visibly less blackheads. Additionally, my complexion has never looked better! I have typically sensitive skin with dryness as a common side effect to any topical agent I apply, but the Magic Pads keep my skin wrapped tight. Just apply an SPF moisturizer after use and you&#x27;re good for the day!</li>
            <li> I have used these pads for a while.  They do amazing things for my skin.  My skin is healthier, brighter and younger looking because of Magic Pads.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Awesome buy! Bianca del Rio uses ther and I figured if it works for her, why not? And boy does it work!!!</li>
            <li> Reaaly like these glycolic pads. My skin feels softer with better texture so I would recommend. Arrived fine.</li>
            <li> Blame it on Bianca Del Rio!  I bought these because she has perfect skin.  I thought &amp;#34;What the heck&amp;#34;,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, these things work!  My skin is soft, no acne break outs, and my skin tone is even.  Easy to use and I saw a change in about a week.  Love them!</li>
            <li> These pads didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my acne prone skin after going through 2 containers of them. After seeing such good reviews I was hoping for a near magical experience. However, they do leave your skin feeling soft and clean and didn&#x27;t break me out. However, I saw no results.</li>
            <li> I have used this 1-2 times daily for the past 4 weeks&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;1. Helps control oily skin&lt;br /&gt;2. Skin texture is softer&lt;br /&gt;3. Does not smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1. Price is high&lt;br /&gt;2. No fading of old acne scars or anything</li>
            <li> Works great! My skin always feels clean and tight after using. I have noticed after using this for 3 weeks, not always everyday, my skin seems more clear and less oily. I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Feels like a good product, but causes mild-to-medium irritation for my sensitive skin. I wouldn&#x27;t use it everyday because of that.</li>
            <li> Product shipped fast, unfortunately did nothing for my acne.</li>
            <li> With the arrival of hot weather here, these feel really refreshing. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with acne to begin with, so I can&#x27;t speak to their effectiveness for that, but they exfoliate nicely and my skin looks and feels better overall.</li>
            <li> There were absolutely no results with this. Not magical at all, I&#x27;m sorry I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> The magic pads have made a noticeable difference in my complexion! They are effective but gentle and really helped with stress breakouts!!</li>
            <li> Great product. I have oily/combination acne prone skin, and these have helped with breakouts immensely. Love!</li>
            <li> I like using this type of product because it&#x27;s quick and easy.  I also like that this brand is made with pretty much mostly, if not all, natural ingredients.  They are gentle and not harsh and don&#x27;t have a strong chemical smell like some others.  Definitely clearing up my skin.</li>
            <li> These are great and easy AND gentle. Both my pre-teen kids use them and once and a while I steal one for myself for a freshening mini peel . Love &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> I am an Esthetician and was looking for a glycolic pad that would be good for most everyone. This is great!  I love the simple ingredients. Not too much tingle just refreshing. Makes skin clean!! I&#x27;m happy with the magic pads!</li>
            <li> This product is nothing short of MAGIC! Cured my embarrassing back acne and keeps my face clear and tight! I have recommended them and given them as gifts. Everyone has raved how well they work! I&#x27;m a make up artist and theyre in my bag of tricks always!</li>
            <li> These Magic Pads are amazing as they helped cleared a lot of my acne when my prescription acne medication were not helping.</li>
            <li> Love the magic pads!! Have been using it for a week now and I love it! My skin looks and feels good! Havent had any more breakouts since I started using. I would highly recommend this product. 😊</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for quite awhile and have a hard time finding something that works. I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;ve had less breakouts after using the magic pads. While it hasn&#x27;t completely cured my acne, it&#x27;s making it less noticeable which is an improvement over everything else</li>
            <li> Does not dry out your skin! My skin is so smooth now and blemishes are a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> Bought Magic-Pads through amazon.com, after much research, for my teenage son who was battling moderate to severe acne. Other products were harsh and less effective. Within the first week we saw dramatic results without redness and burning and at a great price!!! Thank you Amazon!!!  Thank you Magic-Pads!!!</li>
            <li> This was something that heard about from various people via social media. I was skeptical as I have suffered from acne since I was 14 years old. Being 26 now, I still suffer from mild acne and the occasional breakout. I absolutely love Magic Pads. Not only are the convenient and easy (I am lazy), but they also make my skin feel healthy. I have very sensitive skin, and in the past I used harsh washes and creams that would cause dryness and redness. Magic Pads feel very mild and refreshing. In the morning I use a noncomedogenic wash in the shower and Magic Pads after. When I use the Magic Pads, there is still dirt on my face. It&#x27;s amazing. Magic Pads restored balance, glow, and general happiness to my skin. I still, on occasion, break out, but when I use Magic Pads, the redness is significantly reduce and the heal time is practically doubled. I think I am a customer for life!</li>
            <li> I saw that Bianca Del Rio used them and thought hey, why not. Nothing else was working. These actually worked, which is marvelous. They don&#x27;t work perfectly, nothing does, but my skin is definitely smoother and nicer and it&#x27;s pretty great. They also don&#x27;t dry my skin out, which I love. They&#x27;re definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> It really works! My skin has gotten clearer and my acne scars have faded! Thanks to BDR! I am now a regular buyer of magic pads</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with these little deals</li>
            <li> These pads are very refreshing.  I use them after a work out to remove the gunk from my pores.  I love the tingle sensation when I use them.  I notice my skin is a little more glowy.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love using this product and my skin has never felt smoother and softer since I began using The Magic Pads.  I can&#x27;t wait to get more!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical. The key word here being &amp;#34;was.&amp;#34; I am a former, dedicated Proactiv customer until the product stopped working after years of use. Since then I have tried numerous products with little to no relief. I have been using The Magic Pads for two weeks and can say, honestly, that they are working. I suffer from adult, cystic acne primarily on my chin and experience daily breakouts. This product has managed to eliminate the frequent breakouts. Initially, my acne got worse before it got better, however, that was over a 2-3 day period. Currently, my face is acne free! I use a single pad once in the morning after cleansing and once in the evening after removing make-up with a make-up removing wipe.  I highly recommend this product to all acne sufferers and will continue to use it regularly.</li>
            <li> People tell me all the time how young I look And how clean and fresh my face looks.  I believe it&#x27;s thanks to Magic Pads! I will definitely get more as I have seen the difference since I started using them.</li>
            <li> I have to start off by saying I really like these pads and definitely would suggest them. If you look at the ingredients, you&#x27;ll notice it is all natural stuff which I really like, as opposed to weird chemicals which is what you find in most other stuff. Unlike other pads, these pads don&#x27;t really sting or irritate my face, they actually are pretty soothing to my skin. The results I&#x27;ve seen since using them are pretty good. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts, my face is a little less red and I think my skin just looks a little healthier. Overall, this is without a doubt a very good product that I highly recommend whether you have acne or not, these pads will definitely make your face look better.</li>
            <li> I was so hoping these would work, but not even these can control my acne.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my son, has helped tremendously....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using First Aid Beauty&#x27;s Facial Radiance (very pricey!), and found these Magic Pads to be an amazing substitute. Will be buying these again and again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product :-)</li>
            <li> A very important step to cleaning your face. Makes your skin glow....Great product.. thank you ☺</li>
            <li> Nothing magic about them</li>
            <li> I typically used Glycolix pads but wanted to try these instead. They&#x27;re ok but i notice a bigger difference with the Glycolix pads. Won&#x27;t order these again.&lt;br /&gt;(The one advantage i do like about these is that the pads are a bit thicker and are great little exfoliaters.)</li>
            <li> Came quickly and works better than drugstore brands</li>
            <li> Love it!  Leaves your face feeling refreshed!</li>
            <li> UPDATE: They changed the actual pad itself and now this product is not useful to me. The pads used to be textured and thick so that they would help with blackheads. Now it is a very thin non-textured pad. I am sending it back and looking for another product. //  Original Review: This product was by no means &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; for me as claimed. It did improve my blackheads a lot so I may use it again. But for the price, it&#x27;s a lot to pay for only addressing one issue. It did not help with my blemishes, acne, age spots, or to &amp;#34;smooth and tighten&amp;#34; my skin unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Works really well for acne highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I love these. Was having some trouble with clogged pores due to extra humidity in the air this year, but didn&#x27;t want anything too harsh. These made a big difference, and quickly (just a few days). Also noticed a really nice change in my skin tone as well (have some sun spots that like to pop up every year.) I have combination to oily skin, 31 years old, and skin is just slightly sensitive.</li>
            <li> No noticing a difference with my skin :(&lt;br /&gt;Might don&#x27;t think they are &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; but they are expensive.</li>
            <li> Easy on the skin but definitely keeps it clear for me! These don&#x27;t feel too harsh and I like that! Other pads have a lot of chemicals and feel like you&#x27;re putting alcohol right onto the skin but these do not sting at all!</li>
            <li> This product has changed my life and my skin forever. I won&#x27;t and can&#x27;t live a day without them!  Poreless, crystal clear and clean!</li>
            <li> Works great! I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> ***UPDATE*** I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;ve received an IMPOSTER or what, but you&#x27;ve gone from 50 to 60 pads and the TEXTURE IS ALL WRONG. See the picture. They are no longer textured and exfoliating, they are just smooth pads and don&#x27;t seem to be the real deal at all. i&#x27;m EXTREMELY disappointed and sending them back for a refund. Many of my friends and family that I&#x27;ve turned on to these will be very disappointed with their next order, you can bet. I really hope this is a bad batch and it will be remedied post haste. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**OLD REVIEW**I am astonished. I&#x27;ve been blessed (and I mean that) with oily skin my whole life and exfoliation has always been my bane. This stuff does it. It&#x27;s as if the constant layer of dull skin is now stripped. I shipped some to my son as well and he&#x27;s over the moon about it. I too found out from Bianca del Rio. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> The name says it all,  it works like magic.</li>
            <li> Love these! Truly magic! I get acne once a month and this is the best way to get rid of them!</li>
            <li> I wish I could say I experienced &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; results with these pads, but my daughter and I both used them and didn&#x27;t find them any more effective than similar pads we had been using by Neutrogenia, just 3x more expensive.  That&#x27;s not to say they didn&#x27;t work at all, just that they didn&#x27;t work any better. Apparently judging by other reviewers, they work great for some people.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, and I am so in love. When I first started using the pads I had horrible persistent acne on my jawline. No product has ever worked to consistently clear up my skin. I first started using pads three times a day, and although I didn&#x27;t see results immediately, I continued trying them. After 3 months, my face was finally clear, and my skin was so smooth. That&#x27;s when I knew I was hooked.&lt;br /&gt;I have found that I have to consistently use the pads 1-2 times a day to keep clear, healthy skin. And if I run out before getting a new jar, my face will start to break out again after about a week. I find it very helpful to use a good exfoliating face scrub each day helps as well. The pads are a topical treatment, not an exfoliating product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just so glad that after years of dealing with acne, I found a product that can keep my face so much clearer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> These are incredible! They changed my skin in ONE DAY (not kidding) and I&#x27;m never looking back. I use twice per day after washing my face and have oily but sensitive skin. They soothe but don&#x27;t dry me out And leave my skin super fresh, clear, and soft.</li>
            <li> Believe it! This stuff is the real deal.  First day, I had a more evened tone, smaller  pores, clean and fresh face.  Four days later sun damage and acne scars are noticeably lighter, skin is smooth and completely clear.  Literally wipes away the dirty old layer of skin.  Excellent stuff.</li>
            <li> I like that it is not too harsh (my skin can be sensitive), but effective. Gets rid of those tiny little red marks or small pimples, and improved overall tone of face.</li>
            <li> I am a beauty addict and have tried so many products - these are one of the best for keeping not-so-perfect skin beautiful!  They are very gentle but highly effective and I recommend them if you have moderate acne.  They are also an excellent value (you get 50 pads).  I only use them once a day, but I believe they would be fine if you chose to use them twice a day.  I&#x27;m a believer...</li>
            <li> My face has been clear my whole life, until I reached my mid 20&#x27;s and started mysteriously having constant breakouts! On my cheeks, forehead, chin, every week a different trouble spot. It was very frustrating. My friend told me about magic pads and I was a bit sceptical of any \\&quot;miracle product,\\&quot; but decided to give it a shot. After only one week of using magic pads after cleansing my face in the morning and night, I see a vast improvement. My existing breakouts are vanishing and no more have appeared. I would definitely recommend this product. I&#x27;m amazed at the improvement of my skin, it looks so much for even toned and vibrant than it did merely a week ago. Will definitely be recommending to friends and family!</li>
            <li> Works great.  I would get cists like pimples on my face.  I saw awesome results in just one week.. I had tried Skin ID Proactive anything I could try I did.  Nothing worked magic like magic pads.</li>
            <li> These have helped improve the condition and smoothness of my skin but I do not think they are the miracle some reviewers are describing. I have been using them about 3 weeks now and while I have seen pore reductions and overall clarity improve- my acne prone skin still has breakouts. I use this in conjunction with La Roche Posay Purifying Gel Cleanser and Effaclar DUO on alternating days.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! They&#x27;ve helped my skin quite a bit. I&#x27;ve been dealing with acne issues for a few years...first time in my life...&amp; these pads have been really helpful with healing &amp; exfoliation to clear pores. I use them every day.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the pads.  They were nicely saturated and just the right size for my face and neck.  Performance wise they were also surprisingly good. . Keeps the oil at bay without aggravating my skin.  My skin is now smoother and softer and no breakouts.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t burn. I&#x27;m not breaking out from it. No scent. Guess it&#x27;s fine with me :-)</li>
            <li> The Magic Pads are okay.  I&#x27;m using the for the 2nd month, and really have not noticed a change yet.</li>
            <li> I feel like another reviewer stated.  I thought that these pads would be life changing for me. Lol. They are not.  How long dies it take for them to work.  It&#x27;s been 2 1/2 weeks now and I see a little difference.</li>
            <li> I use one at night before bed and they are gentle yet effective.  I have tan oily skin fairly blemish free except for a little mild rosacea and a sun spot.  The redness is reducing and the spot is fading in less than a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical...about everything...but these are really amazing. Thanks to Bianca Del Rio for the recommendation. The moment I applied the first pad to my face and elbows, I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin felt. Even after cleansing, I&#x27;m surprised with what these mighty pads pick up.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter who has been battling acne for a few years now.  After only a couple weeks using this product she is almost completely clear.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I found to clear my skin</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about these actually working. Bianca Del Rio swore by them so I figured I&#x27;d give them a try. They&#x27;re almost too easy to use. Nothing has ever worked this well at clearing up my skin. It also doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like every other product I&#x27;ve tried. I can&#x27;t praise these enough. I&#x27;m telling everyone I know about them. Buy them, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!!! I was suffering from oil patches and blemishes and this cleared my skin up in just a week and left it clear, toned and smoother. Very happy and satisfied</li>
            <li> The Pads are for after makeup / with acids for brown spots / wrinkles / it not too harsh on my skin so face don&#x27;t dry out. Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Great product.  I use it first thing in the morning and then before bedtime.  I really like the way it cleans my face and leave my skin smooth.  Hurry !!  Get one or two !!!</li>
            <li> I am cheap when it comes to buying products like this and never believe in the claims they make. But all I can say is for once, i have not been let down. Love the pads and planning on continuing to use them.</li>
            <li> These little things are amazing! My skin is acne prone but can get dried out very easily as well. These really helped with acne I already had with inflammation and redness and they go away a lot quicker. They are also great at preventing future breakouts! At first I did one a day, but when I knew I was going to breakout like right before my period I would go up to two. I also wipe them on the back of my arms for my keratosis pilaris and it has helped a lot! I am so glad I came across these. Before I found these my skin was more congested than it had ever been and the magic pads have truly helped get my skin under control!</li>
            <li> I have only used these for a few days and can see a huge difference in my skin already.  I have large pores and acne scars and they are getting smaller and smaller each time I use a pad.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin will look like in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Got a jar for my daughter and granddaughter to try.  Asked them today how they liked them.  And I quote &amp;#34; Hannah has been using them and her skin is super soft ! They make my skin feel freshy and clean !&amp;#34; So I have just ordered 2 more jars.  Thanks Bianca Del Rio for the heads-up.</li>
            <li> Works great! No wrinkles here! Again if its good for the drag queens its good for me!</li>
            <li> These are worthless! I noticed no difference in the texture of my skin and no decrease in acne. Also, I had to use several each day because there did not seem to be enough liquid on them to do my whole face and neck. This jar will last me less than a month!</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing.  The glow to my skin is noticeable to the point that people compliment me on my skin on a regular basis, and mention the healthy shine.  Spectacular!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using it a week or so it does pretty good</li>
            <li> Seems to keep my breakouts under control.  I did not have a major problem before, but I notice when I start to get blackheads or a pimple in an area, it seems to subside.  I can see the dirt marks on the pad.  It&#x27;s more convenient than glycolic acid in a vial, but since it&#x27;s not as strong, would be applied much more often.  I use 2-3 pads in the morning and also at night, so it&#x27;ll get a little pricey and would only last 20 days or so.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had skin problems for years, but tried these when I suddenly began to experience blemishes. I was surprised to find they really work as advertised.  They leave your skin feeling super clean and tighter. No more skin problems, but I think I&#x27;ll keep using them to make sure it stays that way.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these! My skin is so smooth and soft! Thank you Bianca Del Rio. These really are magic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problem skin my whole life. And these &amp;#34;simple&amp;#34; cleansing pads truly are &amp;#34;magic.&amp;#34; And I take them with me no matter where I go in the country! :)</li>
            <li> I love The Magic Pads! I use them about three to four times a week at night and use a benzoyl peroxide lotion the rest of the time. Using these every other night gives me a great glow and helps clear up the small skin-tone bumps on my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li> Best astringent pads! These may be a little pricey but they are totally worth it. I&#x27;ve suffered with acne for about 15 years now. I have found that adult acne is waaaaay more difficult to treat than that of a teenager. I have tried tons of things. I have very sensitive combination skin and have found it difficult to find products that don&#x27;t further irritate my skin! These all natural pads have made the biggest difference in my skin! Please give these a try! Everyone&#x27;s skin is different but give it at least a week to see changes in your skin. Not only have these pads improved my acne, they also have improved the texture of my skin and diminished old acne scars (I only have the flat red kind, can&#x27;t speak for pitting scars). These are a must have staple for me. I use these in conjunction with the acne.org regimen, after the foaming cleanser I wipe my face down and allow to dry before moving on to the next step.</li>
            <li> waste of money gave me.more blemish</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Glycolic acid pads and these are great - gentle on my face and it really does seem to make my pores seem smaller after just two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Came across this awesome product via Bianca Del Rio. I have been using every day since then, and my skin has cleared, and looks better than ever. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My bf says my skin look tighter and brighter&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> Magic pads are magical!</li>
            <li> Great product! Arrived promptly and sealed. I&#x27;m not sure if they are magic, but they help my skin.</li>
            <li> The best pads I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;My pores seem smaller and skin is smoother!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! A big improvement for my skin, will definitely order them again!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Works wonders.  Made my skin so soft and clear.  Highly Recommended and very affordable.</li>
            <li> The real reason I know The Magic Pads really work are through the compliments I have received from friends and family about how much better my face looks since I started using them. I no longer get breakouts and have much clearer looking skin. Shout out to Bianca Del Rio for putting the word out about this product!</li>
            <li> These little pads ARE magic. They work great and are so easy to use. I am surprised how much make up comes off on the pads AFTER I have cleansed !  Give them a try.  Who doesn&#x27;t want their night time cleansing and moisturizing routine to be easier and produced better skin ?</li>
            <li> Great pads. My daughter likes them a lot.</li>
            <li> It works great, and goes on without leaving my skin oily.</li>
            <li> Bianco Del Rio has been telling me to try these so i finally did!!! why did i wait! after the first week i noticed my skin getting smoother and I had less discoloration. after two weeks my skin looked and felt even better. I love these and intend on using them everyday for the rest of my life. so if you are thinking about trying them- listen to me they r great and if you don&#x27;t listen to me listen to that famous drag queen-her skin is like buttah!! love magic pads</li>
            <li> This product has really helped solve my breakout issues. I have used about 15 pads already and it has worked a charm on my face and has made me even more confidence. Definitely something I will purchase once my first order is over!</li>
            <li> After one week of use I can see noticeable changes in my skins texture. My skins looks brighter and feels smoother. I will definetly be reordering.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really do much for me. I went through 2 packages of it, and I guess it made my face feel clean-- but a lot of things can do that. But I still had my blackheads, pimples, etc. Maybe I broke out less while using? But I just wasn&#x27;t impressed enough to buy it again. I was really patient and consistent with it. I don&#x27;t know what all these 5 star reviews are talking about....</li>
            <li> Affordable alternative to the Bliss Incredi-peels at Sephora. Love&#x27;em</li>
            <li> I really did like these but the result doesn&#x27;t justify the price. I can get more uses from My La Roche Posay Effaclear Clarifying Solution and a better clean. The pads are convenient and clean off makeup and oil nicely but did seem to dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> My daughter LOVES these. It has helped her soo much!!</li>
            <li> Magic pads is a skin-saver. I was referred to this product from some instagram posts by Bianca Del Rio. The queen was right! I&#x27;ve had problem acne and oiliness for years. Also, my skin is too sensitive to use proactiv, or products like it. (My skin gets severely dried-out and cracks painfully.) The Magic Pads control oiliness without drying out. It controls acne, leaves no marks or redness (another problem of mine.) I highly recommend this product. SKIN-SAVER!!</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed these. I feel they clean my skin very well and are quick to use, which is nice at night. I also like that they are so natural.</li>
            <li> my skin is so much better , my pores are smaller and all cleaned up.</li>
            <li> Okay. So I don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews unless something is a total waste of money or totally changed my life. These have changed my life. I never had acne until I was about 20, and it has gradually gotten worse over the last 4 years. I never had severe acne, but I had bad hormonal breakouts and giant bumps under my skin that hurt and never seemed to go away (chin and jawline, primarily). I&#x27;ve paid SO much money for dermatologist appointments, topical and oral medications, and even teas and food to try and fix my skin. I got these without too much hope since nothing has worked thus far, and when I first began using them my skin was worse for about 10 days. Then it cleared up, and since I&#x27;d been using a retinol cream for about 8 months I thought that might finally be working. I didn&#x27;t order more Magic Pads and within 3 days my skin began to break out again. I ordered more, and it cleared right up. I suppose there is a &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; of the skin that occurs with these sometimes due to the glycolic acid. However, I now use these and an Aveeno skin clearing bar of soap on my face and THAT&#x27;S IT. No medication, no more dermatologist, no more expensive prescriptions. Be sure to order these a couple days before you run out because you don&#x27;t want to miss a day (but shipping to my apartment only takes 1-2 days). Honestly I am so grateful to have found these.</li>
            <li> This product not only helps with blemishes but also with my acne problems. I highly recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I am in love with the magic pads, they have saved my life and my wallet. Not only have the magic pads cleared up my breakouts it has completely made my malasma disappear!!! I&#x27;ve spent so much time and money on creams,pills and doctor visits!  Thank You Magic Pads!!!! I feel so good about myself I&#x27;m telling everyone about these</li>
            <li> I got these with some skepticism, but was pleasantly surprised to find out how well they work! My face has been looking much clearer since I started using them; less breakouts, pores even seem smaller. I&#x27;ll definitely be adding these to my daily routine!</li>
            <li> I had suffered from bad skin and terrible acne all through my teenage years. Now a graduate student in college, I needed an easy and gentle way to keep my skin clear with all the stress of work and school. The Magic Pads seem to be just the thing to keep my skin calm and clear. I feel like my comexion has significantly improved and I don&#x27;t have breakouts like I used to. I would highly suggest this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait to review this until after I used them for awhile. I&#x27;ve been using them for two months and wouldn&#x27;t exactly call them &amp;#34;magic.&amp;#34; The magic seems to wear off. I loved them once my face went through the purging phase and this pulled out even under the skin acne. And I LOVED that it eventually helped with ingrown hairs on my chin. But it seemed that my face became &amp;#34;immune&amp;#34; to them, because now it&#x27;s no different than using some astringent. Plus you have to use more than one pad at a time and they get expensive. So now it&#x27;s just weigh the pro&#x27;s against the cons I guess as to whether to continue purchasing or not.</li>
            <li> These are nothing more than just cotton pads soaked in rubbing alcohol with a cool name! BEWARE of all the positive reviews - they are obviously fake. Not only did these pads not help with my face - they actually made it worse. I used them for a few days and my pores got so huge that my face was looking like a pancake. So I stopped for a few days until my face got better. But then I thought I&#x27;d try again because I&#x27;ve never used a product that made my face worse (most products just don&#x27;t do anything) so after another couple of days of using these - pancake face is back on!! Do yourself a favor and go get some benzoyl peroxide. It seems to be the only thing that works. Any brand will do.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from Big Fat Vegan Radio, and I&#x27;m SO glad I did. Thank you Laura Yaz! I use this after I go on my daily runs, and my face feels so much cleaner and smoother than just washing alone. I was worried that it would dry my skin out, but it doesnt at all. I can feel confident that I wont get any breakouts from sweat on my forehead, and its such a nice feeling. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I found it to be too strong for my face. I have sensitive mile acne but I used it 1-2 times a day so maybe using it once every 2-3 days would be best.</li>
            <li> These may help with acne and skin texture but its hard to tell a difference in my skin. My biggest problem is that the pad&#x27;s dry up very quickly I can not saturate the entirety of my face and don&#x27;t fell like i should have to use two. Will not re-buy.</li>
            <li> Product does exactly what it says.  There was plenty of solution on pad. Face felt super cleansed after using pad.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t than I hoped</li>
            <li> It does exfoliate well when the product is fresh. After a little while the product does lose effectiveness even if capped tightly. That&#x27;s why if it was in a container that didn&#x27;t get exposed to the air everyone you used it it might last longer. It didn&#x27;t do anything for me face probably because I&#x27;ve done 15% glycolic peels so my facial skin is used to it so I use it for the bumps on my upper arms and back of thighs and it does a mostly good job on those. I follow that up with a BHA cream and the combo works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these pads 2x a day for about a week. So far my skin is no better and no worse. I&#x27;ll provide additional feedback once I use all of the pads. I&#x27;m still hopeful!</li>
            <li> These things are awesome! I highly recommend them. It&#x27;s nice to finely find a product that lives up to the hype.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 26 year old male that has struggled with acne since junior high. I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, Clearasil, and many others and this product has given me the best results in the shortest time. I highly recommend the Magic Pads!</li>
            <li> My kids have been using them and in a few days you can see the difference . Well I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li> WOW!! works on my super stubborn adult acne!!</li>
            <li> It was okay for me , i did not really notice any significant change but it did keep ny face clean</li>
            <li> I tried a new brand there are tons of glycolic pads. These are good. You can fo your face knees elbows and heels for sure. Very nice. Good value</li>
            <li> Nothing MAGIC here - No different than any of the pads you can pickup at Walmart for $7 or $10</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of all the great reviews and I was extremely disappointed. I suffer from (what I understand) to be hormonal acne. I&#x27;m on bc, taking vitamin a and zinc supplements everyday, which are helping but I really needed something to put on the actual skin- so I tried this. Didn&#x27;t work at all. Due to the five star reviews I expected this to actually be &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; but it was not. It didn&#x27;t not work for me at all, maybe for others it does, but especially with the hefty price tag I really don&#x27;t recommend trying this.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that the formula is so weak.</li>
            <li> only used them for a few days and I actually am starting to see my pores get smaller. I have had no problems with my face drying out at all. No burning either so so far so good!! I will be reordering and adding these to my daily routine.</li>
            <li> My teenage son and I have been sharing our Magic Pads and we&#x27;ve both seen improvements.  After a week, my son&#x27;s pimples are noticeably reduced and my forehead wrinkles are softened.  Both of our usually dry complexions are hydrated and glowing.  What a great find!</li>
            <li> I bought one jar and instantly saw improvent in my skin.  I have very sensitive skin so I am very picky about what I put on my skin.  I am for sure adding this to my regimen.</li>
            <li> Love this product so far! Saw results after first use! Look forward to using it, as it leaves skin feeling very refreshed. Pores appear smaller and overall skin looks smoother and softer. I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I love these! They helped with my acne big time! I&#x27;ve been dealing with acne since high school and these definitely helped tame them.</li>
            <li> it really works - use it on body blemish&#x3D;prone areas.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I NEVER write reviews. This product, however, is AMAZING. In the past year I have been suffering from horrible adult acne, I swear I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there-it would either break me out more or dry out my skin so bad it would flake off and look even worse. I read the reviews on this and thought, why not? My face is FINALLY clearing up, not drying out, and looking so much better-even softer! It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;instantly&amp;#34; clearing it up, as I am on my second jar, but I am very confident that it will be clear very soon. My daughter has started using it and after 2 weeks it cleared her up all the way-so everyone&#x27;s skin is different-with all the positive reviews though, it works! Btw, I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> Best acne medication I&#x27;ve ever used. Very quick results, you can feel it working without the intense burn you get from some other products.</li>
            <li> Broke me out!!!  I would never buy again.</li>
            <li> After reading all the raving reviews, I expected more from this product. At 31, I still suffer from the occasional break out and hyper-pigmentation of old acne. I used most of the container, once or twice a day, and didnt experience anything magical. It did not clear my acne and I did not notice any difference in hyper-pigmentation. It dried my skin out a little bit, and maybe helped active acne heal a little bit faster, but not enough for me to want to buy this product again. I had high hopes for you, magic pads! I&#x27;m disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Even worse, I pulled it out to use it after storing it under the sink in my bathroom for a couple weeks, ( there were about 4 or 5 pads left) and now there is funky colored mold on it! It looks like a science project instead of a facial cleansing product.  I can&#x27;t even finish the container! definitely not buying this again!</li>
            <li> Well these &amp;#34;Magic Pads&amp;#34; are not so magic!&lt;br /&gt;They really strip your face. Seriously killing bacteria, however they&#x27;re not a daily face wash. They kill bacteria that is there, doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent future break outs. Seems like the company needs an entire product line to treat properly and be balanced, so it doesn&#x27;t over strip your skin &amp;#34;causing&amp;#34; breakout&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Having suffered from acne for nearly 20 years, this has been the only thing that has cleared my skin without irritation or redness, did not dry out my skin and it didn&#x27;t cause me to break out before having my skin clear up! It doesn&#x27;t feel like there is anything on the pads, no stickiness, no stinging or burning of the skin, it really does seem like magic- having tried everything from ProActiv to Accutane, this honestly has been the only thing that has dramatically and permanently cleared up my acne. It didn&#x27;t happen overnight, but after two weeks it was incredibly clearer- I&#x27;ve also had 3 people compliment my skin, MY skin, saying I looked so refreshed and clear, I never thought in a million years that anyone would EVER compliment my complexion, definitely love these!!!</li>
            <li> I bought Magic Pads hoping for help with my skin after having my son. I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle or anything, just something. Only been using for 1 week and I can tell a huge difference. Leaves my face oil free and clean feeling. All skin types are different so it may not work well for some. I have combination skin, and so far, so good!</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful stuff. I have super sensitive skin that gets irritated very easily and these pads have worked wonders. I&#x27;ve recommended them to everyone in my family, and could literally not give more of an endorsement of a product. Buy them, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> WOW, buy it. In all my 33 years my face has never looked so refreshed!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but after reading so many great reviews I thought it was worth a try.  My skin isn&#x27;t terrible but I&#x27;ve always had mild acne and as I&#x27;ve gotten older large pores and patchy skin.  I have been using every evening for a month now and it&#x27;s been slow but I see improvement.  The texture of my skin has really improved and I haven&#x27;t had an acne flare up.  I really wish the blackheads on my nose would disappear, but hopefully over time they&#x27;ll go away.  I do think they aren&#x27;t as dark.  Someone commented on what great skin I have today and before using this product I never heard those words.  I wish I had taken before photos.</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesome…doesn&#x27;t cause dryness or irritation - makes skin lovely!</li>
            <li> Not sure what the big rave is over these pads. Ill finish the last few pads I have left but wont rebuy. They must have left out the Magic in my jar.</li>
            <li> I used these for about 2 weeks and didn&#x27;t really see a huge difference. I suffer from chronic rosacea and as such my skin is easily irritated and reddened with bumps all over my t-zone. I was hoping that this product would be something that would help me clear up or at least lessen my flareups, but alas, I didn&#x27;t really see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like these would work better for someone who simply suffers from acne or generally clogged pores, as they did make my skin feel fresh and clean. I guess I was expecting a bit too much :) Good product! Just not for me,..</li>
            <li> I am a master esthetician so skincare is something I know and love. I decided to try these out after having some issues with my skin because I was unable to always wash my face due to health issues/bedridden. My main issue was that I had MANY breakouts along my forehead so I was hoping these wipes could decrease the breakouts and hopefully &amp;#34;wipe&amp;#34; them out. I was AMAZED who quickly the pads worked. My face was breakout free within a week and half and my skin is also smoother and brighter. I have recommended them to several friends. They are really awesome and super affordable.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product. From the ingredients down to the texture of the pads, everything would have been perfect for me. EXCEPT that I use BHA and I broke out after using Magic Pads. I tried several times but they just didn&#x27;t work for me. Come out with a 2%BHA pad and I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> Feels great using them as they aren&#x27;t loaded with alcohol like most astringent pads.  Very soothing and really keep your face toned and smooth.  Well worth the money and you&#x27;ll definitely notice a difference after continued usage.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Surprised it works so well</li>
            <li> It works beautiful,  I recommend this product 100%</li>
            <li> I like the way they make my skin feel, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in tone. My husband has been using them and he&#x27;s noticed these help for his oily skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few days now and I can&#x27;t tell if there is any glycolic acid in here... I put it on expecting to feel a tingle or something. Not sure what to think.  Update : 1 week later please save your money. I get better results from a 5 dollar jar of stridex pads. Changed my rating from 3 to 1.</li>
            <li> I saw no visible change in my skin and have discontinued using the product.</li>
            <li> Noticed no difference than other brands (including store brands)</li>
            <li> effective product. Been using twice a day for just under 2 weeks and having got any new break outs</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved these!!! I didnt think they would make such a difference but it does! Around my period, I get occasional pimple or two, and the worst part is they take forever healing, but these pads work like magic, the healing only takes a couple days, I love them! I will definitely buy more, but I wish there were more than 50 in each bottle.</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s just our genetics....no difference after the entire container &#x3D;0(</li>
            <li> These pads are everything! I have had combination, acne prone, AND super sensitive skin all my life, and have used just about any and every product out there. These Magic Pads are the first product to completely combat my acne, nourish my skin, and improve its overall look/tone and texture all at once! I noticed a huge change after my FIRST time using them, and received compliments on my skin after the second day. I cannot recommend these pads enough. I love these pads because above all else, they&#x27;re made with natural ingredients and aren&#x27;t harsh on my sensitive skin. Do yourself a favor and grab at least two of these. I promise you won&#x27;t regret it--they&#x27;re worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> No miracles here,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost feels like I&#x27;m scraping a part of my face off.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s for exfoliation purposes, but did not help at all with my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No soothing effect at all,&lt;br /&gt;My already sensitive spots became much more swollen and red after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a huge acne problem, but my new workout routine was leaving my skin blotchy and I had zits popping up more frequently. I have very sensitive dry skin, and I was worried looking at products that they might dry me out or cause other sensitivity related issues.  The Magic Pads have been so amazing that I have a jar at home and in my gym bag. My skin is clear without feeling dry.  In fact, I don&#x27;t even feel the need to moisturize after using them. I can&#x27;t recommend them enough.</li>
            <li> Loved the way there is no burn and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  Left my face glowing. :-)</li>
            <li> Very good product. I&#x27;ve used glycolic acid peels before and they have been too harsh for my somewhat sensitive skin, this product is not. It seems to exfoliate my skin and help my moisturizer work better. It leaves my skin feeling softer and looking like it has a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> These are amazing!  Can&#x27;t recommend them any more for clearing up skin!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product! It has definitely improved my skin. My skin is now a lot smoother and clearer, my pores are smaller and it doesn&#x27;t dry me out. I was bummed when I ran out but immediately ordered two more jars! Just impatiently waiting for them to arrive, lol!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about these at first, but they really seem to work!  I&#x27;m a repeat customer, and I&#x27;d recommend them to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a short while but I can already see a difference in the condition of my skin. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have been battling with acne for years! I&#x27;m going on 27 years old and so it&#x27;s super embarrassing to still have acne! I have a major hormonal issue though and only usually break out on my chin, these pads have helped immensely! I have paired them with a glycolic acid lotion for the past week and everything is clearing up very well! I&#x27;m very impressed, I would recommend these to anyone!</li>
            <li> Wow, these pads are great!!</li>
            <li> These pads have dramatically improved the overall appearance of my skin tone.  The results are extremely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I wish they came in a jumbo size! Been using the magic pads for a week now. One when I wake up and one before I go to sleep. I look forward to wiping my face with these pads since they get so much oil off and leave me feeling refreshed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with these! I was looking for a very gentle daily AHA to help with my hyper-pigmentation and clogged pores and since&lt;br /&gt;I had heard good things about these pads, I decided to try them. The first thing I noticed is how instantly my face felt smoother and after a few weeks of daily use, my skin is clearer, my products work more efficiently, and I rarely break out now. Since there are so many pads, I use them on the backs of my arms as well and when I use them on my face I bring the pad down across my neck and collar bone. This is definitely something I&#x27;ll keep using because when you consider how many pads are in the container, this is actually less expensive than other AHA pads on the market, plus they&#x27;re effective and don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I am a senior citizen and my face is getting blotchy and uneven skin tone.  I find that the pads help tone and remove the redness.  I have just started using the pads, but I am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> I purchased magic pads for my son and clearly u could tell he has less blackheads and breakouts.He also likes the way they leave your skin feeling soft and clean.Will buy again..</li>
            <li> They work great. Not irritating to skin.</li>
            <li> Great product. They are not too harsh, yet effective.  Didn&#x27;t dry my skin out too much.  Smell is nice, not too strong, not too medicine like; it&#x27;s a light refreshing smell.  The best glycolic pads I&#x27;ve tried yet!</li>
            <li> I actually came across this product while looking for another similar product.  The Magic pads were similar but received rave reviews over the more expensive product.  I have recommended to a friend and bought one for my daughter!  We all love it and plan to buy more!  Thank you Magic Pads</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so radiant .</li>
            <li> Great product and works excellent on my face. Helped diminish acne scars and heal them. Will buy them again</li>
            <li> Figured Id give it a try with all the great reviews. So far so good! Only have used it a couple days so I&#x27;ll have to see after longer use.  Update: my most recent order seems to have a different formulation. I&#x27;m not sure if the pads are different or if it&#x27;s the actually formulation. Needless to say, I don&#x27;t like them as much as the old one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend these pads enough. I&#x27;m a life-time acne sufferer (been on two rounds of Accutane and many OTC options as well). My skin is combination and very sensitive, and I get blackheads, whiteheads, and the occasional deep cystic pimple. At the time I started this product about 1 month ago, I was very concerned about how bad my skin had become, and was seriously considering another trip to the dermatologist. I decided to scrap my entire old routine, and have been using the magic pads along with a gentle non-foaming cleanser and a vitamin-c moisturizer, and I am shocked at how quickly I saw an improvement. Literally, my skin felt better WITHIN 24 HOURS. I went through a brief purging phase, and within 3 weeks realized I had NO NEW PIMPLES, fading scars, decreased pore size, and blackheads were much easier to remove (ah!ah!ah! don&#x27;t pick!! :)).  I&#x27;m impressed at how gentle the product is; I&#x27;m still using a moisturizer, but I&#x27;ve had no drying or uncomfortable peeling. Also purchased this for my teenager, who saw benefits in less than a week. Lastly, I love that the ingredient list is short and sourced naturally. I will continue to use this product indefinitely. If you have bad scarring, try using in conjunction with tamanu oil!</li>
            <li> This product truly is magic, great find and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I used this for just one week and i instantly saw results. It reduced my acne greatly and faded my black spots</li>
            <li> I like the texture on the pads andtuse them everyday. They are a great all in one product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see what the big fuss is about with these &amp;#34;Magic Pads&amp;#34; they did absolutely nothing for my face.</li>
            <li> No results like previous customers... Week 2 and no change... Disappointed</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. It&#x27;s easily irritated by strong products. And although I thought I would be past breakouts at this age, I&#x27;m not. So I have sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to acne...great. I&#x27;ve used all sorts of products, and I&#x27;ve found some I like but not any I really love. I was skeptical about the Magic Pads, but I got a gift card for my birthday, so I decided to give them a go. I was pleasantly surprised! They are awesome. My skin looks a lot clearer! (I still have ocassional pimples, but I think they&#x27;re hormonal.) The Magic Pads don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and best of all, they don&#x27;t leave a sticky residue. After using them I feel clean and fresh but not too oily or too dry either. I&#x27;ve been using them once a day or once every other day. That&#x27;s what works for me!</li>
            <li> Work great! Cleared up my skin in a few days :)</li>
            <li> I love this product. The glycolic acid us only 2% but after 3 weeks I can really see the difference. Will buy again when product is empty. $20 for 50 pads seems alot but this is all natural.</li>
            <li> I swear by The Magic pads for a FRESH FACE! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> These are the best OTC pads I have used for my skin! They help clear up my blemishes, and skin feels tighter and younger.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about two months now. I have seen no change in my acne and skin.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for the magic pads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Caucasian female in my 20&#x27;s and I wanted to get smoother skin mostly because after clearing some breakouts, I had a little bit of an uneven skin tone and some rough spots. My skin looked pretty dull. I used this for a whole month and it has helped a little bit with the skin smoothing, but not really anything special. The smell isn&#x27;t too strong and my face wasn&#x27;t really irritated. I&#x27;m not sure if my skin just healed on its own or if these helped at all. I probably won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> amazing! my skin has never looked so clear! thank you!!!</li>
            <li> A great product! I would definitely recommend others buying this, it&#x27;s gentle on the skin and works better than I had expected.</li>
            <li> Good at removing excess dirt but definitely not &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne for about 10 years and thought with all the great reviews I&#x27;d give this product a try. I was convinced they would work when one review mentioned she did not have to go back on accutane after using this. Unfortunately these pads did nothing to help my acne and even made be break out a little as well. I wish that I had deeper into some of the other reviews. I now realize that those same reviews that had convinced me to purchase this product were from customers that had only written one review. Also, they were very detailed and contained no spelling or grammar errors. I should have caught that. They were too perfect. I&#x27;m off to try another round of accutane.</li>
            <li> I love Bianca Del Rio, which is where I heard about these, but I didn&#x27;t notice a difference to my skin, unless you have to use like 5 pads each time, which would not be cheap.  It says you can use 1 or 2 at a time, but they aren&#x27;t very moist.</li>
            <li> Not magical but not bad either.  Good exfoliation, easy to use.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is WOW! I recently started breaking out, after having a baby. I couldn&#x27;t get anything to clear it up- even the product given to me by a very expensive dermatologist. I started using Magic Pads, I thought &#x27;what do I have to lose?&#x27; At this point, I was having a new break out EVERY DAY. I started using them every other day, now every day. My skin cleared up in a week! I can&#x27;t believe it! Amazing product, I have my complexion back!! Such a confidence booster!   *Update* I&#x27;ve now tried these pads for a few months. While it has helped prevent major breakouts, my face seems more bumpy. Like I&#x27;m getting more subtle blackheads. I think it&#x27;s helped me to stop getting red and infected pimples but they have been replaced with blackheads that just look like bumps on my face. Not exactly what I was looking for but helped.</li>
            <li> These pads make my dull skin look more luminess and they do not cause me to have break outs. I have oily skin as well and these help control my oiliness through out the day. I would recommend these to anyone with oily or dull skin or anyone looking to give their skin a little pick me up.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. As a 49 year old, I was looking for something that will reduce the signs of aging. These pads leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I used up a whole jar for minor breakouts I would get on my chest area and it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> As described...great value and gentle!</li>
            <li> Its amazing , after the first day I saw results .</li>
            <li> In about two days my ance,was gone.&lt;br /&gt;I freaking love this product. Its fantastic and I don&#x27;t see myself using anything else for my ance</li>
            <li> Great Product! one week and my skin feels great!</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, and I was a bit worried about using these, but I had read some good reviews about them, decided I would try them and if I hated them, my niece would like them (y&#x27;know...).  While I&#x27;m certain my niece would have loved them, she didn&#x27;t get to try mine!  I don&#x27;t  know what I did before I found them - they are awesome.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with sensitivities, and i love the way my skin looks.  I definitely see improvements, and I&#x27;m really happy I tried them.</li>
            <li> Like many others I heard Bianca del Rio was using this product and I thought, well, that&#x27;s a queen with some beautiful skin - I gotta try this. I used it once or twice a day on my whole face, neck and chest after cleansing, and sometimes used it alone to clean my skin. I experienced a noticeable reduction in acne, facial redness, and pore size. My skin felt clean, smooth, and a little more taught. It was worth the purchase as it did exactly what I was expecting with great results. The only issue is that it is too expensive for my tight budget with the other beauty products I already like to buy regularly. I recommend this to someone who likes a face product that&#x27;s quick to use and can afford it, but for myself I found a face wash with a few similar ingredients that is half the price and gives very similar results, so in the end I will stick with that.</li>
            <li> These have SAVED my skin. In the hot sun of summer and the dry wind of winter these pads really are MAGIC. Thank you thank you thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I am tired of having a new pimple every time I turn around. With all the great reviews,  I had to try. Thesr broke me out. Bad. Like gigantic, cystic, painful, and oh so ugly zits. I normally only get pimples on my t zone, and mainly my chin. I had them every where. Cheeks, forehead,  chin, under my nose, jaw line. Never again will I use one of these magic pads.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. Isn&#x27;t a horrible product but isn&#x27;t a great one either. If you are buying this to help with acne problems, I&#x27;d say skip this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month. It&#x27;s amazing. The number blackheads on my cheeks and nose have dropped significantly. I have eczema on my face, chin, and neck. The Magic Pads helped soothe my irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Love it!.... I&#x27;ve been using for two weeks and it&#x27;s already clearing up my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week, but I can already see a difference.  I&#x27;ve got super sensitive skin, but the Magic Pads are very gentle while still clearing up my blemishes.  Thanks to Bianca Del Rio for the recommendation!</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this would do as advertised, however it actually made me break out plus I didn&#x27;t see any skin clarity, brightening, or any other purported positive effects. Really disapointed.</li>
            <li> Have not used them long enough to give a accurate result fro using the pads.</li>
            <li> Thank You! Bianca del Rio for posting about these on the *book.com...</li>
            <li> My favorite product for reducing hyperpigmentaion and keeping my skin bright and smooth. Really gets rid of my breakouts and blackheads that I get occasionally. I also love using this product on my chest and shoulders when I get breakouts there, it really gets rid of them fast. Will definitely keep ordering.</li>
            <li> The Magic Pads are a great addition to my skin care routine.  As someone with oily, acne prone skin, these pads get the job done but don&#x27;t dry out my skin.  Try them, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> This works really well! I used it twice a day and I saw improvement. I have acne scars and have been trying to get rid of them but nothing has worked. But when I used this, I was shocked! It actually helped my skin and helped breakouts as well as my stubborn acne scars. My pores went down as well and no more blackheads. Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Wow! I&#x27;ve struggled with acne my whole life. It has been a hard and long battle with my skin, and I&#x27;ve literally tried everything you can buy for treating acne over the years. I think my skin became immune to all of the major acne products because they all share the same chemical ingredients. These however, I used one- and the next morning my old acne that usually takes weeks to fade- had faded significantly over night. Theses are named well because they really are magic for someone who has struggled with acne and scarring her whole life. I don&#x27;t have to cover my acne with make up anymore because my skin looks so good after a week of using these. Also, I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since I started using these, I am so amazed. Thank you for having such a great product available and for making it affordable. My self esteem is so high right now. :)</li>
            <li> After having not had acne since I was a teenager, I suddenly found myself having constant breakouts in my late 20s. In addition, my skin was dull and dry, and no matter how much I moisturized nothing seemed to work. I freaked out and tried a thousand different things which did not work. I decided to try the Magic Pads, and they work. They work significantly better than the $40 glycolic acid potions that I tried before; once I use the pads several days go by when I don&#x27;t have to use them, and my skin is radiant and glowing. Plus at this price they are a bargain! I highly recommend them if you&#x27;re having acne problems or dull skin, they are even reducing my sun spots!</li>
            <li> Good product, five stars. Contains glycolic acid, organic willow bark, hyaluronic acid and vitamin E in an organic aloe vera juice base.</li>
            <li> These are the best! I love how they make my skin so smooth! and they are organic!!!</li>
            <li> My 11 year old daughter has been having problems with acne on her forehead for a few months.  I knew that I needed a product that didn&#x27;t require a lot of complicated steps, and this is it.  She has been using them once a day for a week now, and I am really starting to see a difference.  The acne had improved quite a bit in just a week.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I love these pads and they feel great on my face.im not sure if they are working on my skin but the best I have used on my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I love these! Some nights I am incredibly an do not want to wash my face, so I use w couple of these magic pads and my face feels clean! Much better than your average acne pads.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these pads. They actually work exactly as described! One swipe, after I wash, before I lotion, once a day, and my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> I personally know someone who was paid to write a good review about this product. Buyer beware</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used for my face!  I LOVE it and cannot live without it!  I never wear any make up and I always get compliments on my skin and complexion.  People are always amazed that I&#x27;m not wearing any make up because of how good my complexion looks.  The pads keep my face acne free and have done wonders with removing any scarring I had from when I did have issues with acne.  Definitely the best product out there!</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t really do anything for me. The liquid in on pad is not enough to cover whole face so more would be used. Also they sent me an email saying if I rate this 5 stars they would send me another one for free . That makes me worry about all the good reviews here, who wouldn&#x27;t want free stuffs right?   Overall I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I have been using The Magic Pads for at least two years and it has cleared my skin without drying it out, leaving it feeling fresh and clean.  I have recommended The Magic Pads to all of my friends and have bought them for family members.  Everyone who tries these pads falls in love with them and for good reason!  They work amazingly!!  I ran out a couple weeks ago and kept forgetting to re-order.  After 3 days I started breaking out again!  That sent me to my computer in a hurry to place my new order.  Thank you Prime! they arrived in 2 days and I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I was!  They began to clear up my skin immediately.  I will never let them run out again.</li>
            <li> A few months ago my sister gave me these Magic Pads to try as she loved how they not only cleaned but also exfoliated; I was skeptical since I have not only oily but also very sensitive skin. They are amazing! My complexion has both cleared and brightened. So much so that I started using them while on a business trip (3 days) and when I got back my typically unobservant boyfriend comments on how great my skin looked. Since then, I have “forced” so many friends to use them as they are awesome!</li>
            <li> Cleanses and makes my faces feel so soft. LOVE IT!! Effective but cheap. Great buy.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money! Did nothing for me or my son.</li>
            <li> Love the Maic Pads! After using them for about two months i am noticing a decrease in appearance of fine lines and it has never cause any breakout or reaction and i am very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these even before they were sold on Amazon, and I believe they&#x27;ve done wonders for my complexion.  I&#x27;ve seen fewer breakouts, and my skin seems clearer and a little tighter.  My pores don&#x27;t seem as large, either.</li>
            <li> Been using them for a few weeks and my skin looks smoother.  I love they way the pads take all the dirt off as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter and she loves it. It didn&#x27;t  dry her skin out.</li>
            <li> Noticed an improvement in just a week. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well! Thanks to Bianca del Rio for posting about them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 years old, with combination skin (oily in the t-zone, normal cheeks, very dry eye area).  I have been using The Magic Pads for three weeks now, and the difference is amazing!  My pores are less congested, my fine lines are less noticeable, and my overall skin tone &amp; texture is discernibly better.  These are my Holy Grail product; please don&#x27;t ever stop making them!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have sensative skin and adult acne. Since I started using the pads I have not had even one breakout and it does not burn or irritate my skin. After washing my face and using the pads it will make my skin red for just a minute or two then it is gone. My pores are even getting smaller and my skin feels tighter.</li>
            <li> I needed a skin product that would clean the impurities and leave it soft and smooth.  These pads are easy to use and accomplish just what I need the, to.</li>
            <li> I started using The Magic Pads nearly a year ago and haven&#x27;t looked back! About two years ago I completely changed my skincare routine and became obsessed with AHA and BHA exfoliants. While there are some great exfoliants out there, there is nothing on the market as convenient as The Magic Pads. They keep your skin clear and exfoliated, while also keeping it calm and moisturized. I&#x27;d recommend The Magic Pads for all skin types, but especially for those of us with combination skin; it does a great job at controlling oily areas and moisturizing dry ones! I pair this with my favorite Korean snail cream and my skin has never looked more radiant!</li>
            <li> These pads are amazing! I use them daily and I can see the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> So much more convenient than face wash and doesn&#x27;t have the alcohol smell and drying of acne pads.</li>
            <li> This product has helped quite a bit with complexion issues. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> These are a total lifesaver. Not only do they save time, but my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this great in ages. I have the most sensitive skin, and these don&#x27;t dry my skin out at all. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Was not impressed. Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for me. It&#x27;s different for everyone though</li>
            <li> These pads are the best ever!!!! Immediately after using them my skin looked the smoothest it ever has! It also gets off the extra make up on my face that simply washing with my face soap and water leaves behind. I would 1000% recommend these to girls (and guys) as my boyfriend has started stealing them from me as well!!</li>
            <li> Best Product. A family member works for El Rey Networks and saw a few gorgeous stars using it.  Second jar and my skin is now HD camera ready. It doesn&#x27;t have to break the bank to work.  This works!</li>
            <li> Thank you Bianca. I was skeptical but decided to give them a try.  Man!  I&#x27;ve had problems with my nose bridge.  Breakouts and a red patch.  After about two days the redness started to clear up.  After about a month, clogged pores have cleared up.  I used them twice a day for a week, then once a day after for maintenance.  No problems with breakouts.  Hey, I&#x27;m 60 years old and breakouts are not in my life plan. I want clear skin and have it now</li>
            <li> Love love love The Magic Pads!  First heard of them from Bianca Del Rio who always looks flawless so I figured I&#x27;d give them a try.  My skin feels cleansed and refreshed without feeling dry. I&#x27;m a convert!</li>
            <li> Bought these after a recommendation from a friend... Love them! My skin glows, feels fresh, and the occasional pimple I get has been non existent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love!  Magic Pads have helped calm my acne breaks outs and has significantly cut the amount of oil on my face. I love that it&#x27;s an all-in-one product. Super easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t sting or hurt. Just make sure you grab one pad and not two. Don&#x27;t want to waste one bit.</li>
            <li> I originally bought these just because Bianca Del Rio posted about them. (little obsessed, I know.) But these are honestly the best things I have ever purchased for my face. My skin has improved so much since I started using these. I&#x27;ve already used up one container and ordered 2 more a few days ago. I highly suggest that you try these!</li>
            <li> Normally I buy products and end up being less than impressed with them, but I LOVE these pads. They don&#x27;t dry my face out and that&#x27;s pretty easy to do for me. They help fade any dark spots and they really help with fighting blemishes. They do not have an unpleasant smell and they make my face feel like I actually got everything off of it. I love the cost too!</li>
            <li> I love these pads! I use them, as well as my 17 year old exchange student. They work magic on my 30 year old skin, making it cleaner and brighter. For the 17 year old, they have drastically helped with his acne and redness.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m loving the magic pads. It&#x27;s only been less than a week, but I&#x27;ve been using them daily and I see some improvement with the keratosis pilaris on my arms. I think I&#x27;m going to up the dose to two pads a day. I definitely love that the ingredients are clean.</li>
            <li> Tried this for the first time and love it! Leaves your skin soft and smooth to the touch with no redness - safe to use daily on face and neck without drying your skin out too!</li>
            <li> I just finished my second bottle of these little miracle workers and about to order my third. I&#x27;ve been struggling with cystic acne, breakouts and redness for the last few years - out of nowhere - and I&#x27;ve tried everything: Glycolic peels, charcoal scrubs, bentonite clay masks, you name it. I imagine it was due to hormonal changes in my late 20&#x27;s, which was the pits. It wasn&#x27;t until I found this listing on Amazon and saw other people&#x27;s success that I decided to give them a shot. I could tell a distinct difference in the smoothness of my skin within the first couple days, with the added bonus of less oily t-zone issues! Not only that, but any break outs or annoying bumps started clearing up within a few days, as well. My cystic acne would finally be drawn to the surface of my skin and clear itself!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back to finally having my skin look as smooth as a china doll.&lt;br /&gt;I use one pad at night after cleansing with a gentle hypoallergenic bar, and then apply a alpha-hydroxy moisturizer. Same deal in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I tried another brand of pads with a higher concentration of glycol acid, just to see if I liked something better. WRONG MOVE! My skin broke out just after a couple days, and my oil issues returned.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish these came in higher count bottles!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three week or so.  I&#x27;ve really found such a noticeable difference in the feel and appearance of my skin.  I have very sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve had no issues at all with this product.  I also, but a container for my 11 year daughter who has oily skin with blackheads.  Her skin looks so much better just after a few days of use.  I would recommend if you want to have smoother and softer skin.</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old and have a graveyard of lotions, serums, oils from so many companies I&#x27;ve lost count. I&#x27;ve been in this anti-aging battle for a long time. The Magic Pads were recommended to me by my daughter. After 3 weeks, the comedones are reduced in size. The marionette lines from mouth to chin are less deep. The age spots on my skin are fading. Pores are tightened and skin appearance is smoother. I know this sounds outlandish but, I kid you not. My skin is very dry and I do need to use a good moisturizer after using the pads.</li>
            <li> This works way better than my proactive trial. My skin cleared up within a week . I use it twice a day.  I leave one at home and one in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> Wow! This product is amazing! Try it and you&#x27;ll love it forever!</li>
            <li> I love the way these pads make my skin look and feel! I&#x27;ve finally found something easy and effective for clearing and renewing my skin!</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be working! My face has been a lot cleaner and flawless. Will buy more soon ;)</li>
            <li> I have razor burns on my face and have read that using glycolic acid is a natural way to treat it.  At first, I only used the pads once a day and wasn&#x27;t getting the results that I wanted.  So, I started using it twice a day, morning and night.  I can tell a difference within days.  My face has cleared up 70% and I get the extra benefit of it&#x27;s anti-aging properties.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who has skin problems and the results were noticeable after just 1 week of use ... clear, smooth and free of breakouts. Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. The product did nothing for me and I can&#x27;t return it. WASTE of money.</li>
            <li> Great product with quick results. Would recommend to those who have cystic pimple breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for less than a week and the difference is already so noticeable.  I have combination skin that always had some patchy dry spots on my cheeks, the sides of my nose, even near my eyes.  The Magic Pads smoothed them out within 3 days.  My skin actually feels healthier, and the zits I was sporting the day I received the package are already gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> great product no complaints...been using it 2 weeks no new out breaks and skin looking refreshed.</li>
            <li> If you have wrinkles and acne you need this!  It works ... I love it!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin! At first I broke out but then I realized that everything was just being brought to the surface of my skin. After 2 weeks of use my blackheads have decreased, I don&#x27;t have any pimples, my pores look smaller, and my normally dry skin is no longer requiring moisturizer. 5 STARS!!!</li>
            <li> You can thank Bianca Del Rio for plugging this product on social media. Just make her your spokesperson.&lt;br /&gt;Any new skincare introduced to your skin takes a few weeks to show any results, so I waited three weeks before I could claim it worked or not. I had sensitive and sometimes acne-prone skin, and I think The Magic Pads are great. I&#x27;ve introduced them into my already slightly complicated skincare regimen, and they work perfectly as a pre-treatment step. The true test for me was post-shaved skin... as I mentioned, I have sensitive/sometimes acne-prone skin, and that is a directed result to shaving, however, The Magic Pads worked great to minimize any post-shave breakout. Give The Magic Pads a shot.</li>
            <li> These pads have cleared my acne at my chin and jawline and have made my skin much smoother. I really like that there is no strong scent to these pads and they also don&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry after use.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE them! Combo of the pads and coconut oil, my face as never looked and felt better!</li>
            <li> this is the first and last time i&#x27;ll buy something because a celeb endorsed it. im not sure there is anything on them except water.</li>
            <li> Like almost ever acne sufferer I&#x27;ve tried everything. Every supplement, wash, herb, essential oil, cream... Antibiotics, retin-a, proactiv, the list goes on and on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, like most everything, didn&#x27;t do anything. I&#x27;ve had moderate to sever acne for over 10 years now and only three things have helped me personally:&lt;br /&gt;1) Burdock root. For about a year, then I feel like my body may have gotten used to it or something.. I still take it on and off just for fun.&lt;br /&gt;2) Papaya soap. For some crazy reason, I dunno.&lt;br /&gt;3) and most importantly the acne org regimen. Please don&#x27;t confuse this with products that make a profit, it&#x27;s all about how you use whatever you choose&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acne org regimen works wonders. Yes, months after trying these pads I spent some more of my time on google and finally checked out their site. It is more about the regimen itself than the products they sell and they even state that. It&#x27;s about washing your face, twice a day for roughly 10 seconds (crazy, right?) then waiting 15 min to put on a 2.5 peroxide lotion, then 15 more and putting on a regular moisturizing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other tips that helped me... change your pillowcase daily or every other. Use a separate towel for your face and one for your body/hair. Drink enough water. And one you&#x27;ve heard 1000x over, don&#x27;t touch your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These wonder products are scams. A bunch of poor saps are paid hourly to leave reviews for products like these. It&#x27;s sad because people like us suffered long enough then get screwed over and over and over hoping that something will work. Good luck, people!</li>
            <li> First thing in a long time that has worked for my skin!  It looks clearer, smaller pores, and much brighter overall!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I used them once a day and I broke out</li>
            <li> these are so great! my skin has definitely improved since using them. i don&#x27;t have nearly as much acne.</li>
            <li> Love it! Gentle yet very strong and effective! Thank you, Bianca!!! Can&#x27;t wait for season 7 of RDR!</li>
            <li> Magic, miracle, amazing magic pads. Love them they really make a difference. Thaaaanks</li>
            <li> Great! Improved my skin right away. I&#x27;m in week 3 and I know I will reorder when I run out. That&#x27;s a big statement from me as I&#x27;m rarely impressed with beauty products.</li>
            <li> Bianca Del Rio posting about this on Instagram brought it to my attention.  It is now a staple in my morning routine.  I use this once a day after I wash my face in the shower, followed by a moisturizer with SPF.  It does a great job of keeping my skin smooth and gets rid of those stupid little bumps that aren&#x27;t quite full pimples yet.  Highly recommend this product as an addition to your current face washing routine.</li>
            <li> after one week of using these pads, i think i can tell a positive difference. Doesn&#x27;t dry my face out, or burn when using. The smell is pleasant and mild.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and these pads are very gentle. They are also fragrance free and have very few ingredients.  I am using them every other day.</li>
            <li> I usually get small little pimples along my forehead from wearing a baseballl cap all day.  These cleared me up in 3 days!  Love them!!!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely helped clear my skin. Not a cure but saw really good results.</li>
            <li> I like these pads, overall, but you&#x27;re going to need a lot of them if you have a lot of &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; to be done and for almost $20.00 a pop, no thanks.</li>
            <li> These pads worked better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried for acne. I just wish there was another version with a stronger glycolic content. I love how they make my face feel and don&#x27;t leave behind a residue or a weird smell. Great job!</li>
            <li> No magic here....... I can&#x27;t believe I got duped into paying $19.95 for this. I used the entire jar, just like it said. It helped dry up some zits, but nothing beyond that.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Glad I bought it once to at least give it a try. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again though. There was absolutely nothing special or magic about these pads.</li>
            <li> These pads make my skin feel great.  I use one at night (after makeup removing) and in the morning to refresh from the nights sleep.  Will definiately buy again</li>
            <li> I unfortunately have bad skin and have tried sooo many products. Received (timely) and started using these twice a day one week ago. WOW. FAST results above anything else I&#x27;ve tried. Easy and quick to use too. Acne lessens overnight, clarity improved, and even wrinkles reducing ... in one week!! I was clearly wasting my money elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Broke my face out, weird since I do a regular glycolic peel once every 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Wow! I don&#x27;t understand why this product has such great reviews when it&#x27;s not doing anything at all. It seems like it&#x27;s as good as putting just water on your face. Absolutely no tingling sensation at all or improvement on my skin. Very cheap product and now I know why. Glad I could return it. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> These pads work great. During times of stress I often break out and these did a great job of immediately stopping the breakout and preventing more. I use them every night before bed and have noticed a big difference in the rate of occurrence of pimples, even during stressful times.</li>
            <li> They arrived really quickly. I have sensitive skin and these didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. With that being said I have not notice one change since using these nothing!!!</li>
            <li> These pads didn&#x27;t seem too magical to me. They work about as well as any other acne pad I&#x27;ve used in the past. The reviews lead me to believe that these would be life-changing--lol-- but I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. I&#x27;ve ordered these twice and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference....certainly not &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product March 2015 and I used the entire container, using the pads 2x daily. I feel it&#x27;s a good product but not good enough for my skin. I have acne prone oily skin and the Magic Pads did not stop my breakouts nor did they exfoliate enough to clear any scarring from my old blemishes. I defintely need a product with a higher concentration of glycolic acid. I give this product 3 Stars. I feel it would help those with mild skin problems.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started college in 2010, I have dealt with severe acne. I&#x27;ve tried every trick in the book to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Randomly watched a Wicked video blog and these beauties were mentioned. I noticed that a lot of the stars of the show use them and even use them after they leave the show. Because a lot of people do see pretty good results with these, I figured I&#x27;d give them a try. I really like them! They&#x27;re a lot better than the salicylic acid pads I see in stores all the time. My acne isn&#x27;t totally gone, but I don&#x27;t have problems with excessive redness or with painful cystic acne clusters anymore, which is enough of an improvement to warrant a 4-star review from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every night, I wash my face with a facial buff pad that has mild Olay cleanser on it. After that, I use one of these pads, and then I lightly apply pure tea tree oil to my face. I think the pads and the oil have actually helped me the most, and my skin has started to look really soft, bright, and younger.</li>
            <li> I received the order a day before it was due..happy about that. I can&#x27;t give you an in depth summation, because I &#x27;ve just received it. But so far..only two days of applications, it&#x27;s working. I can see a difference in my skin tone. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t feel these were any different than $5.00 drugstore acne pads.. not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> It cleans dirt and my makeup off well...but did very little to get rid of blemishes. I don&#x27;t blame the product though, as its hormonal acne that&#x27;s tough to combat...I think once I get over that...i&#x27;ll revisit this product and see how it goes. I love the exfoliating side.</li>
            <li> This product is Amazing!! My skin was very smooth after using this product. It is not harsh or drying on the skin at all. I will continue using this product and the shipping time was very fast. THANK YOU!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using The Magic Pads for about 6 months and it&#x27;s improved my skin way better than Proactive or Nutragina! I noticed results after just a few days. If you want not only a pimple free face but a blackhead free face with smaller pores buy The Magic Pads! They&#x27;re perfection in a jar! You won&#x27;t be disappointed I promise.</li>
            <li> The pads are very rough on surface and I&#x27;m afraid to rub on my face so I use this for body.</li>
            <li> When you need to find a product that helps cure and prevent breakouts, you go to one source: drag queens. Bianca Del Rio, most recent winner of Drag Race talked about this product on his facebook feed and I had to try it. A person that spends time putting on tons of make-up knows the right products to keep their pores clean. On that recommendation I picked up this product and was not disappointed. I&#x27;m a person that has oily skin and is prone to breakouts but had problems with other medications drying my skin out. The Magic Pads have the rare combination of materials that keeps me from breaking out without giving me the dry, patchy skin other products did. It was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Yes yes yes!!! I bought the benzoyl peroxide body wash before buying this product and nothing. I bought these amazing pads and damn....it works! A bit pricey.  Living in south florida and working out....the sweat tends to make my skin break out. And now during the summer time, I don&#x27;t want to have &amp;#34;backne&amp;#34; when wearing cute summer dresses. Worth it!</li>
            <li> I used a full set of these pads lasting approx 3 weeks. I had a patch on my cheek that had continuously been breaking out in the same area. After using these, I do feel that it may have reduced the likelihood of getting another pimple in my break out area. In fairness though, the weather had shifted and was also dramatically dryer, so this may have played a role. It did not improve my scars, but overall I am satisfied. I cannot attest to glowing skin as some others. I do feel like the best results were in the first week and if nothing else it was an non-irritating remover of any remaining makeup on my cheeks after washing my face.</li>
            <li> My skin was never terrible but as soon as I started using these my skin cleared up and has stayed that way! Thank you Magic Pads!!!!</li>
            <li> This product has saved my skin!</li>
            <li> So far we have felt like these are worth the money!</li>
            <li> Make your skin so smooth and glowing! I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I initially gave up on these because they made me break out. Eventually I decided to try them again and I&#x27;m glad I did. Yes, I did break out a bit again, but eventually that cleared up and my skin started getting smoother. It&#x27;s not an instant change, but it has completely changed my skin.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying this is an absolutely wonderful product. Not sure how my wife came across these, but she did and ordered a canister; I figured I&#x27;d try a couple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had quite a few small blackheads on my forehead and would occasionally have some pimples pop up. After a couple days of using them (one per day), my face was completely clear and has been easily maintained since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one and only complaint is the price. It&#x27;s not terrible by any means, especially for face solutions. But for small pads that last us less than a month, it adds up quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for about 10 days. In a week, I noticed a much smoother surface to my face. I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation or redness from them. I was hoping to see more reduction in my acne breakouts, but hopefully that will come with more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It has now been about a month since I started using these 2x a day. After about 2 weeks, I noticed a lot of new acne, but I&#x27;m guessing this is all the clogs coming to the surface as the cells turnover. After a week or so of really bad skin, it is now looking great. I hardly have any blemishes, and my skin feels so smooth to the touch. People have even commented on how good my skin looks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 week UPDATE: My skin looks better than it has in years! I haven&#x27;t had any cystic acne in a month, and just the occasion zit. My skin is so smooth that I&#x27;m wearing foundation a lot less than I used to!  I hooked on these pads now!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for wrinkles afer watching a Dr. Oz show about Glycolic acid and absolutely love it, it has shrunk my large pores on my nose and smoothed my face.  I will be buying a replacement when done.  this product saved me alot of money, i was going to get micro treatments.</li>
            <li> Initially I didn&#x27;t think this helped. But I&#x27;ve used it more consistently &amp; I think it has decreased # of pimples, as well as redness.</li>
            <li> This product is great with my skin. Of course i didn&#x27;t see change the first time i tried it. It takes time. I can already see improvement on my skin. My dark spots are fading away. Had quite a few blackheads on my nose, those are fading away slowly. I also see less breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is tired of all those breakouts. Will purchase again and again now :)</li>
            <li> Thanks Bianca Del Rio for the recommendation! These are great! I work over a deep fryer for a good perron of my day and these make my skin feel fresh and clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other pads before the magic pads and wasn&#x27;t really impressed with the results.These pads work great,much better results.</li>
            <li> I love my Magic Pads! I heard about them from Bianca del Rio and am amazed by how clear they keep my skin! Just be sure to use a good moisturizer as they have ingredients that are a little bit drying.</li>
            <li> Love The Magic Pads! Definitely helps dry up acne and makes it go away faster! Just like magic!</li>
            <li> I love it amazing soft and smooth pads</li>
            <li> My teenager used these on his acne.  It really minimized the blemishes and made his skin look clearer.</li>
            <li> Daughter is 10 yrs old with forehead with white heads, black head and some on nose.&lt;br /&gt;This product is so much easier than getting her to wash her face outside of being in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;It helps her easily control her acne and is much easier for me to get her to use then anythings else.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and it help control my acne. I love the way it leaves your skin clean and tight and is its odorless. Can&#x27;t recommend it enough if you have trouble skin or just loved to have a clean face this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I love this product, starting to see improvement already. Thank you so much. Loving it!!!</li>
            <li> Love these! They are great for sensitive skin. I use one in the morning and one before bed. Awesome product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for about 5 days and I can honestly say I love &#x27;em. I had these two HUGE pimples on either side of my face as well as one on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;Within 3 days of using these every night the redness went down considerably and the pimples shrunk quite a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love these. I&#x27;ve told almost everyone I know about &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> These pads have really made a difference for my skin. I finally have my acne under control with only the occasional small pimple showing up around the time of my period. They also seem to help with the healing of preexisting acne scars. Overall very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I heard about these pads from a posting on Facebook and I decided to give them a try and I&#x27;m glad I did. Since using them, I noticed a positive change in my complexion and no breakouts! Oil control is fair but overall I would definitely purchase again and make this part of my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> This product does work!  My skin cleared up and is radiant!</li>
            <li> this product is amazing!!!! my skin looks brighter and smoother after only few applies of this pads.  i recommended it to those who has lots of break outs on their skin.</li>
            <li> These have helped the breakouts on my face and chest. Even in my 30s they continue, hoping with longer use they will help sun spots as well. You need a good mousterizer as they do dry your skin. I use once per day only.</li>
            <li> Just finished my second jar of these pads and I love them.  My skin is much smoother and it&#x27;s definitely helped with breakouts!</li>
            <li> Amazing! Really works. I didnt believe the results I saw in just 3 days. Great product. Bought them from my little brother struggling with acne he loves them already.</li>
            <li> Seemed to help my sons acne. Only been using a week and can tell a difference.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old son and I have used the Magic Pads now for a year. He has mild acne and I have very sensitive skin. We love this product!</li>
            <li> This product is great to use. My daughter&#x27;s troubled skin is healing and she is thrilled. So simple</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these and have even raved about them on my blog.  They make my skin feel very smooth and are not the slightest bit irritating.  I have dry skin and think that these are actually pretty hydrating.  The biggest difference I noticed with these was clearer skin.  I actually ran out for a few days and think it is no coincidence that I broke out when I was without them.  They are SO worth the money!</li>
            <li> Magic pads smell nice and leave my skin feeling clean and soft. They are easy to pack with me so I can use them after I workout if I don&#x27;t have time to go home to wash my face. I even use them in the car!</li>
            <li> These are an absolute God send! My skin tone is more even, less oily, and more clear. I&#x27;ve only been using Magic Pads for about a month and my blemishes are significantly reduced and the discoloration is diminished. I highly recommend The Magic Pads!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed these...I see a difference in my complexion for the better. It&#x27;s a slow to emerge difference but I think this is better for my skin long term since it then becomes part of my treatment regimen. I use them day and night after washing with salicylic acid cleanser to help clear out my pores.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good product.</li>
            <li> Although these haven&#x27;t cured my acne completely, it did solve my cystic acne problems! No more large painful bumps! Always follow beauty advice from an award winning drag queen! Thanx Bianca Del Rio!</li>
            <li> I love these!!! There working so well! If the drags like them and use them then they had to be good!!! Love them!!!!</li>
            <li> I love them! I have had no issues at all with the shipper or the product itself.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, best glycolic treatment I have used</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! I don&#x27;t know where its been my whole life. As an adult with cystic acne and plain old acne I was curious if this would work. After a few weeks I can atest that it does. Give it a try, see for yourself. You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have an acne problem. My problem is dullness and these pads really bring out a vibrant complexion.</li>
            <li> I combine this with a mild anti-acne scrub and have found my skin clearing up dramatically after just a week and a half of use!  It is also not as drying as many products.</li>
            <li> All I can say is AMAZING.....areas where I previously had breakouts have vanished...within 2 weeks I can see a huge difference! Definitely a wonderful product...where was this when I was a teen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick - no problems whatsoever! If I could give 10 stars I would! Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Love these! They work just as good as proactive but are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Of course I heard of The Magic Pads from Bianca Del Rio and immediately became intrigued with her amazing complexion. I&#x27;ve been using these on an every other day basis for nearly a month now and am really pleased so far. My face feels very clean after using and I pair with a daytime facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It really does work. I was prepared to be skeptical but a week later my skin is in much better shape and without some of the rough side effects of other acne medications. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I like these-I have very sensitive acne prone skin  I can only use once a day so far.  Good product  I was supposed to receive an extra set of these per &amp;#34;The Magic Pads&amp;#34; email.  Please forward asap</li>
            <li> This product did not produce the results I was expecting.  After 2 weeks of using Magic Pads, there were no improvements on my face.</li>
            <li> I use these everyday, partnered with my other organics line.  I will never use anything else!  Perfect for travel as well!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! It really works!</li>
            <li> Not gonna lie. They offered me a free jar for 5 stars and a good review. I want to see if they hold up on their end. That being said, I am about halfway through my first jar and so far, I really like them. I use them twice a day and they aren&#x27;t as harsh as some pads and my skin has started to improve. I want the 2nd jar, because I think it&#x27;ll take longer then a month to give me the skin I want. My pores are crazy...I absolutely recommend this product, but when it says stay out of the sun, DO IT. I went to the tanning bed and exposed my face for 2 minutes. Lobster city.</li>
            <li> This is doing a great job clearing up my hormonal acne.  It&#x27;s not too drying or too strong!  I&#x27;m so glad to have found something that works :D</li>
            <li> I bought these for my son because he has been breaking out extremely bad. I knew he is too young to keep up with using proactive so I decided to have him give these a try and I am glad I did! I have noticed a big difference in his acne. It has not fully went away but id say a good 50% has. I had originally purchased the aztec clay with it but realized he doesn&#x27;t even need to use that. I will be purchasing more pads soon. Im hoping by the summer all his acne will be gone. He loves these! I will post before and after pics once we give it a few more months. So far though we are beyond happy with the results!</li>
            <li> This product is a good replacement for my toner. Good so far!!</li>
            <li> My daughter is on her 3rd jar. She had acne scars that were really making her self conscious. I saw noticeable improvement after the first jar &amp; major improvement after the 2nd. It&#x27;s not an overnight miracle. But MAGIC does happen when you stay consistent with them!</li>
            <li> The MAGIC PADS are AMAZING! I have been using the pads for two months and have noticed a difference immediately. This has helped me with acne, large pores, and has given me a glow that I haven&#x27;t seen in years. This product is a must have and it&#x27;s one that I will never go without.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love that there are organic ingredients and its cruelty free. Use these daily and they are not too harsh and help my oily skin stay clear.</li>
            <li> This really does clear up dark blemishes.  I broke out on my forehead for about 5 weeks straight and when it was gone it had left darker spots from me picking at it so much.  They really are &amp;#34;Magic Pads.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Does wat it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love these Pads ❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> Really great product!  Has worked wonders on my teenage son&#x27;s skin and doesn&#x27;t dry his skin out.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and these work wonderfully. The convenience also has me washing my face more religiously.</li>
            <li> First, these are a little on the expensive side, especially if use several pads per day. Understand that the pads used for this product are fairly abrasive, this may or not be to your liking - I like it. I have always had troubled skin, and a life-time of studying and experimenting with diet and lifestyle have not left me completely adult-acne-free. I have used benzoil p. for years with pretty good results, but I decided to give a glycolic acid product a try - this one. I had some unusual scar tissue right under my bottom lip that embarrassed me and to cover the appearance I&#x27;ve grown my facial hair there for a long time. After using Magic Pads for one day I noticed the tissue was breaking up. A few weeks later and the protruding scar tissue is almost completely gone...this would seem miraculous to me if I hadn&#x27;t seen it for myself. I think that one of my issues is that my skin is so oily that it never gets to exfoliate properly on its own - Magic Pads has allowed a rejuvenating process to begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use BP and I&#x27;m experimenting with various Glycolic products, but this is the one that made me hopeful again. I&#x27;m very impressed. May not work for you, or may cause a temporary response wherein toxins make their way to the skin&#x27;s surface and create little pustules (I have read a small percentage of reports claiming this), but for me there have been no unwanted side-effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you give this a try, even if it seems expensive. If it doesn&#x27;t deliver what you hoped, you aren&#x27;t out too much money. But, if it does work, what is that worth to you?</li>
            <li> Great product!! Best acne treatment ive had so far after using the original proactiv line, X-Out, acne free.. Finally starting to see a clear face again! And very quick and simple to use..</li>
            <li> you cannot get a better product for the money!  a great value, and it has made my finicky winter skin AMAZING!! I have TRULY gone from DRAB TO FAB!!  Thank you Bianca Del Rio..and THE MAGIC PADS...you have a customer for LIFE!!</li>
            <li> These really are magic, they got rid of a pimple on my neck that wouldn&#x27;t go away after trying a lot of other products.  Love these!!!</li>
            <li> Helped even my skin tone and reduce my breakouts and blackheads. As an adult female with sensitive skin, I can only use certain ingredients. This product is simple and effective. I did not dry out. I did not break out. I did not get any rashes or burning sensation. It was smooth and soothing. If you can&#x27;t use harsh ingredients on your acne skin, give this a try. It&#x27;s worth it, trust me.</li>
            <li> Something odd happened to my face when I hit my 30s;  I started to break out more often as though I was a teenager...and I never had acne while I was a teen. I went to get a facial last month, and the esthetician suggested I try glycolic pads to help with my acne after I asked for her recommendations. So, I decided to seek options on Amazon, and I found this amazing product. I&#x27;ve been using the pads for a month now, and they have significantly improved the quality of my skin. After only a a couple of weeks of using one glycolic pad each night, even some of my coworkers began to notice the change in my appearance and commented on how I had this &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; and how I even looked younger. Even the size of my pores shrank by a lot. Honestly, I was a bit skeptical about this product even though it has great reviews, yet I can assure you it works wonders. I&#x27;m so glad my face is back to normal!</li>
            <li> These have really helped with my adult acne around my chin!!</li>
            <li> I love these Magic pads.  Was not expecting to see such a difference in such a short amount of time!  Pores look like they did when I was young and skin is so much smoother and brighter!  I use them once a day and will continue for years to come! I&#x27;m 55 years old and skin is looking younger every day.</li>
            <li> I received these about 5 days ago and I love them!  I am 52 and on hormone replacement so I still break out and it&#x27;s very frustrating.  After only a few days using the pads twice a day, my skin is very visibly clearer.  They are strong enough to do a little exfoliating and leave my face feeing very clean without over-drying it.  My teenage daughter is using them too and is so happy with the results!  Will absolutely continue to purchase these.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for two days, but so far it has reduced the redness on my face, and made it smoother. I hope it keeps working!</li>
            <li> I am 34 and have had acne since my teens. I have tried prescription oral medicine and topical medicine, but could not find any long-lasting solution. I had high hopes for the Magic Pads. However, my skin broke out worse than ever. The pad is very small and does not have an exfoliating texture. I have sensitive skin, so be wary of using these if you have sensitive skin. I am sorry I wasted my money on these pads. There is nothing magical about them; they make acne worse.</li>
            <li> A product my teen and me can share.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d try this, since my favorite drag queen, Bianca Del Rio recommended it. I&#x27;ve always had good skin, but the Magic Pads take it to the next level. Blackheads are less noticeable; skin is moisturized, not oily.The two zits I had disappeared the next day. My makeup goes on easier, looks better, and stays on longer. I totally think they&#x27;re worth the price. I started with using twice a day; now i just use at night. (i&#x27;m a 32-year-old female, who has tried everything from drugstore to premium counters)</li>
            <li> I experienced no irritation with these pads. Works great, my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> i simply love these pads , they work amazing on my face</li>
            <li> Love these pads!  I am 40ish and still get breakouts from time to time, plus now getting some lines and sagging skin.  The worst of all worlds.  I use them morning and night, and they keep my skin clear without drying it out.  This is impressive considering I have used these in Minnesota all winter long and didn&#x27;t have any dryness or flaking.  They cause no irritation of my sensitive skin.  These have replaced my previous salicylic acid product that I had been using for years.  I will continue to buy these as part of my everyday skin routine.</li>
            <li> Been using for a month. Some positive improvement.</li>
            <li> My favorite drag queen Bianca Del Rio endorses them and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. While I&#x27;m not sure I would purchase this product again, as I normally use something different to cleanse my face; I have no complaints. My skin does not feel irritated or dried out after I use these pads and since I don&#x27;t have acne, I can&#x27;t really say I&#x27;ve noticed a difference with my skin. The shipping was prompt and I did not need to contact the seller.</li>
            <li> My acne prone skin is healing nicely.  I liked them so much that I ordered another tub 2 weeks later b/c I was afraid to run out.  I use a pad morning &amp; night and also once a day on my hands.</li>
            <li> I love these pads! They gently exfoliate my sensitive skin, and dry up blemishes, but don&#x27;t dry out my skin . My pores feel clean, and my skin feels refreshed after using them. I love the smell, it&#x27;s not overpowering. I highly recommend these pads if you want to clear up your skin, and want to exfoliate without using harsh chemical products.</li>
            <li> Seems fabulous! It is very cleansing, but not harsh. I&#x27;m impressed. :)</li>
            <li> I started using the one in the am and one at nite, but my skin started to flake and peel.  They are powerful, and don&#x27;t burn.  I recommend only once a day.</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my skin feel. It has a cooling tingling effect to it that really makes me feel like it is working. My breakouts have greatly reduced since using this product, but I have had to start using a moisturizer with this, as it does dry out my skin a little. I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fantastic customer service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s &amp; have had moderate acne since I was a teenager that has never gone away. I&#x27;ve been using these pads for about a week &amp; I have already seen a significant improvement in my skin. Looking forward to more improvement!! :)</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been looking for an acne product that consistently works. Some worked but would eventually over-dry my skin which would then create a whole new problem. The Magic Pads consistently works and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. It is strong enough, yet gentle enough for your face. I use it twice a day and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using The Magic Pads for several months. I have been very pleased with the improvement of my skin. I am thrilled to find these pads are now on Amazon. It&#x27;s a win-win situation.</li>
            <li> I like it, not too harsh on my skin, but it has gotten rid of any rough patches. $20 bucks for 50 pads isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Bianca DelRio, and when I saw her posting about using the magic pads, I had to have a jar for myself. It was the right thing to do. I&#x27;ve never had my face be so clean. After using makeup remover wipes, I apply a magic pad to my face and am always shocked at how much dirt and makeup my makeup wipes have been missing. Also, my overall appearance of my skin has improved, looking smoother and brighter. I&#x27;m already on my second  jar!</li>
            <li> These are AMAZING!!! They work better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first but decided to give it a try.  No need to add use lotion after use, they leave your skin feeling soft and clean.  Defiantly a great buy!</li>
            <li> I have tried a million products and I gave these a shot because of the positive reviews.  Well I am not disappointed.  I have been using them for 2 weeks now and my skin isnt only clearer but more hydrated and smoother than its been in months.  So far I am really liking these pads!</li>
            <li> I really do love this product. However...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other day I got an email that said if I leave a 5 star review on Amazon they&#x27;ll send me a free jar of Magic Pads. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but it turned me off and I felt like they were trying to buy a good review. Left a bad impression with me, therefore, review is knocked down to 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought these for myself after, yes, hearing Bianca Del Rio rave about them on her Instagram feed. However, my 11 year old daughter quickly declared them her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pads are cooling to use and feel great on my skin. I just use them once a day after washing and before moisturizing at night. They have kept my skin soft and reduced blemishes. My 11 year old doesn&#x27;t wear make-up and they have reduced her pre-teen acne quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a feeling these will be a regular purchase. Thanks Magic Pads!</li>
            <li> Love these as they have made a great difference to my skintone... Been using it for a couple of months now and love what I see in the mirror... Keep up the good work!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Magic Pads! I have cystic acne due to PCOS and they have made a huge difference!! Even when I get one or two during shark week it clears up fast with no scarring and my old scars are GONE!! Just gone!! It&#x27;s a miracle. My skins tone is more even and super smooth (I have fair skin with red undertones) and I wear less and less make up each week! I used to wear concealer and cover up and primer and powder...now I just use a little concealer and a translucent powder. By far the thing I have done for my skin in a long time!,You will NOT regret trying them.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Bianca del Rio for the awesome advice!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using this for a week and our faces look better. My daughters acne has dried up considerably and she is not breaking out.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my 16 year old son and 13 year old daughter. They don&#x27;t have severe acne , just stubborn acne. Store bought products worked hit and miss, but mostly miss. The magic pads have been a relief for my wife and I because it has taken the guess work out of helping our teens control / prevent their breakouts. Love this stuff, it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> I used to do demos for organic skincare products, so I was familiar with the ingredients in Magic Pads. This product works better for my sensitive skin than any of the other significantly more expensive products that I have used in the past. I have gotten rid of my skin regimen (essentially a war chest) and now solely use Magic Pads. They have even gotten rid of a dry spot that I have never been able to tackle before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Bianca Del Rio for your recommendation!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product! Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> i love these things! my skin is so soft and my blemish issues have cleared up! i will definitely keep buying.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best product so far! i love the THE MAGIC PADS .. i can see the different on my skin in just one week. I highly recommend this product to others. THE MAGIC PADS simply amazing.</li>
            <li> My skin is healthier since I started using these pads. Great product</li>
            <li> So far, it has helped my acne problem. I&#x27;ve had no irritation or further breakouts since starting these. Great product.</li>
            <li> I have used many products way more expensive than this, but I was pleasantly surprised to find this one works just as well.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d see at least a small difference,  wasnt expexting too much, but I am using it for weeks now and didn&#x27;t see any!! was a waist of money.. can I send it back?</li>
            <li> I am so excited to tell everyone about this product!!! I have had acne for about 10 years and have tried everything from drug store products to high end to natural everything, I saw this online and thought why not try this if it doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;ll be on to the next. NOPE, I&#x27;m sticking to this for the rest of my life, I use to wake up with maybe 5-6 active pimples everyday now it&#x27;s only maybe 1-2 a week and it def is helping my old scars fade. Please never discontinue!!!! Everyone needs to try this. Oh plus I have super sensitive skin and this does not irratate.</li>
