            <li>but I think these are a perfect solution for the task I use them for.</li>
            <li>This is the best use I&#x27;ve found for these</li>

            <li>Great price with amazon prime.</li>
            <li>it great for applying shadow as eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am happy to have Q-Tip swabs that already have somewhat of a point.  </li>
            <li>A great addition to my arsenal.</li>
            <li>lots of great uses.</li>
            <li>The fine-tipped Q-tips are great for hobbies and crafts, but not so great for ear cleaning.</li>
            <li>I am a happy customer.</li>
            <li>These swabs are great for that.</li>
            <li>The tip is great for applying make-up or cleaning up eyeliner smudges or mistakes.  </li>
            <li>This type of Q-tip is great for that.  </li>
            <li>None of these procedures is routinely successful.  </li>
            <li>Now it is a good product, but to be very honest</li>
            <li>This product was of good quality and as described.</li>
            <li>They are also good for refining eyebrow pencil applications or perfecting lip lines.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re traveling and forgot your eyes hadow brushes, these will make a good substitute.  </li>
            <li>These Q-Tips are of really good use for make-up too.</li>
            <li>Also the tip is good for my glass art cleanup and corrections.</li>
            <li>But, this is a good addition to the bathroom &amp;#34;stuff.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>They are also good as a tool for blending eye shadow.</li>
            <li>So, for me, they&#x27;re good for home maintenance.  </li>
            <li>put some of these in my guest room and all my guests loved it and ordered for themselves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good that QTips released these before our increasingly meddlesome government could block this product from being sold.</li>
            <li>I find they particularly good for cleaning around the edges of your ear.</li>
            <li>So, what are they good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>A dab of food coloring and you are good</li>
            <li>also a good for cleaning that corner on a laptop monitor where the plastic meets the screen.</li>
            <li>I use Q Tips to clean my ear channels and this is a perfect shape for it.</li>
            <li>Love these great for cleaning and makeup.</li>
            <li>These precision tip swabs work great for so many things.</li>
            <li>perfect for gun cleaning and applying clp products right where you want it.</li>
            <li>pleased!</li>
            <li>This is another product I love!</li>
            <li>/&gt;To put it simply, I love these!  </li>
            <li>As advertised, they are good for precision work that needs a very fine cotton swab.</li>
            <li>They handle easily and are very effective.  </li>
            <li>in precise manner, these Q-tips are great.</li>
            <li>own pointy elbows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice, pointy tips for precision.  </li>
            <li>My wife used them with her make-up applications and she liked them.  </li>
            <li>, you won&#x27;t use them to tidy up your ears.</li>
            <li>I do my own nails, and always get polish on my skin.</li>
            <li>The cotton effectively removes the spots of polish on the sides of my cuticle or finger.  </li>
            <li>Great for makeup correction but hurt your ears if you use it to clean up your ears.</li>
            <li>If you are into art as am I, you will find these q-tips very handy in applying paints in special ways.</li>
            <li>I love these for use in home manicures and polishing my own nails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you can come up with your own uses.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a great and useful</li>
            <li>Keep them around for special needs when I need a good, pointy tip...</li>
            <li>Just dip one in eye makeup remover and the precision pointed tip takes care of smears without messing up the rest of your makeup; you can be very precise with them.  </li>
            <li>I use it to wipe of anesthesia on the eylid &amp; it is very precise.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love them for correcting eye makeup mishaps.  </li>
            <li>These are OK.  </li>
            <li>I have been using them and love their pointy end</li>
            <li>Yes, there are warning labels about sticking things in your ears but what do most people use QTips for, anyway?</li>
            <li>These work wonderfully as eyeshadow/eyeliners blenders (especially underneath</li>
            <li>I shopped many places in my area and no one carried these.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure i it would make a difference or not, but it did.</li>
            <li>Love these Precision Tips.  </li>
            <li>I love these for eye make up and car detailing.</li>
            <li>just use another one, and still better than classic-type cotton buds.</li>
            <li>They are better in cleaning because of the added tip.  </li>
            <li>Sure, as some reviewers pointed out, the end doesn&#x27;t stay pointed because the more you use it, the more rounded it gets but what do you expect?</li>
            <li>The difference with these Precision Q-Tips is that the ends have more of a point to them.</li>
            <li>It just goes to show, that you have to have the appropriate \\&quot;need\\&quot;</li>
            <li>These precision tips are not only wonderful for make up removal, but my husband and I use them in our lawnmower shop and art studio.</li>
            <li>The precision tips allow better control for application of decals and cleaning overspray from my airbrushes.  </li>
            <li>For use with make-up there&#x27;s nothing better.  </li>
            <li>I love the tapered edge of the precision tip Q-Tips because they can be used for almost anything.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was going to think about these when they came.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;these simply are the best.</li>
            <li>Depending on the price at which you obtain them, I think you will find them a worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li>That is not what most people would look for in something they are putting in their ears.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I think this is a very useful</li>
            <li>JOY JOY to find in multi-pack since I use so many of these for my nails and other purposes.</li>
            <li>Precision Tip is a nice variation on the known and trusted original.</li>
            <li>Much more accurate and.. PRECISE!  </li>
            <li>Easily one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>The new pointy style tips on these Qtips come in very handy.  </li>
            <li>Q-Tips are finally available in a precision-tip design, and I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all good nothing much to say with this product.</li>
            <li>the cotton tips fray so easily.  </li>
            <li>The tip is pointed, and fairly strong for spun cotton.  </li>
            <li>Good to have both these and normal Q-tips on hand.</li>
            <li>They are very precise and easy to use for making clean lines (I paint on a color for the tips, and then use the precision Q-Tips dipped in nail polish remover to create a clean line).</li>
            <li>The Amazon packing was fine</li>
            <li>The sharper tip can also make a fine, disposable paintbrush.  </li>
            <li>and you should be fine.</li>
            <li>and it is comfortable and strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this new product!</li>
            <li>I just use warm water and wipe gently</li>
            <li>I use these primarily for make-up.</li>
            <li>This one does a great job in reaching the inner channel without pushing anything there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are not that precise and/or tapered/angled at the tips and they lose their shape almost immediately.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like any off-brand swabs, so i always end up coming back to q-tip, and it&#x27;s perfect that you can buy them on here.</li>
            <li>I am sure I will find other great uses for them too.</li>
            <li>The real ones are manufactured to clean electronics, and are firmer, much more pointed, and they hold the tip shape better.</li>
            <li>Since I have always been a fan of Qtips, these precision tips ones will be very useful.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ll stick with the original Qtips for applicable manly grooming needs.</li>
            <li>Never a disappointment, ever!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re multipurpose, and really useful!</li>
            <li>Every time I&#x27;ve used this method on me or my husband (the original Daverat), we find the Zit never comes to a head.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps her clean and pretty :)</li>
            <li>These are awesome, new Qtips, but won&#x27;t replace the normal round-tip I&#x27;ve been using my whole life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never seen these before and guessed that they&#x27;d have less cotton on them, to be ideal for cleaning my APV tank and coil replacement heads/drip tips (I&#x27;m a vaper)</li>
            <li>These precision tip QTips allow me to \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; around my nails without smudging the polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li>to clean crevices, and to neaten the cuticle area (when applying toenail/fingernail polish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got them to clean up the trem when I paint my nails.</li>
            <li>Extremely useful item, arrived quickly in great condition, bargain price compared to local stores.</li>
            <li>I use these to clean my Sphynx cat&#x27;s ears.  </li>
            <li>Not only can they still clean your ears but they&#x27;re also good for applying make-up around the eyes and even lip gloss.</li>
            <li>QTips are the kind of product you really don&#x27;t think about very much.</li>
            <li>Careful not to use on my ears, I used them to touch up paint projects (worked great).  </li>
            <li>I really like them but would like them better if they had one side paddle for eye shadow application and pointed tip for eye liner and everything else.</li>
            <li>However, they seem to do a good enough job at that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sometimes in order to experience the true benefit of a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Another use for them is to apply minute amounts of cream medications in precisely the right spot.  </li>
            <li>This item is actually three packs which each have 170 precision tip cotton swabs - 510 total - which means this is a great price!</li>
            <li>The tips on this product are only semi-sharp at best and when they arrived the sides of every package had been squashed just enough</li>
            <li>The cotton is thicker and it stays on better, same as Band Aids seem to be made better as well and the adhesive works longer.</li>
            <li>The best I can say is that these are slightly better than regular Q-tips, but a long way from real precision swabs.</li>
            <li>okay, so what&#x27;s the big deal review, until my wife discovered these and was immediatly thrilled with how well they work in dealing with certain make-up issues.  </li>
            <li>However, using them in a more dry (precision) situation is far more effective.</li>
            <li>These are great for makeup application and for cleaning in tight spots.  </li>
            <li>for using these to apply cosmetics or clean up your manicure, they&#x27;re just exactly what you need.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not as firm as something like a marker would be, but they are noticeably pointy which makes them great for detail</li>
            <li>I really liked the quality of the regular Q-tips you find at the store.  </li>
            <li>Do not poke these in your ear, as the shape is narrower than the regular kind</li>
            <li>have trimmed far too many Q-Tips over the decades for a variety of purposes.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great for reaching hard-to-reach places but since the cotton bud is soft it soon deforms and, like regular ones, with continual probing starts to come</li>
            <li>Effective, practical, for hygiene, medical,  beauty, and cosmetology applications</li>
            <li>but I must say that I did find these Precision Tip Q-tips quite useful.</li>
            <li>A brush is useful</li>
            <li>I use these to clean bits and pieces and they are better than standard Q-Tips.</li>
            <li>Q-tips are Q-tips, right?</li>
            <li>I was all prepared to right an</li>
            <li>but sometimes these Q-tips proved to be just the right thing.</li>
            <li>Great little tool!</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve had them though, I&#x27;ve realized that not only are they good for cleaning your ears (the precision tip really just doesn&#x27;t waste cotton), but they do a really good job of getting into nicks and crannies and crevices around the house.</li>
            <li>My hand is never as steady as the girls&#x27; in the salon, but with these Q-Tips, I can clean up any mistakes.  </li>
            <li>The tip is so soft the point softens into shapelessness very quickly.  </li>
            <li>However, I do find them much more useful than regular QTips for makeup and nail polish application.  </li>
            <li>such a useful tool&lt;br /&gt;For make-up, nails and touching up&lt;br /&gt;Those</li>
            <li>The precision tip is excellent for many functions where you need a little finer point, from cleaning hard-to-get-to nooks and crannies on devices to applying color to small items.</li>
            <li>The price is pretty good for a three pack as it gives out slightly over five hundred Q-tips.</li>
            <li>While I wouldn&#x27;t use these for every job I use a Q-tip for, I must say, these Precision Tip Q-tips are a much better item to have on hand for detailed cleaning of keyboards, appliances, electronics and other machinery.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them to gently remove something stuck in my gums, to apply some touch-up paint to a difficult-to-reach area, and to clean the very edges of a LCD screen.</li>
            <li>Personally, I love having these around the house for special projects, or just getting into those harder to reach spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That is, until finally someone had the bright idea to expand its uses and make a version that had a more pointed, narrow tip.</li>
            <li>but not enough better that I will buy again.</li>
            <li>The only downfall would be the price is a bit steep for cotton swabs, however the price I found on Amazon was better than any local store where I was able to find these precision cotton swabs.</li>
            <li>With regular Q-tips, I would pull off some of the cotton ends to make them thinner and then use them under my lower eyelashes, but these work better.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, many people have tried the same thing I have, and Q-Tip decided to offer a version that already has a tip that has somewhat of a point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tips are blunt and unravel immediately and aren&#x27;t much better than a regular Q-Tip.</li>
            <li>I realize many people, including myself, have found many other uses for these cotton swabs other than cleaning out the Dumbo muscles, so the company decided to create these swabs for better precision.</li>
            <li>Regular Q-Tips work better for this too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, my personal favorite use is to get nail polish off of my fingers.</li>
            <li>work better then the way manicurists wrap cotton on a wooden cuticle stick!</li>
            <li>they have less cotton and fit into my tanks and accessories better.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a bit softer than I&#x27;d like, but certain able to get at finer areas than the regular ones.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t press hard and go in short strokes for best results.</li>
            <li>While a woman might find these useful for make-up removal and/or application, I found them best suited for cleaning dirty groves and 90-degree joints (like where window glass meets wood or sealant).  </li>
            <li>One other great thing to use these for is a home -heat treatment for the occasional breakout.  </li>
            <li>but I use them everyday on my Exotic Shorthair (shorthaired persian) to clean around her eyes.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty neat idea because they allow you to get into many more small, tight spots with better precision, hence the name.</li>
            <li>but I like that these are more stiff than the original.</li>
            <li>Also great for cleaning out your ears, in all the troublesome corners n&#x27; stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tapered tips &#x27;shed&#x27; less than normal QTips, and are more firm.</li>
            <li>and that way I can easily touch up any stray flake or flecks of mascara without ruining my entire face.  </li>
            <li>Great for odd jobs such as gun cleaning etc.</li>
            <li>I am only truly surprised it took them this long to realize how useful a more finely pointed QTip would be.</li>
            <li>They are also much cheaper than purchasing the ones from beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li>Product arrived really fast.</li>
            <li>Now I can buy them this way which is a much nicer alternative.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love these Q-tips with a tapered edge for getting to the harder to reach stuff.  </li>
            <li>As such, they are quite well suited to a variety of detailed cleaning tasks.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t have much need for that.</li>
            <li>Thought these would be better than the old standard Q-tips - and they are for a number of purposes.  </li>
            <li>The pointy tip is far better than the regular cotton swab.</li>
            <li>I got these expecting to be able to clean (gently) the insides of my ears, but the cotton is rather hard, so it didn&#x27;t really do that job too well.  </li>
            <li>Many other uses, too.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand they DO fit into smaller cracks and crevices pretty nicely, but that&#x27;s counterbalanced by the aforementioned sharpness.</li>
            <li>The tips are quite big to clean the cuticle area.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The pointed tip makes it useful for more precise cleaning, or cleaning or doing other things requiring a swab in a confined area that requires something smaller than a regular QTip.</li>
            <li>Pour a few drop of foundation onto a clean ceramic dish, mix in your moisturizer and then dot it onto your face with one of this and blend with a CLEAN disposable or washable make-up sponge.  </li>
            <li>These q-tips have a more defined shape than your average teardrop shaped q-tips.</li>
            <li>The pointy tip is great but doesn&#x27;t stand up at all when they get a little wet.</li>
            <li>so I thought these would be better because they are pointy on both ends and they cost less.  </li>
            <li>Well, this particular Q-Tip has a catch: a pointed, \\&quot;precision\\&quot; end.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, I noticed that the back of the box details all the things you can do with the Precision Tip Qtips, but most of them don&#x27;t involve personal care.  </li>
            <li>But they do serve a decent purpose from time to time.</li>
            <li>These things have always been out on the Department Store make-up counters and now we have them at a decent price.  </li>
            <li>I was using a cotton swab (don&#x27;t know the name) with a firm, sharp, pointed tip that worked great for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>In the photo, they appear to be a little more tapered to a point.</li>
            <li>Q-tips Cotton Swabs with precision tip is precise and pointed than the broad design which came earlier.</li>
            <li>It is kind of hard to say a lot about a Q-tip</li>
            <li>This really gets all of my &amp;#34;mistakes&amp;#34; off and it looks like I got a professional manicure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are just like normal Q-Tips, but have pointed tips.</li>
            <li>In addition, I use a heavy degreaser applied to the tip of the precision tip to get kitchen gunk out of the creases of my stove top range and out of the cross-threads of screws.  </li>
            <li>Point is just right for doing a bit of precision makeup work - can dab a bit of extra makeup over a blemish or dark spot for better coverage, use the point for cleanup of mascara on upper lid, smoothing of your eyeliner, use the flat edge to roll under your lower eyelashes to clean up any residue you don&#x27;t want...</li>
            <li>The new design feels tailor-made for that purpose.</li>
            <li>Who would have thought that the age-old Qtip could be new and improved?</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s new and improved.</li>
            <li>that use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might, however, use them to clean up a doll&#x27;s ear after it was dragged through a wet sandbox.</li>
            <li>I also discovered that I can stick these through the tiny hole in my bottle of eye makeup remover but the regular cotton swabs don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>Found better quality with some unknown Chinese brands.  </li>
            <li>Dipped in a little hot water, and they will provide a quick scrub of keyboard letters.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Or to paint a carefully drawn ear on a special birthday cake.</li>
            <li>Also works great for tiny corners and my favorite: around the base of faucets and knobs.</li>
            <li>These Precision Tips Qtips are great for getting into tight and small places.  </li>
            <li>does the job, but is softer, with a less precise pointed tip than what I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li>These work much better than regular Q-Tips for everything other than cleaning inside your ears!  </li>
            <li>I guess they are a little better than regular q-tips if you are looking for pointy ends,</li>
            <li>These are hard to find as they are sold out in most stores already, as soon as they hit the shelf.</li>
            <li>These really work, especially for under eye makeup</li>
            <li>old wife well knows</li>
            <li>Q-Tips are one of those items that nearly everyone has because you can use them for 1,001 things.  </li>
            <li>They require daily cleaning and these get into the folds very well.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used these for any makeup type applications, so I really can&#x27;t comment there, and at 170 count in one package, they will probably last me quite a while for my cleaning projects!</li>
            <li>No, That pointy tip is just too pointy to get near eyes.</li>
            <li>, then you&#x27;ll know that our hands are some of the filthiest, germ infested things we could ever touch our faces with, even with frequent washings.  </li>
            <li>The tip is a lot more narrow than regular ones.</li>
            <li>so what little original sharpness they had was gone and</li>
            <li>you need to get into very small spots for cleaning, this is a very handy little swab to have on hand.  </li>
            <li>The precision tip does smush down fairly quickly but that&#x27;s life...</li>
            <li>the plus side, even if the tip is not quite sharp enough, it is relatively easy to trim the tip just a little to make it sharper, which is great for cleaning corners, under keyboard keys, and in other tight places.  </li>
            <li>My main reason for buying them was for cleaning the hearing aid molds from daily use.  </li>
            <li>I found that my ordinary rounded tip qtips was able to do the same thing.</li>
            <li>The tapered heads are both pointier than a regular q-tip and also firmer, so if you&#x27;re poking a hard-to-reach cranny on an electronics board, they won&#x27;t fall apart too easily and leave little cottony residues everywhere.  </li>
            <li>They have the obvious cosmetic advantage where if you need to cover a blemish you can easily apply a product to a very small area with reasonable precision.</li>
            <li>They hold alcohol well and fit in small places.</li>
            <li>I actually don&#x27;t mind that they&#x27;re a bit more expensive than the other style because these offer more uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new \\&quot;Precision Tip\\&quot; really does make a difference, when using these Q-Tips for things other than ear cleaning.</li>
            <li>*too* worked up about these new Qtips - after all, these are simply regular QTips with the addition of a tapered \\&quot;precision\\&quot; tip.</li>
            <li>The price was good for so many, but I was a little disappointed in the &amp;#34;precision&amp;#34; tips.</li>
            <li>At least they were cheap enough--I&#x27;ll use them as I would the normal tipped swabs and buy a different brand for detail work.</li>
            <li>The cotton is perhaps a bit more firm than other Q-Tips, which some may or may not like.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even find these at my local grocery stores (and I live in a good-sized college city), but normal Q-Tips are considerably more expensive locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not enough cotton on the swabs, they are quite sharp, and they don&#x27;t get as much \\&quot;grit\\&quot; as normal cotton swabs.</li>
            <li>No matter how hard I try I always get a tiny speck of mascara in the wrong place or a wobble in my eyeliner and a Q-Tip is perfect for touch-up.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t soft enough.</li>
            <li>When you need a harder, pointier cotton swab, QTips cotton swabs are a reasonable choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Brockeim</li>
            <li>Non-Oily Instant Cleanser Sensitive Eyes 125ml/4.2oz]]</li>
            <li>Just remember not to use them with the same amount of force or expect the same level of quantity per swap from these compared to normal sized Q-Tips</li>
            <li>I have long used Q-Tips in various hobbies, particularly for building models, and for cleaning things.  </li>
            <li>These are exactly what I&#x27;ve been needing to fix little oops spots on the side of my nails.  </li>
            <li>When I tried to twist the end on a regular qtip they wouldn&#x27;t twist right, wouldn&#x27;t hold, and came out uneven.  </li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to receive these QTips through Amazon Vine, but I&#x27;ll definitely buy them in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to get</li>
            <li>I stick with the regular quips for other things as they are so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also quite handy for cleaning dust buildup out of electric guitar hardware; few other dusting implements can get into areas so narrow.  </li>
            <li>Good tool and less expensive than those made specifically for makeup.</li>

            <li> lots of great uses.</li>
            <li> The fine-tipped Q-tips are great for hobbies and crafts, but not so great for ear cleaning.</li>

            <li> Now it is a good product, but to be very honest</li>
            <li> This product was of good quality and as described.</li>
            <li> They are also good for refining eyebrow pencil applications or perfecting lip lines.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re traveling and forgot your eyes hadow brushes, these will make a good substitute.  </li>
            <li> These Q-Tips are of really good use for make-up too.</li>
            <li> Also the tip is good for my glass art cleanup and corrections.</li>
            <li> But, this is a good addition to the bathroom &amp;#34;stuff.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They are also good as a tool for blending eye shadow.</li>
            <li> So, for me, they&#x27;re good for home maintenance.  </li>
            <li> put some of these in my guest room and all my guests loved it and ordered for themselves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good that QTips released these before our increasingly meddlesome government could block this product from being sold.</li>
            <li> I find they particularly good for cleaning around the edges of your ear.</li>
            <li> So, what are they good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> A dab of food coloring and you are good</li>
            <li> also a good for cleaning that corner on a laptop monitor where the plastic meets the screen.</li>
            <li> I use Q Tips to clean my ear channels and this is a perfect shape for it.</li>

            <li> pleased!</li>
            <li> This is another product I love!</li>
            <li> /&gt;To put it simply, I love these!  </li>
            <li> As advertised, they are good for precision work that needs a very fine cotton swab.</li>
            <li> They handle easily and are very effective.  </li>
            <li> in precise manner, these Q-tips are great.</li>
            <li> own pointy elbows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice, pointy tips for precision.  </li>
            <li> My wife used them with her make-up applications and she liked them.  </li>
            <li> , you won&#x27;t use them to tidy up your ears.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails, and always get polish on my skin.</li>
            <li> The cotton effectively removes the spots of polish on the sides of my cuticle or finger.  </li>
            <li> Great for makeup correction but hurt your ears if you use it to clean up your ears.</li>
            <li> If you are into art as am I, you will find these q-tips very handy in applying paints in special ways.</li>
            <li> I love these for use in home manicures and polishing my own nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you can come up with your own uses.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a great and useful</li>
            <li> Keep them around for special needs when I need a good, pointy tip...</li>
            <li> Just dip one in eye makeup remover and the precision pointed tip takes care of smears without messing up the rest of your makeup; you can be very precise with them.  </li>
            <li> I use it to wipe of anesthesia on the eylid &amp; it is very precise.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love them for correcting eye makeup mishaps.  </li>
            <li> These are OK.  </li>
            <li> I have been using them and love their pointy end</li>
            <li> Yes, there are warning labels about sticking things in your ears but what do most people use QTips for, anyway?</li>
            <li> These work wonderfully as eyeshadow/eyeliners blenders (especially underneath</li>
            <li> I shopped many places in my area and no one carried these.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure i it would make a difference or not, but it did.</li>
            <li> Love these Precision Tips.  </li>
            <li> I love these for eye make up and car detailing.</li>
            <li> just use another one, and still better than classic-type cotton buds.</li>
            <li> They are better in cleaning because of the added tip.  </li>
            <li> Sure, as some reviewers pointed out, the end doesn&#x27;t stay pointed because the more you use it, the more rounded it gets but what do you expect?</li>
            <li> The difference with these Precision Q-Tips is that the ends have more of a point to them.</li>
            <li> It just goes to show, that you have to have the appropriate \\&quot;need\\&quot;</li>
            <li> These precision tips are not only wonderful for make up removal, but my husband and I use them in our lawnmower shop and art studio.</li>
            <li> The precision tips allow better control for application of decals and cleaning overspray from my airbrushes.  </li>
            <li> For use with make-up there&#x27;s nothing better.  </li>
            <li> I love the tapered edge of the precision tip Q-Tips because they can be used for almost anything.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was going to think about these when they came.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;these simply are the best.</li>
            <li> Depending on the price at which you obtain them, I think you will find them a worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li> That is not what most people would look for in something they are putting in their ears.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I think this is a very useful</li>
            <li> JOY JOY to find in multi-pack since I use so many of these for my nails and other purposes.</li>
            <li> Precision Tip is a nice variation on the known and trusted original.</li>
            <li> Much more accurate and.. PRECISE!  </li>
            <li> Easily one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> The new pointy style tips on these Qtips come in very handy.  </li>
            <li> Q-Tips are finally available in a precision-tip design, and I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all good nothing much to say with this product.</li>
            <li> the cotton tips fray so easily.  </li>
            <li> The tip is pointed, and fairly strong for spun cotton.  </li>
            <li> Good to have both these and normal Q-tips on hand.</li>
            <li> They are very precise and easy to use for making clean lines (I paint on a color for the tips, and then use the precision Q-Tips dipped in nail polish remover to create a clean line).</li>
            <li> The Amazon packing was fine</li>
            <li> The sharper tip can also make a fine, disposable paintbrush.  </li>
            <li> and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> and it is comfortable and strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this new product!</li>
            <li> I just use warm water and wipe gently</li>
            <li> I use these primarily for make-up.</li>
            <li> This one does a great job in reaching the inner channel without pushing anything there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are not that precise and/or tapered/angled at the tips and they lose their shape almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like any off-brand swabs, so i always end up coming back to q-tip, and it&#x27;s perfect that you can buy them on here.</li>
            <li> I am sure I will find other great uses for them too.</li>
            <li> The real ones are manufactured to clean electronics, and are firmer, much more pointed, and they hold the tip shape better.</li>
            <li> Since I have always been a fan of Qtips, these precision tips ones will be very useful.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll stick with the original Qtips for applicable manly grooming needs.</li>
            <li> Never a disappointment, ever!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re multipurpose, and really useful!</li>
            <li> Every time I&#x27;ve used this method on me or my husband (the original Daverat), we find the Zit never comes to a head.  </li>
            <li> and it keeps her clean and pretty :)</li>
            <li> These are awesome, new Qtips, but won&#x27;t replace the normal round-tip I&#x27;ve been using my whole life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never seen these before and guessed that they&#x27;d have less cotton on them, to be ideal for cleaning my APV tank and coil replacement heads/drip tips (I&#x27;m a vaper)</li>
            <li> These precision tip QTips allow me to \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; around my nails without smudging the polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> to clean crevices, and to neaten the cuticle area (when applying toenail/fingernail polish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got them to clean up the trem when I paint my nails.</li>
            <li> Extremely useful item, arrived quickly in great condition, bargain price compared to local stores.</li>
            <li> I use these to clean my Sphynx cat&#x27;s ears.  </li>
            <li> Not only can they still clean your ears but they&#x27;re also good for applying make-up around the eyes and even lip gloss.</li>
            <li> QTips are the kind of product you really don&#x27;t think about very much.</li>
            <li> Careful not to use on my ears, I used them to touch up paint projects (worked great).  </li>
            <li> I really like them but would like them better if they had one side paddle for eye shadow application and pointed tip for eye liner and everything else.</li>
            <li> However, they seem to do a good enough job at that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sometimes in order to experience the true benefit of a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Another use for them is to apply minute amounts of cream medications in precisely the right spot.  </li>
            <li> This item is actually three packs which each have 170 precision tip cotton swabs - 510 total - which means this is a great price!</li>
            <li> The tips on this product are only semi-sharp at best and when they arrived the sides of every package had been squashed just enough</li>
            <li> The cotton is thicker and it stays on better, same as Band Aids seem to be made better as well and the adhesive works longer.</li>
            <li> The best I can say is that these are slightly better than regular Q-tips, but a long way from real precision swabs.</li>
            <li> okay, so what&#x27;s the big deal review, until my wife discovered these and was immediatly thrilled with how well they work in dealing with certain make-up issues.  </li>
            <li> However, using them in a more dry (precision) situation is far more effective.</li>
            <li> These are great for makeup application and for cleaning in tight spots.  </li>
            <li> for using these to apply cosmetics or clean up your manicure, they&#x27;re just exactly what you need.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not as firm as something like a marker would be, but they are noticeably pointy which makes them great for detail</li>
            <li> I really liked the quality of the regular Q-tips you find at the store.  </li>
            <li> Do not poke these in your ear, as the shape is narrower than the regular kind</li>
            <li> have trimmed far too many Q-Tips over the decades for a variety of purposes.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great for reaching hard-to-reach places but since the cotton bud is soft it soon deforms and, like regular ones, with continual probing starts to come</li>
            <li> Effective, practical, for hygiene, medical,  beauty, and cosmetology applications</li>
            <li> but I must say that I did find these Precision Tip Q-tips quite useful.</li>
            <li> A brush is useful</li>
            <li> I use these to clean bits and pieces and they are better than standard Q-Tips.</li>
            <li> Q-tips are Q-tips, right?</li>
            <li> I was all prepared to right an</li>
            <li> but sometimes these Q-tips proved to be just the right thing.</li>
            <li> Great little tool!</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve had them though, I&#x27;ve realized that not only are they good for cleaning your ears (the precision tip really just doesn&#x27;t waste cotton), but they do a really good job of getting into nicks and crannies and crevices around the house.</li>
            <li> My hand is never as steady as the girls&#x27; in the salon, but with these Q-Tips, I can clean up any mistakes.  </li>
            <li> The tip is so soft the point softens into shapelessness very quickly.  </li>
            <li> However, I do find them much more useful than regular QTips for makeup and nail polish application.  </li>
            <li> such a useful tool&lt;br /&gt;For make-up, nails and touching up&lt;br /&gt;Those</li>
            <li> The precision tip is excellent for many functions where you need a little finer point, from cleaning hard-to-get-to nooks and crannies on devices to applying color to small items.</li>
            <li> The price is pretty good for a three pack as it gives out slightly over five hundred Q-tips.</li>
            <li> While I wouldn&#x27;t use these for every job I use a Q-tip for, I must say, these Precision Tip Q-tips are a much better item to have on hand for detailed cleaning of keyboards, appliances, electronics and other machinery.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them to gently remove something stuck in my gums, to apply some touch-up paint to a difficult-to-reach area, and to clean the very edges of a LCD screen.</li>
            <li> Personally, I love having these around the house for special projects, or just getting into those harder to reach spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That is, until finally someone had the bright idea to expand its uses and make a version that had a more pointed, narrow tip.</li>
            <li> but not enough better that I will buy again.</li>
            <li> The only downfall would be the price is a bit steep for cotton swabs, however the price I found on Amazon was better than any local store where I was able to find these precision cotton swabs.</li>
            <li> With regular Q-tips, I would pull off some of the cotton ends to make them thinner and then use them under my lower eyelashes, but these work better.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, many people have tried the same thing I have, and Q-Tip decided to offer a version that already has a tip that has somewhat of a point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tips are blunt and unravel immediately and aren&#x27;t much better than a regular Q-Tip.</li>
            <li> I realize many people, including myself, have found many other uses for these cotton swabs other than cleaning out the Dumbo muscles, so the company decided to create these swabs for better precision.</li>
            <li> Regular Q-Tips work better for this too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, my personal favorite use is to get nail polish off of my fingers.</li>
            <li> work better then the way manicurists wrap cotton on a wooden cuticle stick!</li>
            <li> they have less cotton and fit into my tanks and accessories better.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a bit softer than I&#x27;d like, but certain able to get at finer areas than the regular ones.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t press hard and go in short strokes for best results.</li>
            <li> While a woman might find these useful for make-up removal and/or application, I found them best suited for cleaning dirty groves and 90-degree joints (like where window glass meets wood or sealant).  </li>
            <li> One other great thing to use these for is a home -heat treatment for the occasional breakout.  </li>
            <li> but I use them everyday on my Exotic Shorthair (shorthaired persian) to clean around her eyes.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty neat idea because they allow you to get into many more small, tight spots with better precision, hence the name.</li>
            <li> but I like that these are more stiff than the original.</li>
            <li> Also great for cleaning out your ears, in all the troublesome corners n&#x27; stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tapered tips &#x27;shed&#x27; less than normal QTips, and are more firm.</li>
            <li> and that way I can easily touch up any stray flake or flecks of mascara without ruining my entire face.  </li>
            <li> Great for odd jobs such as gun cleaning etc.</li>
            <li> I am only truly surprised it took them this long to realize how useful a more finely pointed QTip would be.</li>
            <li> They are also much cheaper than purchasing the ones from beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> Product arrived really fast.</li>
            <li> Now I can buy them this way which is a much nicer alternative.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love these Q-tips with a tapered edge for getting to the harder to reach stuff.  </li>
            <li> As such, they are quite well suited to a variety of detailed cleaning tasks.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t have much need for that.</li>
            <li> Thought these would be better than the old standard Q-tips - and they are for a number of purposes.  </li>
            <li> The pointy tip is far better than the regular cotton swab.</li>
            <li> I got these expecting to be able to clean (gently) the insides of my ears, but the cotton is rather hard, so it didn&#x27;t really do that job too well.  </li>
            <li> Many other uses, too.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand they DO fit into smaller cracks and crevices pretty nicely, but that&#x27;s counterbalanced by the aforementioned sharpness.</li>
            <li> The tips are quite big to clean the cuticle area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The pointed tip makes it useful for more precise cleaning, or cleaning or doing other things requiring a swab in a confined area that requires something smaller than a regular QTip.</li>
            <li> Pour a few drop of foundation onto a clean ceramic dish, mix in your moisturizer and then dot it onto your face with one of this and blend with a CLEAN disposable or washable make-up sponge.  </li>
            <li> These q-tips have a more defined shape than your average teardrop shaped q-tips.</li>
            <li> The pointy tip is great but doesn&#x27;t stand up at all when they get a little wet.</li>
            <li> so I thought these would be better because they are pointy on both ends and they cost less.  </li>
            <li> Well, this particular Q-Tip has a catch: a pointed, \\&quot;precision\\&quot; end.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, I noticed that the back of the box details all the things you can do with the Precision Tip Qtips, but most of them don&#x27;t involve personal care.  </li>
            <li> But they do serve a decent purpose from time to time.</li>
            <li> These things have always been out on the Department Store make-up counters and now we have them at a decent price.  </li>
            <li> I was using a cotton swab (don&#x27;t know the name) with a firm, sharp, pointed tip that worked great for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> In the photo, they appear to be a little more tapered to a point.</li>
            <li> Q-tips Cotton Swabs with precision tip is precise and pointed than the broad design which came earlier.</li>
            <li> It is kind of hard to say a lot about a Q-tip</li>
            <li> This really gets all of my &amp;#34;mistakes&amp;#34; off and it looks like I got a professional manicure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are just like normal Q-Tips, but have pointed tips.</li>
            <li> In addition, I use a heavy degreaser applied to the tip of the precision tip to get kitchen gunk out of the creases of my stove top range and out of the cross-threads of screws.  </li>
            <li> Point is just right for doing a bit of precision makeup work - can dab a bit of extra makeup over a blemish or dark spot for better coverage, use the point for cleanup of mascara on upper lid, smoothing of your eyeliner, use the flat edge to roll under your lower eyelashes to clean up any residue you don&#x27;t want...</li>
            <li> The new design feels tailor-made for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Who would have thought that the age-old Qtip could be new and improved?</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s new and improved.</li>
            <li> that use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might, however, use them to clean up a doll&#x27;s ear after it was dragged through a wet sandbox.</li>
            <li> I also discovered that I can stick these through the tiny hole in my bottle of eye makeup remover but the regular cotton swabs don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> Found better quality with some unknown Chinese brands.  </li>
            <li> Dipped in a little hot water, and they will provide a quick scrub of keyboard letters.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Or to paint a carefully drawn ear on a special birthday cake.</li>
            <li> Also works great for tiny corners and my favorite: around the base of faucets and knobs.</li>
            <li> These Precision Tips Qtips are great for getting into tight and small places.  </li>
            <li> does the job, but is softer, with a less precise pointed tip than what I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li> These work much better than regular Q-Tips for everything other than cleaning inside your ears!  </li>
            <li> I guess they are a little better than regular q-tips if you are looking for pointy ends,</li>
            <li> These are hard to find as they are sold out in most stores already, as soon as they hit the shelf.</li>
            <li> These really work, especially for under eye makeup</li>
            <li> old wife well knows</li>
            <li> Q-Tips are one of those items that nearly everyone has because you can use them for 1,001 things.  </li>
            <li> They require daily cleaning and these get into the folds very well.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these for any makeup type applications, so I really can&#x27;t comment there, and at 170 count in one package, they will probably last me quite a while for my cleaning projects!</li>
            <li> No, That pointy tip is just too pointy to get near eyes.</li>
            <li> , then you&#x27;ll know that our hands are some of the filthiest, germ infested things we could ever touch our faces with, even with frequent washings.  </li>
            <li> The tip is a lot more narrow than regular ones.</li>
            <li> so what little original sharpness they had was gone and</li>
            <li> you need to get into very small spots for cleaning, this is a very handy little swab to have on hand.  </li>
            <li> The precision tip does smush down fairly quickly but that&#x27;s life...</li>
            <li> the plus side, even if the tip is not quite sharp enough, it is relatively easy to trim the tip just a little to make it sharper, which is great for cleaning corners, under keyboard keys, and in other tight places.  </li>
            <li> My main reason for buying them was for cleaning the hearing aid molds from daily use.  </li>
            <li> I found that my ordinary rounded tip qtips was able to do the same thing.</li>
            <li> The tapered heads are both pointier than a regular q-tip and also firmer, so if you&#x27;re poking a hard-to-reach cranny on an electronics board, they won&#x27;t fall apart too easily and leave little cottony residues everywhere.  </li>
            <li> They have the obvious cosmetic advantage where if you need to cover a blemish you can easily apply a product to a very small area with reasonable precision.</li>
            <li> They hold alcohol well and fit in small places.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t mind that they&#x27;re a bit more expensive than the other style because these offer more uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new \\&quot;Precision Tip\\&quot; really does make a difference, when using these Q-Tips for things other than ear cleaning.</li>
            <li> *too* worked up about these new Qtips - after all, these are simply regular QTips with the addition of a tapered \\&quot;precision\\&quot; tip.</li>
            <li> The price was good for so many, but I was a little disappointed in the &amp;#34;precision&amp;#34; tips.</li>
            <li> At least they were cheap enough--I&#x27;ll use them as I would the normal tipped swabs and buy a different brand for detail work.</li>
            <li> The cotton is perhaps a bit more firm than other Q-Tips, which some may or may not like.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even find these at my local grocery stores (and I live in a good-sized college city), but normal Q-Tips are considerably more expensive locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not enough cotton on the swabs, they are quite sharp, and they don&#x27;t get as much \\&quot;grit\\&quot; as normal cotton swabs.</li>
            <li> No matter how hard I try I always get a tiny speck of mascara in the wrong place or a wobble in my eyeliner and a Q-Tip is perfect for touch-up.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t soft enough.</li>
            <li> When you need a harder, pointier cotton swab, QTips cotton swabs are a reasonable choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Brockeim</li>
            <li> Non-Oily Instant Cleanser Sensitive Eyes 125ml/4.2oz]]</li>
            <li> Just remember not to use them with the same amount of force or expect the same level of quantity per swap from these compared to normal sized Q-Tips</li>
            <li> I have long used Q-Tips in various hobbies, particularly for building models, and for cleaning things.  </li>
            <li> These are exactly what I&#x27;ve been needing to fix little oops spots on the side of my nails.  </li>
            <li> When I tried to twist the end on a regular qtip they wouldn&#x27;t twist right, wouldn&#x27;t hold, and came out uneven.  </li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to receive these QTips through Amazon Vine, but I&#x27;ll definitely buy them in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to get</li>
            <li> I stick with the regular quips for other things as they are so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also quite handy for cleaning dust buildup out of electric guitar hardware; few other dusting implements can get into areas so narrow.  </li>
            <li> Good tool and less expensive than those made specifically for makeup.</li>
            <li> They worked well for cleaning around the cuticle area, but were not quite tough enough to clean underneath the nails.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other methods, but these Q-Tips are by far the fastest and easiest method.</li>
            <li> The paper shaft the cotton bud is attached to is the same flat ended cylinder; it&#x27;s just the cotton bud that is formed into a point.</li>
            <li> I use these mixed with a little hot water and shampooto clean the bristles of my expensive paddle comb that can&#x27;t be soaked.  </li>
            <li> Regular q-tips often just clean the bottom of grooves and creases, but because these q-tips have a point and a fatter base they also clean those edges.</li>
            <li> They worked really well for cleaning in small crevices, especially electronics.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are pretty hard and somewhat pointy.</li>
            <li> how to contac hem,amazon should require these shady company&#x27;s to have a return label include in each order,a lot of company&#x27;s do this,they really care about customers getting correct product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After going through a whole package, I do not think that I would switch from my usual QTips to these.</li>
            <li> the tips were mostly flat.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really no end  to the specific uses for both regular Q-tips and Precision Tips.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really no end  to the specific uses for both regular Q-tips and Precision Tips.  </li>
            <li> No matter how hard I try, I&#x27;m kind of sloppy with nail polish application.</li>
            <li> a little eyeliner and mascara helps with the natural look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There isn&#x27;t really anything negative I can say about this product.</li>
            <li> I just apply a small dab of remover with the precision tip and it ends up being a lot cleaner than with the regular old blob of</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what took qtip sooo long to make these.</li>
            <li> Even after having my nails done professionally, I still find I need to do a few touch ups and these Precision Tips</li>
            <li> be careful if you&#x27;re using them as actual ear cleaners; used on the other day, and accidentally went too deep.</li>
            <li> the same quality I get with the other style</li>
            <li> They save you money too by letting you use just the amount of make-up remover needed or cleanser for your equipment.to clean the bristles of my expensive paddle comb that can&#x27;t be soaked.  </li>
            <li> I am sure there are morons out there who will damage their ear because they stick these pointed versions in too far...</li>
            <li> I even carry a few in my evening purse with a tiny little sample sized clear squirt bottle of both the Make-up remover and Nail Polish remover in case I need to do touch-ups or if my eyes water and my eyeliner runs.  </li>
            <li> Of course, you should not use regular Q-Tips in your ears either, and that goes double for these Q-Tips, because they have an end that is pointier than regular Q-Tips and the end is hard.  </li>
            <li> sort-of flat on the other.  </li>
            <li> When I paint with the darker colors its hard get the color exact without getting a little on the edges of my skin.</li>
            <li> On the Q-tips I received, one tip is a little flatter than the other, don&#x27;t know if that is a manufacturing thing or one side got smushed a bit, but I happen to like that as it gives slightly different points to do different jobs on my makeup.  </li>
            <li> Unlike traditional Q-tips, these have a tapered, conical end that feels a little sturdier (and less \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot;) than traditional Q-tips.  </li>
            <li> No, these left little bits of cotton in my nail polish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> purchase includes three boxes of 170 swabs, made of 100% cotton, and with white flexible sticks as opposed to those hard blue plastic</li>
            <li> turns out i actually prefer the round tips over the precision tips</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t what I expected, though.  </li>
            <li> and I use Qtips from time to time and these seem safer for me as I reach into distant crevases.  </li>
            <li> See, I had trouble even thinking of the generic name for a moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just be careful when using them, they can be a tad</li>
            <li> If the tip gets too wet, it can lose its point.</li>
            <li> My Dior and Lancome reps have been slipping me a some with every purchase and now I don&#x27;t have to beg them for hand-outs.  </li>
            <li> Such a waste.</li>
            <li> The precision tip helps get up close to the nail and remove unwanted polish from the skin or other areas that need precision.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They&#x27;re aso a big help in cleaning gunk out of small areas, like computer keyboards, around the sink, and on car</li>
            <li> You may dispose of these swabs in your recycle bin with other paper products and you may even compost them - unless you painted with them, or used them with solvents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These are hardly &#x27;sharp&#x27; when compared to other products like Fran Wilson Nail Tees or Eye Tees.</li>
            <li> And, given the price, I&#x27;m not sure I will be using them over regular ones.</li>
            <li> One other use</li>
            <li> careful if using this item to clean your ears as the precision point can slide into your ear canal and be quite painful.</li>
            <li> These Q-Tips have less cotton and they end in sharp points.</li>
            <li> The point is too big and and I have to push really hard, with nail polish remover on it, to get anything to happen.</li>
            <li> I mean how could a person go wrong with a tried and true product like this?  </li>
            <li> You just have to kill the bacteria down in the pore with heat.  </li>
            <li> Where other brands have a shaft that bends, this one stays firm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still if you need to reach somewhere difficult these do add some precision for a few moments if you&#x27;re gentle.</li>
            <li> I pour steaming but not boiling water over one, soaking it and hold it to the red area to \\&quot;cook\\&quot; the bacteria the same way those expensive Zit-Zappers do.  </li>
            <li> They are workable, but it seemed these had been smushed down a little.</li>
            <li> Because of the image on the package, which shows a q-tip with cotton so tightly wound that the tip is at a point, I thought this product would be a less costly alternative to Nail Tees (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00015GWQU/ref&#x3D;as_li_ss_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B00015GWQU&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;adre04-20).  </li>
            <li> Whether you&#x27;re cleaning up in a tight space (like a crevice or between keys on a keyboard) or applying glues, paints, etc...</li>
            <li> so I down&#x27;t waste half a bottle of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t get any little cotton fibers in your eye accidentally.  </li>
            <li> I wear little makeup.</li>
            <li> little vents&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Of course, I used a little bleach or isopropyl alcohol.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if any other companies make the precision tip swabs,</li>

            <li> I wish the tips were a little stiffer.</li>
            <li> They narrow tips allow easier access to facilitate cleaning in tight places.</li>
            <li> ;&#x27;s a godd price for a trusted product that can save you a lot of headaches down the road once you get used to using them for hygenic reasons and also to keep your electronics and appliances sparkling!  </li>

            <li> The round ones tend to push the germ into the ear rather than cleaning it.</li>
            <li> To add insult to injury, these are packaged horizontally in a package that is slightly too small, so all the tips come out flattened.</li>
            <li> tried using these to clean some small recesses with the tip dipped in paint remover, and was mildly disappointed that the cotton tip lost its point.  </li>
            <li> These are NOT true precision swabs!</li>
            <li> You can apply either plain water or specialized cleaners, get into the small areas and not worry about wasting expensive cleansers for your stereo equipment  and such.  </li>

            <li> They work well for things like removing a mascara spot or cleaning up nail polish mistakes, but the &amp;#34;precision tip&amp;#34; makes cleaning one&#x27;s ears a little uncomfortable as it&#x27;s difficult to get to the edges without getting deeper than is advisable.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love these for use in home manicures and polishing my own nails.  My hand is never as steady as the girls&#x27; in the salon, but with these Q-Tips, I can clean up any mistakes.  They are also much cheaper than purchasing the ones from beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> I was using a cotton swab (don&#x27;t know the name) with a firm, sharp, pointed tip that worked great for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;This does the job, but is softer, with a less precise pointed tip than what I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li> This item is actually three packs which each have 170 precision tip cotton swabs - 510 total - which means this is a great price! I can&#x27;t even find these at my local grocery stores (and I live in a good-sized college city), but normal Q-Tips are considerably more expensive locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are just like normal Q-Tips, but have pointed tips. They&#x27;re not as firm as something like a marker would be, but they are noticeably pointy which makes them great for detail work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got these to do at home french manicures. They are very precise and easy to use for making clean lines (I paint on a color for the tips, and then use the precision Q-Tips dipped in nail polish remover to create a clean line). I&#x27;ve tried several other methods, but these Q-Tips are by far the fastest and easiest method.</li>
            <li> I received a sample pack of these recently and I absolutely love them for correcting eye makeup mishaps.  Just dip one in eye makeup remover and the precision pointed tip takes care of smears without messing up the rest of your makeup; you can be very precise with them.  I also discovered that I can stick these through the tiny hole in my bottle of eye makeup remover but the regular cotton swabs don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> turns out i actually prefer the round tips over the precision tips but they do the job</li>
            <li> These are OK.  They aren&#x27;t what I expected, though.  I shop at the grocery store, HEB, where they have a store brand of q-tip that is pointy on one end and sort-of flat on the other.  I have been using them and love their pointy end so I thought these would be better because they are pointy on both ends and they cost less.  Unfortunately they are not as pointy or as stiff as what I was using.  The tip is so soft the point softens into shapelessness very quickly.  I guess they are a little better than regular q-tips if you are looking for pointy ends, but not enough better that I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Product what I needed for advice makeup consultant</li>
            <li> Great to have a flatter tip for detail work.</li>
            <li> I purchased these Precision Tip Q-Tip Cotton Swabs to use with my Konad Nail Art. This product works perfect for cleaning up polished nails and/or in my case to perfect my Konad nail art nails. The precision tip helps get up close to the nail and remove unwanted polish from the skin or other areas that need precision. This product was of good quality and as described. The only downfall would be the price is a bit steep for cotton swabs, however the price I found on Amazon was better than any local store where I was able to find these precision cotton swabs.</li>
            <li> Nothing works as well as these precision qtips for getting all the extra nail polish off the edges of your nails without mussing your actual nail. Also works great for tiny corners and my favorite: around the base of faucets and knobs. Works great, plenty of cotton on each end to do the job, but does not come apart.</li>
            <li> These Q-Tips are perfect for removing excess amounts of mascara.  They are also good for refining eyebrow pencil applications or perfecting lip lines. If you&#x27;re traveling and forgot your eyes hadow brushes, these will make a good substitute.  Another use for them is to apply minute amounts of cream medications in precisely the right spot.  I like the fact that, the tips stay pointed and the fibers don&#x27;t spread out.  I&#x27;ve even used the Precision Tips dipped into nail polish remover for manicures; removing any polish that is on the skin and not on the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need to get into very small spots for cleaning, this is a very handy little swab to have on hand.  It helps with cleaning crevices when polishing and getting the hard-to-reach areas under the handles of a pot.</li>
            <li> Not what I was hoping for. I&#x27;d never seen these before and guessed that they&#x27;d have less cotton on them, to be ideal for cleaning my APV tank and coil replacement heads/drip tips (I&#x27;m a vaper) but they&#x27;re not. They seem to be great for makeup or manicures, so I gave them to my sister. I will stick to the skinny cotton swabs you can get at dollar stores, for that purpose...they have less cotton and fit into my tanks and accessories better.</li>
            <li> Great for makeup correction but hurt your ears if you use it to clean up your ears.</li>
            <li> I looked all over locally to find these and found nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased! I use the precision tip for applying eye shadow, and can then just toss it out, also used to blend eye liner to soften the line (I use gel liner)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also used to cleaning up my nails with alcohol prior to painting, and cleaning up polish around nail after painting (dipped in remover)</li>
            <li> QTips brand is a great product however if you are looking for precision tip this is not what I would recommend. I decided to try this product because of the price in relation to the amount of product. I can still use them but not for what it was intended.</li>
            <li> I use these precision Q-Tips to wipe off the nail polish on the sides of nails. Just dip it in acetone and wipe. These Q-Tips are of really good use for make-up too. Product arrived really fast. Thank you .</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to receive these QTips through Amazon Vine, but I&#x27;ll definitely buy them in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to get *too* worked up about these new Qtips - after all, these are simply regular QTips with the addition of a tapered \\&quot;precision\\&quot; tip. However, I do find them much more useful than regular QTips for makeup and nail polish application.  No matter how hard I try, I&#x27;m kind of sloppy with nail polish application. These precision tip QTips allow me to \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; around my nails without smudging the polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> The QTips Cotton Swabs, Precision Tip is a nice variation on the known and trusted original. Where other brands have a shaft that bends, this one stays firm. The precision tip is excellent for many functions where you need a little finer point, from cleaning hard-to-get-to nooks and crannies on devices to applying color to small items. The cotton swap on the tip also holds its shape well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful if using this item to clean your ears as the precision point can slide into your ear canal and be quite painful. Yes, there are warning labels about sticking things in your ears but what do most people use QTips for, anyway?</li>
            <li> With the brand name, I bought the 3 pack.  I really liked the quality of the regular Q-tips you find at the store.  But the quality of these precision tips was not there.  Found better quality with some unknown Chinese brands.  I bought these initially for some mechanical work and for a relative with medical issues since they wanted a brand name.  For mechanical uses the threads break apart when in contact with liquid.  I would buy another brand unless you&#x27;re set on a name brand.</li>
            <li> These work wonderfully as eyeshadow/eyeliners blenders (especially underneath eyes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also to clean crevices, and to neaten the cuticle area (when applying toenail/fingernail polish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very difficult to find locally.</li>
            <li> These Precision Tips Qtips are great for getting into tight and small places.  I shopped many places in my area and no one carried these.  My main reason for buying them was for cleaning the hearing aid molds from daily use.  When I tried to twist the end on a regular qtip they wouldn&#x27;t twist right, wouldn&#x27;t hold, and came out uneven.  These are already set to use and they work great.  I am sure I will find other great uses for them too.</li>
            <li> Sucks sucks sucks and the cotton tips fray so easily.  Precision my buttocks!  Fran Wilson or nothing!</li>
            <li> These really work, especially for under eye makeup so you don&#x27;t get any little cotton fibers in your eye accidentally.  I stick with the regular quips for other things as they are so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> These Q tips cotton swabs with the &amp;#34;precision&amp;#34; tip are wonderful. I wasn&#x27;t sure i it would make a difference or not, but it did.</li>
            <li> This is three packs of 170 each so you get a ton.  Great for using with makeup or nail polish</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these on myself but I use them everyday on my Exotic Shorthair (shorthaired persian) to clean around her eyes. I just use warm water and wipe gently and it keeps her clean and pretty :)</li>
            <li> Love these Precision Tips.  Great for make-up application and touch ups when I make a mistake.</li>
            <li> Bad. All point are broken very poor quality</li>
            <li> Great for odd jobs such as gun cleaning etc.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like any off-brand swabs, so i always end up coming back to q-tip, and it&#x27;s perfect that you can buy them on here.</li>
            <li> You want precision? Buy Nail Tees.  These Q-Tip brand ones aren&#x27;t anywhere pointy enough to claim &amp;#34;precision&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great value, comes with 3 packs of 170 swaps each!  Perfect for cleaning up manicures!</li>
            <li> I wear little makeup. I just do not like the results but a little eyeliner and mascara helps with the natural look. I can make corrections with the precision tip without having to start over. Also the tip is good for my glass art cleanup and corrections. Good tool and less expensive than those made specifically for makeup.</li>
            <li> What a great invention.</li>
            <li> Now it is a good product, but to be very honest I found that my ordinary rounded tip qtips was able to do the same thing. I guess it is a matter of preference</li>
            <li> I use it to wipe of anesthesia on the eylid &amp; it is very precise. Great little tool!</li>
            <li> The reason I gave product only 1 star I I dered precision not regular swabs,waste of money,the crooks never inserted sales slip with information last me how to contac hem,amazon should require these shady company&#x27;s to have a return label include in each order,a lot of company&#x27;s do this,they really care about customers getting correct product.</li>
            <li> This are just like regular q-tips, but with a pointed tip on both ends. I love these for eye make up and car detailing. Great price with amazon prime.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what took qtip sooo long to make these. I really like them but would like them better if they had one side paddle for eye shadow application and pointed tip for eye liner and everything else. These are hard to find as they are sold out in most stores already, as soon as they hit the shelf.</li>
            <li> too hard, hurts my ear</li>
            <li> JOY JOY to find in multi-pack since I use so many of these for my nails and other purposes. The precision tip does smush down fairly quickly but that&#x27;s life... just use another one, and still better than classic-type cotton buds.</li>
            <li> Q-tips are Q-tips, right? Well, this particular Q-Tip has a catch: a pointed, \\&quot;precision\\&quot; end. Frankly, I think these can be useful in  a variety of ways, including cleaning electronics (between the keys on a keyboard!), jewelery, or virtually any other item which has small crevices. And while there are various \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; uses listed on the box, cleaning your ears is noticeably absent. However, they seem to do a good enough job at that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t really anything negative I can say about this product. The cotton is perhaps a bit more firm than other Q-Tips, which some may or may not like. But these work, and I&#x27;m continuing to use them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of Q-tips for years, and use daily for a number of reasons.  Thought these would be better than the old standard Q-tips - and they are for a number of purposes.  Correcting manicure/pedicure &amp;#34;oops&amp;#34;, fixing the eyeliner that goes astray, and things like that which require &amp;#34;precision&amp;#34; fixes.  The tip is pointed, and fairly strong for spun cotton.  However, because of this, when it comes to cleaning ears....you still need (or I do anyway) the standard old-fashioned Q-tips.  But, this is a good addition to the bathroom &amp;#34;stuff.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I like the shape of these.  Point is just right for doing a bit of precision makeup work - can dab a bit of extra makeup over a blemish or dark spot for better coverage, use the point for cleanup of mascara on upper lid, smoothing of your eyeliner, use the flat edge to roll under your lower eyelashes to clean up any residue you don&#x27;t want...I&#x27;m sure you can come up with your own uses.  On the Q-tips I received, one tip is a little flatter than the other, don&#x27;t know if that is a manufacturing thing or one side got smushed a bit, but I happen to like that as it gives slightly different points to do different jobs on my makeup.  With regular Q-tips, I would pull off some of the cotton ends to make them thinner and then use them under my lower eyelashes, but these work better.  Do not poke these in your ear, as the shape is narrower than the regular kind and you could do some damage.</li>
            <li> The price was good for so many, but I was a little disappointed in the &amp;#34;precision&amp;#34; tips. In the photo, they appear to be a little more tapered to a point. They are workable, but it seemed these had been smushed down a little.</li>
            <li> A cotton swab with pointy ends&lt;br /&gt;Is such a useful tool&lt;br /&gt;For make-up, nails and touching up&lt;br /&gt;Those art projects for school&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For cleaning grooves and little vents&lt;br /&gt;For clearing holes in drains&lt;br /&gt;Applying salve to paper cuts&lt;br /&gt;And taking out small stains&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not made for your inner ear, as&lt;br /&gt;Any old wife well knows&lt;br /&gt;The only things allowed in there&lt;br /&gt;Are one&#x27;s own pointy elbows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This purchase includes three boxes of 170 swabs, made of 100% cotton, and with white flexible sticks as opposed to those hard blue plastic ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amanda Richards, December 30, 2012</li>
            <li> I bought these specifically for cleaning up around the edges when I do my nails. They&#x27;re great for that purpose!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using these tapered tip q-tips for a while now. they reach areas a regular q-tip can&#x27;t. perfect for gun cleaning and applying clp products right where you want it.</li>
            <li> Q-Tips are finally available in a precision-tip design, and I love it. This is perfect for make-up. No matter how hard I try I always get a tiny speck of mascara in the wrong place or a wobble in my eyeliner and a Q-Tip is perfect for touch-up. The new design feels tailor-made for that purpose. I have been remodeling my Q-tips for years by pulling off about a third of the cotton, wetting the tip and molding it into a point. Now I can buy them this way which is a much nicer alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also put them to use cleaning difficult to reach places, but the old design did that satisfactorily. I use these primarily for make-up.</li>
            <li> These are great for makeup application and for cleaning in tight spots.  The harder, pointed tip make them a poor choice for ear cleaning.  I use them for cleaning up smudged makeup, putting on eye shadow when the crappy applicator that comes with it fails, and cleaning keyboards, crevices in the kitchen, etc.  Good to have both these and normal Q-tips on hand.</li>
            <li> The new pointy style tips on these Qtips come in very handy.  I especially like it for removing makeup smears underneath my bottom lids, and it great for applying shadow as eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re aso a big help in cleaning gunk out of small areas, like computer keyboards, around the sink, and on car dashboards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember NOT to put these in your ears!!</li>
            <li> Love these Q-tips with a tapered edge for getting to the harder to reach stuff.  I use them for cleaning my ears, my computer keyboard, and around my bathroom sink.  They are also good as a tool for blending eye shadow.</li>
            <li> These are awesome, new Qtips, but won&#x27;t replace the normal round-tip I&#x27;ve been using my whole life. Keep them around for special needs when I need a good, pointy tip...</li>
            <li> I got these expecting to be able to clean (gently) the insides of my ears, but the cotton is rather hard, so it didn&#x27;t really do that job too well.  Afterwards, I noticed that the back of the box details all the things you can do with the Precision Tip Qtips, but most of them don&#x27;t involve personal care.  While a woman might find these useful for make-up removal and/or application, I found them best suited for cleaning dirty groves and 90-degree joints (like where window glass meets wood or sealant).  Of course, I used a little bleach or isopropyl alcohol.  So, for me, they&#x27;re good for home maintenance.  But I&#x27;ll stick with the original Qtips for applicable manly grooming needs.</li>
            <li> My wife uses a lot of Qtips and she says that the Precision Tips are a big improvement.  They are better in cleaning because of the added tip.  They also seem to be a safer Qtip with the added tip.  I&#x27;ve had ear surgery and I use Qtips from time to time and these seem safer for me as I reach into distant crevases.  Who would have thought that the age-old Qtip could be new and improved?</li>
            <li> The tips on this product are only semi-sharp at best and when they arrived the sides of every package had been squashed just enough so what little original sharpness they had was gone and the tips were mostly flat.  The Amazon packing was fine so I believe they were damaged before that.  At least they were cheap enough--I&#x27;ll use them as I would the normal tipped swabs and buy a different brand for detail work.</li>
            <li> These have a smaller, tapered tip. As such, they are quite well suited to a variety of detailed cleaning tasks. Also great for cleaning out your ears, in all the troublesome corners n&#x27; stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tapered tips &#x27;shed&#x27; less than normal QTips, and are more firm.</li>
            <li> These work much better than regular Q-Tips for everything other than cleaning inside your ears!  I use them during makeup application for adjusting makeup, fixing smudges, and drying watery, allergy eyes before applying eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I use these for getting into tiny cracks and spaces where regular q-tips will not reach...also these are cheaper on amazon rather then getting them at your local stores...</li>
            <li> The tips are quite big to clean the cuticle area.</li>
            <li> I use Q Tips to clean my ear channels and this is a perfect shape for it. The round ones tend to push the germ into the ear rather than cleaning it. This one does a great job in reaching the inner channel without pushing anything there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put some of these in my guest room and all my guests loved it and ordered for themselves. I just ordered my second pack of 3.</li>
            <li> Seriously. These are terrific for the fine-touch things I do with QTips. For example, I can outline my eyebrows with detail. And I can get into the smallest grooves of my computer keyboard. And I can use it for makeup application in a pinch. I am only truly surprised it took them this long to realize how useful a more finely pointed QTip would be.</li>
            <li> QTips are the kind of product you really don&#x27;t think about very much. They&#x27;re there, and you use them. Their name has become synonymous with cotton swabs, same as Kleenex is for tissues and Band Aids are for, well, for Band Aids. Oh, I mean bandages. See, I had trouble even thinking of the generic name for a moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There IS a difference in quality between QTips and cheaper brands. The cotton is thicker and it stays on better, same as Band Aids seem to be made better as well and the adhesive works longer. But still, a QTip is a QTip.  That is, until finally someone had the bright idea to expand its uses and make a version that had a more pointed, narrow tip. Not an earth-shattering change but it&#x27;s a great and useful idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pointed tip makes it useful for more precise cleaning, or cleaning or doing other things requiring a swab in a confined area that requires something smaller than a regular QTip. Sure, as some reviewers pointed out, the end doesn&#x27;t stay pointed because the more you use it, the more rounded it gets but what do you expect? It&#x27;s made out of cotton. Honestly, I think this is a very useful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one thing - I am sure there are morons out there who will damage their ear because they stick these pointed versions in too far... despite the warnings QTips gives about NOT using these for your ear. The benefits outweigh the potential drawbacks, though. It&#x27;s good that QTips released these before our increasingly meddlesome government could block this product from being sold.</li>
            <li> What you see is basically what you get with the Precision QTip. This QTip is essentially the same as a regular QTip, but with pointed ends. Personally, I love having these around the house for special projects, or just getting into those harder to reach spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful when using them, they can be a tad sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going through a whole package, I do not think that I would switch from my usual QTips to these. But they do serve a decent purpose from time to time.</li>
            <li> QTips are used for all sorts of things, from putting on makeup to cleaning small items. The difference with these Precision Q-Tips is that the ends have more of a point to them. This is a pretty neat idea because they allow you to get into many more small, tight spots with better precision, hence the name. My wife uses them for makeup. I&#x27;ve used these for cleaning small, hard to get areas on my harmonica, my electric razor, my computer keyboard and, while detailing the interior of my car. They work great! Give them a try and compare.</li>
            <li> Whether you&#x27;re cleaning up in a tight space (like a crevice or between keys on a keyboard) or applying glues, paints, etc... in precise manner, these Q-tips are great. Unlike traditional Q-tips, these have a tapered, conical end that feels a little sturdier (and less \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot;) than traditional Q-tips.  I recommend them!</li>
            <li> Q-Tips are one of those items that nearly everyone has because you can use them for 1,001 things.  I have long used Q-Tips in various hobbies, particularly for building models, and for cleaning things.  One of the drawbacks to standard Q-Tips is that the tip is blunt.  My solution has been to pull the tip to elongate it, a process fraught with errors and waste, or cutting the tip with scissors or a hobby knife.  None of these procedures is routinely successful.  Apparently, many people have tried the same thing I have, and Q-Tip decided to offer a version that already has a tip that has somewhat of a point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, even if the tip is not quite sharp enough, it is relatively easy to trim the tip just a little to make it sharper, which is great for cleaning corners, under keyboard keys, and in other tight places.  The sharper tip can also make a fine, disposable paintbrush.  About the only place you should not use this Q-Tip is in your ears.  Of course, you should not use regular Q-Tips in your ears either, and that goes double for these Q-Tips, because they have an end that is pointier than regular Q-Tips and the end is hard.  Do not put these in your ears!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to their utility for cleaning, hobbies, and makeup, these Q-Tips are made from renewable resources.  You may dispose of these swabs in your recycle bin with other paper products and you may even compost them - unless you painted with them, or used them with solvents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have trimmed far too many Q-Tips over the decades for a variety of purposes.  I am happy to have Q-Tip swabs that already have somewhat of a point.  I have already used them and plan to use them often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I was all prepared to right an okay, so what&#x27;s the big deal review, until my wife discovered these and was immediatly thrilled with how well they work in dealing with certain make-up issues.  It just goes to show, that you have to have the appropriate \\&quot;need\\&quot; sometimes in order to experience the true benefit of a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using these to clean some small recesses with the tip dipped in paint remover, and was mildly disappointed that the cotton tip lost its point.  However, using them in a more dry (precision) situation is far more effective.</li>
            <li> They work well for things like removing a mascara spot or cleaning up nail polish mistakes, but the &amp;#34;precision tip&amp;#34; makes cleaning one&#x27;s ears a little uncomfortable as it&#x27;s difficult to get to the edges without getting deeper than is advisable.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with these...they just don&#x27;t work for what I bought them for. I got them to clean up the trem when I paint my nails. The point is too big and and I have to push really hard, with nail polish remover on it, to get anything to happen.</li>
            <li> Love these great for cleaning and makeup. The pointy tip is great but doesn&#x27;t stand up at all when they get a little wet.</li>
            <li> These are NOT true precision swabs! The real ones are manufactured to clean electronics, and are firmer, much more pointed, and they hold the tip shape better. That is what I thought I was buying. The best I can say is that these are slightly better than regular Q-tips, but a long way from real precision swabs. To add insult to injury, these are packaged horizontally in a package that is slightly too small, so all the tips come out flattened. GRRRR!</li>
            <li> Great find! These precision tips are not only wonderful for make up removal, but my husband and I use them in our lawnmower shop and art studio. The pointy tip is far better than the regular cotton swab. Extremely useful item, arrived quickly in great condition, bargain price compared to local stores.</li>
            <li> The precision tips allow better control for application of decals and cleaning overspray from my airbrushes.  A great addition to my arsenal.</li>
            <li> For use with make-up there&#x27;s nothing better.  Nice, pointy tips for precision.  Many other uses, too.  Easily one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;precision&amp;#34; tips make a difference.  They help removing polish from corners of nails; mascara that smears, eyeliner that is too thick...lots of great uses.</li>
            <li> I like the precision tip Q-Tips and have found numerous uses for them around the house.</li>
            <li> Qtips are a quality product and these precision tips are wonderful.  Careful not to use on my ears, I used them to touch up paint projects (worked great).  My wife used them with her make-up applications and she liked them.  Since I have always been a fan of Qtips, these precision tips ones will be very useful.</li>
            <li> These are hardly &#x27;sharp&#x27; when compared to other products like Fran Wilson Nail Tees or Eye Tees. The tips are blunt and unravel immediately and aren&#x27;t much better than a regular Q-Tip. I wasn&#x27;t impressed. If you&#x27;re looking for a cheaper alternative to Nail Tees, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I use these to clean my Sphynx cat&#x27;s ears.  They require daily cleaning and these get into the folds very well.  Not sure if any other companies make the precision tip swabs, but I think these are a perfect solution for the task I use them for.</li>
            <li> These precision tip swabs work great for so many things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these q-tips for cleaning--mostly musical equipment.  The tapered heads are both pointier than a regular q-tip and also firmer, so if you&#x27;re poking a hard-to-reach cranny on an electronics board, they won&#x27;t fall apart too easily and leave little cottony residues everywhere.  They&#x27;re also quite handy for cleaning dust buildup out of electric guitar hardware; few other dusting implements can get into areas so narrow.  I haven&#x27;t used these for any makeup type applications, so I really can&#x27;t comment there, and at 170 count in one package, they will probably last me quite a while for my cleaning projects!</li>
            <li> The fine-tipped Q-tips are great for hobbies and crafts, but not so great for ear cleaning. I realize many people, including myself, have found many other uses for these cotton swabs other than cleaning out the Dumbo muscles, so the company decided to create these swabs for better precision. They&#x27;re a bit softer than I&#x27;d like, but certain able to get at finer areas than the regular ones.&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful if you&#x27;re using them as actual ear cleaners; used on the other day, and accidentally went too deep. It hurt quite a bit!</li>
            <li> These q-tips have a more defined shape than your average teardrop shaped q-tips. I find they particularly good for cleaning around the edges of your ear. Regular q-tips often just clean the bottom of grooves and creases, but because these q-tips have a point and a fatter base they also clean those edges. Overall, I definitely prefer these to regular q-tips.</li>
            <li> Because of the image on the package, which shows a q-tip with cotton so tightly wound that the tip is at a point, I thought this product would be a less costly alternative to Nail Tees (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00015GWQU/ref&#x3D;as_li_ss_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B00015GWQU&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;adre04-20).  Well the sharpness of the cotton wound around the q-tip on the image is not at all reflected in the q-tips that actually come in the package.  The q-tips in the package are blunt and do not imitate Nail Tees AT ALL.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Q-tips Cotton Swabs with precision tip is precise and pointed than the broad design which came earlier. It can help you feel the point where it cleans your inner ear making cleaning easier than before and it is comfortable and strong.</li>
            <li> These Q-Tips have less cotton and they end in sharp points. The ends are firmer then regular Q-Tips but the sticks are a little flimsier. So, what are they good for?&lt;br /&gt;- Ears?&lt;br /&gt;  No, after stabbing my ears a couple times, I decided regular Q-Tips work better&lt;br /&gt;- Eye Make-Up?&lt;br /&gt;  No, That pointy tip is just too pointy to get near eyes. Regular Q-Tips work better for this too.&lt;br /&gt;- Nail Polish?&lt;br /&gt;  No, these left little bits of cotton in my nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning Nails?&lt;br /&gt;  Maybe. They worked well for cleaning around the cuticle area, but were not quite tough enough to clean underneath the nails.&lt;br /&gt;- Arts and Crafts/Hobbies?&lt;br /&gt;  Probably. These worked well for painting some things, especially where it didn&#x27;t matter if there was a bit of cotton in the paint. They worked really well for cleaning in small crevices, especially electronics. They hold alcohol well and fit in small places.</li>
            <li> I run out of cotton swabs and so I went to AMAZON to purchased one and also to used my discount coupon for this item as well. It&#x27;s all good nothing much to say with this product. It&#x27;s all good. I am a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I mean how could a person go wrong with a tried and true product like this?  Never a disappointment, ever!</li>
            <li> The new \\&quot;Precision Tip\\&quot; really does make a difference, when using these Q-Tips for things other than ear cleaning. I&#x27;ve used them to gently remove something stuck in my gums, to apply some touch-up paint to a difficult-to-reach area, and to clean the very edges of a LCD screen. They&#x27;re multipurpose, and really useful!</li>
            <li> Life is about crevices. Not all life. Maybe just \\&quot;cotton swab life.\\&quot; These QTips cotton swabs reach into tiny crevices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, you won&#x27;t use them to tidy up your ears. They aren&#x27;t soft enough. Too pointy. They aren&#x27;t intended for that use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might, however, use them to clean up a doll&#x27;s ear after it was dragged through a wet sandbox. Or to paint a carefully drawn ear on a special birthday cake. These swabs are great for that. A dab of food coloring and you are good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also a good for cleaning that corner on a laptop monitor where the plastic meets the screen. Don&#x27;t press hard and go in short strokes for best results. Dipped in a little hot water, and they will provide a quick scrub of keyboard letters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get the idea. When you need a harder, pointier cotton swab, QTips cotton swabs are a reasonable choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Brockeim</li>
            <li> I love the tapered edge of the precision tip Q-Tips because they can be used for almost anything. Not only can they still clean your ears but they&#x27;re also good for applying make-up around the eyes and even lip gloss. However, my personal favorite use is to get nail polish off of my fingers. When I paint with the darker colors its hard get the color exact without getting a little on the edges of my skin. I just apply a small dab of remover with the precision tip and it ends up being a lot cleaner than with the regular old blob of a tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the same quality I get with the other style but it&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s new and improved. I actually don&#x27;t mind that they&#x27;re a bit more expensive than the other style because these offer more uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep comparing them to the regular Q-Tips but I like that these are more stiff than the original. I&#x27;m very pleased with this new product!</li>
            <li> These Q Tips are essentially like the regular ones but with a pointed end. The paper shaft the cotton bud is attached to is the same flat ended cylinder; it&#x27;s just the cotton bud that is formed into a point. They&#x27;re great for reaching hard-to-reach places but since the cotton bud is soft it soon deforms and, like regular ones, with continual probing starts to come unfurled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still if you need to reach somewhere difficult these do add some precision for a few moments if you&#x27;re gentle. And, given the price, I&#x27;m not sure I will be using them over regular ones.</li>
            <li> Effective, practical, for hygiene, medical,  beauty, and cosmetology applications</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was going to think about these when they came. The tip is a lot more narrow than regular ones. Since I&#x27;ve had them though, I&#x27;ve realized that not only are they good for cleaning your ears (the precision tip really just doesn&#x27;t waste cotton), but they do a really good job of getting into nicks and crannies and crevices around the house.</li>
            <li> I wish the tips were a little stiffer. I use these to clean bits and pieces and they are better than standard Q-Tips. Just wish they were stiffer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these. I do my own nails, and always get polish on my skin. This really gets all of my &amp;#34;mistakes&amp;#34; off and it looks like I got a professional manicure.</li>
            <li> The tip is great for applying make-up or cleaning up eyeliner smudges or mistakes.  If the tip gets too wet, it can lose its point.</li>
            <li> This is another product I love! From putting on your eye make up, to cleaning the track in sliding glass doors, or outside corners of wood funiture&lt;br /&gt;these simply are the best. I found these by accident, and now I won&#x27;t be without them!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I cared for these. There&#x27;s not enough cotton on the swabs, they are quite sharp, and they don&#x27;t get as much \\&quot;grit\\&quot; as normal cotton swabs. On the other hand they DO fit into smaller cracks and crevices pretty nicely, but that&#x27;s counterbalanced by the aforementioned sharpness. The price is pretty good for a three pack as it gives out slightly over five hundred Q-tips. That should last you for some time. Just remember not to use them with the same amount of force or expect the same level of quantity per swap from these compared to normal sized Q-Tips and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> While I wouldn&#x27;t use these for every job I use a Q-tip for, I must say, these Precision Tip Q-tips are a much better item to have on hand for detailed cleaning of keyboards, appliances, electronics and other machinery.  You can apply either plain water or specialized cleaners, get into the small areas and not worry about wasting expensive cleansers for your stereo equipment  and such.  I also use them to get lime scale out of the threading on plumbing pipes and the shower head so I down&#x27;t waste half a bottle of [[ASIN:B000SKX0N6 Jelmar CL-4 CLR Enhanced Calcium, Lime And Rust Remover]]!  In addition, I use a heavy degreaser applied to the tip of the precision tip to get kitchen gunk out of the creases of my stove top range and out of the cross-threads of screws.  I HATE having grease anywhere on my stove or oven because that stuff attracts bugs.  Even the slightest remnants of food particles of grease can be a problem out here in LA where we have all kinds of bugs to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for using these to apply cosmetics or clean up your manicure, they&#x27;re just exactly what you need.  If you&#x27;ve seen the film [[ASIN:B0069UP2PI Contagion (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)]], then you&#x27;ll know that our hands are some of the filthiest, germ infested things we could ever touch our faces with, even with frequent washings.  Keeping that in mind, women often re-infect themselves with bacterial-based breakouts and eye infections by using their fingers to apply foundation, eye shadow and to smudge eyeliner.  Well quit it!  Pour a few drop of foundation onto a clean ceramic dish, mix in your moisturizer and then dot it onto your face with one of this and blend with a CLEAN disposable or washable make-up sponge.  Only let the Q-tip touch your eye shadows.  I don&#x27;t use brushes around my eyes unless they can be sanitzed after each use.  I even rinse my Mascara brushes out after every use since you shouldn&#x27;t keep mascara longer than 3 months.  I use the Precision Tip Q-Tips dipped in my [[ASIN:B000RO83AS Lancome BI-FACIL Non-Oily Instant Cleanser Sensitive Eyes 125ml/4.2oz]] and that way I can easily touch up any stray flake or flecks of mascara without ruining my entire face.  I even carry a few in my evening purse with a tiny little sample sized clear squirt bottle of both the Make-up remover and Nail Polish remover in case I need to do touch-ups or if my eyes water and my eyeliner runs.  Nobody likes to look like a Racoon at a club around 11PM!  These things have always been out on the Department Store make-up counters and now we have them at a decent price.  Even after having my nails done professionally, I still find I need to do a few touch ups and these Precision Tips work better then the way manicurists wrap cotton on a wooden cuticle stick! Much more accurate and.. PRECISE!  I even use these to apply a thin line of chapstick to my outer lip line to prevent my darker lispticks from feathering if I can find my [[ASIN:B000Z605J0 DuWop Reverse Lipliner Reverse Lipliner, Colorless 1 ea]]!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To put it simply, I love these!  My Dior and Lancome reps have been slipping me a some with every purchase and now I don&#x27;t have to beg them for hand-outs.  I uses these to clean-up the edges of all my  facial product containers or squeeze tubes after each use so my fingers don&#x27;t touch the opening and contaminate them as well as for theusual make-up applications.  One other great thing to use these for is a home -heat treatment for the occasional breakout.  I pour steaming but not boiling water over one, soaking it and hold it to the red area to \\&quot;cook\\&quot; the bacteria the same way those expensive Zit-Zappers do.  Every time I&#x27;ve used this method on me or my husband (the original Daverat), we find the Zit never comes to a head.  You just have to kill the bacteria down in the pore with heat.  This type of Q-tip is great for that.  Use each end once and then toss.  One other use and I&#x27;ll shut up.  I use these mixed with a little hot water and shampooto clean the bristles of my expensive paddle comb that can&#x27;t be soaked.  There&#x27;s really no end  to the specific uses for both regular Q-tips and Precision Tips.  It;&#x27;s a godd price for a trusted product that can save you a lot of headaches down the road once you get used to using them for hygenic reasons and also to keep your electronics and appliances sparkling!  They save you money too by letting you use just the amount of make-up remover needed or cleanser for your equipment.to clean the bristles of my expensive paddle comb that can&#x27;t be soaked.

            <li> It is kind of hard to say a lot about a Q-tip but I must say that I did find these Precision Tip Q-tips quite useful. They have the obvious cosmetic advantage where if you need to cover a blemish you can easily apply a product to a very small area with reasonable precision. If you are into art as am I, you will find these q-tips very handy in applying paints in special ways. A brush is useful but sometimes these Q-tips proved to be just the right thing. That also applies to working with blemishes. Depending on the price at which you obtain them, I think you will find them a worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I&#x27;ve been needing to fix little oops spots on the side of my nails.  They handle easily and are very effective.  Keep a capfull of polish remover next to you, dip and then dab onto a kleenex to remove extra liquid.  The cotton effectively removes the spots of polish on the sides of my cuticle or finger.  This is the best use I&#x27;ve found for these and they work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I find the picture on the box is nothing like the q-tips in the box. They are not that precise and/or tapered/angled at the tips and they lose their shape almost immediately. I will use them like I do the regular q-tips but this will not be a repurchase. Such a waste.</li>
            <li> I got these QTips precision Cotton Swabs with the idea that they could be used as regular swabs as well as for precision jobs. That hasn&#x27;t worked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are pretty hard and somewhat pointy. That is not what most people would look for in something they are putting in their ears. As advertised, they are good for precision work that needs a very fine cotton swab. I just don&#x27;t have much need for that. This one box will probably last me the rest of my life. How often is a regular cotton swab too big?</li>
            <li> I ordered these precision Q tips for cleaning my gun.  They narrow tips allow easier access to facilitate cleaning in tight places.</li>
