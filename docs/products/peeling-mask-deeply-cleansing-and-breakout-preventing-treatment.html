            <li>It has a strange smell, but I love the texture, it feels like a whipped product, love the feeling on my face.</li>
            <li>First order on Amazon - used to order from their website!</li>

            <li>So far I can share the following:  Pros:  1) nice package, fast delivery and fantastic customer</li>
            <li>My favorite is the eye cream, which I use twice a day and would never switch back to anything else.</li>
            <li>For several months, this mask has been my favorite of all the Nazelie products.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so fresh and new!</li>
            <li>it does clean your face as far as I can say already, blackheads are reduced (</li>
            <li>, your skin will become soft and clean.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so fresh now that I feel comfortable not using foundation on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I have been using this mask for over a month, last two weeks on a daily basis and I&#x27;m very pleased with results.</li>
            <li>, I can still go out with only day cream and transparent powder, looking and feeling comfortable</li>
            <li>My skin his very oily.</li>
            <li>This mask/cleanser was recommended by my cosmetologist and I&#x27;m very greatful for being introduced to this product.</li>
            <li>Within days all acnes disappeared and I was back to my smooth skin in the matter of couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really working thing!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I am very picky with skincare products, because I feel like many of them are an absolute waste of time and money, but this mask really does the job.</li>
            <li>though the stick applied to this special product for me is of no use since product gets \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; in corners of the stick which has a form of a deep spade)  3)</li>
            <li>I normally use it at least once or twice a month and it always leaves my skin bright and young.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product for everybody with oily and problematic skin.&lt;br /&gt;THANK</li>
            <li>First impressions: the mask can be used as cleanser as well, it was nipping my forehead only</li>
            <li>Acne went away completely!</li>
            <li>At first I was not going to buy the product thinking that it would only be something else I would either give away or throw away</li>
            <li>Peeling mask is natural, easy to use and last long time.</li>
            <li>Dead skin exfoliates very fast and you look fresh and have a glow.</li>
            <li>even though it contains Hydrogen Peroxide which you might think only discolors the blackheads, in fact they really disappear)  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any considerable tightening of pores or smoother skin though.</li>
            <li>Normally, my face is oily in 10 min after I wash it- especially my nose and forehead.</li>
            <li>I act and model and my face is my resume, so I am usually hesitant to try new products, but I feel like I finally found the brand I can both trust and enjoy using.</li>
            <li>(here it&#x27;s hard to say if the whole face had better texture after only the mask or due to complexional care including their cream testers)    </li>
            <li>My skin is almost clear and I definitely see the difference.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m personally no fan of masks in general, however I tend to reach for this one more than I thought I would (at least every second day).</li>
            <li>My skin has shown tremendous improvements over the past 6 months since I started to use it.</li>
            <li>This mask is a must for my oily T-zone, it really shrinks pores and removes dark spots!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> heard about this brand from youtube blogger, so far very happy that made choice to try it!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product together with their eye cream and got 2 free samples of day and night cream.    First impressions: the mask can be used as cleanser as well, it was nipping my forehead only, the rest felt very comfortable. So far I can share the following:  Pros:  1) nice package, fast delivery and fantastic customer care  2) comfortable application and use (though the stick applied to this special product for me is of no use since product gets \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; in corners of the stick which has a form of a deep spade)  3) multifunctional use  4) it does clean your face as far as I can say already, blackheads are reduced (even though it contains Hydrogen Peroxide which you might think only discolors the blackheads, in fact they really disappear)  5) I can&#x27;t see immediate results, but overall after a week even though I never had serious problems, I can still go out with only day cream and transparent powder, looking and feeling comfortable (here it&#x27;s hard to say if the whole face had better texture after only the mask or due to complexional care including their cream testers)    Cons:  1) Hydrogen Peroxide which I wasn&#x27;t happy to find out  2) Strong smell (I guess from that ingredient)  3) Not the cheapest mask    Overall, I&#x27;m personally no fan of masks in general, however I tend to reach for this one more than I thought I would (at least every second day). I like the results so far and would recommend it for those who like masks in general and aren&#x27;t afraid of the smell. It works anyway.    Two weeks application update:  The mask definitely cleans up the face. My skin is in general without any serious breakouts, but blackheads have reduced. I still feel strange about the smell, but use the product with pleasure. Sometimes, when tired I apply it only as a cleanser. It washed off easily and leaves a pleasant feeling. I haven&#x27;t noticed any considerable tightening of pores or smoother skin though. Overall, I&#x27;d consider buying it again at price discount periods.</li>
            <li> My friend suggested this brand for me, and I can&#x27;t be happier! I am very picky with skincare products, because I feel like many of them are an absolute waste of time and money, but this mask really does the job. I act and model and my face is my resume, so I am usually hesitant to try new products, but I feel like I finally found the brand I can both trust and enjoy using.</li>
            <li> This mask did not do anything for me. I bought thinking it was a peeling mask, meaning that it peeled off like most peeling masks. It does not and I do not understand why it is called a &amp;#34;peeling&amp;#34; mask. I did not see any difference in my acne or blackheads after using this product. I will say the only thing it did for me was leave my skin feeling a bit cleaner. I could use a simple facial cleanser for that though.</li>
            <li> I have never used a product like this before. It has a strange smell, but I love the texture, it feels like a whipped product, love the feeling on my face. It leaves my skin clean and oil-free. I am so happy to have finally found what works on me!</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample, and my super oily skin feels really good after it. Skin feels super clean, but not irritated.</li>
            <li> The mask looks like a white souffle  has a soap smell. I use it every evening, apply and wait five minutes after clean my face with water. I use this mask more then three months and i see how my skin looks better.</li>
            <li> Nazelie skin care products are wonderful!  I&#x27;ve been using several products for almost a year and have been very pleased with the results. My favorite is the eye cream, which I use twice a day and would never switch back to anything else. Give them a try!  You will be very pleased!!  If you have any questions or uncertainty over what products are right for your skin, contact the company...they are extremely helpful in personalizing your skin card regime.</li>
            <li> This mask is a must for my oily T-zone, it really shrinks pores and removes dark spots!</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better than now! I have tried millions of products and this is one of the best! Dead skin exfoliates very fast and you look fresh and have a glow. Highly recommend this product for everybody with oily and problematic skin.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU !!!</li>
            <li> My skin his very oily. Normally, my face is oily in 10 min after I wash it- especially my nose and forehead. I think because of that I had acne. After I&#x27;ve used this mask for a couple days it all changed. Acne went away completely! My face is cleared and brightened up.( I have dark skin so it&#x27;s like a bonus) It feels like it exfoliates the skin till bones.</li>
            <li> This is best thing that i try in my life!!!</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it with Clarisonic brush. My skin is squeaky clean after it and creams absorb a lot better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask for over a month, last two weeks on a daily basis and I&#x27;m very pleased with results. My skin is almost clear and I definitely see the difference. I&#x27;ve been leaving the mask for several minutes on the skin every evening and wash it out with the facial sponge (buf-put) or cellulose sponge. This mask/cleanser was recommended by my cosmetologist and I&#x27;m very greatful for being introduced to this product. I also stopped consume the dairy products or eat goat yogurt just a several spoons a week.</li>
            <li> It helped me fight my acne problems which were almost eternal. Very good product!. Now, need to explore their youth illuminator to remove the post-acne marks.</li>
            <li> I normally order on the website, loved to see Nazelie products on Amazon! I&#x27;m constantly looking for ways to rejuvenate and brighten my skin tone. This mask does the job. I normally use it at least once or twice a month and it always leaves my skin bright and young. I have larger pores around the T-zone and this product definitely helps to tighten them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the mask for a couple days. It works great. It feels like I have new skin right now, clean and without acne. It has not the best smell though, but I don&#x27;t care. Feels like medicine, not cosmetic stuff.</li>
            <li> I don’t usually write any reviews but couldn’t resist to write one for this product. For no specific reason my face started breaking out, so my friend recommended me to try this product. Within days all acnes disappeared and I was back to my smooth skin in the matter of couple of weeks. My skin looks so fresh now that I feel comfortable not using foundation on a daily basis. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely fabulous! With daily use, your skin gets noticeably better and better. You will feel (and see!) the result of this incredible mask in 2 weeks, your skin will become soft and clean. For several months, this mask has been my favorite of all the Nazelie products.</li>
            <li> When I got a super cute purple package today in my mail I knew I was in for something good...!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This product is a magic mask..!! Truly fabulous...!!!

            <li> Peeling mask is natural, easy to use and last long time. Its a worthy investment. My skin has shown tremendous improvements over the past 6 months since I started to use it. The whole line of these natural products is amazing! Also would want to mention state-of-the-art customer service and individual approach to every customer.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product of all time. I notice results the second I wash it off. My skin literally glows. I did not know that it was possible. This is a miracle product. I call it the gateway drug to all Nazelie products. You will not be disappointed. Obsessed.</li>
