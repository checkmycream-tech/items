            <li>The range of colors is really nice and the pencils being</li>
            <li>since it was cheep you will need to warm it up</li>

            <li>they are tiny pencils but perfect for a makeup bag..</li>
            <li>Sincerely, Juanita Wilson...</li>
            <li>My daughter and I were able to split the colors between both of us.</li>
            <li>We love the colors, ease of application</li>
            <li>they were mostly browns.</li>
            <li>They took almost took weeks to get here, but that&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>I gave it two starts just because it came with so many.</li>
            <li>The colors are okay.</li>
            <li>they are okay</li>
            <li>Love it&#x3D;)was</li>
            <li>so I love love</li>
            <li>love it&#x3D;D</li>
            <li>BECAUSE EVEN CRAYONS ARE BETTER THAN THIS.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for those who want to experiment with different looks.</li>
            <li>Love them a lot.</li>
            <li>You have to coat the line of your eye to many times to even see it.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic value for the price!</li>
            <li>These were ok.</li>
            <li>Love how it showed up&lt;br</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It was just adorable:)</li>
            <li>It is tinyer than I expecteted and not that pigmented it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Its exactly 2 weeks!!!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good eyeliners but you don&#x27;t get the colors pictured which is the only reason I bought the product however they are a good brow/eye pencil.</li>
            <li>very fun and easy to use!</li>
            <li>However, the blue is very nice and makes a nice accent for anyone&#x27;s eyes.</li>
            <li>They glide on well &amp; the best part was the nice note that came with the pack it had a little history &amp; a thank you!</li>
            <li>the colors are bright and vibrant!</li>
            <li>but I still love them and they were cheap</li>
            <li>Good colors, probably wont get much use.  </li>
            <li>The product does not go on easy .</li>
            <li>These pencils are smaller them I thought they would be - great selection but thought it was more pencil</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and remove.  </li>
            <li>I must say this product wasnt right for me, But this company did go through hoops to see that i was a satisfied customer and did was EVER they had to do to see that i was COMPLETELY satisfied</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty, and they go on well after you warm them up a bit.</li>
            <li>Beautiful colors that last all day!!</li>
            <li>They are ok, great for the pocket book, small and effective.</li>
            <li>for a child&#x27;s play makeup they would be fine, for an adult looking for a good value, keep looking</li>
            <li>yeah, to sum things up, this is a GREAT pack to get for only TWO dollars and free shipping.</li>
            <li>The pencils run short and the colors are great .</li>
            <li>will have to apply heat in order for the color to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>i enjoy the makeup  </li>
            <li>They glide on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>It was cheap</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect it to be so cheap.</li>
            <li>They were cheap, but it was still not work the money.</li>
            <li>but these liners simply dont glide..not happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>these are cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li>Thanks for being nice and helpful</li>
            <li>It was very nice, a little smaller than I had imagined in size, but I still liked it and the price was good.</li>
            <li>thety are ver pigmented, very soft but no fragile, and wonderful colors.</li>
            <li>THAT I REASSESS MY ORIGINAL RATING OF THEIR PRODUCT/ SERVICE AND EXCHANGE IT TO A 5 STAR RATING</li>
            <li>/&gt;you get your money&#x27;s worth and then some !</li>
            <li>It goes on clean and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li>The product itself is nicely pigmented and the perfect balance being being too soft and rubbing anywhere and everywhere to being too hard and making it feel like your poking at your eye.</li>
            <li>, I just use them on my top lid, because on the waterline they really don&#x27;t show up.</li>
            <li>Overall good for the price...</li>
            <li>Just wished they were full length.</li>
            <li>When I recieved these eyeliner pencils, I was pleasantly surprised, because I liked their size.</li>
            <li>I love it , it stay on the whole day .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not awful but have to go over and over to get the color to really show.</li>
            <li>These people contacted me and made me feel like they truely cared about my business.</li>
            <li>get 12 of them, the pigment is good &amp;&amp; they last a lot longer then some liners !&lt;</li>
            <li>But not bad for the price I guess.</li>
            <li>Omg.... what a super bargain.....</li>
            <li>shipped quick.</li>
            <li>Can double for eyeshadow, adds pops of color, good quaility, worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well the colors are very pretty</li>
            <li>They are not hard like most eyeliners, they are very soft and go on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>these are going to be so super fun...</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I hoped it&#x27;d be!</li>
            <li>These pencils are wonderful to look at, but they won&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>but when I tried it for the first time it didn&#x27;t come on so clean.</li>
            <li>Happy I pay little money for it</li>
            <li>I received them yesterday, and I tested them today on my eyebrows; they filled in very well; to my sparse eyebrows.</li>
            <li>the colors are very pigmented i just love it thanks to the world pride</li>
            <li>Was honestly looking for a double ended type that I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li>they can be fun to play around with</li>
            <li>My daughter, who is 11, had fun playing with these</li>
            <li>The colors were comical as far as make up is concerned.</li>
            <li>would recommend for anyone who&#x27;s colorful like me</li>
            <li>/&gt;Totally worth</li>
            <li>I got these pretty quick</li>
            <li>For me they were the right size to put in my purse</li>
            <li>goes on smooth, vibrant colors, and lasts all day</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t go on very easily and it takes several layers to get the effect you want.</li>
            <li>they are small in size great for the purse or pocket.</li>
            <li>Anyways, they&#x27;re really small, about the size of my pinkie, but they go on well, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>it wud b...was expecting it to be soft for easy application</li>
            <li>thank you for going through all the trouble to see that i was a satisfied customer &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It shipped super fast and on time.</li>
            <li>The browns turn out more reddish and the actual reds and pinks made my eyes look puffy and sore.</li>
            <li>i thought they were eye shadow pencils when i first purchased them</li>
            <li>Love all the different colors.</li>
            <li>I really like them!</li>
            <li>AND AFTER A LONG TALK AND A PROMISE OF FULL REFUND I HAVE DECIDED THAT IT IS ONLY FAIR</li>
            <li>AND PROMISED TO DO BETTER IN THE FUTURE.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>The pencils have really pretty colors.</li>
            <li>I ordered this, thinking it would be these exact colors, it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>love the colors they definitely works with my eye color...</li>
            <li>.. goes on pretty smoothly, and they arrived early.</li>
            <li>fustrated at first</li>
            <li>omg they look so pretty</li>
            <li>some wear first or it will hurt</li>
            <li>they have nice colours in the selection and they are able to fit in your pocket if needed, as long as you understand they are small</li>
            <li>But beautiful colors, however,  I do give second chances, so in the near future I may order again.</li>
            <li>Most of these eyeliners appear to be very pigmented however the pencils are extremely short.</li>
            <li>although the size i f the pencils was small, that would not have been an issue if the quality was good..</li>
            <li>Much smaller than shown, and had to reorder, because the first ones never came, but all in all they are fine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fun to try new looks</li>
            <li>You have to kinda heat it up to use it easily, and there were no pinks when I got it only lots of browns,but will probably buy it again</li>
            <li>They are very small colors are pretty ae good for travel compact size</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a fine product.</li>
            <li>They are nice, but I think I&#x27;ll just be giving them to my niece for play make-up for just have them in my make-up bag for when I babysit some little girls that want to play with my make-up...</li>
            <li>for a little as they are they put out a nice color.</li>
            <li>The colours are amazing, one thing to note is that the pencil is really really short, even with that said I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t mark very well either</li>
            <li>They are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for someone who&#x27;s really into makeup, and like experimenting.besides</li>
            <li>really suck</li>
            <li>The pencils are very tiny and they go on too light.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I have darker skin, and all the colors go on very well.</li>
            <li>thanks..</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not going to complain too much.</li>
            <li>I really did not care for the cosmetic pencils.</li>
            <li>ans texture blends very well ,,,</li>
            <li>so much I would never pay it again.</li>
            <li>I am very please with this product.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>The colored part is not soft or easy to apply at all.</li>
            <li>The pencils are small, and they don&#x27;t go on real smooth.</li>
            <li>More or less got what I paid for.</li>
            <li>Vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>The colors look vibrant, but are not when applied.</li>
            <li>I will definitely recommend them to others and I will be ordering some more in the future.</li>
            <li>I got a different product which had mostly browns, not multiple colors</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very surprised how nice these eyeliner pencils are for how little they cost!</li>
            <li>and I did use a high end sharpener and a cheaper one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main gripe I have</li>
            <li>These were smaller than I thought but the color when applied is very pretty.</li>
            <li>Now, I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to be getting high dollar make-up quality with these.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting these.</li>
            <li>BUT, I was hoping for a little better quality than what they are.</li>
            <li>The colors are lighter than I thought and do need  a little more effort to put on darker.</li>
            <li>thought how cute it came in its little box</li>
            <li>I love the variety and for so little $$!</li>
            <li>Only a few of the colors need more than one coat, the rest are all highly pigmented and really pop.</li>
            <li>But honestly, I cant tell if that&#x27;s because the product itself is incredibly sheer, or because I&#x27;m just too dang pale.</li>
            <li>You are able to sharpen them just a couple of times before it is too small to even be used.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>too light and not as long lasting as I would like</li>
            <li>These are cute, easy to use however the shipping on these was crazy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the colors in the pictures they were more or less all brown with two different blues.</li>
            <li>It is just a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>The colors r not as soft as i tot</li>
            <li>When I use it for the first time it did stay on long after the lipstick</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am a medium brown shade with sensitive skin and the colors showed up without any skin irritation.</li>
            <li>but they last longer than you&#x27;d expect and don&#x27;t have to be sharpened much.</li>
            <li>they show but not that good very small and sharp</li>
            <li>I bought these as a gift for a friend, the pencils are little bit smaller than I expected, but they are nice.</li>
            <li>The only color I don&#x27;t really like from my pack is my silver, which just plain doesn&#x27;t really show up much.</li>
            <li>the only big issue I have is the two pencils that look the same but even that I can solve by swatching them on my hand first.</li>
            <li>I bought these originally because of the number of colors, but there are really only a few that are true to their actual color- the black, brown, and greens.</li>
            <li>better then expected!!!!!!</li>
            <li>They are small but they work as expected and the colors are interesting.</li>
            <li>I can barely hold them in my hand.</li>
            <li>I was expected to get them on the first of next month!</li>
            <li>These pencils are super small and it took about 3 weeks before they were delivered.</li>
            <li>They appeared very small and cheap.</li>
            <li>they are only 1/3 size pencils and wear down very fast.</li>
            <li>they are small but for the price their worth having and buying</li>
            <li>Still, I like the variety of colors so much that I will keep these and use them until they are down to the nub.</li>

            <li> Pigmentation if great, firmness of the makeup is good, easy to blend, good range of colors, doesn&#x27;t rub off extremely easily....</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> it amazing.</li>
            <li> However the box that they come in is cute and was good storage for them in my makeup tub.</li>

            <li> They don&#x27;t go on nicely.</li>
            <li> She was thrilled with the variety of colors, and loves to point out her makeup to me whenever I see her.</li>
            <li> The range of colors is really nice and the pencils being</li>
            <li> since it was cheep you will need to warm it up</li>
            <li> Most of them have a nice shimmer to them as well.</li>
            <li> I am pretty impressed with the quality, because they were so cheap</li>
            <li> Bright, true to color and waterproof...</li>

            <li> but I don&#x27;t complain about the size, comes in time, and I love using them ..</li>
            <li> I think my favorite was the gold color</li>
            <li> they are tiny pencils but perfect for a makeup bag..</li>
            <li> Sincerely, Juanita Wilson...</li>
            <li> My daughter and I were able to split the colors between both of us.</li>
            <li> We love the colors, ease of application</li>
            <li> they were mostly browns.</li>
            <li> They took almost took weeks to get here, but that&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li> I gave it two starts just because it came with so many.</li>
            <li> The colors are okay.</li>
            <li> they are okay</li>
            <li> Love it&#x3D;)was</li>
            <li> so I love love</li>
            <li> love it&#x3D;D</li>
            <li> BECAUSE EVEN CRAYONS ARE BETTER THAN THIS.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for those who want to experiment with different looks.</li>
            <li> Love them a lot.</li>
            <li> You have to coat the line of your eye to many times to even see it.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic value for the price!</li>
            <li> These were ok.</li>
            <li> Love how it showed up&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It was just adorable:)</li>
            <li> It is tinyer than I expecteted and not that pigmented it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Its exactly 2 weeks!!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good eyeliners but you don&#x27;t get the colors pictured which is the only reason I bought the product however they are a good brow/eye pencil.</li>
            <li> very fun and easy to use!</li>
            <li> However, the blue is very nice and makes a nice accent for anyone&#x27;s eyes.</li>
            <li> They glide on well &amp; the best part was the nice note that came with the pack it had a little history &amp; a thank you!</li>
            <li> the colors are bright and vibrant!</li>
            <li> but I still love them and they were cheap</li>
            <li> Good colors, probably wont get much use.  </li>
            <li> The product does not go on easy .</li>
            <li> These pencils are smaller them I thought they would be - great selection but thought it was more pencil</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and remove.  </li>
            <li> I must say this product wasnt right for me, But this company did go through hoops to see that i was a satisfied customer and did was EVER they had to do to see that i was COMPLETELY satisfied</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty, and they go on well after you warm them up a bit.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors that last all day!!</li>
            <li> They are ok, great for the pocket book, small and effective.</li>
            <li> for a child&#x27;s play makeup they would be fine, for an adult looking for a good value, keep looking</li>
            <li> yeah, to sum things up, this is a GREAT pack to get for only TWO dollars and free shipping.</li>
            <li> The pencils run short and the colors are great .</li>
            <li> will have to apply heat in order for the color to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> i enjoy the makeup  </li>
            <li> They glide on so smoothly.</li>
            <li> It was cheap</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect it to be so cheap.</li>
            <li> They were cheap, but it was still not work the money.</li>
            <li> but these liners simply dont glide..not happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> these are cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li> Thanks for being nice and helpful</li>
            <li> It was very nice, a little smaller than I had imagined in size, but I still liked it and the price was good.</li>
            <li> thety are ver pigmented, very soft but no fragile, and wonderful colors.</li>
            <li> THAT I REASSESS MY ORIGINAL RATING OF THEIR PRODUCT/ SERVICE AND EXCHANGE IT TO A 5 STAR RATING</li>
            <li> /&gt;you get your money&#x27;s worth and then some !</li>
            <li> It goes on clean and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> The product itself is nicely pigmented and the perfect balance being being too soft and rubbing anywhere and everywhere to being too hard and making it feel like your poking at your eye.</li>
            <li> , I just use them on my top lid, because on the waterline they really don&#x27;t show up.</li>
            <li> Overall good for the price...</li>
            <li> Just wished they were full length.</li>
            <li> When I recieved these eyeliner pencils, I was pleasantly surprised, because I liked their size.</li>
            <li> I love it , it stay on the whole day .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not awful but have to go over and over to get the color to really show.</li>
            <li> These people contacted me and made me feel like they truely cared about my business.</li>
            <li> get 12 of them, the pigment is good &amp;&amp; they last a lot longer then some liners !&lt;</li>
            <li> But not bad for the price I guess.</li>
            <li> Omg.... what a super bargain.....</li>
            <li> shipped quick.</li>
            <li> Can double for eyeshadow, adds pops of color, good quaility, worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well the colors are very pretty</li>
            <li> They are not hard like most eyeliners, they are very soft and go on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> these are going to be so super fun...</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I hoped it&#x27;d be!</li>
            <li> These pencils are wonderful to look at, but they won&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> but when I tried it for the first time it didn&#x27;t come on so clean.</li>
            <li> Happy I pay little money for it</li>
            <li> I received them yesterday, and I tested them today on my eyebrows; they filled in very well; to my sparse eyebrows.</li>
            <li> the colors are very pigmented i just love it thanks to the world pride</li>
            <li> Was honestly looking for a double ended type that I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li> they can be fun to play around with</li>
            <li> My daughter, who is 11, had fun playing with these</li>
            <li> The colors were comical as far as make up is concerned.</li>
            <li> would recommend for anyone who&#x27;s colorful like me</li>
            <li> /&gt;Totally worth</li>
            <li> I got these pretty quick</li>
            <li> For me they were the right size to put in my purse</li>
            <li> goes on smooth, vibrant colors, and lasts all day</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t go on very easily and it takes several layers to get the effect you want.</li>
            <li> they are small in size great for the purse or pocket.</li>
            <li> Anyways, they&#x27;re really small, about the size of my pinkie, but they go on well, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> it wud b...was expecting it to be soft for easy application</li>
            <li> thank you for going through all the trouble to see that i was a satisfied customer &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It shipped super fast and on time.</li>
            <li> The browns turn out more reddish and the actual reds and pinks made my eyes look puffy and sore.</li>
            <li> i thought they were eye shadow pencils when i first purchased them</li>
            <li> Love all the different colors.</li>
            <li> I really like them!</li>
            <li> AND AFTER A LONG TALK AND A PROMISE OF FULL REFUND I HAVE DECIDED THAT IT IS ONLY FAIR</li>
            <li> AND PROMISED TO DO BETTER IN THE FUTURE.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> The pencils have really pretty colors.</li>
            <li> I ordered this, thinking it would be these exact colors, it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> love the colors they definitely works with my eye color...</li>
            <li> .. goes on pretty smoothly, and they arrived early.</li>
            <li> fustrated at first</li>
            <li> omg they look so pretty</li>
            <li> some wear first or it will hurt</li>
            <li> they have nice colours in the selection and they are able to fit in your pocket if needed, as long as you understand they are small</li>
            <li> But beautiful colors, however,  I do give second chances, so in the near future I may order again.</li>
            <li> Most of these eyeliners appear to be very pigmented however the pencils are extremely short.</li>
            <li> although the size i f the pencils was small, that would not have been an issue if the quality was good..</li>
            <li> Much smaller than shown, and had to reorder, because the first ones never came, but all in all they are fine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fun to try new looks</li>
            <li> You have to kinda heat it up to use it easily, and there were no pinks when I got it only lots of browns,but will probably buy it again</li>
            <li> They are very small colors are pretty ae good for travel compact size</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a fine product.</li>
            <li> They are nice, but I think I&#x27;ll just be giving them to my niece for play make-up for just have them in my make-up bag for when I babysit some little girls that want to play with my make-up...</li>
            <li> for a little as they are they put out a nice color.</li>
            <li> The colours are amazing, one thing to note is that the pencil is really really short, even with that said I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t mark very well either</li>
            <li> They are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for someone who&#x27;s really into makeup, and like experimenting.besides</li>
            <li> really suck</li>
            <li> The pencils are very tiny and they go on too light.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I have darker skin, and all the colors go on very well.</li>
            <li> thanks..</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not going to complain too much.</li>
            <li> I really did not care for the cosmetic pencils.</li>
            <li> ans texture blends very well ,,,</li>
            <li> so much I would never pay it again.</li>
            <li> I am very please with this product.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> The colored part is not soft or easy to apply at all.</li>
            <li> The pencils are small, and they don&#x27;t go on real smooth.</li>
            <li> More or less got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> The colors look vibrant, but are not when applied.</li>
            <li> I will definitely recommend them to others and I will be ordering some more in the future.</li>
            <li> I got a different product which had mostly browns, not multiple colors</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very surprised how nice these eyeliner pencils are for how little they cost!</li>
            <li> and I did use a high end sharpener and a cheaper one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main gripe I have</li>
            <li> These were smaller than I thought but the color when applied is very pretty.</li>
            <li> Now, I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to be getting high dollar make-up quality with these.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting these.</li>
            <li> BUT, I was hoping for a little better quality than what they are.</li>
            <li> The colors are lighter than I thought and do need  a little more effort to put on darker.</li>
            <li> thought how cute it came in its little box</li>
            <li> I love the variety and for so little $$!</li>
            <li> Only a few of the colors need more than one coat, the rest are all highly pigmented and really pop.</li>
            <li> But honestly, I cant tell if that&#x27;s because the product itself is incredibly sheer, or because I&#x27;m just too dang pale.</li>
            <li> You are able to sharpen them just a couple of times before it is too small to even be used.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> too light and not as long lasting as I would like</li>
            <li> These are cute, easy to use however the shipping on these was crazy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the colors in the pictures they were more or less all brown with two different blues.</li>
            <li> It is just a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> The colors r not as soft as i tot</li>
            <li> When I use it for the first time it did stay on long after the lipstick</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am a medium brown shade with sensitive skin and the colors showed up without any skin irritation.</li>
            <li> but they last longer than you&#x27;d expect and don&#x27;t have to be sharpened much.</li>
            <li> they show but not that good very small and sharp</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for a friend, the pencils are little bit smaller than I expected, but they are nice.</li>
            <li> The only color I don&#x27;t really like from my pack is my silver, which just plain doesn&#x27;t really show up much.</li>
            <li> the only big issue I have is the two pencils that look the same but even that I can solve by swatching them on my hand first.</li>
            <li> I bought these originally because of the number of colors, but there are really only a few that are true to their actual color- the black, brown, and greens.</li>
            <li> better then expected!!!!!!</li>
            <li> They are small but they work as expected and the colors are interesting.</li>
            <li> I can barely hold them in my hand.</li>
            <li> I was expected to get them on the first of next month!</li>
            <li> These pencils are super small and it took about 3 weeks before they were delivered.</li>
            <li> They appeared very small and cheap.</li>
            <li> they are only 1/3 size pencils and wear down very fast.</li>
            <li> they are small but for the price their worth having and buying</li>
            <li> Still, I like the variety of colors so much that I will keep these and use them until they are down to the nub.</li>
            <li> waste of time a complete waste of money, hardly shoes at all better off giving your child to use as crayons.</li>
            <li> They are about half the size of a normal eyeliner pencil, but it seems they will last a very long time to me.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> As has been mentioned they&#x27;re only 2 inches long.  </li>
            <li> They do not run and are long lasting.</li>
            <li> I was expecting long pencils, they were short and skinny.</li>
            <li> Work very well, only complaint is that I wish they were longer.</li>
            <li> but that is not even the real problem which is its hard an</li>
            <li> they are 2 inches long.</li>
            <li> expected something larger in length and in diameter was</li>
            <li> Does not stay on long and smears a lot.</li>
            <li> smaller then expected.</li>
            <li> it is not easy to apply, and needs to be reapplied frequently.</li>
            <li> proves difficult to apply properly in that its not going onto my eyes when I try lining my waterline or lid</li>
            <li> the color is to dark its not the same what they posted.</li>
            <li> I was expecting them to be a little bigger and to stay on long</li>
            <li> They are half the size of your standard eyeliner pencil.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing they said was that they were to short.</li>
            <li> But in order to use any of them the need to be sharpened and wet.</li>
            <li> sharpen roughly leaving spiked type edges on the pencils</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> The items were to short and uneven in length.  </li>
            <li> Colors I expected weren&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li> Each pencil is very small, about the size of a golf pencil, so don&#x27;t be too surprised when you get them</li>
            <li> No, I really can&#x27;t say that if I  would recommend this product due to I did not use them.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any red or pink colors, just a couple of blue/purple and green, and the rest were dark brown, like 5 of them.</li>
            <li> lots of colors to pick from, but waxy and hard to use and don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> package of these liners was expired, had to throw most of them away because they were dried out and impossible to use</li>
            <li> but when i tried to use them the tip was too sharp and it gives off no pigment</li>
            <li> They really small thats the only problema but</li>
            <li> The pencils are so sharp that they cut my eyelid, and the color doesn&#x27;t even show up.</li>
            <li> and the other comment make me want them more:D</li>
            <li> They were not what I expected!</li>
            <li> yeah, only a few inches long and as thin as a regular pencil,</li>
            <li> small means that if you have a color you don&#x27;t really like you wont feel as bad just not using it since its not as much of a</li>
            <li> They are pretty colors but hard to apply , really small and are hard to sharpen</li>
            <li> but you gave me such a hard time they dont want to deal ith you....</li>
            <li> not worth your money go buy cover girl sticks</li>
            <li> they are really small like 2&amp;#34; inches long.</li>
            <li> The could be used as a colored pencil, but for makeup they are definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> ITS NOT WORTH THE MONEY NOR</li>
            <li> One is a dark magenta like color and another is a medium brown.</li>
            <li> Might work a lot nicer of dark skin.(also a picture of</li>
            <li> Very small -tiny pencil.</li>
            <li> very small and low quality</li>
            <li> Odd colors.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t expect the odd colors.</li>
            <li> colors dont show up pencils hard to sharpen took too long to arrive....threw away</li>
            <li> Not what I expected too small</li>
            <li> I even tried the trusty lighter to melt it a little............</li>
            <li> It took a little over two weeks to get here.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Just waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m just going to go to the drugstore and get a few 88 cent eyeliner pencils.</li>
            <li> The colors don&#x27;t glide on and they are not easily seen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not only are they EXTREMELY small, but the color payoff is not good and they are hard.</li>
            <li> i did receive them but they are so small</li>
            <li> pencils are too small.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!</li>

            <li> I know there probably small</li>
            <li> This are small pencils .</li>
            <li> When I received my eyeliner the package was broken on the side, but other then that everything was intact.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with this product first off its very small</li>
            <li> You have to push kinda hard to get the color on.</li>
            <li> Hard ton the eye, needs to be softened.</li>
            <li> Too hard to apply on the eyelid.</li>
            <li> Some of them came fully sharpened, while others seemed to be dull and shorter that the others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed, at least in mine</li>
            <li> Yes they&#x27;re small but for the price why complain!</li>
            <li> im not sure what to do with them because they are miniature !</li>

            <li> VERY SMALL IN SIZE.</li>
            <li> The pencils are very small</li>
            <li> For $3.54 how can you seriously complain ?</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t work at all and the pencils were so small that if you had to sharpen them they are useless.</li>
            <li> These are very hard and need to be warmed before use.</li>
            <li> BUT they were really small!!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed to see how small they were.</li>
            <li> find them poor quality and would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> They receive them in approximately 20 to 25 days.</li>
            <li> was not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner does not stay on, it&#x27;s poor quality.</li>
            <li> stiff when the pencil is cold</li>
            <li> is the length of them, they are worse then travel and mini size!</li>

            <li> Now, I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to be getting high dollar make-up quality with these. BUT, I was hoping for a little better quality than what they are. Yes, they do show that they are miniature, but don&#x27;t let the pictures fool you.. They are S M A L L. I can barely hold them in my hand. They don&#x27;t mark very well either, I just use them on my top lid, because on the waterline they really don&#x27;t show up. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase these again. They are nice, but I think I&#x27;ll just be giving them to my niece for play make-up for just have them in my make-up bag for when I babysit some little girls that want to play with my make-up...</li>
            <li> The colors are lighter than I thought and do need  a little more effort to put on darker.</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors. But in order to use any of them the need to be sharpened and wet. A bit pulling. But t the wear great. Starting power. Would buy again</li>
            <li> Not something I would buy again.</li>
            <li> The pencils run short and the colors are great . The product does not go on easy . will have to apply heat in order for the color to go on smoothly. Overall good for the price...</li>
            <li> I bought these originally because of the number of colors, but there are really only a few that are true to their actual color- the black, brown, and greens. The browns turn out more reddish and the actual reds and pinks made my eyes look puffy and sore. They don&#x27;t go on very easily and it takes several layers to get the effect you want. Another thing: the package came addressed from China but the pencils say they are made in France. However the box that they come in is cute and was good storage for them in my makeup tub.</li>
            <li> Has the color perfect for your eyebrows only.</li>
            <li> They work great. For me they were the right size to put in my purse</li>
            <li> They are mini size but the colors are good. Just wished they were full length.</li>
            <li> Colors do not work.  Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> i thought they were eye shadow pencils when i first purchased them but when i tried to use them the tip was too sharp and it gives off no pigment</li>
            <li> They are very small colors are pretty ae good for travel compact size</li>
            <li> these are crap do not buy  doesnt work an it doesnt spread its so not worth your money go buy cover girl sticks</li>
            <li> The colors r not as soft as i tot it wud b...was expecting it to be soft for easy application</li>
            <li> These are cute, easy to use however the shipping on these was crazy. I actually forgot that I had ordered them until they arrived</li>
            <li> goes on smooth, vibrant colors, and lasts all day</li>
            <li> Omg.... what a super bargain.....better then expected!!!!!! Highly recommended. Love all the different colors. Eyes and lips use it every day.</li>
            <li> I really like them! Yes they&#x27;re small but for the price why complain!</li>
            <li> i enjoy the makeup  and i order more thank u and he os very good so get it now do think just order what u like</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good eyeliners but you don&#x27;t get the colors pictured which is the only reason I bought the product however they are a good brow/eye pencil.</li>
            <li> the color is to dark its not the same what they posted.</li>
            <li> These are more like colored pencils!!! Trying to put it on my eyes, it didn&#x27;t work, it made my eyelid sore and red trying to get it on!!&lt;br /&gt;  I even tried the trusty lighter to melt it a little............it didn&#x27;t work out???</li>
            <li> They really small thats the only problema but the colors are very pigmented i just love it thanks to the world pride</li>
            <li> Most of these eyeliners appear to be very pigmented however the pencils are extremely short. You are able to sharpen them just a couple of times before it is too small to even be used.&lt;br /&gt;They sharpen roughly leaving spiked type edges on the pencils and I did use a high end sharpener and a cheaper one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main gripe I have is the length of them, they are worse then travel and mini size!</li>
            <li> they are small in size great for the purse or pocket.</li>
            <li> it is not easy to apply, and needs to be reapplied frequently.</li>
            <li> i did receive them but they are so small im not sure what to do with them because they are miniature ! but thank you for getting them to me, i guess that what you get for that price</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have ever purchased from amazon. Did not expect amazon to sell such horrible things. Does not work at all. Please don&#x27;t buy this. Just waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> They are pretty colors but hard to apply , really small and are hard to sharpen</li>
            <li> Not what I expected too small</li>
            <li> these are the best purchace yet. thety are ver pigmented, very soft but no fragile, and wonderful colors. im NOT dissapointed at all</li>
            <li> this is great if you are just messing around with colours and like to spice things up! very fun and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I love these eyeliners. I received them yesterday, and I tested them today on my eyebrows; they filled in very well; to my sparse eyebrows. I also applied the eyeliner to my eyes as a eyeshadow; it stayed on, until I washed it off. I am going to order more, because I don&#x27;t want to run out of it.</li>
            <li> Well the colors are very pretty BUT they were really small!! I thought they were either gonna b jumbo or regular size pencil but they are lik  mby 4 inchs big.</li>
            <li> I am in love! I just thought it was for eyeliner! WRONG! I can use it on my lips as well. They glide on so smoothly. The size are very small.. About as big as my pinky finger. They are very pigmented. Overrall.. Amazing. Great buy! Plus!! It took a little over two weeks to get here. I ordered them on the 1st and today is the 14th! Oooo! Its exactly 2 weeks!!! I was expected to get them on the first of next month!</li>
            <li> These are some short pencils but a lot of colors. Makes good travel pencils for your purse or make up pouch. Great deal.</li>
            <li> I love it but there isn&#x27;t white..</li>
            <li> I HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE COMPANY ABOUT MY PURCHASE OF THIS PRODUCT FROM THEM AND MY INITIAL THOUGHTS ABOUT IT AND AFTER A LONG TALK AND A PROMISE OF FULL REFUND I HAVE DECIDED THAT IT IS ONLY FAIR THAT I REASSESS MY ORIGINAL RATING OF THEIR PRODUCT/ SERVICE AND EXCHANGE IT TO A 5 STAR RATING AS THEY HAVE MADE GOOD ON THEIR PROMISE AND PROMISED TO DO BETTER IN THE FUTURE. I HOPE THIS ENCOURAGES ALL TO TRY OUT THIS COMPANY AND THEIR PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> VERY HAPPY WITH THIS . EXACTLY AS I PICTURED. LOVE THE COLORS. ITS TRIAL SIZE MAKES IT EASIER TO TRY TO SEE WHICH ONE OR ONES ARE THE BEST CHOICES FOR YOU. LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> The colours are amazing, one thing to note is that the pencil is really really short, even with that said I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> These are great if your trying to add  or build a make-up collection. There are many colors.</li>
            <li> they are a but  tiny but I don&#x27;t complain about the size, comes in time, and I love using them ..</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for a friend, the pencils are little bit smaller than I expected, but they are nice.</li>
            <li> I received these, i was unaware that they were mini&#x27;s but I use them just the same. The colors in  the pack was the ones that I needed. I am glad that I got them, they would be great for travel.</li>
            <li> I Don&#x27;t Recommend This Product.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for someone who&#x27;s really into makeup, and like experimenting.besides it&#x27;s fun to try new looks</li>
            <li> Can not &amp; will not use this product. The pencils are to tiny for me to grip them properly and apply on the eyes. You get what you pay for lol. Save you $2.00</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected. You have to push kinda hard to get the color on. Was honestly looking for a double ended type that I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li> package of these liners was expired, had to throw most of them away because they were dried out and impossible to use</li>
            <li> excellent product and 100% reliable</li>
            <li> waste of time a complete waste of money, hardly shoes at all better off giving your child to use as crayons.</li>
            <li> Odd colors. Tiny pencils. Hard ton the eye, needs to be softened. More or less got what I paid for. Just didn&#x27;t expect the odd colors. Took awhile to get through customs too.</li>
            <li> Like using a collerd pencil</li>
            <li> dont show on skin really suck</li>
            <li> The pencils are small, and they don&#x27;t go on real smooth. Good price for what you get. Good colors in the assortment.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! The colors pop so nicely! I think my favorite was the gold color but they are all really nice! They glide on well &amp; the best part was the nice note that came with the pack it had a little history &amp; a thank you! All in all it&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t work at all and the pencils were so small that if you had to sharpen them they are useless. Sorry.</li>
            <li> nice colors great for travelling i bought these to put in goody bags at my wrap party and everyone loved them i have a pair in my makeup bag that i keep in my office at work to do touch ups and they are the perfect size!  love them!</li>
            <li> Total waste of my money and so disappointed. The pencils are very tiny and they go on too light. The colors look vibrant, but are not when applied. I threw them out because I had no use for them once I seen how they looked.</li>
            <li> Each pencil is very small, about the size of a golf pencil, so don&#x27;t be too surprised when you get them (like I was).</li>
            <li> It was very nice, a little smaller than I had imagined in size, but I still liked it and the price was good.</li>
            <li> I was expecting them to be a little bigger and to stay on long but they are pretty small pencils. they can be fun to play around with but when I tried it for the first time it didn&#x27;t come on so clean. but hay I think at the same time you are getting what you paid for.</li>
            <li> These pencils are smaller them I thought they would be - great selection but thought it was more pencil then what&#x27;s there</li>
            <li> These were smaller than I thought but the color when applied is very pretty. I use them to stain my lips and outline my brows before I fill them in.</li>
            <li> Took about a month.... but very satisfied. I love the variety and for so little $$! Bright, true to color and waterproof... always a bonus. They are smaller pencils but no worries... will buy again when needed. thanks</li>
            <li> The pencils have really pretty colors. They are half the size of your standard eyeliner pencil. I have darker skin, and all the colors go on very well.</li>
            <li> Why do not you write the pencil length, size? What do you think would be the toy sized pencil. Low quality.</li>
            <li> they are tiny pencils but perfect for a makeup bag.. they have nice colours in the selection and they are able to fit in your pocket if needed, as long as you understand they are small you will be very happy with this product</li>
            <li> When I recieved these eyeliner pencils, I was pleasantly surprised, because I liked their size. They were compact in package, but big in performance! Thank you for such a fine product. Sincerely, Juanita Wilson...</li>
            <li> Much smaller than shown, and had to reorder, because the first ones never came, but all in all they are fine.</li>
            <li> Nice assortment of colors make it a great choice!! Easy to apply and remove.  Long lasting.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I were able to split the colors between both of us. We love the colors, ease of application and I was very pleased with the amount of Makeup and Eyebrow pencils that I received. I will definitely recommend them to others and I will be ordering some more in the future.</li>
            <li> colors dont show up pencils hard to sharpen took too long to arrive....threw away</li>
            <li> The colors don&#x27;t glide on and they are not easily seen.&lt;br /&gt;I find them poor quality and would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love it , it stay on the whole day .&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to redo my make up it amazing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this, thinking it would be these exact colors, it wasn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not at all happy with it. It also was labeled as a phone case.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff but ...they are smaller than the picture shows it to be but I still love them and they were cheap</li>
            <li> I got these pretty quick, I was told I would get them a month from when I ordered it and actually got it about 10 days after. I am pretty impressed with the quality, because they were so cheap but I did expect them to be bigger..</li>
            <li> too light and not as long lasting as I would like</li>
            <li> Excellent colors, my mom loved it</li>
            <li> pencils are too small.</li>
            <li> This are good for their price even tho they are really small like 2&amp;#34; inches long. They receive them in approximately 20 to 25 days.</li>
            <li> Received them today. December 10, 2012 thanks..they are small but for the price their worth having and buying and I would probably buy something similar again in the future.</li>
            <li> I used these as stocking stuffers so I cannot comment on the product themselves. They appeared very small and cheap.</li>
            <li> My daughter, who is 11, had fun playing with these but they are very low quality.</li>
            <li> They are ok, great for the pocket book, small and effective.Just not what im looking for</li>
            <li> was not happy with this product. they were mostly browns. i will not order this ever again</li>
            <li> Crap hated them they don&#x27;t even work they color on paper not on skin</li>
            <li> stiff when the pencil is cold but if you rub it on your hand and get it warmed up they work great</li>
            <li> The items were to short and uneven in length.  But beautiful colors, however,  I do give second chances, so in the near future I may order again. No, I really can&#x27;t say that if I  would recommend this product due to I did not use them.  Sorry, but they did offer me discount if I kept them.</li>
            <li> They look like big fat pencils online.  they are 2 inches long. Good colors, probably wont get much use.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> shipped quick. just as pictured.</li>
            <li> These pencils are super small and it took about 3 weeks before they were delivered.</li>
            <li> I gave these to my teenagers. The colors were comical as far as make up is concerned. It was cheap so I&#x27;m not going to complain too much.</li>
            <li> love the colors they definitely works with my eye color... Just what I needed to enhance my eyes!</li>
            <li> Too hard to apply on the eyelid. Very small -tiny pencil. Didn&#x27;t expect it to be so cheap. Never again.</li>
            <li> The pencils are so sharp that they cut my eyelid, and the color doesn&#x27;t even show up. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!</li>
            <li> There are 12 colors to use and it can be used for you eyes or lips and if you wanted you could use some colors for blush. I wish they were longer, but they work great, and an awesome gift.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this for a friend and buy this for myself when I am in need of more.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time! Too bad I got 2 silver instead of one silver and a gold. However, the blue is very nice and makes a nice accent for anyone&#x27;s eyes.</li>
            <li> They took almost took weeks to get here, but that&#x27;s okay, I guess. Anyways, they&#x27;re really small, about the size of my pinkie, but they go on well, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my sister, I thought they would be like fat pencils. Instead they are smaller than a child&#x27;s crayon. Not only are they EXTREMELY small, but the color payoff is not good and they are hard. The colored part is not soft or easy to apply at all. My sister ended up throwing them away. They were cheap, but it was still not work the money. I gave it two starts just because it came with so many. The could be used as a colored pencil, but for makeup they are definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> expected something larger in length and in diameter was a bit embarrassed sense it was given as a gift to a friend</li>
            <li> My Wife and Daughter lover the colors and the feeling of these eyeliner&#x27;s. The only negative thing they said was that they were to short. I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Not awful but have to go over and over to get the color to really show.</li>
            <li> Hope they soon come, so I can try my Mary kay sharpener.</li>
            <li> its very nice and glides on my eyes perfectly</li>
            <li> I must say this product wasnt right for me, But this company did go through hoops to see that i was a satisfied customer and did was EVER they had to do to see that i was COMPLETELY satisfied and if i found another item through them i wanted to try i WOULD order it because even if i was not satisifed i can rely 100 percent on the customer service and refund service. thank you for going through all the trouble to see that i was a satisfied customer &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> These pencils are wonderful to look at, but they won&#x27;t last very long.  As has been mentioned they&#x27;re only 2 inches long.  Hence, the price.  I knew it was too good to be true.  Still, I like the variety of colors so much that I will keep these and use them until they are down to the nub.</li>
            <li> They are very small. Use Daily for a week, and they&#x27;re gone or one turn of sharpening and they&#x27;re gone.. that&#x27;s how small they are.&lt;br /&gt;2 coats and you can see the color.. goes on pretty smoothly, and they arrived early. The colors are okay. I like this product, I do recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a while ago..although the size i f the pencils was small, that would not have been an issue if the quality was good..but these liners simply dont glide..not happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> They are small but they work as expected and the colors are interesting.</li>
            <li> these are cheap for a reason. lots of colors to pick from, but waxy and hard to use and don&#x27;t last long. for a child&#x27;s play makeup they would be fine, for an adult looking for a good value, keep looking</li>
            <li> they are okay they show but not that good very small and sharp</li>
            <li> they are only 1/3 size pencils and wear down very fast. work nice though</li>
            <li> I am happy with this order</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t go on nicely. Small. Garbage. It is just a huge waste of money. Don&#x27;t buy them. Save yourself.</li>
            <li> This did not show on the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;it rubbed off easily.&lt;br /&gt;this product is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;the colors were really bad.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a gift for a teenage girl that is just getting into makeup. She was thrilled with the variety of colors, and loves to point out her makeup to me whenever I see her.</li>
            <li> I really did not care for the cosmetic pencils. Does not stay on long and smears a lot.</li>
            <li> Love it&#x3D;)was fustrated at first cuz I thought it wasn&#x27;t guna come on time but it did so I love love love it&#x3D;D</li>
            <li> Colors I expected weren&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li> These people contacted me and made me feel like they truely cared about my business.They went out of their way to correct the problem I had and now I am waiting to get my product as promised.</li>
            <li> Can double for eyeshadow, adds pops of color, good quaility, worth the money. would recommend for anyone who&#x27;s colorful like me</li>
            <li> I got a different product which had mostly browns, not multiple colors</li>
            <li> great choice in colors ans texture blends very well ,,,,lots of my friends wanted dozens of these but you gave me such a hard time they dont want to deal ith you....s0 sorry...nice product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very surprised how nice these eyeliner pencils are for how little they cost! I highly recommend getting these. You get twelve of them and they all go on very nicely. Only a few of the colors need more than one coat, the rest are all highly pigmented and really pop. Most of them have a nice shimmer to them as well. They are about half the size of a normal eyeliner pencil, but it seems they will last a very long time to me. They are not hard like most eyeliners, they are very soft and go on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I hoped it&#x27;d be! The eyeliner is very easy to use and os great on the skin!</li>
            <li> These are beautiful colors and wear great. However, they are only about 2 inches tall. My daughter loves wearing them.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner does not stay on, it&#x27;s poor quality. I was asured this was a fluke and I was immediately refunded once I contacted the seller. The pencils are very small and not pigmented.</li>
            <li> When I received my eyeliner the package was broken on the side, but other then that everything was intact. I was a little disappointed to see how small they were. But that is my fault for overseeing that detail and depending on the pictures provided.  The colors are great and stayed on well without risk of accidentally rubbing it off.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THE EYELINERS TODAY, NOT PLEASED AT ALL. THERE ARE NO PINKS WHATSOEVER..I HAVE 7 BROWNS , 2 BLUES, AN COUPLE OF OLIVES AND A COPPER COLOR. VERY SMALL IN SIZE. ITS NOT WORTH THE MONEY NOR THE WAIT. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks for being nice and helpful</li>
            <li> Got these for my daughter and she just loved them. Great colors can switch off with all her outfits. Still using daily!! They do not run and are long lasting. What a great gift idea and great price!!!</li>
            <li> Happy I pay little money for it I hate hate it so much I would never pay it again. Never</li>
            <li> For $3.54 how can you seriously complain ?&lt;br /&gt;You get 12 of them, the pigment is good &amp;&amp; they last a lot longer then some liners !&lt;br /&gt;I personally recommend the product.&lt;br /&gt;I use them on my lips, eyes, brows, etc.&lt;br /&gt;you get your money&#x27;s worth and then some !</li>
            <li> these are going to be so super fun...there are lots of colors adn cant wait to use it for makeup at halloween</li>
            <li> THIS LOOKS LIKE WHAT YOU WOULD PAINT A COLORING BOOK WITH. A BABY BOOK. BECAUSE EVEN CRAYONS ARE BETTER THAN THIS.</li>
            <li> Small and not creamy at all. When I use it for the first time it did stay on long after the lipstick but it jut looks weird.</li>
            <li> for a little as they are they put out a nice color. we have a beauty school so these worked great for the price.</li>
            <li> I do love them, they have the best quality. But they are VERY tiny pencils. That&#x27;s the only thing I dislike about them.</li>
            <li> Does not work on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and I wasn&#x27;t irritated by this product. I got the product before the estimated date and I was so happy.</li>
            <li> Era lo q esperaba, colores reales que resaltan el maquillaje, no dudaría en volver a comprarlos, sin duda recomendados, ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to get them I know there probably small but omg they look so pretty and the other comment make me want them more:D</li>
            <li> These pencils are of great quality. They are waterproof and can be used for both lips and eyes. Great collection for the price. I was disappointed that instead of the gold and silver colors shown, I received two orange liners instead. I have no use for orange let alone two. This is perfect for those who want to experiment with different looks.</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are awesome. Love them a lot. Work very well, only complaint is that I wish they were longer.</li>
            <li> You have to coat the line of your eye to many times to even see it.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was larger then they appeared . This are small pencils . I thought they were alot larger</li>
            <li> These are very hard and need to be warmed before use.</li>
            <li> I am very please with this product.  I am a medium brown shade with sensitive skin and the colors showed up without any skin irritation. Excellent product from an excellent company. ...&amp;#34;So happy! &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic value for the price! The pencils are very small yeah, only a few inches long and as thin as a regular pencil, but they last longer than you&#x27;d expect and don&#x27;t have to be sharpened much. The product itself is nicely pigmented and the perfect balance being being too soft and rubbing anywhere and everywhere to being too hard and making it feel like your poking at your eye. The range of colors is really nice and the pencils being small means that if you have a color you don&#x27;t really like you wont feel as bad just not using it since its not as much of a waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A con I&#x27;ve noticed, at least in mine if that I have two pencils that look like they&#x27;re the same color...that is, the wood part itself is painted with the same color, but they aren&#x27;t. One is a dark magenta like color and another is a medium brown. Both are pictured in the attached pictures(my eyebrows are a gradient of Black-&amp;#62;The medium brown-&amp;#62; The darkish Magenta color)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the makeup in the attached picture is from the pack I got. The only color I don&#x27;t really like from my pack is my silver, which just plain doesn&#x27;t really show up much. But honestly, I cant tell if that&#x27;s because the product itself is incredibly sheer, or because I&#x27;m just too dang pale. Might work a lot nicer of dark skin.(also a picture of swatches)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But yeah, to sum things up, this is a GREAT pack to get for only TWO dollars and free shipping. Pigmentation if great, firmness of the makeup is good, easy to blend, good range of colors, doesn&#x27;t rub off extremely easily.... the only big issue I have is the two pencils that look the same but even that I can solve by swatching them on my hand first. Absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the colors in the pictures they were more or less all brown with two different blues.</li>
            <li> These were ok. I was expecting long pencils, they were short and skinny. But not bad for the price I guess.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty, and they go on well after you warm them up a bit. The downfall is the size and color variety. Some of them came fully sharpened, while others seemed to be dull and shorter that the others.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any red or pink colors, just a couple of blue/purple and green, and the rest were dark brown, like 5 of them. I think I&#x27;m just going to go to the drugstore and get a few 88 cent eyeliner pencils.</li>
            <li> very small and low quality&lt;br /&gt;poor quality&lt;br /&gt;different what you see&lt;br /&gt;no good&lt;br /&gt;is for children&lt;br /&gt;looks like a toy</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with this product first off its very small but that is not even the real problem which is its hard an proves difficult to apply properly in that its not going onto my eyes when I try lining my waterline or lid</li>
            <li> The colors are great it goes on well and the colors are bright and vibrant! It goes on clean and doesn&#x27;t smudge. It shipped super fast and on time.</li>
            <li> Love how it showed up&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth it^.^&lt;br /&gt;and thought how cute it came in its little box&lt;br /&gt;It was just adorable:)</li>
            <li> They were not what I expected!</li>
            <li> smaller then expected. Arrived in 17 days.</li>
            <li> It is tinyer than I expecteted and not that pigmented it&#x27;s okay since it was cheep you will need to warm it up some wear first or it will hurt</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! Must try! Beautiful colors that last all day!!</li>
            <li> You have to kinda heat it up to use it easily, and there were no pinks when I got it only lots of browns,but will probably buy it again</li>
