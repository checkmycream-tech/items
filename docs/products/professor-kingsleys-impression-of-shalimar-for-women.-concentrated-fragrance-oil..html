            <li> Love original Shalimar fragrance, but it is not easy to find and doesn&#x27;t come cheap. This is such a close match. Love it.</li>
            <li> Good value for price but could be stronger and last longer.</li>
            <li> Love Shalimar perfume but this oil is so much better....last all day and into the night can still smell it before my shower.... Thank you Kingsley&#x27;s Oils</li>
            <li> Never had the real Shalimar so I can&#x27;t compare the two however this fragrance oil is very weak could barley smell anything</li>
            <li> This is very close to the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; which I have worn for years. Great size for my purse. I will buy more.  This seller really knows how to package!!!</li>
            <li> I love the scent, but not really pleased with its ability to linger and last.  I would say about 4 to 6 hours, and you have to be generous with the roll on.  I&#x27;m not familiar with real Shalimar, but know it is a chypre scent,&lt;br /&gt;and I like those.  I was pleased with this scent, but got no compliments, wondered if anybody really noticed it.</li>

            <li> I was happily surprised when I received Shalimar Perfume Oil.  It&#x27;s fragrance captures the essence of the original Shalimar, which is much more expensive and which I, for one, can&#x27;t afford.  However, when I looked for it again at the Kingsley&#x27;s Oils website, I could only find Shalimar in a spray, and I was disappointed.  I would have liked to have sent it to a friend.  I much prefer the oil because I think it lasts longer.  So, I picked another fragrance.  Please continue to make Shalimar in a perfume oil.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Better then I expected!!! Smells just like the original and has great staying power!!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I am having a great experience with Shalimar type for women. The scent is very similar to Shalimar original, if not, identical! Long lasting scent. It is just beautiful, sensual. When I put it on it lifts my spirits , a most delicious scent indeed. I recommend Kingsley&#x27;s Oils. Delivery was excellent, two days. :)&amp;#34; Thank you.</li>
            <li> Smells like the real thing.  I&#x27;ve been using Shalimar for years and this is as close as you can come to the real thing.</li>
            <li> Got impression from the product description that this would smell like shalimar, but it doesn&#x27;t. I should have realized, imposter fragrances never smell the same as the originals.</li>
            <li> not bad and a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love this in the roll one bottle. Its smells wonderful and last for hours and smellsl close to Shalimar.</li>
