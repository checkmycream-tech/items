            <li>also use it for my legs, they feel nice.</li>
            <li>am now trying this on a couple of brown spots to see if it&#x27;s effective for removing those, as I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li>She was satisfied, and since then has put it to good  use (have not heard yet any complaints).</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s castor oil and will come in handy in soap making.</li>
            <li>This brand is awesome and very cost effective</li>
            <li>I made my own twisting cream with it and the castor oil</li>
            <li>I bought this to make my own face wash with castor oil/olive oil.  </li>
            <li>and I mix my own hair products</li>
            <li>If you do any kind of working out</li>
            <li>However, this is probably no fault of the product but perhaps my own hair.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and excellent product.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice smell to it when it leaves the muffler.</li>
            <li>This particular kind works the best.</li>

            <li>Thanks for all the good tips you&#x27;ve all posted on this castor Oil Product.</li>
            <li>great price, super fast shipping</li>
            <li>/&gt;Castor Oil has a legendary reputation to be a potent detox, if you are not familiar with the Gerson Therapy you should read the book</li>
            <li>I use it to wrap sprains, cracked heels, massage into hair and full castor oil bath (please use caution and educate yourself on castor oil baths before trying!).</li>
            <li>from time to time to make sure my body is clean, inside out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and it had good reviews as well as a decent price</li>
            <li>It does have a bit of an odor, but it isn&#x27;t terribly strong.</li>
            <li>I use it for hair growth and to thicken my hair, so far so good, i do not care for the smell though :)</li>
            <li>Now I can see why so many natural product sites include discussion of the benefits of a good castor oil.</li>
            <li>If you find yourself getting bumps on your scalp, undiluted may be too strong for you.  </li>
            <li>Great on the age spots and general massage.</li>
            <li>Used to make soap for the first time - really liked this product.</li>
            <li>Caster Oil is an important ingredient for making soap because caster oil is one of the major ingredients which cause a great lather.  </li>
            <li>and it smells just fine</li>
            <li>I did dilute it with grapeseed adding beeswax and the resulting salve was smooth, soothing, and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worked fine for getting rid of moles,</li>
            <li>The product was fine, it just did not get rid of the ground moles in my yard.</li>
            <li>the product was fine...</li>
            <li>the results have been tremendous!</li>
            <li>I cannot find much online about moldy castor oil, but sure don&#x27;t plan on using it any longer!  </li>
            <li>This is a very high quality product, and in my opinion, much better quality than many of the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; brands out there.  </li>
            <li>HUGE bottle.</li>
            <li>Its huge for the price</li>
            <li>I have been applying it to my eyelashes to help them grow, but haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I saw some reviews that said the bottle was damaged and leaking, but I guess the company must have fixed the problem because mine came well wrapped and in perfect condition, one day early.</li>
            <li>huge bottle</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s in a HUGE bottle...</li>
            <li>If you are stressed out and can&#x27;t sleep using one of these as a heat pack is fantastic.</li>
            <li>great product to be regularly stocked at home</li>
            <li>it also smooth out your hear.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>I mix it with coconut oil to smooth is out and put it on my head for a while and its been mking my hair</li>
            <li>I decided to make some salve for Christmas, which is the primary reason why I opted to look for castor oil, I found Heritage Caster Oil</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whenever I use the salve it leaves my skin nicely supple but isn&#x27;t greasy in any way, just remember not to glob it on since it is very viscous (like molasses type of viscous).</li>
            <li>I added it to some jojoba oil and grapeseed oil I had around, castor oil being the primary oil for my skin type so</li>
            <li>If you decide to use this cleansing method castor oil does wonders, and I&#x27;d recommend using castor oil as the primary oil with a carrier.</li>
            <li>I found it to be too toxic for my back pain, but great for my feet in combination w/heat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly cheap.  </li>
            <li>Works great when mixed with coconut oil for a hair oil treatment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;According to researchers studying the light reflected from hair samples, castor oil hair treatments were found to increase the luster of hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a fabulous lip gloss.  </li>
            <li>I did the Oil cleansing method for about two weeks with olive oil only and my skin felt great,</li>
            <li>Please do not ask about quantities for the mask, try it once and adjust the quantities as you see fit, it all depends of the length of your hair.</li>
            <li>This works better for my hair than JBCO, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>and my twists have stayed put, are shiny, and feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>it at the end of your shower with a light rinse before turning off the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>but now they are really filled in</li>
            <li>I use this to wash my face with (the oil cleaning method) and mixing this with jojoba and tea tree oil is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Great big bottle of Castor oil in all of its glory.</li>
            <li>Castor oil is absorbed into the skin leaving it looking and feeling more youthful.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>but it does make my lips soft and surprisingly doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>Thus far good results.</li>
            <li>My hair retains length so much better, and this made my hair much stronger.this definitely​ deserve more than 5 stars</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted, a high quality castor oil to use in my mixes in a large quantity and at a great price.</li>
            <li>Smells very fresh.</li>
            <li>This oil is very useful.</li>
            <li>I prefer the cleanest stuff when it comes to my mixtures, and this definitely is clean, I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Fairly priced and seems like a genuine product based on (1) the results I experienced and (2) in comparison to my earlier castor oil of different brand.</li>
            <li>this brand happens to be the most pure and economical i have found...and i have found many.</li>
            <li>I love castor oil so much!</li>
            <li>Many thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why it works, but I am very happy that it does.  </li>

            <li>Use this product combined with safflower oil to clean my face every night.</li>
            <li>I chose to buy Heritage Store Castor oil (32 ounce) because I had read many positive reviews for this brand specifically.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth and high quality oil!</li>
            <li>Price is very important because I want to offer my customers a quality soap for a reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noted that the one large one on my arm that I&#x27;ve been applying this oil too for a couple of months, most nights has faded quite a bit already.</li>
            <li>, this is the right brand and product for you!</li>

            <li>She said that its helping her a whole lot better then the pain pills.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair so soft and nice.</li>
            <li>Even though it didn&#x27;t help with hair loss as much as rosemary did, it helps cleanse my scalp better when I apply it for an hour before shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was old and out of date, but the label indicated it was good to 2015.</li>
            <li>But lucky that the bottle did not broke.</li>

            <li>but well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love it so far.</li>
            <li>I ordered the empty mascara bottles which are a perfect purchase if you intend to use this for the same thing.</li>
            <li>but so far I love it.</li>
            <li>It was well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I make my own soap sometimes, I added the castor oil the last time I made some</li>
            <li>Big bottle for a nice price.</li>
            <li>worth it.</li>
            <li>its purity makes it worth drop by drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and afterwards I use a warm washcloth on my face to open up my pores.</li>
            <li>However, more frequent use than this can result in an oily scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now they feel much better and are soft, it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
            <li>This item came right on time Fast !!</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure that, soon, I will experience some new hair growth too.</li>
            <li>I recommend Heritage to anyone who wants a honest product for a decent price and especially for those who love Edgar Cayce remedies that are made specifically like Edgar had specified for them to be made.</li>
            <li>know there are many other uses for this magical stuff, but I haven&#x27;t tried them yet..</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m sure there are many other uses that I haven&#x27;t discovered yet.</li>
            <li>This came pretty quick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Castor oil is a popular ingredient in hair products formulated for highly textured hair because it is known for its ability to seal moisture in the hair, combatting the natural dryness of these hair types.</li>

            <li>I was so happy to finally get my bushy eyebrows back and able to get them threaded professionally.</li>
            <li>After buying some jojoba oil as a carrier, I decided to try my own method out of fear that this new method would backfire as it has done with many other users.</li>
            <li>I had someone tell me that castor oil works great for permed black hair; It makes my hair very managable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the few things that&#x27;s versatile, effective and cheap all in one.​</li>
            <li>Ive been very lucky to not have had a reaction so far.</li>
            <li>I add a little bit of Castor Oil into my home made soaps, and the oil has good lathering qualities.  </li>
            <li>I live in very rural area and am glad I can order it!</li>
            <li>As presented ~ no  issues, Thanks!</li>
            <li>SO MUCH OIL!</li>
            <li>First day of using.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years having encountered it at the Heritage Store in Virginia Beach, VA white attending a conference at</li>
            <li>This oil is most often used to moisten the wool flannel used in the Castor Oil Pack recommended by the aforementioned readings.</li>
            <li>I use it in many different capacities</li>
            <li>I highly recomend it !!</li>
            <li>When I first purchased this product I bought it in an 8oz.</li>
            <li>This works for everything, hair growth, first aid, must have.</li>
            <li>Thanks ohvaleriemoncherie!</li>
            <li>It sells for much higher in the health food stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought the larger size.</li>
            <li>It is sticky but soaks in pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The benefits from the castor oil packs, and hair are more than enough.</li>
            <li>However, mine came shipped in a box, and then in a big plastic baggie, and then there was a piece of tape across the top of it.</li>
            <li>so chose to buy this brand for my first venture into castor oil.</li>
            <li>I first learnt about the healing power of castor oil reading a yoga book.</li>
            <li>I recommend castor oil massages for any inflammation/muscles/ligaments/bodily pain, it really works!</li>
            <li>I tried this and the body will glow, and will feel much more open, with any stiffness gone away!</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>and then I make my washcloth wet with warm water and place it over my face to open up my pores even more</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used Castor Oil.  </li>
            <li>I use castor oil for many things - soap making, deep oil cleansing, eyelash and eyebrow treatment.</li>
            <li>Most definitely a holy grail item!</li>
            <li>In addition to healing benefits, castor oil also contains anti-inflammatory properties, all of which are related to healthy hair growth.</li>
            <li>The shipping is fast!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li>I used it for hot castor oil packs on my bladder and it worked.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Seems kinda funny since it&#x27;s an oil</li>
            <li>and it is more than enough.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to using it as a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>Very versatile product!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Heritage Store brand is pretty good, and a few batches in, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>I also use it in hot oil treatments (as a pre-poo).</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>just a note: these are only two of the many things i use this castor oil for.</li>
            <li>I see many traditional remedies and online home remedy forums recommending putting castor oil drops into your eyes-- do not.  </li>
            <li>After soaking in a hot bath, I apply it all over my body.</li>
            <li>nothing but good things to say, amazing how such a simple substance taken externally can assist the body so much.  </li>
            <li>I was very unsure if it would be worth the money.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>Bottle is very thin and week, that&#x27;s why 4 stars, otherwise an excellent product.</li>
            <li>I put the castor oil directly onto my skin over the scar, cover with an old towel, and place a heating pad on top, which I leave in place for 20 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the few things that&#x27;s versatile, effective and cheap all in one.​r face regimens for anyone who is looking at natural solutions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found my recovery time to be much quicker when used with either cotten or wool flannel accompanied by heat (either a heating pad or hot water bottle).</li>
            <li>I bought the 32 oz bottle because it&#x27;s roughly how much I needed, and it arrived nicely packaged and secured, which I appreciated.</li>
            <li>The product was high quality and the price was right.</li>
            <li>Even though I don&#x27;t henna anymore, the oil somehow seems to make my henna more red and vibrant after shampooing it out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that I can save it and keep using it down the road, though.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve hired a mole hunter, in the past, but the cost is just too high, successful as he was.  </li>
            <li>it for increasing density of eyelashes, Edgar Cayce&#x27;s castor oil packs, itching and/or dry skin and many others. . .</li>
            <li>This is a great price for being natural - way cheaper than the small bottles you buy in the store.  </li>
            <li>most recommend for moisturizing, some recommend it for overly oily skin since it will dry you out.</li>
            <li>It arrived with a large crack along the side that had dripped out a quite a bit of oil.  </li>
            <li>This is a large bottle of Castor oil.  </li>
            <li>It is a large size for the price.</li>
            <li>Wonderfully pure product.</li>
            <li>but when I started using it externally at night, rubbing on my stomach and in my navel, putting a towel and a hot pad on top until the oil was fully absorbed the next morning</li>
            <li>The castor oil is fine, but the bottle wasn&#x27;t sealed well enough and it leaked during shipping.</li>
            <li>I massage it with an old mascara brush on my eyebrows and after about 3 weeks or a little more they have filled it amazingly and are a little darker.</li>
            <li>Castor oil is also good for hard to deal with skin priblems.</li>
            <li>Huge Bottle will last awhile</li>
            <li>I buy mine at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sticky.</li>
            <li>It make my hair grow fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and my hair is so much softer.</li>
            <li>So can I say how FAST the shipping is</li>
            <li>I ordered this product from Vitacost on 3rd April and received on 7th April in secure packaging.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but it really does work.</li>
            <li>I use it for my hair and lashes and I am amazed at how much fuller and longer my lashes have gotten.</li>
            <li>Thanks for your business &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I really do not have 15 more words to say about this</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very nature</li>
            <li>I use it to wash my face (this and hemp oil - castor oil can be very drying by itself).  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This product really helped with our mole problem.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I am getting ready to order again for myself</li>
            <li>Always works and fast too</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it very soothing for foot rubs.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I applied it liberally, and once I was done - combed it gently through my hair.</li>
            <li>Very goog quality oil.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Very versatile</li>
            <li>My hair looks much healthier.</li>
            <li>I have very acne prone/dry skin</li>
            <li>Using this in combination with Jojoba Oil really has been the answer for my oily skin.</li>
            <li>The oil is meeting all my expectations, me and my husband are very please with this product.</li>
            <li>It works fast as well.</li>
            <li>Worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>Plus it lasted a whole year.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the Heritage Castor Oil!</li>
            <li>The product is more than expected.</li>
            <li>You can really feel it working.</li>
            <li>Walgreens wants nearly&lt;br /&gt;$6.00 for 4 oz.  </li>
            <li>It came wrapped up very well where it would not have a chance of spilling.  </li>
            <li>Not too much, or you&#x27;ll have a very gooey mixture.  </li>
            <li>this one is any thing oil very goog</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell.</li>

            <li>A+ thank you so much i have been looking for this in the storesand it got here</li>
            <li>realy FAST 😄</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>Anticipate a fast removal of spots.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It is quite a heavy oil, it&#x27;s very sticky and does not glide very easily across the skin.</li>
            <li>Many other uses.</li>
            <li>I wish I could really put my heart in this and say more wonderful news but having a cracked bottle and someone on the other end still decided to ship it pretty puts a bad taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased an 8-oz. bottle and it was not enough for my castor oil packs.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t overpay with some of those other oils that say they are better for hair.  </li>
            <li>The item was packaged very tight in a plastic bag and arrived in a nice box.  </li>
            <li>Too Much to say about this Particular Brand of Castor Oil....</li>
            <li>My skin is super soft, it helped clear blemishes, AND works FANTASTICALLY as a makeup remover.</li>
            <li>THE FIRST TIME I RECEIVED THIS CASTOR OIL, THE OIL WAS CLEAR LIKE SPRING WATER.</li>
            <li>If I simply used other oils w/o adding Castor Oil, my skin was much more soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>Use castor oil for hot oil treatments and scalp massages to stimulate hair growth and keep your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Use castor oil for hot oil treatments and scalp massages to stimulate hair growth and keep your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>have very dry skin that really helps n smooth my skin</li>
            <li>Brand New!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like I have all new skin!</li>
            <li>It gives my hair strength- less breakage and fallout, with more shine.  </li>
            <li>The stickiness is particular o ALL</li>
            <li>castor oils and not just with this particular brand.</li>
            <li>I added the oil into a hair mask for a deep conditioning and it worked better then when I use olive oil (or whatever) only, and for the OCM</li>
            <li>I soak the flannel in the oil, put the flannel next to where the healing is to be done, I cover the flannel with plastic and I use a heating pad set on low on top of the oil soaked flannel and plastic.</li>
            <li>Castor oil packs speed healing for many medical conditions as colds and bronchitis , menstrual cramps, urinary infections, anything internal.</li>
            <li>My combination skin has normalized, complexion is more even, and I&#x27;m using a little of the straight Castor oil around my eyes a few times a week and the fine lines around my eyes are minimized!</li>
            <li>and you have a steady energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am really upset, I usually do not leave comments but this time I got to do it</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this brand.</li>
            <li>I highly doubt the reviews are even legit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We almost purchased a product advertised to get rid of the moles, but the cost was just too high, until I looked at the components of the product.  </li>
            <li>Heritage Store is well known for their high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On time and high quality.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and you want high quality without having to pay obscene amounts</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li>, the only thing I would put on my face as a moisturizer was 99% pure aloe vera gel, twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;So, after my face cleared up I decided to use the rest of that big bottle of castor oil on my hair, figured out that it&#x27;s fine since I&#x27;m not using it on my face</li>
            <li>I love to mix a little of this, in my hand, with my leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>what is there to say this is cold pressed and very good.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I read in a review that it had a very mild smell compared to other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didint&#x27;t blame the castor oil at first, I thought it was the Oil cleansing method, that my skin reacted in general to the oils I was using on it.</li>
            <li>Really helps lock in the moisture and keeps it soft.</li>
            <li>Enough that it probably isn&#x27;t worth the hassle of trying to return it.  </li>
            <li>level came normal.</li>
            <li>Use it for moisturizing by adding  a drop to your normal cream or lotion.  </li>
            <li>antifungal and antibacterial properties in castor oil are useful in combating scalp infections, such as follliculitus, ringworm and peidra.</li>
            <li>I started noticing a difference after only 2 heated applications (much sooner than I thought), and have been experiencing much better results than I expected.</li>
            <li>This oil is nice and thick and she seems to like it.</li>
            <li>It absorbs better than other oils yet the moisture has major staying power.</li>
            <li>Now, who, in their right mind, would purchase an item at three times the price of Castor Oil for the same item?  </li>
            <li>but I do believe it leaves the hair a little more soft.</li>
            <li>I am unsure if it is this product or the new techniques I am doing to my hair that is making my hair grow.</li>
            <li>I live my castor oil</li>
            <li>Ive seen some new lashes start to sprout.</li>
            <li>I can see a difference in thickness and some new hairs growing.</li>
            <li>I live this oil</li>
            <li>wanna live forever...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much time for other issues but I will be ordering more in the near future if that helps to clarify what I think of this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m black and going natural using this in my products keeps my growing afro soft and spongy:)</li>
            <li>I received the product the next day after I purchased it and for the 32 oz is pretty cheap compare to other castor oil.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft as well.</li>
            <li>However, the results are certainly worth the minor discomfort.</li>
            <li>You may purchase a small book titled &amp;#34;The Secrets of the Palma Christy Oil&amp;#34; if you need more information on the uses of castor oil.</li>
            <li>This oil has so many uses it&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend uses this for making makeup, hair conditioners and many other health and beauty related products.</li>
            <li>Natural hair chick here!</li>
            <li>Due to the extended weave wearing and braiding, my edges had thinned out significantly.</li>
            <li>Working well so far for oil washes!</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered this product I only got the 8 oz sized bottle.</li>
            <li>I had to go back to my Grandmother&#x27;s old ways, it will never fail you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and as expected.  </li>
            <li>This is the ONLY thing that works, and works consistently and naturally.  </li>
            <li>I stay up &#x27;till the wee hours, trying to catch them at their deeds, but no matter how much sleep I lose, they always manage to tear up my new lawn, when I go back to sleep.</li>
            <li>so I had no regrets about buying this particular oil.</li>
            <li>Now I have to find another bottle large enough to transfer its contents to.</li>
            <li>I use castor oil all the time, it&#x27;s the only thing that get my feet totally soft, yes i use it for other things but as a nurse (ie on my feet 12+ hours a day) and social dancing most nights</li>
            <li>It seals in the moisture and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>but I am still alive so it did not hurt.</li>
            <li>now they are shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I also use it in my hair to seal in moisture/ bring in moisture, and it makes it soft</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It is soothing, absorbes into the skin, natural and no residue.  </li>
            <li>Wow I received this product about a month ago and let me tell you this has help me with my oily acne prone skin</li>
            <li>and wow my t zone is not oily at all anymore</li>
            <li>It completely went away.</li>
            <li>(Over stretched them badly in my first yoga year</li>
            <li>it will be completely gone.</li>
            <li>This is a big 32-oz bottle at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>They (or it, as they are very solitary beasts) have all but destroyed our yard for the last two years.  </li>
            <li>I use a bit on my face at night and it makes my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully will disappear completely.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>but I think I will purchase my old brand instead of this.</li>
            <li>My adult acne is fading away, including the scars.  </li>
            <li>I have had this bottle for about 7 months and am no where near running out.  </li>
            <li>this not only made mine grow but very brittle.</li>
            <li>maybe this just makes em too sensitive??</li>
            <li>The quality of the caster oil used has a direct effect on the quality of soap which results.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and silky....</li>
            <li>I get lots of compliments on how soft my hands are and my boyfriends just loves how soft I feel.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
            <li>So far this seems to work for me.</li>
            <li>Please keep this basic property of castor oil in mind, and be very cautious.    </li>
            <li>I use this to make homemade all natural shampoo bars.  </li>
            <li>I mix it with sunflower oi, and so far I like the results.</li>
            <li>A few drops in your bath water will leave your skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;really surprised when i tell them its castor oil</li>
            <li>My newest staple in my natural hair care routine is castor oil.</li>
            <li>I use it to make my natural hair products</li>
            <li>Use this for skin, hair, eyebrows and long eyelashes; an occasional teaspoon full in juice to detox.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very rich and thick</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American with VERY thick hair and this oil is amazing for hot oil treatments and scalp massages.</li>
            <li>So much length that I felt the need to get out my old curler( have not used for so long bc</li>
            <li>I have previously bought the same item (just smaller size), and have used it in many ways.</li>
            <li>Especially for hot oil treatments and deep conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li>I have eliminated cleanser, exfoliated, toner, moisturizer, lip cream, and eye cream (I am in the beauty industry and am a complete product junkie, so this is major).</li>
            <li>This one is high quality, and though I purchased for my hair, it can see that it would benefit my skin, foot and internal care as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also perfect for dry skin, sore muscles, or painful joints.</li>
            <li>I have straight, bleached, long hair with henna on it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s somewhat too heavy for the face, so I cut it with sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very thick oil, so a little goes a long way, but my hair feels very well nourished and my scalp feels great.  </li>
            <li>As a way to keep in moisture right out of the shower (I added essential oils to make it smell good, although without a scent it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but I get noodle from it.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes dry skin very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, however, I just want anyone interested in oil healing to know this oil is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I added few drops of rosemary essential oil and it smells fabulous.</li>
            <li>A bottle a third of the size costs the same at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>Stronger odor and a little more sticky then other brands I have tried</li>
            <li>I did this every night before going to bed for only 7 days untill the pain completely disappeared!</li>
            <li>After 2-1/2 years of pain, in only 7 days with castor oil it completely went away!</li>
            <li>Infections and scalp disorders are major causes of hair loss.</li>
            <li>But it is definitely an aggravation, and it may be worth looking at some of the other brands for sale on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very thick and sticky though so make sure you mix it with another type of oil.</li>
            <li>so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  </li>
            <li>I am yet to see any permanent positive effects on my skin however, because if I don&#x27;t use it for 2+ days my hands get dry and turn white.</li>
            <li>I also use this on my skin to moisturize in general</li>
            <li>All the castor oils I purchased before were clear, except for this bottle, it was yellow.  </li>
            <li>But since I&#x27;ve started using castor oil on my skin to wash my face, I barely have any issues.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to be added to hair or face regimens for anyone who is looking at natural solutions.</li>
            <li>I do believe in natural cures when possible.  </li>
            <li>As for the actual oil, it makes my skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing weaves and braids for years to avoid my hair and recently starting working with my hair in its natural state.</li>
            <li>I purchased it to make my eyebrows thicker and grow more because they are thin from plucking and waxing.</li>
            <li>sure enough, not only is there grey mold in it, but black globs of mold, too!  </li>
            <li>I use it as a hot ol treatment for my hair every other week!</li>
            <li>If not, I can live with it as long as I have the Heritage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very tactile person and can be a little over sensitive to whatever is on my fingers and hands</li>
            <li>you have a pimple or any other skin issue, it really helps.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Castor oil is the commonly used lipophilic vector but has been shown to be cytotoxic.\\&quot;  From \\&quot;Results\\&quot;: \\&quot;castor oil was shown to induce significant necrosis\\&quot;   \\&quot;Conclusion\\&quot;: \\&quot;The results demonstrated that castor oil exerts cytotoxic effects on conjunctival cells.</li>
            <li>Rich &amp; thick.</li>
            <li>Thick and rich in quality.</li>
            <li>Months later after my last henna application, my hair is still retains its vibrant and deep red.</li>
            <li>Yes, because its packaging fails to include a caveat against this (popular) usage, and says only \\&quot;massage into any area.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>A little background first</li>
            <li>I had breast cancer and underwent extensive major surgery, and as a consequence,  I suffer from pain every day of my life.&lt;br /&gt;Before taking a bath each night</li>
            <li>EVERYTHING I EXPECTED IT TO BE...VERY HIGH QUALITY.</li>
            <li>I have been natural for a long time.</li>
            <li>I use it on castor oil packs for my surgical scar everyday, and my husband and I have noticed that the scar is healing much faster!</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and also live in the driest state of all --- Nevada.</li>
            <li>This 32 oz bottle of pure castor oil was less than $13.00 with the shipping.  </li>
            <li>I trimmed in the first week on February to just above my bra line and now 3 and half months later my hair is 3, almost 4 inches longer.</li>
            <li>After dance class, I will put a big glob of this stuff on my heels and some big thick socks on and after a few hours, my feet are so nice and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is what I do, night time only (I bought some plastic shower caps first): I combine organic honey, castor oil, pure cold pressed olive oil and 1 egg yolk, stir everything well using a wooden spoon until it becomes somewhat of a paste then apply it first on my scalp, massaging well.</li>
            <li>My hair is no longer dry, and it leaves it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I put this on every night for the past 2 months and wow my eyelashes are so much longer</li>
            <li>In reality less than a tablespoon of oil had leaked and I felt they really did try to package it as soundly as possible.</li>
            <li>Not familiar with this seller but recently purchased this brand at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>After taking this, a few hours later and an entire role of toilet paper, he was back to his normal maniacal 8yr old self.&lt;br</li>

            <li> And the value on this product is great, it is HUGE.</li>
            <li> This oil does amazing things for the skin.</li>
            <li> It was amazing.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> So amazing on holding curl patterns.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use in my own oil cleansing method.</li>
            <li> Packaged nicely and did not leak all over the box.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I haven&#x27;t used this product as often to say it does or doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The castor oil was a lot more viscous I had anticipated, but I noticed how good my hands were feeling while I was making the salve</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy on my journey to more eyebrow growth:)</li>
            <li> also use it for my legs, they feel nice.</li>
            <li> am now trying this on a couple of brown spots to see if it&#x27;s effective for removing those, as I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li> She was satisfied, and since then has put it to good  use (have not heard yet any complaints).</li>
            <li> Decided to do some research on my own, came across castor oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s castor oil and will come in handy in soap making.</li>
            <li> This brand is awesome and very cost effective</li>
            <li> I made my own twisting cream with it and the castor oil</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own face wash with castor oil/olive oil.  </li>
            <li> and I mix my own hair products</li>
            <li> If you do any kind of working out</li>
            <li> However, this is probably no fault of the product but perhaps my own hair.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and excellent product.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice smell to it when it leaves the muffler.</li>
            <li> This particular kind works the best.</li>
            <li> This Brand in particular is the BEST</li>
            <li> This is one of the best price you can get on high quality castor oil.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Although castor oil is a miracle product for so many reasons, I bought it mostly for nurturing my hair-----and boy does it!</li>
            <li> I think it is a great product for a awesome price compared to Baar Products who over price their products due to The Edgar Cayce name.  </li>

            <li> Thanks for all the good tips you&#x27;ve all posted on this castor Oil Product.</li>
            <li> great price, super fast shipping</li>
            <li> /&gt;Castor Oil has a legendary reputation to be a potent detox, if you are not familiar with the Gerson Therapy you should read the book</li>
            <li> I use it to wrap sprains, cracked heels, massage into hair and full castor oil bath (please use caution and educate yourself on castor oil baths before trying!).</li>
            <li> from time to time to make sure my body is clean, inside out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li> and it had good reviews as well as a decent price</li>
            <li> It does have a bit of an odor, but it isn&#x27;t terribly strong.</li>
            <li> I use it for hair growth and to thicken my hair, so far so good, i do not care for the smell though :)</li>
            <li> Now I can see why so many natural product sites include discussion of the benefits of a good castor oil.</li>
            <li> If you find yourself getting bumps on your scalp, undiluted may be too strong for you.  </li>
            <li> Great on the age spots and general massage.</li>
            <li> Used to make soap for the first time - really liked this product.</li>
            <li> Caster Oil is an important ingredient for making soap because caster oil is one of the major ingredients which cause a great lather.  </li>
            <li> and it smells just fine</li>
            <li> I did dilute it with grapeseed adding beeswax and the resulting salve was smooth, soothing, and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worked fine for getting rid of moles,</li>
            <li> The product was fine, it just did not get rid of the ground moles in my yard.</li>
            <li> the product was fine...</li>
            <li> the results have been tremendous!</li>
            <li> I cannot find much online about moldy castor oil, but sure don&#x27;t plan on using it any longer!  </li>
            <li> This is a very high quality product, and in my opinion, much better quality than many of the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; brands out there.  </li>
            <li> HUGE bottle.</li>
            <li> Its huge for the price</li>
            <li> I have been applying it to my eyelashes to help them grow, but haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I saw some reviews that said the bottle was damaged and leaking, but I guess the company must have fixed the problem because mine came well wrapped and in perfect condition, one day early.</li>
            <li> huge bottle</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s in a HUGE bottle...</li>
            <li> If you are stressed out and can&#x27;t sleep using one of these as a heat pack is fantastic.</li>
            <li> great product to be regularly stocked at home</li>
            <li> it also smooth out your hear.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> I mix it with coconut oil to smooth is out and put it on my head for a while and its been mking my hair</li>
            <li> I decided to make some salve for Christmas, which is the primary reason why I opted to look for castor oil, I found Heritage Caster Oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whenever I use the salve it leaves my skin nicely supple but isn&#x27;t greasy in any way, just remember not to glob it on since it is very viscous (like molasses type of viscous).</li>
            <li> I added it to some jojoba oil and grapeseed oil I had around, castor oil being the primary oil for my skin type so</li>
            <li> If you decide to use this cleansing method castor oil does wonders, and I&#x27;d recommend using castor oil as the primary oil with a carrier.</li>
            <li> I found it to be too toxic for my back pain, but great for my feet in combination w/heat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly cheap.  </li>
            <li> Works great when mixed with coconut oil for a hair oil treatment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;According to researchers studying the light reflected from hair samples, castor oil hair treatments were found to increase the luster of hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a fabulous lip gloss.  </li>
            <li> I did the Oil cleansing method for about two weeks with olive oil only and my skin felt great,</li>
            <li> Please do not ask about quantities for the mask, try it once and adjust the quantities as you see fit, it all depends of the length of your hair.</li>
            <li> This works better for my hair than JBCO, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> and my twists have stayed put, are shiny, and feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> it at the end of your shower with a light rinse before turning off the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> but now they are really filled in</li>
            <li> I use this to wash my face with (the oil cleaning method) and mixing this with jojoba and tea tree oil is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Great big bottle of Castor oil in all of its glory.</li>
            <li> Castor oil is absorbed into the skin leaving it looking and feeling more youthful.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> but it does make my lips soft and surprisingly doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> Thus far good results.</li>
            <li> My hair retains length so much better, and this made my hair much stronger.this definitely​ deserve more than 5 stars</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, a high quality castor oil to use in my mixes in a large quantity and at a great price.</li>
            <li> Smells very fresh.</li>
            <li> This oil is very useful.</li>
            <li> I prefer the cleanest stuff when it comes to my mixtures, and this definitely is clean, I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Fairly priced and seems like a genuine product based on (1) the results I experienced and (2) in comparison to my earlier castor oil of different brand.</li>
            <li> this brand happens to be the most pure and economical i have found...and i have found many.</li>
            <li> I love castor oil so much!</li>

            <li> I chose to buy Heritage Store Castor oil (32 ounce) because I had read many positive reviews for this brand specifically.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth and high quality oil!</li>
            <li> Price is very important because I want to offer my customers a quality soap for a reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noted that the one large one on my arm that I&#x27;ve been applying this oil too for a couple of months, most nights has faded quite a bit already.</li>
            <li> , this is the right brand and product for you!</li>

            <li> and it makes my hair so soft and nice.</li>
            <li> Even though it didn&#x27;t help with hair loss as much as rosemary did, it helps cleanse my scalp better when I apply it for an hour before shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was old and out of date, but the label indicated it was good to 2015.</li>
            <li> But lucky that the bottle did not broke.</li>
            <li> Love it, decent shipping.</li>

            <li> towel dry to remove any excess oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and good</li>
            <li> but my boyfriend used it first and he loooves it!</li>
            <li> 4a/4b apl very dense, fine hair.</li>
            <li> AND I WISH THAT CERTAIN COMPANIES SHOULD JUST STICK TO THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT AND NOT CHANGE IT SO QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> SCALP ACNE COMPLETELY CLEARED UP !!!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for being so speedy and deliveries and offering such a great product.</li>
            <li> Not only I am still using it till today, but it works amazingly.</li>
            <li> but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love it so far.</li>
            <li> I ordered the empty mascara bottles which are a perfect purchase if you intend to use this for the same thing.</li>
            <li> but so far I love it.</li>
            <li> It was well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I make my own soap sometimes, I added the castor oil the last time I made some</li>
            <li> Big bottle for a nice price.</li>
            <li> worth it.</li>
            <li> its purity makes it worth drop by drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and afterwards I use a warm washcloth on my face to open up my pores.</li>
            <li> However, more frequent use than this can result in an oily scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now they feel much better and are soft, it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
            <li> This item came right on time Fast !!</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure that, soon, I will experience some new hair growth too.</li>
            <li> I recommend Heritage to anyone who wants a honest product for a decent price and especially for those who love Edgar Cayce remedies that are made specifically like Edgar had specified for them to be made.</li>
            <li> know there are many other uses for this magical stuff, but I haven&#x27;t tried them yet..</li>
            <li> know there are many other uses for this magical stuff, but I haven&#x27;t tried them yet..</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure there are many other uses that I haven&#x27;t discovered yet.</li>
            <li> This came pretty quick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Castor oil is a popular ingredient in hair products formulated for highly textured hair because it is known for its ability to seal moisture in the hair, combatting the natural dryness of these hair types.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Castor oil is a popular ingredient in hair products formulated for highly textured hair because it is known for its ability to seal moisture in the hair, combatting the natural dryness of these hair types.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to finally get my bushy eyebrows back and able to get them threaded professionally.</li>
            <li> After buying some jojoba oil as a carrier, I decided to try my own method out of fear that this new method would backfire as it has done with many other users.</li>
            <li> I had someone tell me that castor oil works great for permed black hair; It makes my hair very managable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few things that&#x27;s versatile, effective and cheap all in one.​</li>
            <li> Ive been very lucky to not have had a reaction so far.</li>
            <li> I add a little bit of Castor Oil into my home made soaps, and the oil has good lathering qualities.  </li>
            <li> I live in very rural area and am glad I can order it!</li>
            <li> As presented ~ no  issues, Thanks!</li>
            <li> SO MUCH OIL!</li>
            <li> First day of using.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years having encountered it at the Heritage Store in Virginia Beach, VA white attending a conference at</li>
            <li> This oil is most often used to moisten the wool flannel used in the Castor Oil Pack recommended by the aforementioned readings.</li>
            <li> I use it in many different capacities</li>
            <li> I highly recomend it !!</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this product I bought it in an 8oz.</li>
            <li> This works for everything, hair growth, first aid, must have.</li>
            <li> Thanks ohvaleriemoncherie!</li>
            <li> It sells for much higher in the health food stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought the larger size.</li>
            <li> It is sticky but soaks in pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The benefits from the castor oil packs, and hair are more than enough.</li>
            <li> However, mine came shipped in a box, and then in a big plastic baggie, and then there was a piece of tape across the top of it.</li>
            <li> so chose to buy this brand for my first venture into castor oil.</li>
            <li> I first learnt about the healing power of castor oil reading a yoga book.</li>
            <li> I recommend castor oil massages for any inflammation/muscles/ligaments/bodily pain, it really works!</li>
            <li> I tried this and the body will glow, and will feel much more open, with any stiffness gone away!</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> and then I make my washcloth wet with warm water and place it over my face to open up my pores even more</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used Castor Oil.  </li>
            <li> I use castor oil for many things - soap making, deep oil cleansing, eyelash and eyebrow treatment.</li>
            <li> Most definitely a holy grail item!</li>
            <li> In addition to healing benefits, castor oil also contains anti-inflammatory properties, all of which are related to healthy hair growth.</li>
            <li> The shipping is fast!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li> I used it for hot castor oil packs on my bladder and it worked.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Seems kinda funny since it&#x27;s an oil</li>
            <li> and it is more than enough.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to using it as a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> Very versatile product!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Heritage Store brand is pretty good, and a few batches in, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I also use it in hot oil treatments (as a pre-poo).</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> just a note: these are only two of the many things i use this castor oil for.</li>
            <li> I see many traditional remedies and online home remedy forums recommending putting castor oil drops into your eyes-- do not.  </li>
            <li> After soaking in a hot bath, I apply it all over my body.</li>
            <li> nothing but good things to say, amazing how such a simple substance taken externally can assist the body so much.  </li>
            <li> I was very unsure if it would be worth the money.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Bottle is very thin and week, that&#x27;s why 4 stars, otherwise an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I put the castor oil directly onto my skin over the scar, cover with an old towel, and place a heating pad on top, which I leave in place for 20 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few things that&#x27;s versatile, effective and cheap all in one.​r face regimens for anyone who is looking at natural solutions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found my recovery time to be much quicker when used with either cotten or wool flannel accompanied by heat (either a heating pad or hot water bottle).</li>
            <li> I bought the 32 oz bottle because it&#x27;s roughly how much I needed, and it arrived nicely packaged and secured, which I appreciated.</li>
            <li> The product was high quality and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Even though I don&#x27;t henna anymore, the oil somehow seems to make my henna more red and vibrant after shampooing it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that I can save it and keep using it down the road, though.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve hired a mole hunter, in the past, but the cost is just too high, successful as he was.  </li>
            <li> it for increasing density of eyelashes, Edgar Cayce&#x27;s castor oil packs, itching and/or dry skin and many others. . .</li>
            <li> This is a great price for being natural - way cheaper than the small bottles you buy in the store.  </li>
            <li> most recommend for moisturizing, some recommend it for overly oily skin since it will dry you out.</li>
            <li> It arrived with a large crack along the side that had dripped out a quite a bit of oil.  </li>
            <li> This is a large bottle of Castor oil.  </li>
            <li> It is a large size for the price.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully pure product.</li>
            <li> but when I started using it externally at night, rubbing on my stomach and in my navel, putting a towel and a hot pad on top until the oil was fully absorbed the next morning</li>
            <li> The castor oil is fine, but the bottle wasn&#x27;t sealed well enough and it leaked during shipping.</li>
            <li> I massage it with an old mascara brush on my eyebrows and after about 3 weeks or a little more they have filled it amazingly and are a little darker.</li>
            <li> Castor oil is also good for hard to deal with skin priblems.</li>
            <li> Huge Bottle will last awhile</li>
            <li> I buy mine at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sticky.</li>
            <li> It make my hair grow fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and my hair is so much softer.</li>
            <li> So can I say how FAST the shipping is</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from Vitacost on 3rd April and received on 7th April in secure packaging.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but it really does work.</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair and lashes and I am amazed at how much fuller and longer my lashes have gotten.</li>
            <li> Thanks for your business &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I really do not have 15 more words to say about this</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very nature</li>
            <li> I use it to wash my face (this and hemp oil - castor oil can be very drying by itself).  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This product really helped with our mole problem.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I am getting ready to order again for myself</li>
            <li> Always works and fast too</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it very soothing for foot rubs.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I applied it liberally, and once I was done - combed it gently through my hair.</li>
            <li> Very goog quality oil.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Very versatile</li>
            <li> My hair looks much healthier.</li>
            <li> I have very acne prone/dry skin</li>
            <li> Using this in combination with Jojoba Oil really has been the answer for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> The oil is meeting all my expectations, me and my husband are very please with this product.</li>
            <li> It works fast as well.</li>
            <li> Worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> Plus it lasted a whole year.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the Heritage Castor Oil!</li>
            <li> The product is more than expected.</li>
            <li> You can really feel it working.</li>
            <li> Walgreens wants nearly&lt;br /&gt;$6.00 for 4 oz.  </li>
            <li> It came wrapped up very well where it would not have a chance of spilling.  </li>
            <li> Not too much, or you&#x27;ll have a very gooey mixture.  </li>
            <li> this one is any thing oil very goog</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell.</li>
            <li> the shipping not so much.</li>
            <li> A+ thank you so much i have been looking for this in the storesand it got here</li>
            <li> realy FAST 😄</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> Anticipate a fast removal of spots.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It is quite a heavy oil, it&#x27;s very sticky and does not glide very easily across the skin.</li>
            <li> Many other uses.</li>
            <li> I wish I could really put my heart in this and say more wonderful news but having a cracked bottle and someone on the other end still decided to ship it pretty puts a bad taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased an 8-oz. bottle and it was not enough for my castor oil packs.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t overpay with some of those other oils that say they are better for hair.  </li>
            <li> The item was packaged very tight in a plastic bag and arrived in a nice box.  </li>
            <li> Too Much to say about this Particular Brand of Castor Oil....</li>
            <li> My skin is super soft, it helped clear blemishes, AND works FANTASTICALLY as a makeup remover.</li>
            <li> THE FIRST TIME I RECEIVED THIS CASTOR OIL, THE OIL WAS CLEAR LIKE SPRING WATER.</li>
            <li> If I simply used other oils w/o adding Castor Oil, my skin was much more soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> Use castor oil for hot oil treatments and scalp massages to stimulate hair growth and keep your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Use castor oil for hot oil treatments and scalp massages to stimulate hair growth and keep your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> have very dry skin that really helps n smooth my skin</li>
            <li> Brand New!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like I have all new skin!</li>
            <li> It gives my hair strength- less breakage and fallout, with more shine.  </li>
            <li> The stickiness is particular o ALL</li>
            <li> castor oils and not just with this particular brand.</li>
            <li> I added the oil into a hair mask for a deep conditioning and it worked better then when I use olive oil (or whatever) only, and for the OCM</li>
            <li> I soak the flannel in the oil, put the flannel next to where the healing is to be done, I cover the flannel with plastic and I use a heating pad set on low on top of the oil soaked flannel and plastic.</li>
            <li> Castor oil packs speed healing for many medical conditions as colds and bronchitis , menstrual cramps, urinary infections, anything internal.</li>
            <li> My combination skin has normalized, complexion is more even, and I&#x27;m using a little of the straight Castor oil around my eyes a few times a week and the fine lines around my eyes are minimized!</li>
            <li> and you have a steady energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am really upset, I usually do not leave comments but this time I got to do it</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this brand.</li>
            <li> I highly doubt the reviews are even legit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We almost purchased a product advertised to get rid of the moles, but the cost was just too high, until I looked at the components of the product.  </li>
            <li> Heritage Store is well known for their high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On time and high quality.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and you want high quality without having to pay obscene amounts</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> , the only thing I would put on my face as a moisturizer was 99% pure aloe vera gel, twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;So, after my face cleared up I decided to use the rest of that big bottle of castor oil on my hair, figured out that it&#x27;s fine since I&#x27;m not using it on my face</li>
            <li> I love to mix a little of this, in my hand, with my leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> what is there to say this is cold pressed and very good.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I read in a review that it had a very mild smell compared to other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didint&#x27;t blame the castor oil at first, I thought it was the Oil cleansing method, that my skin reacted in general to the oils I was using on it.</li>
            <li> Really helps lock in the moisture and keeps it soft.</li>
            <li> Enough that it probably isn&#x27;t worth the hassle of trying to return it.  </li>
            <li> level came normal.</li>
            <li> Use it for moisturizing by adding  a drop to your normal cream or lotion.  </li>
            <li> antifungal and antibacterial properties in castor oil are useful in combating scalp infections, such as follliculitus, ringworm and peidra.</li>
            <li> I started noticing a difference after only 2 heated applications (much sooner than I thought), and have been experiencing much better results than I expected.</li>
            <li> This oil is nice and thick and she seems to like it.</li>
            <li> It absorbs better than other oils yet the moisture has major staying power.</li>
            <li> Now, who, in their right mind, would purchase an item at three times the price of Castor Oil for the same item?  </li>
            <li> but I do believe it leaves the hair a little more soft.</li>
            <li> I am unsure if it is this product or the new techniques I am doing to my hair that is making my hair grow.</li>
            <li> I live my castor oil</li>
            <li> Ive seen some new lashes start to sprout.</li>
            <li> I can see a difference in thickness and some new hairs growing.</li>
            <li> I live this oil</li>
            <li> wanna live forever...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much time for other issues but I will be ordering more in the near future if that helps to clarify what I think of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black and going natural using this in my products keeps my growing afro soft and spongy:)</li>
            <li> I received the product the next day after I purchased it and for the 32 oz is pretty cheap compare to other castor oil.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very soft as well.</li>
            <li> However, the results are certainly worth the minor discomfort.</li>
            <li> You may purchase a small book titled &amp;#34;The Secrets of the Palma Christy Oil&amp;#34; if you need more information on the uses of castor oil.</li>
            <li> This oil has so many uses it&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend uses this for making makeup, hair conditioners and many other health and beauty related products.</li>
            <li> Natural hair chick here!</li>
            <li> Due to the extended weave wearing and braiding, my edges had thinned out significantly.</li>
            <li> Working well so far for oil washes!</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered this product I only got the 8 oz sized bottle.</li>
            <li> I had to go back to my Grandmother&#x27;s old ways, it will never fail you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and as expected.  </li>
            <li> This is the ONLY thing that works, and works consistently and naturally.  </li>
            <li> I stay up &#x27;till the wee hours, trying to catch them at their deeds, but no matter how much sleep I lose, they always manage to tear up my new lawn, when I go back to sleep.</li>
            <li> so I had no regrets about buying this particular oil.</li>
            <li> Now I have to find another bottle large enough to transfer its contents to.</li>
            <li> I use castor oil all the time, it&#x27;s the only thing that get my feet totally soft, yes i use it for other things but as a nurse (ie on my feet 12+ hours a day) and social dancing most nights</li>
            <li> It seals in the moisture and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> but I am still alive so it did not hurt.</li>
            <li> now they are shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I also use it in my hair to seal in moisture/ bring in moisture, and it makes it soft</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It is soothing, absorbes into the skin, natural and no residue.  </li>
            <li> Wow I received this product about a month ago and let me tell you this has help me with my oily acne prone skin</li>
            <li> and wow my t zone is not oily at all anymore</li>
            <li> It completely went away.</li>
            <li> (Over stretched them badly in my first yoga year</li>
            <li> it will be completely gone.</li>
            <li> This is a big 32-oz bottle at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> They (or it, as they are very solitary beasts) have all but destroyed our yard for the last two years.  </li>
            <li> I use a bit on my face at night and it makes my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully will disappear completely.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> but I think I will purchase my old brand instead of this.</li>
            <li> My adult acne is fading away, including the scars.  </li>
            <li> I have had this bottle for about 7 months and am no where near running out.  </li>
            <li> this not only made mine grow but very brittle.</li>
            <li> maybe this just makes em too sensitive??</li>
            <li> The quality of the caster oil used has a direct effect on the quality of soap which results.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and silky....</li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments on how soft my hands are and my boyfriends just loves how soft I feel.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
            <li> So far this seems to work for me.</li>
            <li> Please keep this basic property of castor oil in mind, and be very cautious.    </li>
            <li> I use this to make homemade all natural shampoo bars.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with sunflower oi, and so far I like the results.</li>
            <li> A few drops in your bath water will leave your skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;really surprised when i tell them its castor oil</li>
            <li> My newest staple in my natural hair care routine is castor oil.</li>
            <li> I use it to make my natural hair products</li>
            <li> Use this for skin, hair, eyebrows and long eyelashes; an occasional teaspoon full in juice to detox.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very rich and thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with VERY thick hair and this oil is amazing for hot oil treatments and scalp massages.</li>
            <li> So much length that I felt the need to get out my old curler( have not used for so long bc</li>
            <li> I have previously bought the same item (just smaller size), and have used it in many ways.</li>
            <li> Especially for hot oil treatments and deep conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> I have eliminated cleanser, exfoliated, toner, moisturizer, lip cream, and eye cream (I am in the beauty industry and am a complete product junkie, so this is major).</li>
            <li> This one is high quality, and though I purchased for my hair, it can see that it would benefit my skin, foot and internal care as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also perfect for dry skin, sore muscles, or painful joints.</li>
            <li> I have straight, bleached, long hair with henna on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat too heavy for the face, so I cut it with sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thick oil, so a little goes a long way, but my hair feels very well nourished and my scalp feels great.  </li>
            <li> As a way to keep in moisture right out of the shower (I added essential oils to make it smell good, although without a scent it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but I get noodle from it.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes dry skin very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, however, I just want anyone interested in oil healing to know this oil is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I added few drops of rosemary essential oil and it smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> A bottle a third of the size costs the same at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> Stronger odor and a little more sticky then other brands I have tried</li>
            <li> I did this every night before going to bed for only 7 days untill the pain completely disappeared!</li>
            <li> After 2-1/2 years of pain, in only 7 days with castor oil it completely went away!</li>
            <li> Infections and scalp disorders are major causes of hair loss.</li>
            <li> But it is definitely an aggravation, and it may be worth looking at some of the other brands for sale on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very thick and sticky though so make sure you mix it with another type of oil.</li>
            <li> so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  </li>
            <li> I am yet to see any permanent positive effects on my skin however, because if I don&#x27;t use it for 2+ days my hands get dry and turn white.</li>
            <li> I also use this on my skin to moisturize in general</li>
            <li> All the castor oils I purchased before were clear, except for this bottle, it was yellow.  </li>
            <li> But since I&#x27;ve started using castor oil on my skin to wash my face, I barely have any issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to be added to hair or face regimens for anyone who is looking at natural solutions.</li>
            <li> I do believe in natural cures when possible.  </li>
            <li> As for the actual oil, it makes my skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing weaves and braids for years to avoid my hair and recently starting working with my hair in its natural state.</li>
            <li> I purchased it to make my eyebrows thicker and grow more because they are thin from plucking and waxing.</li>
            <li> sure enough, not only is there grey mold in it, but black globs of mold, too!  </li>
            <li> I use it as a hot ol treatment for my hair every other week!</li>
            <li> If not, I can live with it as long as I have the Heritage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very tactile person and can be a little over sensitive to whatever is on my fingers and hands</li>
            <li> you have a pimple or any other skin issue, it really helps.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Castor oil is the commonly used lipophilic vector but has been shown to be cytotoxic.\\&quot;  From \\&quot;Results\\&quot;: \\&quot;castor oil was shown to induce significant necrosis\\&quot;   \\&quot;Conclusion\\&quot;: \\&quot;The results demonstrated that castor oil exerts cytotoxic effects on conjunctival cells.</li>
            <li> Rich &amp; thick.</li>
            <li> Thick and rich in quality.</li>
            <li> Months later after my last henna application, my hair is still retains its vibrant and deep red.</li>
            <li> Yes, because its packaging fails to include a caveat against this (popular) usage, and says only \\&quot;massage into any area.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> A little background first</li>
            <li> I had breast cancer and underwent extensive major surgery, and as a consequence,  I suffer from pain every day of my life.&lt;br /&gt;Before taking a bath each night</li>
            <li> EVERYTHING I EXPECTED IT TO BE...VERY HIGH QUALITY.</li>
            <li> I have been natural for a long time.</li>
            <li> I use it on castor oil packs for my surgical scar everyday, and my husband and I have noticed that the scar is healing much faster!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and also live in the driest state of all --- Nevada.</li>
            <li> This 32 oz bottle of pure castor oil was less than $13.00 with the shipping.  </li>
            <li> I trimmed in the first week on February to just above my bra line and now 3 and half months later my hair is 3, almost 4 inches longer.</li>
            <li> After dance class, I will put a big glob of this stuff on my heels and some big thick socks on and after a few hours, my feet are so nice and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is what I do, night time only (I bought some plastic shower caps first): I combine organic honey, castor oil, pure cold pressed olive oil and 1 egg yolk, stir everything well using a wooden spoon until it becomes somewhat of a paste then apply it first on my scalp, massaging well.</li>
            <li> My hair is no longer dry, and it leaves it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I put this on every night for the past 2 months and wow my eyelashes are so much longer</li>
            <li> In reality less than a tablespoon of oil had leaked and I felt they really did try to package it as soundly as possible.</li>
            <li> Not familiar with this seller but recently purchased this brand at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> After taking this, a few hours later and an entire role of toilet paper, he was back to his normal maniacal 8yr old self.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After taking this, a few hours later and an entire role of toilet paper, he was back to his normal maniacal 8yr old self.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The castor oils that I have used in the past, all had a screw off top which would get very messy.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry stools, I&#x27;ve tried everything natural and not natural to help get my bowels moving like clockwork.  </li>
            <li> I really love it, have used 1/2 already, will order again...living in a small town, its hard to find quality Castor Oil, and other&lt;br /&gt;essential oils,,,thanks</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not magical, and I don&#x27;t consider it as wondrous as say, pure argan oil, but it&#x27;s a tool that does</li>
            <li> Dull hair may benefit from the use of castor oil hair treatments, either in conditioners or in the form of a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I recommend searching all the various health benefits to its topical application because this oil works wonders on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I decided to get the 32oz since I use it all the time and doesnt last long in my house.</li>
            <li> Using this castor oil, along with specific exercises has gone a long way towards improving my foot mobility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i didnt feel my lashes were long enough)</li>
            <li> The lid was not on good on one of the bottles, loss was maybe 1/2 of cup. :-(</li>
            <li> I tried using T-Gel every few days, it just made my hair so dry and was starting to cause dandruff from the scabs, while it was treating the current bumps, it was not preventing new ones.</li>
            <li> I started using this specific one for the oil cleansing method, which unfortunately did not work out, but I still like the oil and have many other uses for it.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m black and have natural hair, 4a-4b).</li>
            <li> If you have frizzy hair or dry hair try this mixed with another oil.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t bought others in the past to compare, but it does exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Only used it a few weeks so far.</li>
            <li> The Cayce Readings recommend Castor Oil for a variety of conditions, such as liver detoxification, joint pain, inflammation of any type, as a laxative when taken internally, and a host of other conditions.</li>
            <li> If you have dry scalp or dandruff, apply castor oil directly to dry areas prior to washing or shampooing the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have dry scalp or dandruff, apply castor oil directly to dry areas prior to washing or shampooing the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it makes my skin even softer and that softness lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I like this castor oil product, I think the taste is alright and taking it internally can loosen the stool so be careful</li>
            <li> i was looking for a long time something too remove my scars</li>
            <li> To my surprise, there is a moldy, grey growth at the bottom of the liquid.  </li>
            <li> and they have regrown not completely yet</li>
            <li> You might think that is strange</li>
            <li> After the initial would closed, I started rubbing castor oil on it at night -</li>
            <li> In just a few days of applying this oil each morning the rash disappeared completely.</li>
            <li> I use the OCM once a week with the castor and jojoba oil combined but for the rest of the week, if I have any minor blemishes, I will use this as a spot treatment overnight or before heading into the shower.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil because it&#x27;s not as sticky or thick as some of the others</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a good thing I did that because it is not only thick, but if you leave it in your hair, it will weigh your hair down; that&#x27;s why pairing it up with an oil (for me) decreased the amount of product I use and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky, oily, and weighed down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing castor oil packs and I have noticed a major improvment in my cycle; less cramps.</li>
            <li> The color is a deep amber, whereas the last castor oil I had was a pale yellow.  </li>
            <li> have used NUMEROUS brands of Regular Castor and Black Castor Oil -</li>
            <li> I ordered this with several other oils to use in my health and beauty concoctions.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t tried masking it with other essential oils yet.</li>
            <li> I mix this with other oils such as argan and coconut oil and</li>
            <li> Simply mix other olive, jojoba or another oil to ease the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> my hair isn&#x27;t very thick or long but regardless, small quantities go a long way...it really does moisturize naturally curly hair and can be used while deep conditioning too...</li>
            <li> It is hard to apply to the skin because it is very thick but it is worth it because it leaves your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> but you have to be very careful in the amount you use because the final product will be greasy</li>
            <li> This truly miracle for dry skins.</li>
            <li> , I blend it with almond oil for use on my dry hands and cuticles.</li>
            <li> Treatment of Dry Scalp or Dandruff&lt;</li>
            <li> Treatment of Dry Scalp or Dandruff&lt;</li>
            <li> I do suffer from both oily and dry skin.</li>
            <li> does it hydrate or dry??</li>
            <li> I use it nightly now on acne scars and dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair stylist in NYC told me to start using castor oil for my dry hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> I bough castor oil because I heard it helps to strengthen hair and combat dry, brittle hair.</li>
            <li> Arrived with inner seal missing but not open.</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops of peppermint essential oil into a teaspoon of it and rub it onto sore muscles and such.</li>
            <li> granted I keep it in a smaller bottle for everyday use, oh, and the price is terrific.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently gotten on this natural kick lately.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive dry skin, especially in the colder months, so overuse of this product is a no-no for me because it&#x27;ll only make my eczema prone skin even worse.</li>
            <li> I use it every single night on my face to wash my makeup off.</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love this pure cold pressed Castor Oil!!  </li>
            <li> No more flaky skin &amp; skin feels mind blowingly soft.</li>
            <li> I thought I ordered the small size but upon receiving the item, I was surprised to see the JUMBO bottle.</li>
            <li> Apparently it happens all the time because they had it wrapped in a few layers of plastic.  </li>
            <li> Only down side is the oil smell.</li>
            <li> and since you only need a little to go a long way.</li>
            <li> short: If you&#x27;re looking to buy the 32-oz bottle, keep in mind that: a) you may be getting less than you pay for; and b) you may be in for a return/refund hassle.</li>
            <li> It was a big, black, scaly spot, about 2&amp;#34; in diameter.</li>
            <li> AND NOW ITS A SLIGHT YELLOW TINGE IN THE BOTTLE OF OIL.</li>
            <li> Two weeks later, the amount of hair lost is about three quarters less.</li>
            <li> Tried this out because my usual brand of castor oil was more expensive.</li>
            <li> I do use it on my skin, hair which were very dry lifeless</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s mixed with other oils and is a small percentage of the overall ingredients I use.</li>
            <li> store bought animal deterrent, sharp rocks and wire over the soil, black pepper, red pepper, etc.  </li>
            <li> Omega 6 essential fatty acids, vitamin E, proteins and other nutrients in castor oil can penetrate dry and damaged hair, smoothing rough cuticles and helping the hair shaft retain moisture.</li>

            <li> all I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> It was what i expected. .</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> Does everything I&#x27;ve expected</li>
            <li> Put a few drops in your bubble bath and it totally outweighs applying lotion after a bath.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to get it in your hair, can cause hair to be greasy.</li>
            <li> in the morning on empty stomach.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected and it is serving its purpose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 6 fatty acids in castor oil help keep your scalp from drying out, while regular use of castor oil may encourage thicker hair growth.</li>

            <li> Yes, I did research on line to treat my dog&#x27;s fatty tumors and two things came up regularly:</li>
            <li> Not really much to say about Castor Oil.</li>
            <li> I left it in for a few hours, then showered.</li>
            <li> bought an empty mascara tube with wand.</li>
            <li> IDK i just am kinda confused by the whole thing.</li>
            <li> I have continued this ritual a few days per week, and not only is my hair softer than a bunny&#x27;s, it is growing as well.  </li>
            <li> It does not have a fragrance, stabilizers or any unknown chemicals to cause a skin reaction.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating this 4 out of 5 because of my dislike of the scent and how thick it is, I have troubles washing it completely off</li>
            <li> , remember a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> My lashes are growing - very slowly, but I do see a difference - and mascara glides on much easier with less clumping (no I did not change brands of mascara).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the next morning, that evening it popped out with very little pressure.</li>
            <li> I use this on my scalp every other night (promotes hair growth).</li>
            <li> The possibilities for its use are endless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a little sticky but a little sunflower oil mixed in at about 1 to 10 made it perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dont see a difference between this and other brands.</li>
            <li> I used to have bald spots due to letting my causing tweeze my hair out</li>
            <li> Combining it wiht other oils and essentioal oils</li>
            <li> Check out Youtube videos and the Google links, and you will see the benefits it provides other people.</li>
            <li> According to other reviewers, the packaging was not up to par.</li>
            <li> It has other uses, too.</li>
            <li> Opened box to see the air packs intact and oil in the box and on the other item I received.</li>
            <li> other than that, no complaints.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just I am not sure if the castor oil spoils overtime because it turned a different color?</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe how a small amount of this mixed with 2 parts olive oil has transformed my skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure why it&#x27;s yellow in color.</li>
            <li> I use it for castor packs and other beauty uses and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> other</li>
            <li> Rub it on your face or other acne areas in the shower and wipe it off when you get out.  </li>
            <li> For those going natural, stay away from petroleum and mineral oil based products since it causes your hair to become very hard and attract a lot of dirt.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair like other  products.</li>
            <li> just look for 100% or pure and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type or brand.</li>
            <li> Castor oil is pretty thick stuff, and it leaks very slowly, so we still have about 28 oz in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> and so that the castor oil can be absorbed into my skin and then I splash cold water on my face to close my pores.</li>
            <li> be extra delicate when curling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I like the smell of the oil; however, I have been using it for a few weeks and see a big difference in the quickness of how my hairs are growing.</li>
            <li> When I quit putting the oil on it grew back as thick as ever.</li>
            <li> ; do not get me wrong, it&#x27;s definitely sticky and thick, but this brand is much easier to work with, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Whenever I am hurting anywhere on my body, I just take the oil, pour some on a cotton cloth, heat it up and put it on that area for 30 mins while laying down</li>
            <li> I mean it will last you a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I mix castor oil in with other oils like evoo and coconut oil also it works wonders on my eyelashes and eyebrow growth!  </li>
            <li> The oil itself feels somewhat &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and can be a little difficult to remove with just water and plain soap, but a little baking soda takes it right off.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that this oil is very sticky and has a bad smell.</li>
            <li> less then a 1/2 cup spread around my property and the neighbors dogs no longer come to my yard.  </li>
            <li> - less of a book - testimony:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Skin is drying ( less acne)</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed growth in places which previously bald.</li>
            <li> The engine runs quieter with less mechanical noise with castor oil than with synthetic two stroke oil.</li>
            <li> After just a few applications frizz is down to almost zero.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so thick that a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I apply to dry hair and leave on at least 30 mins.</li>
            <li> I use the whole thing covering all my hair until it looks, well, pretty nasty.</li>
            <li> I use a little bit of the castor oil on my face and rub it in</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve seen almost no incursions of the little critters since we&#x27;ve used this product.  </li>
            <li> It has a little bit of scent to it, but we do not find it offensive.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i mix mine with ivory shea butter or little bit of curel anti itch lotion</li>
            <li> but I think a little everyday can be beneficial, maybe a tablespoon to begin and see how it affects yourself.</li>
            <li> A little messy and dumped the wash cloth I used but to get rid of that pain?</li>
            <li> I just used it again yesterday since I had back pain really bad, and this morning is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> Been using on my face for a few days and already I can see a difference.</li>
            <li> I suspect this happens relatively often because the bottle was sent to us within what would be an otherwise completely unnecessary zip-lock bag (which kept the oil from leaking into the shipping box).  </li>
            <li> It does protect their skin/hair from this harsh weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done the one hour hair treatment a few times and also applied it along with some coconut oil after shampooing, I&#x27;m still debating on those</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended it to a few others, and they agreed it worked for them too.</li>
            <li> He started massaging it with castor oil everyday.</li>
            <li> Massaging it in, or applying a paste of castor oil and baking soda everyday was an Edgar Cayce remedy for skin problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you use it as a hair mask, you will need to wash with shampoo a few times to get it all out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2 weeks ago I decided that we both should get checked for heavy metals:</li>
            <li> She carries some heavy metals.&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li> have been using mine for a few months</li>
            <li> Be patient and apply it everyday and you will be amazed.</li>
            <li> I start this in November, i use it once a week and let it sit for a few hours in my hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a harsh scent and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> And I have added a few drops to thicken up some of my lotions.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use castor oil everyday.</li>
            <li> use almost everyday .....</li>
            <li> When I got the package I noticed a small dark spot in the corner of the box.</li>
            <li> less lashes falling out) and will probably work on my head hair too!</li>
            <li> This oil is thick and not runny, if you don’t like the smell or thickness you can mix with other carrier</li>
            <li> I have used plain castor oil on cuts and my skin heals faster.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer, and the scar feels less thick and tight.</li>
            <li> When I first started looking for castor oil, to use to make home made beauty products, I was shocked by the price.  </li>
            <li> I was having a lot of pain around the scar, and the tissue felt really thick, tight, and restricted.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll ever get used to it.</li>
            <li> I have has problem skin for the past year and this stuff has been a miracle.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
            <li> /a few ingredient&amp;It is growing already!</li>
            <li> It was an inch past my shoulders in October and come January</li>
            <li> my hair was an inch past my bra line.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using these quality products recommended in the Edgar Cayce readings for the past 40 years and will attest to their quality and integrity.</li>
            <li> She uses this for the Castor Oil packs and I can say I have seen unbelievable results from this product.</li>
            <li> In the morning, wash your hair thoroughly with shampoo to remove all traces of castor oil, then style as usual.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if this product will work for me.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this was Amazon or the seller.</li>
            <li> Applied it to a rash I&#x27;d been experiencing that antibiotic creams was unable to get rid of for several years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> so I just rinse with my usual philosophy cleanser afterwards.</li>
            <li> Vitacost was reliable and prompt as usual.</li>
            <li> I use this in my radio controlled airplane&#x27;s small two cycle engine.</li>
            <li> I tried out this bottle because the ever-so-popular JBCO is way too expensive in my opinion, so I wanted to get something that was as close as possible to the organic stuff.</li>
            <li> skin and hair very soft- works as a compress for painful joints.</li>
            <li> I thought how hard can it be just to package this so it did not leak.</li>
            <li> I need to be honest, it is disgusting, sorry</li>
            <li> Then it hit me, it was the castor oil.&lt;br /&gt;Think twice before using it on your face or hair, at least do a skin test before.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait at least a month to review bc</li>
            <li> It sucks fighting them both; until now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only has it cured my constipation buy complexion is drastically improving and my hair and nails grow like crazy</li>
            <li> too thick</li>
            <li> It is really thick</li>
            <li> Has thick consistancy that castor oil should have.</li>
            <li> A bit thick, I diluted it with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> This oil is thick</li>
            <li> It is thick, sticky, and seeps into hair/skin.  </li>
            <li> Some people have compared it to vitamin E oil, but it&#x27;s not as thick.</li>
            <li> It has the thick texture and no smell one would expect from castor oil.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the bottle is made of extremely thin/weak plastic.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is the only stuff that works to get rid of my wretchedly dry skin during the brutal winter months here in PA.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously a miracle product.</li>
            <li> I used half castor oil and half baking soda to help my girlfriend fix a bad splinter in her foot.</li>
            <li> and I was starting to have bad anxiety every time I had to wash and brush my hair.</li>
            <li> Not surprising it is known as the Palma Christy</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and want others to be aware.</li>
            <li> Everyone should at least try it!</li>
            <li> I also add some to my deep conditioners &amp; it&#x27;s the base to my OCM.</li>
            <li> I used to have crazy oily skin, not kidding I would have to reapply makeup everyday by noon.</li>
            <li> I have never had broken lashes ever.</li>
            <li> but after curling (using CO one wk) my lashes have completely broken off.</li>
            <li> lashes are broken...</li>
            <li> It does not go bad like typical lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a serious haircut, I tried some very expensive treatments and shampoos, nothing worked.</li>
            <li> for the amount you get and the price, you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> Like wtf is wrong with people?</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with castor oil now.</li>
            <li> Then I tried buying expensive shampoo, still no help.</li>
            <li> the minute I used castor oil, I ended up having terrible rash on my face the next morning.</li>
            <li> The bumps were at worst, 2&amp;#34; in diameter, very swollen and so painful they hurt when I would walk!</li>
            <li> Let me just say my hair grew like crazy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite its unpleasant taste and texture</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, and not too sticky.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any bad reactions to using the oil as of yet, but in both the soap and the lotion I make</li>
            <li> , I had gotten a bad bruise.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t bad....</li>
            <li> So, I was experiencing really bad hair loss.</li>
            <li> my feet were in bad shape.</li>
            <li> My skin was painfully itchy for about a week.</li>
            <li> Try it you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was in desperate need of a miracle!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Absolutely disgusting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this castor oil; it helps to create a very rich creamy lather for all of my soaps.............thesoapmaker.net</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this for the Oil Cleansing Method, I put about 20% of this with the rest Grape Seed Oil or Sunflower seed oil and am getting great results.</li>
            <li> Castor oil is always in my homemade soap recipes! Love this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this for her skin. She applies it and then heats her face. Good quality and good price.</li>
            <li> Great Price for quality Castor oil.  The item was packaged very tight in a plastic bag and arrived in a nice box.  I think it is a great product for a awesome price compared to Baar Products who over price their products due to The Edgar Cayce name.  I recommend Heritage to anyone who wants a honest product for a decent price and especially for those who love Edgar Cayce remedies that are made specifically like Edgar had specified for them to be made.</li>
            <li> Love it, works great. Product arrived on time with good packaging. Fairly priced and seems like a genuine product based on (1) the results I experienced and (2) in comparison to my earlier castor oil of different brand.</li>
            <li> This product is great n all I expected it to be. I love this product</li>
            <li> I started to use this on my aches and pains and then started to use it on my eyelashes and eyebrows to start regrowing them - it works great.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and high quality oil!</li>
            <li> For just 12 bux i got quite a bit of product and it makes my hair feel amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Not too thick and it smells just fine</li>
            <li> My husband uses this for sores on his legs and it works well.</li>
            <li> This has to be the only castor oil that doesn&#x27;t cause me to scratch my scalp until its sore. I use this on my scalp every other night (promotes hair growth). I also add some to my deep conditioners &amp; it&#x27;s the base to my OCM. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this brand. I buy mine at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> I use castor oil in my shampoo and conditioner since i wash my hair often and i love the amount I got for the price. Great Deal!</li>
            <li> Been using on my face for a few days and already I can see a difference. Skin is smoother and more supple. The only thing that still bugs me is the smell. It&#x27;s very potent. Not sure I&#x27;ll ever get used to it. However, the results are certainly worth the minor discomfort.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me to use castor oil on my seborrheic keratosis and it does work to reduce the thickness of it.  I only put it on once a day for a couple months and I&#x27;m sure it would&#x27;ve been better to apply it more than once a day.  When I quit putting the oil on it grew back as thick as ever.</li>
            <li> I love to mix a little of this, in my hand, with my leave-in conditioner.  It seals in the moisture and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Very good. But lucky that the bottle did not broke. Bottle is very thin and week, that&#x27;s why 4 stars, otherwise an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Castor oil is very good for my 4c hair love this product</li>
            <li> It was what i expected. .</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Product as described.  I use as one of the ingredients in my salt scrub.  The odor is very light and the oil is great moisturizer.  The taste is also fine and the price is excellent.</li>
            <li> I use castor oil for healing purposes and have been satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> As presented ~ no  issues, Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is the Best of the Best</li>
            <li> It is good for my castor oil patches</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  Well packaged for shipping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a repeat customer of this item. I haven&#x27;t found a better price for the quantity or quality</li>
            <li> This was a great value! I&#x27;ve ordered from lots of different places and for the price and quality of this oil I was amazed. Thanks so much for being so speedy and deliveries and offering such a great product. I mostly use this in my soap making and so I will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH OIL! Awesome investment.</li>
            <li> I bought the castor oil for my edges because they basically are gone. First day of using. The smell isn&#x27;t bad, and not too sticky.  So far, so good. I will post a update in a month on the growth of my hair.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this product.  It was recommended by my niece who is a hair specialist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom swears by it that it grows her frontal hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use in my own oil cleansing method. Online forums claim Castor Oil is good for oily skin but every time I use this....even in the diluted ratios suggested; I would break out. If I simply used other oils w/o adding Castor Oil, my skin was much more soft &amp; smooth. I would not purchase this again. It&#x27;s very sticky.</li>
            <li> Use this for skin, hair, eyebrows and long eyelashes; an occasional teaspoon full in juice to detox.</li>
            <li> Great quality oil.  I use it for soap making and it works great and at a relatively good price.</li>
            <li> I love love love love this product. It&#x27;s super good. It make my hair grow fast. I swear to God it work.</li>
            <li> Greatest oil ever. I use it to massage my Back, and to rub on my kids&#x27; chests, temple and around when they are congested. It works wonders. Try it you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; would do business again.  On time delivery!</li>
            <li> I use this for heat packs as described by Edgar Cayce. It did not cure my cancer but I am still alive so it did not hurt. I find it a wonderful help for insomnia. If you are stressed out and can&#x27;t sleep using one of these as a heat pack is fantastic. I sleep like a baby.</li>
            <li> I bought it mostly for my hair and found myself using it on my skin. It is hard to apply to the skin because it is very thick but it is worth it because it leaves your skin very soft. It makes my hair very soft as well. Awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years having encountered it at the Heritage Store in Virginia Beach, VA white attending a conference at he ARE.  The Cayce Readings recommend Castor Oil for a variety of conditions, such as liver detoxification, joint pain, inflammation of any type, as a laxative when taken internally, and a host of other conditions. You may purchase a small book titled &amp;#34;The Secrets of the Palma Christy Oil&amp;#34; if you need more information on the uses of castor oil. This oil is most often used to moisten the wool flannel used in the Castor Oil Pack recommended by the aforementioned readings. The oil itself feels somewhat &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and can be a little difficult to remove with just water and plain soap, but a little baking soda takes it right off. The stickiness is particular o ALL castor oils and not just with this particular brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very rich and thick but it&#x27;s a lot for a good price</li>
            <li> I am still waiting on the results</li>
            <li> This item came right on time Fast !! the timing was PERFECT! I would order from them again, no question. Very Happy with my order :) (all smiles)</li>
            <li> Quality product and shipping.  Stronger odor and a little more sticky then other brands I have tried but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> HUGE bottle. I probably won&#x27;t ever have to re-purchase because I bought it for and use it on my eyelashes to strengthen and thicken them. I don&#x27;t use it enough on my scalp, but I think I&#x27;ll start because it is, indeed, thickening and strengthening (and therefore lengthening..less lashes falling out) and will probably work on my head hair too!</li>
            <li> We bought this castor oil (32-oz bottle) for use in soap making.  Unfortunately, the bottle is made of extremely thin/weak plastic.  It arrived with a large crack along the side that had dripped out a quite a bit of oil.  I suspect this happens relatively often because the bottle was sent to us within what would be an otherwise completely unnecessary zip-lock bag (which kept the oil from leaking into the shipping box).  Castor oil is pretty thick stuff, and it leaks very slowly, so we still have about 28 oz in the bottle.  Enough that it probably isn&#x27;t worth the hassle of trying to return it.  But it is definitely an aggravation, and it may be worth looking at some of the other brands for sale on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short: If you&#x27;re looking to buy the 32-oz bottle, keep in mind that: a) you may be getting less than you pay for; and b) you may be in for a return/refund hassle.</li>
            <li> This oil has many valuble and varying uses: body,hair, nails, and food etc. great product to be regularly stocked at home</li>
            <li> I no longer need to use my conditioner with this. It also seems to have thickened my hair in only about 10 days! I am on a strict diet right now so that has a lot to do with it as well, but it works great for me.</li>
            <li> I use this for everything. My kids scars, my scars, nightly face cleansing, my cracked feet, everything.. it is great</li>
            <li> This truly miracle for dry skins.I do use it on my skin, hair which were very dry lifeless before.but now they are shiny and soft. I am using it on my kids skin this winter and sure their skin shines. It does protect their skin/hair from this harsh weather.</li>
            <li> I order this oil constantly and I never want to be without it. It&#x27;s worked wonders for my son&#x27;s eczema (I apply it immediately after his bath while his skin is still damp, so that it soaks in). I&#x27;m African American with VERY thick hair and this oil is amazing for hot oil treatments and scalp massages. I&#x27;ve used every type of oil there is from safflower to coconut and this is my favorite because of it&#x27;s almost gel-like consistency. Will never be without it!</li>
            <li> This product satisfied all my needs I use it in many different capacities and I found it arrived timely, in great condition, and It was really a great buy for the value of this oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great price for castor oil. I&#x27;ll buy this brand again when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, however, I just want anyone interested in oil healing to know this oil is the real deal.</li>
            <li> As described, great value and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> great product for the price..</li>
            <li> I use this on a daily basis. I started using it to promote longer and thicker hair growth in my eyebrows and eyelashes, and I believe it did. Now, I use it every day to remove my eye makeup. This stuff is so cheap for how much you get! I&#x27;ve had this for maybe a year and my oil level hasn&#x27;t even hit the top of the sticker label yet! I think castor oil has a lot of great benefits for your skin and hair and the fact that it just wipes off waterproof makeup with ease is an additional bonus. This is also great for mixing with olive oil and applying to your face with a steamy damp towel over it for a minute to moisturize your face. The possibilities for its use are endless. I recommend searching all the various health benefits to its topical application because this oil works wonders on my dry skin. This is also the cheapest option I have found to buy it in, and I will purchase from this seller again when I run out.... in about 20 years.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, a high quality castor oil to use in my mixes in a large quantity and at a great price. Item arrived quick and securely. Happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Has good smell essay to wash out from hair</li>
            <li> This castor oil helps to soften and thickens my hair. I mix it with equal parts of olive oil &amp; coconut oil.  I also use this castor oil in a castor oil pack.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that the stuff works great and fast service</li>
            <li> Awesome awesome awesome! I use a tiny bit on the problem areas of my skin mixed with my moisturizer at night and I swear my skin is clearer and smoother than it has ever been. I have has problem skin for the past year and this stuff has been a miracle.</li>
            <li> Really great product. I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and my hair is so much softer. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair like other  products. The only downside is that this oil is very sticky and has a bad smell. I have tried mixing it with another product but the smell and sticky texture are still there. However, I find that the smell goes away shortly after using it</li>
            <li> Love the castor oil great quality! Good for the skin and love the feel of it on my skin! Terrific!</li>
            <li> Great transaction. I like this product. I makes my hear looking so shiny and healthy. My mother uses as well and she agrees with me &#x3D;D it also smooth out your hear. Buy it it works.</li>
            <li> mixed with dish soap and alum to spray my lawm that was infested with moles.worked great!!!! I highly recomend it !!</li>
            <li> I bought it because I read in a review that it had a very mild smell compared to other brands.&lt;br /&gt;It was a little sticky but a little sunflower oil mixed in at about 1 to 10 made it perfect.&lt;br /&gt;My only concern was the lid. When it is tipped to pour  oil out, it leaks around the rim.&lt;br /&gt;A simple fix was to take off the lid, wrap it in saran wrap around the rim, and screw the cap back on.</li>
            <li> I love it so far. I ordered this with several other oils to use in my health and beauty concoctions. I mostly use this for my eyelash/eyebrow mix. I ordered the empty mascara bottles which are a perfect purchase if you intend to use this for the same thing. I blend it with others for my face and for acne, I blend it with almond oil for use on my dry hands and cuticles. I love this stuff. Smells pleasant and was delivered in a timely manner. Packaged nicely and did not leak all over the box. Would recommend to anyone, give it a try! I&#x27;ve just started the eyelash thing, so time will tell if it actually helps!</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected. No complaints, will buy again when i need more</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this product I bought it in an 8oz. size and it lasted about 3-4 months with me using it for many purposes, so I decided to step up to the 32oz because of the value and utility I get from this product. As a way to keep in moisture right out of the shower (I added essential oils to make it smell good, although without a scent it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but I get noodle from it. lol) it makes my skin even softer and that softness lasts a really long time. I mix it with some coconut oil that I have and apply it to my legs after shaving, and this soothes them and makes them shiny. I also use it in my hair to seal in moisture/ bring in moisture, and it makes it soft and I feel like it has also made my hair thicker as well (I&#x27;m black and have natural hair, 4a-4b). I also apply it to my eyelashes and I think they have benefited (longer, more volume), I apply it to my eyebrows also to make them lay the way I want them to! I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> I mix 16 oz of this with 16 gallons of water and apply it to 3/4 acre of lawn and apply in April, July, and September.  Works great to keep moles, voles, and gophers away.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> lasted for over a year.</li>
            <li> I love it! No problem with this produt at all I use it all the time and will purchase more</li>
            <li> I been using it for a while now and i changed my mind on castor oil, i love it! I mix it with coconut oil to smooth is out and put it on my head for a while and its been mking my hair look a lot stronger. I am Happy!!!!!!! Hopefully it gets to the point that i am 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> Item has arrived - Thank-you!!</li>
            <li> This works for everything, hair growth, first aid, must have. I prefer it better than JBCO.  It doesnt have the sticky residue and has a neutral scent.  I&#x27;ve notice faster hair growth as well. I decided to get the 32oz since I use it all the time and doesnt last long in my house.</li>
            <li> I mix this with avocado oil and apply to hair. If you have frizzy hair or dry hair try this mixed with another oil. It is really thick so you want another oil to lighten it up. Olive oil or grapeseed would work well with it. Amazing! I apply to dry hair and leave on at least 30 mins. Then shampoo twice and condition. Done once a week my hair is sleek, shiny and all around wonderful. After just a few applications frizz is down to almost zero. I can&#x27;t apply this to my scalp so I use coconut oil on my scalp. For some reason this makes my scalp itch. So I keep it off the scalp and apply the rest of the hair.</li>
            <li> Must-have for basic soaps to add the lather everyone craves.  Can also be used in lip balms and lotions with good results.</li>
            <li> Very happy with size and quality. Looking forward to many&lt;br /&gt;more uses with this oil. Also bought Edgar cayce book</li>
            <li> I have not used this for all the reasons I bought it for but so far I love it. It has improved my toe nail fungus. I cant wait to try a castor oil patch. Good quality and very large bottle. Great value.</li>
            <li> Good price, good product. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Buying - simple and easy  Shipping - quick  Product - outstanding  Buyer satisfaction - A+  Castor oil is an amazing natural product. . .use it for increasing density of eyelashes, Edgar Cayce&#x27;s castor oil packs, itching and/or dry skin and many others. . .</li>
            <li> Absolutely disgusting. It smells like cooking oil and feels like glue. WHO uses this for hair or and skin??? I highly doubt the reviews are even legit.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want my sink to be clogged with this greasy cooking oil so I can&#x27;t even dump it.</li>
            <li> I love love love castor oil. for the amount you get and the price, you cant go wrong. there are so many uses for it including hair growth, constipation, skin firming, antibacterial ointment.</li>
            <li> So can I say how FAST the shipping is I ordered this product from Vitacost on 3rd April and received on 7th April in secure packaging. I haven&#x27;t tried it as yet will do another review in a month or so on the product itself just had to shout out vitacost and their efficiency :)</li>
            <li> This is one of the best price you can get on high quality castor oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its great for massage oil and hair. Love it</li>
            <li> Works great in soap making!</li>
            <li> I put this on every night for the past 2 months and wow my eyelashes are so much longer it&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever used castor oil, but it seems to be a good quality oil and my achy muscles do feel better after a castor pack.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping. Excellent price! I bought this for my 4b hair&amp;mixed it w/a few ingredient&amp;It is growing already! It&#x27;s only been 3 weeks. So glad us naturals have youtube to share! Thanks ohvaleriemoncherie!</li>
            <li> Oil came great and packaged well! Does everything I&#x27;ve expected</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price for castor oil I&#x27;ve ever seen.  It was well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing castor oil packs and I have noticed a major improvment in my cycle; less cramps. The only thing was one of the bottles had a crack .</li>
            <li> I use this to seal in moisture. I love it! i Will always have in my regimen. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product</li>
            <li> Just as described. Good quality product</li>
            <li> I like this castor oil product, I think the taste is alright and taking it internally can loosen the stool so be careful but I think a little everyday can be beneficial, maybe a tablespoon to begin and see how it affects yourself. I&#x27;ve done the one hour hair treatment a few times and also applied it along with some coconut oil after shampooing, I&#x27;m still debating on those but I do believe it leaves the hair a little more soft. I haven&#x27;t had much time for other issues but I will be ordering more in the near future if that helps to clarify what I think of this product.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find what I needed in stores, so bought here. Great purchase and shipped quickly. Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the brand I always buy and this is the best price around. It sells for much higher in the health food stores. I will continue to buy it and recommend it for anyone doing the castor oil packs. It&#x27;s also perfect for dry skin, sore muscles, or painful joints.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read so many great reviews about hair growth and wanted to regrow my eyebrows back, and WOW does this stuff work. I was so happy to finally get my bushy eyebrows back and able to get them threaded professionally. This stuff really works, I was skeptical at first but it really does work. Must buy!!</li>
            <li> I  have been using this as a hair treatment. Leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny. Love it! It is very thick and sticky though so make sure you mix it with another type of oil. I use Coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I like the price for the amount you get I used it for hair and it got the job done removing gum and glue I give it a times up it stops the itchiness of scalp so that was a plus</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was organic when I decided to buy it.  But if you read the back you&#x27;ll find out it is organic. I&#x27;m so happy it is! I read a lot about castor oil before purchasing this and am really happy with it. Sometimes I use it as is, on my hands and feet, sometimes I mix it with my lotion for all over. I put on my lips and eyebrows every night. I don&#x27;t know if my eyebrows have grown at all but it does make my lips soft and surprisingly doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I make my own soap sometimes, I added the castor oil the last time I made some and I love it. Everyone should at least try it! It&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s such a big bottle and it&#x27;s so thick that a little goes a long way but I will definitely be buying this again when I get low.</li>
            <li> i was looking for a long time something too remove my scars this product work with in a week my face scars disappeared&lt;br /&gt;i am so happy i could dance :) dark-spots begone !!! this is the oil work better then anything i used for my face:)</li>
            <li> Love it, decent shipping. Big bottle for a nice price. Rich &amp; thick. Great for stomach pain relief &amp; face/hair masks</li>
            <li> I love love love castor oil. I use it for my hair and lashes and I am amazed at how much fuller and longer my lashes have gotten.</li>
            <li> Definitely cheaper than buying at store. I use this as part of my castor oil pack daily. I&#x27;m glad I bought the larger size. Good quality.</li>
            <li> This is like a miracle!  This oil has many healing qualities.  It is soothing, absorbes into the skin, natural and no residue.  I even use this oil in my hair.  My hair is no longer dry, and it leaves it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Pleased with product. I use it in all my hair products. Has thick consistancy that castor oil should have. For the size the price is a lot cheaper than what I paid for a 16oz bottle on ebay.</li>
            <li> I love castor oil so much! Put a few drops in your bubble bath and it totally outweighs applying lotion after a bath. Just be careful not to get it in your hair, can cause hair to be greasy. Thanks for your business &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This castor oil has worked for me. I dont see a difference between this and other brands. This works for me and does the job.</li>
            <li> In cleaning some shelves today, I pulled out the 32-oz bottle of castor oil purchased last April.  To my surprise, there is a moldy, grey growth at the bottom of the liquid.  Also, I had a smaller amount transferred to a 4-oz. bottle to use with OCM, so I checked and sure enough, not only is there grey mold in it, but black globs of mold, too!  The exp. is 9-2016.  I cannot find much online about moldy castor oil, but sure don&#x27;t plan on using it any longer!  Very disappointed and want others to be aware.</li>
            <li> This is a large bottle of Castor oil.  I bought mascara wands and use it on my lashes and brows.  I was happy with the product and the speed of the shipping</li>
            <li> Used this as a plaster for gallstone pain.  I read about it and was in such pain decided &amp;#34;why not&amp;#34;.  Well, don&#x27;t know why but it works!  Like a charm.  A little messy and dumped the wash cloth I used but to get rid of that pain? worth it.</li>
            <li> Wow I received this product about a month ago and let me tell you this has help me with my oily acne prone skin I wash my face with this oil just like you would with any cleanser (don&#x27;t be scared I did not have any breakouts with this method you can youtube it type oil wash ) and wow my t zone is not oily at all anymore plus I have noticed that my eyebrow hairs have camed back I used to have bald spots due to letting my causing tweeze my hair out and they have regrown not completely yet but is something hopefully I could get them to their original state ovorall great product will recomend to a friend :)</li>
            <li> It is sticky but soaks in pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It is remarkably healing!&lt;br /&gt;You have got to see it to believe it.&lt;br /&gt;I have a wart inside my eyelid:&lt;br /&gt;I have had surgery twice. All the surgery (thousands of dollars and dozens of lies from the docs) did was scar up my eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;A tiny drop of this stuff keeps the wart at bay. Maybe it will go away. If not, I can live with it as long as I have the Heritage.&lt;br /&gt;This is how they treat warty eyelids on dogs.</li>
            <li> Great company, Great castor oil.  This is a great source of healing. Combining it wiht other oils and essentioal oils makes it a super power healing agent. Thank You</li>
            <li> Use this as a castor oil pack and its great. But I realized that anytime I use it, I sleep through the night like a baby. It&#x27;s amazing for people who need help sleeping. I&#x27;ve recommended it to a few others, and they agreed it worked for them too. I also use it in my deep conditioner&#x27;s for my hair. I can&#x27;t use any on my skin, but that&#x27;s okay. The benefits from the castor oil packs, and hair are more than enough. For an awesome deep conditioner, I use castor oil, mayo, egg, and coconut oil. AWESOME. My hair is so conditioned, its amazing. Thank God!!!</li>
            <li> I use Castor Oil to make soap and lotion. I haven&#x27;t used it internally yet. I haven&#x27;t noticed any bad reactions to using the oil as of yet, but in both the soap and the lotion I make it&#x27;s mixed with other oils and is a small percentage of the overall ingredients I use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try it, as the Armadillos are having a banquet on my lawn every night. I stay up &#x27;till the wee hours, trying to catch them at their deeds, but no matter how much sleep I lose, they always manage to tear up my new lawn, when I go back to sleep. I&#x27;ve heard from many people, that they put Castor Oil into a &#x27;hose-end&#x27; sprayer (See photo)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/s/ref&#x3D;nb_sb_ss_c_0_16?url&#x3D;search-alias%3Dlawngarden&amp;field-keywords&#x3D;hose%20end%20sprayer&amp;sprefix&#x3D;hose+end+sprayer%2Caps%2C272&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it seems to work, as a deterrent, so I&#x27;ll give it a try. Thanks for all the good tips you&#x27;ve all posted on this castor Oil Product.</li>
            <li> I used this on my hair (and lips sometimes) when I was on acne medication called Accutane and it helped a lot! The only thing I don&#x27;t like about castor oil is the smell.. I can&#x27;t get the smell out of my pillow cases and blankets no matter how many times I wash them!</li>
            <li> Bought to get rid of neighbors dog worked well.  Castor oil if good irritates dogs noises so they stop going to certain places.  less then a 1/2 cup spread around my property and the neighbors dogs no longer come to my yard.  Also great for my skin</li>
            <li> I use castor oil for my hair and skin care regimen, and it&#x27;s great! This particular brand is great, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for castor oil packs and for skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A castor oil pack is basically a wool flannel soaked and wrung in castor oil. You then place it over your liver area with a heating pad over it. Put towels on top to keep the heat in. Watch TV or read for an hour. Do this 3-4 days in a row. On the last day, take a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil. Repeat every week for a couple of months. What does it do? Stimulates the lymphatic system. Strengthens the liver. Dissolves gall-bladder debris and stones. Great for cancer patients or just anyone in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once, I had gotten a bad bruise. I placed a castor oil pack over it for an hour. In that hour, 50% of the bruise had dissolved. It definitely stimulates circulation and speeds recovery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My father had a benign tumor on his leg. It was a big, black, scaly spot, about 2&amp;#34; in diameter. He started massaging it with castor oil everyday. It completely went away. If you have skin issues, even skin cancer, this product is great. Massaging it in, or applying a paste of castor oil and baking soda everyday was an Edgar Cayce remedy for skin problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good product to have at your disposal. I&#x27;ve bought this brand before and have had no complaints. If you don&#x27;t believe me, do your research. Check out Youtube videos and the Google links, and you will see the benefits it provides other people.</li>
            <li> great for castor oil packs. I really do not have 15 more words to say about this so will just type this nonsense.  give me a break amazon.</li>
            <li> good product esp. for the amount received. i like the oil and being able to use it for many different things.</li>
            <li> I use it as a hot ol treatment for my hair every other week! It thickens the hair and I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and delivered in timely manner with protective packaging.  Many thanks!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the only stuff that works to get rid of my wretchedly dry skin during the brutal winter months here in PA. It is quite a heavy oil, it&#x27;s very sticky and does not glide very easily across the skin. I would recommend using it along with another oil that isn&#x27;t as viscous, perhaps a jojoba oil or even an olive oil if you can stand smelling like an Italian dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that in mind, it works wonders for calloused feet. After dance class, I will put a big glob of this stuff on my heels and some big thick socks on and after a few hours, my feet are so nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipper, Vita Cost, was prompt. According to other reviewers, the packaging was not up to par. However, mine came shipped in a box, and then in a big plastic baggie, and then there was a piece of tape across the top of it. Not a drop of oil in my packaging, they seemed to have taken good measures to fix the leaking oil problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****ALSO**** This stuff is wonderful for a hair mask, as well as a conditioner for eyelashes and eyebrows. If you use it as a hair mask, you will need to wash with shampoo a few times to get it all out.</li>
            <li> Brand New! I absolutely Love this pure cold pressed Castor Oil!!  Delivered as scheduled. Extremely Satisfied customer. Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> Arrived with inner seal missing but not open.</li>
            <li> I love it! my hair is really short when it&#x27;s nappy, and it fell out a lot, but I can see my hair growing back a lot.</li>
            <li> I use it to rid my gardens of moles &amp; gophers. Sprinkle around borders liberally.</li>
            <li> My wife and I basically eat and drink the same. We use the same supplements and vitamins except this one product.&lt;br /&gt;I take it every 2 weeks on a Saturday, two tbsp. in the morning on empty stomach. I need to be honest, it is disgusting, sorry it is but its purity makes it worth drop by drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 weeks ago I decided that we both should get checked for heavy metals: Arsenic, Led and Mercury.&lt;br /&gt;Her level came normal. She carries some heavy metals.&lt;br /&gt;Mine levels came: not found at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Castor Oil has a legendary reputation to be a potent detox, if you are not familiar with the Gerson Therapy you should read the book and it is recommended there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite its unpleasant taste and texture, I plan on having those 2 tbsp. from time to time to make sure my body is clean, inside out.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it every single night on my face to wash my makeup off. It has done wonders for my skin. I used to have crazy oily skin, not kidding I would have to reapply makeup everyday by noon. But since I&#x27;ve started using castor oil on my skin to wash my face, I barely have any issues. It&#x27;s like I have all new skin!</li>
            <li> If you want a cracked bottle with oil everywhere,  this is the product for you. It should have been packed better.</li>
            <li> I use this for castor oil packs, in the eyes, lashes, brows and sometimes as a face and hair conditioner. I always keep some on hand. Love this oil--it&#x27;s A+.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to search for it store to store!  I save on gas, wear and tear on my car and no stress shopping.</li>
            <li> great price, super fast shipping and it worked wonders relieving my knee pain. ******** if you have chronic joint pain this works better pain pills without side effects</li>
            <li> A bit thick, I diluted it with coconut oil. I apply to eyebrows, lips and hair overnight. Have been using only for a couple days but lips are softer and don&#x27;t chap over night, hair is shinier!</li>
            <li> This product is okay.... I have been natural for a long time. I bought this product in hopes that it would make my hair grow faster. To be honest, I haven&#x27;t used this product as often to say it does or doesn&#x27;t work. But what I have noticed is that my hair has been growing. I am unsure if it is this product or the new techniques I am doing to my hair that is making my hair grow. But one thing is for sure, before you buy this product, you need to know what to pair it up with, like oils or conditioning products. I have just recently paired it with extra virgin olive oil and it&#x27;s a good thing I did that because it is not only thick, but if you leave it in your hair, it will weigh your hair down; that&#x27;s why pairing it up with an oil (for me) decreased the amount of product I use and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky, oily, and weighed down.</li>
            <li> I decided to make some salve for Christmas, which is the primary reason why I opted to look for castor oil, I found Heritage Caster Oil and it had good reviews as well as a decent price so chose to buy this brand for my first venture into castor oil. I bought the 32 oz bottle because it&#x27;s roughly how much I needed, and it arrived nicely packaged and secured, which I appreciated. The castor oil was a lot more viscous I had anticipated, but I noticed how good my hands were feeling while I was making the salve so I had no regrets about buying this particular oil. I did dilute it with grapeseed adding beeswax and the resulting salve was smooth, soothing, and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I use the salve it leaves my skin nicely supple but isn&#x27;t greasy in any way, just remember not to glob it on since it is very viscous (like molasses type of viscous). I&#x27;m a very tactile person and can be a little over sensitive to whatever is on my fingers and hands so this was a definite added plus. I had about 1 oz of left over oil after making my salve that I saved for my hair (curly) and some for an oil cleansing method for my face. I added the oil into a hair mask for a deep conditioning and it worked better then when I use olive oil (or whatever) only, and for the OCM I added it to some jojoba oil and grapeseed oil I had around, castor oil being the primary oil for my skin type so about 2:1 castor to jojoba/grapeseed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is unfamiliar with the oil cleansing method (OCM) here&#x27;s an article [...] It&#x27;s worked wonders for my face, and I use it about once every couple of days. If you decide to use this cleansing method castor oil does wonders, and I&#x27;d recommend using castor oil as the primary oil with a carrier. It&#x27;ll cleanse and by it&#x27;s very nature it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, remember a little goes a long way though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I was very satisfied with my purchase and will definitely purchase again. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to be added to hair or face regimens for anyone who is looking at natural solutions. It&#x27;s one of the few things that&#x27;s versatile, effective and cheap all in one.​r face regimens for anyone who is looking at natural solutions. It&#x27;s one of the few things that&#x27;s versatile, effective and cheap all in one.​</li>
            <li> Odorless. I&#x27;ve used the best brands of organic/virgin versions of macadamia oil, argan oil, grape seed oil, jojoba oil, coconut oil &amp; extra virgin olive oil. This oil is the very best for skin. No more flaky skin &amp; skin feels mind blowingly soft. This oil is thick so I have to sort of pat it on. It absorbs better than other oils yet the moisture has major staying power. Husband can&#x27;t stop feeling on me👐👌👏</li>
            <li> Thus far good results. I am yet to see any permanent positive effects on my skin however, because if I don&#x27;t use it for 2+ days my hands get dry and turn white.</li>
            <li> I use it to wash my face (this and hemp oil - castor oil can be very drying by itself).  My skin looks great.  This is a great price for being natural - way cheaper than the small bottles you buy in the store.  Keep it in the fridge.</li>
            <li> December 28, 2013  I love this castor oil! I use it on castor oil packs for my surgical scar everyday, and my husband and I have noticed that the scar is healing much faster! I also use this castor oil on my hair, eyelashes, and eyebrows. It is a large size for the price. I would recommend this product to anyone who loves to use at home beauty solutions like me.  December 12, 2015  I just wanted to write an update about the product. I started using this product as an oil cleansing method in place of face wash and my skin has never looked better.My eyebrows and eyelashes have thickened too!  I use this castor oil every night and still have the same bottle by the way.You only need a tiny amount. I would recommend this brand to anyone.</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase this again....have been using mine for a few months and I still have quite a lot left....my hair isn&#x27;t very thick or long but regardless, small quantities go a long way...it really does moisturize naturally curly hair and can be used while deep conditioning too...I live my castor oil</li>
            <li> I first learnt about the healing power of castor oil reading a yoga book. I had excruciating pain in my hamstrings for 2-1/2 years. (Over stretched them badly in my first yoga year and I was still running marathons). I tried to do as read in the yoga book: put a bit of castor oil in my hands, rub them strongly together to get the oil warm and then massage the area where the pain was. I did this every night before going to bed for only 7 days untill the pain completely disappeared! After 2-1/2 years of pain, in only 7 days with castor oil it completely went away! I just used it again yesterday since I had back pain really bad, and this morning is almost completely gone. I will do it again this evening and I am sure by tomorrow morning it will be completely gone. I recommend castor oil massages for any inflammation/muscles/ligaments/bodily pain, it really works! In India Ashtanga practitioners take 1 day a week of rest (Saturdays) and the take Castor oil bath, pouring a lot of oil all over body/face/hair and rest in savasana for about 10 minutes before washing it off in a shower. I tried this and the body will glow, and will feel much more open, with any stiffness gone away! I love Castor oil! It was almost always recommended in Cayce reading for healing! It really works! Thanks</li>
            <li> I use this as a moisturizer for my skin. I wash my face with a cleanser and afterwards I use a warm washcloth on my face to open up my pores. I use a little bit of the castor oil on my face and rub it in and then I make my washcloth wet with warm water and place it over my face to open up my pores even more and so that the castor oil can be absorbed into my skin and then I splash cold water on my face to close my pores. THIS HELPS WITH ACNE SCARS and WRINKLES!!!! I also use it on my eyelashes and eyebrows and it helps make them longer and thicker. LOVE THIS PRODUCT! :)</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used Castor Oil.  It is of great quality and thicker than expected.  I found it to be too toxic for my back pain, but great for my feet in combination w/heat.</li>
            <li> I use castor oil for many things - soap making, deep oil cleansing, eyelash and eyebrow treatment. This is a big 32-oz bottle at a reasonable price. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great. Product as described.</li>
            <li> So I have never written a review on here before. But I want to let all the buyers know this WORKS!! I purchased it to make my eyebrows thicker and grow more because they are thin from plucking and waxing. Let me tell you I have been using this EVERY night before bed..I massage it with an old mascara brush on my eyebrows and after about 3 weeks or a little more they have filled it amazingly and are a little darker. This stuff is seriously a miracle product. Try it! Be patient and apply it everyday and you will be amazed. I&#x27;m so happy on my journey to more eyebrow growth:)</li>
            <li> I have been ordering this from them for years. They and their product is very good!</li>
            <li> This product is very great. Whenever I am hurting anywhere on my body, I just take the oil, pour some on a cotton cloth, heat it up and put it on that area for 30 mins while laying down and my pain will just melt away. It&#x27;s like a perfect home remedy for pain.&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this product to one of my coworkers for her mother knees  and back pain. She said that its helping her a whole lot better then the pain pills.</li>
            <li> I needed to work on my edges and this has helped me over time and I had no doubt ordering it again. Good value for money considering the size</li>
            <li> We had moles in our yard.  They (or it, as they are very solitary beasts) have all but destroyed our yard for the last two years.  We&#x27;ve hired a mole hunter, in the past, but the cost is just too high, successful as he was.  We&#x27;ve searched the &amp;#34;net&amp;#34; for a solution, and have finally, found one. We almost purchased a product advertised to get rid of the moles, but the cost was just too high, until I looked at the components of the product.  It was 100% Castor Oil.  Now, who, in their right mind, would purchase an item at three times the price of Castor Oil for the same item?  Not us.  We&#x27;ve seen almost no incursions of the little critters since we&#x27;ve used this product.  When one shows up, we spray a bit of Castor Oil on the trail and mound.  It works.  It&#x27;s fairly cheap.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  It has other uses, too. Castor oil does not harm the lawn.  It will not harm our pets or the wildlife that visits our yard.  It has a little bit of scent to it, but we do not find it offensive. If you want a safe way to deal with moles, this is for you.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Bought this to regrow my hair after it started thinning after many treatments. Its huge for the price and since you only need a little to go a long way. Have had it for 8 months now and I&#x27;ll probably have to replace it next month. My hair has also started growing after 2 years of no growth.</li>
            <li> This product really helped with our mole problem.&lt;br /&gt;You can use Castor oil for many uses, it is a must to&lt;br /&gt;have around.</li>
            <li> And this is the best oil! Heritage Store is well known for their high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a pimple or any other skin issue, it really helps. I used half castor oil and half baking soda to help my girlfriend fix a bad splinter in her foot. I have used plain castor oil on cuts and my skin heals faster. It makes your hair thicker. My brother used it on a sprained ankle and it healed overnight!  It&#x27;s a wonder-oil!</li>
            <li> Makes a great aromatic and non-toxic 2 stroke oil in a pinch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will try it as a motor honey later on in my piston ring worn motor too!</li>
            <li> Just what I expected and it is serving its purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was quick and had no problems. Huge Bottle will last awhile</li>
            <li> EVERYTHING I EXPECTED IT TO BE...VERY HIGH QUALITY.</li>
            <li> I use this oil to condition my hair. When Applied to the ends, it tames the hair.  I added few drops of rosemary essential oil and it smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> This castor oil is great. It arrived in a speedy fashion with no leaks and packaged well. Works great when mixed with coconut oil for a hair oil treatment. Many other uses. Thick and rich in quality.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over a month ; still no results . Maybe I have to use it for longer period</li>
            <li> This came pretty quick. The bottle was neatly packed and protected...even the cap.  It is huge, so I was able to share with my mother. I am getting ready to order again for myself so my mom can use this one.</li>
            <li> Castor oil..what is there to say this is cold pressed and very good. Castor oil is also good for hard to deal with skin priblems. I use it for castor oil packs.</li>
            <li> Always works and fast too</li>
            <li> I use Castor Oil to make topical pain balms.  Heritage Store Castor Oil is my favorite for quality and price.</li>
            <li> Enjoying using this as an ingredient in my homemade makeup remover and leave-in hair conditioner.  Haven&#x27;t bought others in the past to compare, but it does exactly what I expected.  It is thick, sticky, and seeps into hair/skin.  It&#x27;s not magical, and I don&#x27;t consider it as wondrous as say, pure argan oil, but it&#x27;s a tool that does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> This product is for someone who hair craves a lot of moisture. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> Very generous amount of oil, good price, and great to work with. I have saturated flannel with this castor oil and made a pack to use to put on areas of pain, injuries, bruises, and many more uses.  I soak the flannel in the oil, put the flannel next to where the healing is to be done, I cover the flannel with plastic and I use a heating pad set on low on top of the oil soaked flannel and plastic. It actually appears to be working.</li>
            <li> I had to go back to my Grandmother&#x27;s old ways, it will never fail you.&lt;br /&gt;I use this for my knees, rub it on and keeps the pain away all day!&lt;br /&gt;I also use it for my legs, they feel nice.</li>
            <li> THE FORMULA WAS CHANGED IN THIS OIL. THE FIRST TIME I RECEIVED THIS CASTOR OIL, THE OIL WAS CLEAR LIKE SPRING WATER. AND NOW ITS A SLIGHT YELLOW TINGE IN THE BOTTLE OF OIL. THE OIL IS NOT WORKING FOR MY HAIR AT ALL AND I WISH THAT CERTAIN COMPANIES SHOULD JUST STICK TO THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT AND NOT CHANGE IT SO QUICKLY. IT WAS FINE THE WAY IT WAS!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the fomentations I used it with.  Thank-you Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 10+ years for everything from a sprained ankle, to sore muscles from working in the yard, even bruises. I&#x27;ve found my recovery time to be much quicker when used with either cotten or wool flannel accompanied by heat (either a heating pad or hot water bottle). I&#x27;m not sure why it works, but I am very happy that it does.  I&#x27;ve even convinced my husband. He thinks it is excellent also. I don&#x27;t know that it would work for everyone, but I know it works for us. I do believe in natural cures when possible.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to family and friends for years.</li>
            <li> I love this.  I use it a lot.  It is a great addition to homemade salves and lotions.  I use a bit on my face at night and it makes my skin soft.  I mix a few drops of peppermint essential oil into a teaspoon of it and rub it onto sore muscles and such.</li>
            <li> I wish i could just show you the difference this has made. My hair was at a stand still back in october. I start this in November, i use it once a week and let it sit for a few hours in my hair. Then shampoo twice to get it all out. Let me just say my hair grew like crazy. It was an inch past my shoulders in October and come January my hair was an inch past my bra line. I trimmed in the first week on February to just above my bra line and now 3 and half months later my hair is 3, almost 4 inches longer. I dont even use this stuff that often anymore and my hair just keeps growing. I LOVE THIS STUFF. Most definitely a holy grail item!</li>
            <li> Great product Great price from The  Heritage store. My wife has been using these quality products recommended in the Edgar Cayce readings for the past 40 years and will attest to their quality and integrity. This product has amazing health and healing properties used as Cayce prescribed She uses this for the Castor Oil packs and I can say I have seen unbelievable results from this product. Not surprising it is known as the Palma Christy</li>
            <li> The product arrived leaking with the safety seal off- but once the product itself was REPURCHASED- it&#x27;s as good as people says it is- skin and hair very soft- works as a compress for painful joints.</li>
            <li> Great product -Great price.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful.  Recently I have been using it on warts and tags; They are miraculously disappearing!  Excellent product, excellent price, arrived on time, very well-packed.  I am recommending it as the best!</li>
            <li> We love this Castor Oil. We used it many times and love the benefits.</li>
            <li> This is excellent castor oil. It comes perfectly packaged, so no spills. It has almost no castor oil odor. Use it for moisturizing by adding  a drop to your normal cream or lotion.  Castor oil packs speed healing for many medical conditions as colds and bronchitis , menstrual cramps, urinary infections, anything internal. For cuts and scratches, use this oil on a bandage to cover and protect the wound. Speeds healing and protects from infections.</li>
            <li> I thought I ordered the small size but upon receiving the item, I was surprised to see the JUMBO bottle. It seems it will last forever. :) This oil is great for hair and skin. It moisturizes dry skin very well. Before going to bed, I apply it to my feet and cuticles, and wait 10-15 minutes to let it sink in.</li>
            <li> This products works good and I have been using it for my hair and it makes my hair so soft and nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten this before and ordered three. I ordered three again and i opened the package and the bottle was cut open and spilled everywhere and i oped the cap and the bottle didn&#x27;t even have a seal. Like wtf is wrong with people? Don&#x27;t package stuff that leaking!!!</li>
            <li> When I say, this will last you a lifetime. I mean it will last you a lifetime. I purchase this oil in April 2013 after I did a big chop. Not only I am still using it till today, but it works amazingly. My hair retains length so much better, and this made my hair much stronger.this definitely​ deserve more than 5 stars</li>
            <li> Great for softening my skin and hair! I will order another bottle soon.</li>
            <li> Although castor oil is a miracle product for so many reasons, I bought it mostly for nurturing my hair-----and boy does it! A little background first: I have Hypothyroidism and also have bleached my hair for 20 years. I was in desperate need of a miracle! Enter castor oil. It is so moisturizing and is great for every type of hair out there. Castor oil contains vitamin E, minerals, proteins, antibacterial and anti-fungicidal properties. Scientists attribute its healing benefits to its unusual chemical composition, which consists of a triglyceride of fatty acids with ricinoleic acid of up to 90 percent. In addition to healing benefits, castor oil also contains anti-inflammatory properties, all of which are related to healthy hair growth. Here are 7 ways to incorporate castor oil into a healthy hair regimen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Added Shine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to researchers studying the light reflected from hair samples, castor oil hair treatments were found to increase the luster of hair. This effect is caused by castor oil&#x60;s ability to coat the hair shaft, sealing in moisture and creating a silkier surface. Dull hair may benefit from the use of castor oil hair treatments, either in conditioners or in the form of a hot oil treatment. For optimum shine, use a hot oil treatment once per month or moisturizing treatments weekly. However, more frequent use than this can result in an oily scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Improve Scalp Circulation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Castor oil on your scalp can help to increase circulation. The strengthening effect it has on hair follicles can stimulate hair growth in cases of alopecia, or hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Prevent Hair Loss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The antifungal and antibacterial properties in castor oil are useful in combating scalp infections, such as follliculitus, ringworm and peidra. Infections and scalp disorders are major causes of hair loss. Pathogens and micro-organisms such as viruses, bacteria, fungus and parasites can attack your skin and scalp, leading to bald patches and impeding hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Control Split Ends&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Castor oil as a conditioning treatment can help reduce split ends, which in turn prevents hair loss and breakage. Omega 6 essential fatty acids, vitamin E, proteins and other nutrients in castor oil can penetrate dry and damaged hair, smoothing rough cuticles and helping the hair shaft retain moisture. Castor oil has a viscous consistency, so mixing it with lighter oils -- such as olive and jojoba -- makes it easier to evenly and sufficiently distribute it throughout your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Sealing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Castor oil is a popular ingredient in hair products formulated for highly textured hair because it is known for its ability to seal moisture in the hair, combatting the natural dryness of these hair types. Apply it after moisturizing with a water-based product for a long-lasting seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Treatment of Dry Scalp or Dandruff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Castor oil contains fungicidal, germicidal and insecticidal properties, making it an effective treatment for many causes of dandruff. In addition, castor oil hair treatments seal in moisture when applied to either the hair or the scalp, making it an excellent scalp moisturizer. If you have dry scalp or dandruff, apply castor oil directly to dry areas prior to washing or shampooing the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Moisturizing Scalp &amp; Thickening Hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Omega 6 fatty acids in castor oil help keep your scalp from drying out, while regular use of castor oil may encourage thicker hair growth. Unrefined castor oil is preferred over refined types, because it contains more nutrients and healing properties. Use castor oil for hot oil treatments and scalp massages to stimulate hair growth and keep your hair soft and manageable. Leave the oil in your hair overnight, covered with a plastic cap to trap heat and enhance penetration. In the morning, wash your hair thoroughly with shampoo to remove all traces of castor oil, then style as usual.ld patches and impeding hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.

            <li> Yes, I did research on line to treat my dog&#x27;s fatty tumors and two things came up regularly: add turmeric to the food and rub the tumor with castor oil. This oil is nice and thick and she seems to like it.</li>
            <li> The shipping is fast! I received the product the next day after I purchased it and for the 32 oz is pretty cheap compare to other castor oil. I gave four stars because I just started using it and I&#x27;m not sure if this product will work for me. I have to wait before I can see the result.</li>
            <li> Beautiful large bottle. Received the box today...box not damaged. Opened box to see the air packs intact and oil in the box and on the other item I received. Not sure if this was Amazon or the seller. However, I love Castor oil. It is great on the skin and hair. I wish I could really put my heart in this and say more wonderful news but having a cracked bottle and someone on the other end still decided to ship it pretty puts a bad taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better quality castor oils I&#x27;ve used. It doesn&#x27;t have a harsh scent and absorbs well. Good price too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it very soothing for foot rubs. I&#x27;ve had issues with one of my ankles (on and off) after injuring it a couple of times. Using this castor oil, along with specific exercises has gone a long way towards improving my foot mobility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now trying this on a couple of brown spots to see if it&#x27;s effective for removing those, as I&#x27;ve read. I&#x27;ve noted that the one large one on my arm that I&#x27;ve been applying this oil too for a couple of months, most nights has faded quite a bit already. Hopefully will disappear completely. I know of other people who have had great success using castor oil for this purpose.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I used this product to remove a wart on my face. You might think that is strange and I did too. I remembered my Mother in law told me to try it and after applying it for one week several times a day, the wart is gone. This is a great product. I learned a lot of uses for it by using a search engine to find information.</li>
            <li> I love love love this Castor Oil. I ordered it so that I could mix it with Sunflower Oil and use it for the Oil Cleansing Method on my face and let me tell you, my skin has never been better! My combination skin has normalized, complexion is more even, and I&#x27;m using a little of the straight Castor oil around my eyes a few times a week and the fine lines around my eyes are minimized! And would you believe that is ALL I am using on my face? I have eliminated cleanser, exfoliated, toner, moisturizer, lip cream, and eye cream (I am in the beauty industry and am a complete product junkie, so this is major). I also use it on my hands and cuticles before bed and they are softer an ever! I have also recommended it to my clients as a dry scalp treatment and they have had great results! And the value on this product is great, it is HUGE. A bottle a third of the size costs the same at Whole Foods. I know there are so many more great uses for this oil that I really look forward to trying!</li>
            <li> SO PLEASED WITH YOU GUYS FOR THE WAY YOU SHIPPED MY PRODUCT.  WOW COULDN&#x27;T ASK FOR BETTER I&#x27;M SO PLEASED HERE YOU ARE WONDERFUL WILL GET MY BUSINESS FOR NOW ON AND WILL RECOMMEND YOU TO EVERYONE I KNOW THAT ORDERS ONLINE FOR SURE FOR SURE.........</li>
            <li> I have purchased castor oil before and this brand has a stronger/peculiar smell. The expiration says it expires a year from now.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall it isn&#x27;t bad....but I think I will purchase my old brand instead of this.</li>
            <li> I love using this stuff in my curly hair.  I get my hair damp (so there is moisture for it to actually be retaining) then apply a tiny amount from roots to tips.  It gives my hair strength- less breakage and fallout, with more shine.  I also massage my scalp with a mixture of castor oil and amla hair oil for a deep scalp stimulating conditioner once a week over night.&lt;br /&gt;After showering I apply a tiny amount to my hair as a hair serum.  It reduces frizz big time.  It&#x27;s also a fabulous lip gloss.  And I have added a few drops to thicken up some of my lotions.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my face to keep acne from cropping up.  My adult acne is fading away, including the scars.  I have been applying it to my eyelashes to help them grow, but haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference.  It might just take some time, or maybe that won&#x27;t work for me, we will see!&lt;br /&gt;I have done a few castor oil packs, which is very relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff has so many healing properties, I highly recommend it for your skin, hair, and body.</li>
            <li> Not really much to say about Castor Oil. Moles don&#x27;t like it and that&#x27;s what I bought it for. Good product, quick ship.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with castor oil now. This oil has so many uses it&#x27;s unbelievable. But this is my biggest testimony to it&#x27;s amazingness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on a medication that can cause scalp acne for some.. lucky me, I got it. The bumps were at worst, 2&amp;#34; in diameter, very swollen and so painful they hurt when I would walk! My hair was thinning and I was starting to have bad anxiety every time I had to wash and brush my hair. I tried using T-Gel every few days, it just made my hair so dry and was starting to cause dandruff from the scabs, while it was treating the current bumps, it was not preventing new ones. Then I tried buying expensive shampoo, still no help. So, after researching castor oil and it&#x27;s medicinal properties, I decided to try it on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRULY a GOD SEND!&lt;br /&gt;I worked my way through my hair, parting it, then dabbed/brushed the castor oil on my scalp with a 2&amp;#34; bristle paint brush. I applied it liberally, and once I was done - combed it gently through my hair. I pinned it up and put a plastic shower cap on. I left it in for a few hours, then showered. I had to wash my hair 3 times to get the oil out, and I put conditioner in very lightly at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week later.. SCALP ACNE COMPLETELY CLEARED UP !!!!! and after 2 treatments (once a week) my HAIR ISN&#x27;T THINNING ANYMORE!!! I&#x27;ve even noticed my hair seems to be growing in places I never noticed were sparse! I&#x27;ve been doing it once a week for about a month now, and it is officially part of my beauty regimen for the rest of my life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd - less of a book - testimony:&lt;br /&gt;I had a scrape biopsy done on a mole. After the initial would closed, I started rubbing castor oil on it at night - it healed way fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd testimony:&lt;br /&gt;I bought an empty mascara tube with wand. Put the castor oil in, and at night I brush it on my lashes. My lashes are growing - very slowly, but I do see a difference - and mascara glides on much easier with less clumping (no I did not change brands of mascara).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4th testimony:&lt;br /&gt;Traditional use, and why it&#x27;s in the laxative isle. My friend&#x27;s son was dealing with horrid constipation. After taking this, a few hours later and an entire role of toilet paper, he was back to his normal maniacal 8yr old self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there are many other uses for this magical stuff, but I haven&#x27;t tried them yet.. but oh.. I will!!!t change brands of mascara).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4th testimony:&lt;br /&gt;Traditional use, and why it&#x27;s in the laxative isle. My friend&#x27;s son was dealing with horrid constipation. After taking this, a few hours later and an entire role of toilet paper, he was back to his normal maniacal 8yr old self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there are many other uses for this magical stuff, but I haven&#x27;t tried them yet.. but oh.. I will!!!</li>
            <li> I use it for my eyelashes.  Ive seen some new lashes start to sprout. I also use it for foot massages.  Works wonders</li>
            <li> it helps to make you go. Just rub over your abdomen before going to bed and it will help in the morning. Besides that I have used castor oil for helping me go into labor. Would not suggest anyone doing that because I labored for 28 hours after that.</li>
            <li> Great off keeping the moles and voles away from the shrubs and plants!  Just run a line around the shrubs and plants!  Commercial products to do the same are Caster Oil mixed with dirt!</li>
            <li> you rub this on, and boom its like magic time. ladies will love if you have some of this handy for evening sessions, and so will men too.</li>
            <li> The oil arrived promptly and was appropriately packaged.  Used in a castor oil pack, it is most calming and relaxing .</li>
            <li> I purchased this specific item for a friend. She was satisfied, and since then has put it to good  use (have not heard yet any complaints). I have previously bought the same item (just smaller size), and have used it in many ways. I, too, am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful nice and thick, loved the way it left my hair and great for the face and hands. :)</li>
            <li> excellent product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use castor oil for castor oil packs for gall bladder stones. Very goog quality oil. I buy all my castor oil her.</li>
            <li> On time and high quality.  This was a great experience.</li>
            <li> I have been using castor oil packs for years, and have finally found a great castor oil at a great price.  The castor oils that I have used in the past, all had a screw off top which would get very messy.  This one has a push top which keeps the oil from leaking all over the place.  The color is a deep amber, whereas the last castor oil I had was a pale yellow.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Good price good value!</li>
            <li> Use this for my skin hair and nails! Very versatile</li>
            <li> I use this castor oil for making homemade soap. It&#x27;s a great product. I will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li> A bit too sticky .. I was hoping this would be smoother on the skin, with that said I am still using it.</li>
            <li> I am really upset, I usually do not leave comments but this time I got to do it and I hope that you improve your service. I paid next day delivery for this order and it arrived on time, but they did not protect the plastic bottle with anything and as soon as I opened the box there was oil leaking all over my carpet! the bottle broke on one side and the inside box and the plastic it was covered with were all oily. I won&#x27;t return it because I changed the bottle to a glass bottle I have and I need it for my ovarian cyst treatment.</li>
            <li> I was my face with this and another oil, mixing the two together.  I have had this bottle for about 7 months and am no where near running out.  Great deal for a 32 oz bottle and I expect it to last me a total of 1.5 to 2 years before I need to replace it.  I shopped all around before I purchased here on Amazon and this was the best deal I could find.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand of Castor Oil I will buy.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend uses this for making makeup, hair conditioners and many other health and beauty related products. She loves it and says it is the best quality she has ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is awesome on the 32 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> Used another brand but this is cheaper and works even better.</li>
            <li> I rated this with 5 stars because this castor oil came to me in 2 days, I love this castor oil for my hair.</li>
            <li> I used it on my face mixed with olive oil, one part castor oil and ten parts olive oil, for the Oil cleansing method (cleaning your face with oils and steamed wash cloth).  I did the Oil cleansing method for about two weeks with olive oil only and my skin felt great, the minute I used castor oil, I ended up having terrible rash on my face the next morning. I didint&#x27;t blame the castor oil at first, I thought it was the Oil cleansing method, that my skin reacted in general to the oils I was using on it. After about two months fighting perioral dermatitis, having red,painfully itchy, flaky skin around my nose and on chin I found my cure (Oregano oil softgels, pinching them and applying on my face every morning and night for about a week) and kept any oils, lotions, creams away from my face, the only thing I would put on my face as a moisturizer was 99% pure aloe vera gel, twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;So, after my face cleared up I decided to use the rest of that big bottle of castor oil on my hair, figured out that it&#x27;s fine since I&#x27;m not using it on my face (again I wasn&#x27;t blaming the castor oil for causing perioral dermatitis), I rubbed it in my hair and slept with it, I didn&#x27;t see anything inusual the next morning so repeated in two days. After the second time I used it on my hair I woke up with red, tchy, flaky skin on my neck, shoulders and my scalp. My skin was painfully itchy for about a week. Then it hit me, it was the castor oil.&lt;br /&gt;Think twice before using it on your face or hair, at least do a skin test before.</li>
            <li> The product is great. I used it for hot castor oil packs on my bladder and it worked. I had benign but transitional tumours inside my bladder and after applying the castor oil packs the tumours shrunk! This particular kind works the best.</li>
            <li> I use it with a flannel and water bag.&lt;br /&gt;It heals all the organs and skin.&lt;br /&gt;It should be used on the regular basis to help.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review hoping that it will also help someone out there. So, I was experiencing really bad hair loss. I had blood work done, they checked my thyroid, everything came out perfect. I had a serious haircut, I tried some very expensive treatments and shampoos, nothing worked. Decided to do some research on my own, came across castor oil. Researched the best products based on reviews. Decided to purchase this one. It works. This is what I do, night time only (I bought some plastic shower caps first): I combine organic honey, castor oil, pure cold pressed olive oil and 1 egg yolk, stir everything well using a wooden spoon until it becomes somewhat of a paste then apply it first on my scalp, massaging well. I use the whole thing covering all my hair until it looks, well, pretty nasty. I then put the shower cap on, wrap a towel around my head and go to sleep. Wake up, shampoo my hair twice then use a deep conditioner. I did this two-three times a week. Two weeks later, the amount of hair lost is about three quarters less. My hair looks much healthier. I am pretty sure that, soon, I will experience some new hair growth too. Please do not ask about quantities for the mask, try it once and adjust the quantities as you see fit, it all depends of the length of your hair. That&#x27;s about it. Wishing you all well.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Only used it a few weeks so far. I can see a difference in thickness and some new hairs growing. Only down side is the oil smell.</li>
            <li> Great quality, great value, would buy again</li>
            <li> Many great uses for this product  (head to toe).</li>
            <li> Natural hair chick here! 4a/4b apl very dense, fine hair. Really helps lock in the moisture and keeps it soft. Love it! Great bargain!</li>
            <li> Smells very fresh. The last castor oil I had (not Heritage Castor Oil) in retrospect smells rancid in comparison to this.</li>
            <li> Youtube has a introduction video on how to prepare a castor oil pack. Excellent, feel great afterwards. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> I thought I would do a review on this as I have been using the OCM for over a month. I wanted to wait at least a month to review bc I know some have had adverse reactions with the OCM after a mo or so. i have not had such. I still have some very moderate breakouts but it pales in comparison to my skin prior to this. I do suffer from both oily and dry skin. Im always trying to find a healthy balance as my skin is now reaching the age of being concerned with wrinkles as well as acne. It sucks fighting them both; until now. I feel like im keeping my breakouts at bay while helping my skin fight aging. I have very acne prone/dry skin and I wash my face with 70-30 EVOO and this. (30%) Ive been very lucky to not have had a reaction so far. I will continue to use until. I will say I read all the reviews on eyelashes and brows. I can use a lil more of both. after a week with this on my eyelashes I could see a diff. So much length that I felt the need to get out my old curler( have not used for so long bc i didnt feel my lashes were long enough) this not only made mine grow but very brittle. I have never had broken lashes ever. but after curling (using CO one wk) my lashes have completely broken off. just one area but very obvious. maybe this just makes em too sensitive?? use with caution on lashes. be extra delicate when curling. other than that, no complaints. IDK i just am kinda confused by the whole thing. most recommend for moisturizing, some recommend it for overly oily skin since it will dry you out. IDK I dont understand the science if anyone could explain it to me id be grateful. does it hydrate or dry?? Skin is drying ( less acne) lashes are broken...</li>
            <li> The product was high quality and the price was right. I will order again from this site in the future.</li>
            <li> I saw some reviews that said the bottle was damaged and leaking, but I guess the company must have fixed the problem because mine came well wrapped and in perfect condition, one day early. As for the actual oil, it makes my skin incredibly soft. I haven&#x27;t used it on my hair yet, but I plan to. Some people have compared it to vitamin E oil, but it&#x27;s not as thick. It does have a bit of an odor, but it isn&#x27;t terribly strong.</li>
            <li> I am the owner of Self-Spa Soapworks; look for my preview shop on Facebook.  Caster Oil is an important ingredient for making soap because caster oil is one of the major ingredients which cause a great lather.  The quality of the caster oil used has a direct effect on the quality of soap which results.  Price is very important because I want to offer my customers a quality soap for a reasonable cost.  Heritage Store Castor Oil is an excellent quality caster oil, and this 32 Ounce bottle helps me keep costs under control.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the product and use it for my hair and skin and it works wonders. I ordered the product  on a Monday and had it by Thursday. I am very impressed and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I always buy a big bottle of this and use plenty on my hair and scalp. I use castor as a pre-oiling treatment. I have straight, bleached, long hair with henna on it. Even though it didn&#x27;t help with hair loss as much as rosemary did, it helps cleanse my scalp better when I apply it for an hour before shampoo. Castor also gives my hair great strength, moist, and shine without being heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the people who henna: Even though I don&#x27;t henna anymore, the oil somehow seems to make my henna more red and vibrant after shampooing it out. Months later after my last henna application, my hair is still retains its vibrant and deep red.</li>
            <li> This oil does amazing things for the skin. Applied it to a rash I&#x27;d been experiencing that antibiotic creams was unable to get rid of for several years. In just a few days of applying this oil each morning the rash disappeared completely. It was amazing. Even though it was not initially purchased for that purpose, it was wonderful to discover the healing properties. Great side benefit.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of lotion it is great for the winter.  It leaves my skin soft and silky....I get lots of compliments on how soft my hands are and my boyfriends just loves how soft I feel.  It has also lightened my brown spots on my hands.  I am African American and this product is great for our skin!</li>
            <li> but it works great for hair and scalp. It&#x27;s somewhat too heavy for the face, so I cut it with sweet almond oil. For my hair, I mixed it with rosemary eo and coconut oil. It made my hair shine and brought life to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s castor oil and will come in handy in soap making.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use for eyebrow regrowth.  I must admit that I was a skeptic.  However, after just a couple of weeks of use, my eyebrows are growing again!  It has even darkened them a bit.  On a whim, I decided to massage it into my scalp and my hair prior to bed.  After doing this just once (and shampooing it out in the morning), my hair was immediately noticeably softer.  I have continued this ritual a few days per week, and not only is my hair softer than a bunny&#x27;s, it is growing as well.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love castor oil because of the benefits it gives my hair:). It&#x27;s just I am not sure if the castor oil spoils overtime because it turned a different color?</li>
            <li> Yes I love this I can never find it at stores and it&#x27;s great I will defiantly buy again.</li>
            <li> Cool,shipped promptly!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Using it as skin care treatment and I can&#x27;t believe how a small amount of this mixed with 2 parts olive oil has transformed my skin!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service</li>
            <li> Using this in combination with Jojoba Oil really has been the answer for my oily skin. It even reduces the aperance of blemishes without stripping my skin of it&#x27;s natural oils. Just two drops in your palm with a drop of Jojoba (my combo, yours may be different) rubbed together on some steamy skin &#x3D; glowing and supple skin people will notice. Add this to your regular routine, it&#x27;s inexpensive but with incredible results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of reviews about this product.  I&#x27;m using it every night on my scalp for my 3 month castor oil challenge. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and my hair does look longer and thinker.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! Good Price! Works like castor oil I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. Is a good size for the price.</li>
            <li> A good way to buy a large quantity.</li>
            <li> I read on the internet that people use castor oil on their hair to get oil back in your hair and that is why I ordered this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I like the smell of the oil; however, I have been using it for a few weeks and see a big difference in the quickness of how my hairs are growing. I have a lot more hair growing where I have been applying it (front hairline and eyebrows) albeit they are very fine..</li>
            <li> This works better for my hair than JBCO, it&#x27;s worth every penny. JBCO cost more but you get more bang for your buck with this product.</li>
            <li> Not familiar with this seller but recently purchased this brand at Whole Foods. To me, it smells like wood. It&#x27;s not bad but I haven&#x27;t tried masking it with other essential oils yet. I initially bought this to try out the Oil Cleansing Method everyone seems to be raving about. After buying some jojoba oil as a carrier, I decided to try my own method out of fear that this new method would backfire as it has done with many other users. I use the OCM once a week with the castor and jojoba oil combined but for the rest of the week, if I have any minor blemishes, I will use this as a spot treatment overnight or before heading into the shower. So far this seems to work for me. I have very sensitive dry skin, especially in the colder months, so overuse of this product is a no-no for me because it&#x27;ll only make my eczema prone skin even worse. Seems kinda funny since it&#x27;s an oil but people aren&#x27;t kidding when they say it is indeed drying! I&#x27;m rating this 4 out of 5 because of my dislike of the scent and how thick it is, I have troubles washing it completely off so I just rinse with my usual philosophy cleanser afterwards.</li>
            <li> The oil is meeting all my expectations, me and my husband are very please with this product. I bought 6 320z bottles and it was a lot cheaper the buying at the health food store.</li>
            <li> I juse Castor Oil for everything. This brand is awesome and very cost effective I brought the 16oz last time and it took some time to use it but now I use castor oil from head to toe.  I mix castor oil in with other oils like evoo and coconut oil also it works wonders on my eyelashes and eyebrow growth!  Just a wonderful product all around</li>
            <li> Help relieved joint inflamation</li>
            <li> This works for allot of ailments. Boils/cuts/rashes/bug bites/hair growth/skin moisturizer/body &amp; facial skin repair . It works fast as well.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this castor oil as a massage oil for my scalp/hair. Heard some good things about it promoting hair growth and thickening hair. I also added it to my homemade shea butter recipe that I also use on my hair and body and I love the way it makes my skin and hair feel. Just started using it so can&#x27;t say it has made my hair grow or benefit it in any way yet but I plan on updating with results in a couple months or so. I definitely recommend this product its very good price plus good quality and huge bottle for cheap.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for getting rid of moles,</li>
            <li> When I first started looking for castor oil, to use to make home made beauty products, I was shocked by the price.  The reviews on this product were what drove me to purchase it.  This is a very high quality product, and in my opinion, much better quality than many of the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; brands out there.  If you&#x27;re looking for castor oil and you want high quality without having to pay obscene amounts, this is the right brand and product for you!</li>
            <li> I read an article that a mixture of castor oil and dish soap would keep cats from pooping in my flower beds, but didn&#x27;t work so well.  I have tried just about everything...store bought animal deterrent, sharp rocks and wire over the soil, black pepper, red pepper, etc.  Nothing works.</li>
            <li> helped to make great  mole movers out of the yard</li>
            <li> works great in soaps but you have to be very careful in the amount you use because the final product will be greasy</li>
            <li> Too Much to say about this Particular Brand of Castor Oil.... All great of course so many uses... This Brand in particular is the BEST</li>
            <li> I love castor oil and since I have been using it in my beauty care. Its a must in my home and care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to promote hair growth.  In 3 months I&#x27;ve had almost 4 inches growth.  This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> I use Taliah Waajid curly curl cream to do twist outs on my 3c/4a hair and this stuff works PERFECTLY to hold in moisture and add shine to my kinky-curly tresses. It also works well as an emulsifier when used with Olive Oil Ecostyler styling gel. I made my own twisting cream with it and the castor oil and my twists have stayed put, are shiny, and feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I use it for hair growth and to thicken my hair, so far so good, i do not care for the smell though :)</li>
            <li> used this for my hair and internally. Worked very well for me. Plus it lasted a whole year. very happy</li>
            <li> Now I can see why so many natural product sites include discussion of the benefits of a good castor oil. This one is high quality, and though I purchased for my hair, it can see that it would benefit my skin, foot and internal care as well.</li>
            <li> I use this for my natural style hair and it is the best oil I have ever used. For those going natural, stay away from petroleum and mineral oil based products since it causes your hair to become very hard and attract a lot of dirt.  I live this oil and I use it every day and would not change a thing about it.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully pure product.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased an 8-oz. bottle and it was not enough for my castor oil packs.  I placed another order and went with the 32-oz. bottle and it is more than enough.  It&#x27;s nice that I can save it and keep using it down the road, though.  I really like this oil because it&#x27;s not as sticky or thick as some of the others; do not get me wrong, it&#x27;s definitely sticky and thick, but this brand is much easier to work with, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My left fallopian tube was  blocked for over 10 years. I used this Castrol oil along with the wool cloth, and I no longer have a block tube or scar tissue</li>
            <li> I do castor oil treatments on my hair weekly! This by far is the best brand I&#x27;ve tried !</li>
            <li> I like it, hope it works on my eyebrows and eyelashes!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for me but my boyfriend used it first and he loooves it! He has rosacea and this hydrates his beard and head so good that it doesn&#x27;t flake. I&#x27;m looking forward to using it as a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> Excellent price for castor oil, much better than I can find in store. I use it for homemade beauty products. I also like that the expiration date is several years later.</li>
            <li> Good for many things!</li>
            <li> I had someone tell me that castor oil works great for permed black hair; It makes my hair very managable. Good product.</li>
            <li> The lid was not on good on one of the bottles, loss was maybe 1/2 of cup. :-(</li>
            <li> The package arrived on time. However, it had leaked in the box. Some how the seal was stuck inside the lid and not attached to the bottle. I attempted to use this product to help grow my eyebrows fuller. While I have noticed some growth, it gave me a rash in that area. I am still going to use this for castor oil packs since I did not get a rash when I applied it to my arms.</li>
            <li> I needed an oil that would condition and smooth my hair out, and this did the job! My hair has been shinier, cleaner, softer, smoother, and a lot more! I would definitely recommend this to others. I mix this with other oils such as argan and coconut oil and the results have been tremendous!</li>
            <li> I really love it, have used 1/2 already, will order again...living in a small town, its hard to find quality Castor Oil, and other&lt;br /&gt;essential oils,,,thanks j&#x27;net</li>
            <li> Item arrived in good order and is a fine quality oil.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!!! I suffer from chronic pain and read several different reviews about different castor oils and how it can halp in alleviating pain.  I chose to buy Heritage Store Castor oil (32 ounce) because I had read many positive reviews for this brand specifically.  I am very happy I chose Heritage.  I had breast cancer and underwent extensive major surgery, and as a consequence,  I suffer from pain every day of my life.&lt;br /&gt;Before taking a bath each night, my husband would rub the Heritage castor oil on my areas of pain, and then apply saran wrap over that.  I would then sit with a heating pad on that area for around 15 to 20 minutes.  I would then then take a bath to wash all of the remaining oil away.  This helped my pain tremendously.  I would highly recommend the Heritage Castor Oil!</li>
            <li> Bought for my mother I can see some hair growth, she just want it to thicken up. i give 3 stars</li>
            <li> The product is more than expected. It is in great quantity. It surpasses all my expectations. I use it for my skin and even mixed a quantity with my back pain linement.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received this product.  I use it with my shea butter mix, oil mix, leave in conditioner mix..... and sometime I just use it on the ends of my hair..... I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  The pro ducted was shipped overseas in a timely manner.... I AM PLEASED....did I say I&#x27;m SOOOOOO HHHHHAAAAAPPPPYYYY!</li>
            <li> Very versatile product! Use it on your skin or hair, or even consume it for the colon cleanse. I love it! And the price I bought it for makes this oil one of my favorite products on earth ;)</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand of castor oil to do heated applications over my c-section scar to help soften the tissue. I was having a lot of pain around the scar, and the tissue felt really thick, tight, and restricted. I started noticing a difference after only 2 heated applications (much sooner than I thought), and have been experiencing much better results than I expected. I put the castor oil directly onto my skin over the scar, cover with an old towel, and place a heating pad on top, which I leave in place for 20 minutes or so. My skin is softer, and the scar feels less thick and tight. This could be used over any scar, not just for c-sections. There is more mobility to the tissue around the scar as well. I am extremely pleased with the results. This is a great product with many uses. I will keep purchasing it!</li>
            <li> Love this castor oil and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin this is an excellent product as a moisturizer.  It does not have a fragrance, stabilizers or any unknown chemicals to cause a skin reaction.  It does not go bad like typical lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it at the end of your shower with a light rinse before turning off the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Then towel dry to remove any excess oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and good</li>
            <li> I must say I&#x27;m very impressed. Caster oil packs are making a difference in pain management. The quality of this product is excellent.  Was quite suprised by the many uses for caster oil. Great on the age spots and general massage. You can really feel it working. The best suprise was how in one use it whitened my teeth, removing coffee stains and soothes agitated gums.  Great natural boost to the immune system!</li>
            <li> I use this to make diy make-up, eye liner, brow gel, mascara. Its regrowing thickening my hair. I love it.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and as expected.  I use this to wash my face.  It does work.</li>
            <li> This 32 oz bottle of pure castor oil was less than $13.00 with the shipping.  it is good quality castor oil.  Walgreens wants nearly&lt;br /&gt;$6.00 for 4 oz.  Vitacost was reliable and prompt as usual.</li>
            <li> I use castor oil all the time, it&#x27;s the only thing that get my feet totally soft, yes i use it for other things but as a nurse (ie on my feet 12+ hours a day) and social dancing most nights my feet were in bad shape. Now they feel much better and are soft, it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway this is great for quality and quantity, I love the flip cap, granted I keep it in a smaller bottle for everyday use, oh, and the price is terrific.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own face wash with castor oil/olive oil.  It came wrapped up very well where it would not have a chance of spilling.  It was a great price for the amount I received.</li>
            <li> This oil is high quality and worked wonderfully in my lotions and soaps. I live in very rural area and am glad I can order it!</li>
            <li> Great value for my money and great, top quality. I use it for everything. I will definitely buy this again and again!</li>
            <li> I add a little bit of Castor Oil into my home made soaps, and the oil has good lathering qualities.  Not too much, or you&#x27;ll have a very gooey mixture.  Heritage Store brand is pretty good, and a few batches in, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have very very coarse 4b hair as well as severe acne. I have been wearing weaves and braids for years to avoid my hair and recently starting working with my hair in its natural state. Due to the extended weave wearing and braiding, my edges had thinned out significantly. So, I started oiling my scalp with castor oil each night. I also use it in hot oil treatments (as a pre-poo). I immediately noticed growth in places which previously bald. I also heard that castor oil is good for skin. So, I started putting it on acne scars and on the challenging parts of my face. Honestly, it is one of the best skin care products I have EVER used. I use it nightly now on acne scars and dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing and is, by far, a number one staple in my household now.</li>
            <li> huge bottle so I should be good for a while. I use it for castor oil tummy heat wraps and it helps with my pain. It came packaged in the bottle in a plastic bag in case it leaked, but it did not...if I ever run out...I will buy again!</li>
            <li> this one is any thing oil very goog</li>
            <li> I bought this because I saw on Pinterest that castor oil can help with growing/lengthening your eyelashes and promoting hair growth for your eyebrows. I truly believe my eyelashes are longer and my eyebrows are thicker. I had over-plucked them to get rid of the white ones. Mistake! They were getting skimpy looking but now they are really filled in and I bought a product from Ulta to cover the white so... Problem solved! Also I had read on Pinterest that castor oil can remove moles, the jury is still out on that one although I think maybe one is shrinking and another one is lighter but they are still there. I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of this product and I&#x27;m sure there are many other uses that I haven&#x27;t discovered yet.</li>
            <li> I use this after my shower. Makes my skin feel softer.</li>
            <li> This oil has so many uses - but I use this on my scalp. This is wonderful for hair growth and strengthening plus it&#x27;s a great moisturizer! Just rub this on the scalp a couple of times a day and you will be AMAZED! This oil is thick and not runny, if you don’t like the smell or thickness you can mix with other carrier oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a severe hair loss issue and using this oil helped me grow my hair back in a couple of months! Consistency is the KEY! I LOVE it and would highly recommend it to anyone. If you find yourself getting bumps on your scalp, undiluted may be too strong for you.  Simply mix other olive, jojoba or another oil to ease the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used NUMEROUS brands of Regular Castor and Black Castor Oil - just look for 100% or pure and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type or brand. I have indeed posted reviews on different brands because I have used these brands.  I use castor oil on my hair and my daughters’ hair and I mix my own hair products so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  I hope this review helps!!</li>
            <li> I looked all over and this was the best deal I found. Very pleased with my order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently gotten on this natural kick lately.  My hair stylist in NYC told me to start using castor oil for my dry hair and scalp.  It works wonders!!  It&#x27;s a very thick oil, so a little goes a long way, but my hair feels very well nourished and my scalp feels great.  This is also a great price. Don&#x27;t overpay with some of those other oils that say they are better for hair.  It&#x27;s all the same oil.</li>
            <li> This works great as a rub for sore musles in conjunction with emu cream.  If you do any kind of working out this is great for building strength than sore muscles...will be purchasing again for sure. .. ;-)</li>
            <li> Great product it really works and I highly recommend it to anybody that wants to try it out good luck</li>
            <li> The product was fine, it just did not get rid of the ground moles in my yard. Not the product&#x27;s fault, just did not run the ground moles.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my fertility massages. Smelled fresh! Love it</li>
            <li> Great product and came in quickly</li>
            <li> The Castor Oil is pure and excellent to use if you are irregular (constipated) or to condition your hair.  I would recommend&lt;br /&gt;Heritage Store Castor Oil to everyone.</li>
            <li> i use this to seal in any moisture and to thicken any thinned-out patches of hair, especially along my hairline. it always works! just a note: these are only two of the many things i use this castor oil for. this brand happens to be the most pure and economical i have found...and i have found many.</li>
            <li> The bottle was cracked when I received it.  Apparently it happens all the time because they had it wrapped in a few layers of plastic.  Now I have to find another bottle large enough to transfer its contents to.</li>
            <li> Happy with shipping and product..</li>
            <li> I took some essential oil and mixed it with the castor oil and we used this for a massage oil. I also use this on my skin to moisturize in general it&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
            <li> I use this to wash my face with (the oil cleaning method) and mixing this with jojoba and tea tree oil is fabulous. My skin is super soft, it helped clear blemishes, AND works FANTASTICALLY as a makeup remover. This is a lot of oil but it stores and was a good value for the price</li>
            <li> chose it because i heard about this product online review.  yes i will recommend this product to anyone that ask about it</li>
            <li> this stuff gets you moving</li>
            <li> I cannot compliant.  The price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> This brand of castor oil is of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in my soapmaking, so the value of price is a plus.</li>
            <li> I use this in my home made shampoo and hair moisturizes and conditioners it works great:) I&#x27;m black and going natural using this in my products keeps my growing afro soft and spongy:)</li>
            <li> I have never used Castor Oil before, so I have nothing to compare it to.  For what I am using it for I am very pleased.  I have been mixing it in a scrub for my skin.</li>
            <li> I use for hair and skin, and works great. Especially for hot oil treatments and deep conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> I bough castor oil because I heard it helps to strengthen hair and combat dry, brittle hair. After using the product for a few weeks, I did not see much change. However, this is probably no fault of the product but perhaps my own hair.</li>
            <li> Loved it and my hair is growing</li>
            <li> Great big bottle of Castor oil in all of its glory.</li>
            <li> The castor oil was delivered on time. What I wasn&#x27;t used to was the color. All the castor oils I purchased before were clear, except for this bottle, it was yellow.  At first I thought it was old and out of date, but the label indicated it was good to 2015. I&#x27;m still not sure why it&#x27;s yellow in color. Time will tell if it works the same.</li>
            <li> I love this. It is the perfect glide for my deep tissue massage. Yes, it&#x27;s stinky, but it&#x27;s caster oil! it&#x27;s pure, hexanne free and makes my skin feel great. TY</li>
            <li> I see many traditional remedies and online home remedy forums recommending putting castor oil drops into your eyes-- do not.  Castor oil is a known cytotoxin, and putting castor oil into the eyes will cause tissue damage.    See, for instance, a 2007 study that can be found on the National Institute of Health webpage:  \\&quot;Castor oil is the commonly used lipophilic vector but has been shown to be cytotoxic.\\&quot;  From \\&quot;Results\\&quot;: \\&quot;castor oil was shown to induce significant necrosis\\&quot;   \\&quot;Conclusion\\&quot;: \\&quot;The results demonstrated that castor oil exerts cytotoxic effects on conjunctival cells. This cytotoxicity could explain the side effects observed in some patients using eye drops [including Restasis] containing castor oil as a vehicle.\\&quot; (Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2007 Nov; 48(11):5000-6.)    Does this warrant a one-star rating for this specific product from Heritage Store? Yes, because its packaging fails to include a caveat against this (popular) usage, and says only \\&quot;massage into any area.\\&quot;    Castor oil is also traditionally used to remove warts-- that is, by working to stop cell growth. Please keep this basic property of castor oil in mind, and be very cautious.    I hope this helps someone out there.</li>
            <li> wanna live forever...buy this stuff...lol</li>
            <li> Product was as it was advertised. Neat pkg. Simple to open and use. Quality was perfect. Keep up your standards and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sales will continue.</li>
            <li> I use castor oil everyday. This product is hexane-free therefore meeting my criteria for what I will put on and in my body. I have very dry skin and also live in the driest state of all --- Nevada. Castor oil is absorbed into the skin leaving it looking and feeling more youthful. After soaking in a hot bath, I apply it all over my body. I highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> Works pretty ok in soap -  I haven&#x27;t yet tried them in a facial oil so cannot give a better review but once I do I will come back and update.</li>
            <li> Amaaaazzzzzing stuff!!!!! I use this oil for everything body related. Internally and externally. It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell. I&#x27;m the type of person that will overlook most smells if the substance is great for my body. I will be buying another one soon! I&#x27;ve had this same bottle for over a year now and I still have 1/3 left! A great buy! A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Because it  work great&lt;br /&gt;If it work I will like it&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to my friends and my family</li>
            <li> I like castor oil for many things. I started using this specific one for the oil cleansing method, which unfortunately did not work out, but I still like the oil and have many other uses for it.</li>
            <li> Great, high quality product. I use it for castor packs and other beauty uses and have no complaints. I will continue to purchase this brand of castor oil.</li>
            <li> the product was fine... the shipping not so much. When I got my item the cap was lost and the product has spilled out the bottle... other then that it was okay.</li>
            <li> it was nice smooth Skins... use almost everyday ..... have very dry skin that really helps n smooth my skin</li>
            <li> The prestige of the mark, and the price!! my God so affordable.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it and I&#x27;m going to send for more</li>
            <li> I prefer the cleanest stuff when it comes to my mixtures, and this definitely is clean, I enjoy it. period.</li>
            <li> I use this to make homemade all natural shampoo bars.  So far so good!  I&#x27;ll continue us to buy it.</li>
            <li> I have had wonderful luck with using on my face and body.  I feel it has been successful on both my face and body.  I use it for cleaning and moisturizing.  Great  product, I add heather to make the smell more pleasant.</li>
            <li> A+ thank you so much i have been looking for this in the storesand it got here realy FAST 😄</li>
            <li> Great high quality castor oil, even though it isn&#x27;t organic, but it isn&#x27;t necessary. I use it to wrap sprains, cracked heels, massage into hair and full castor oil bath (please use caution and educate yourself on castor oil baths before trying!). Simply love it.</li>
            <li> Rub it on your face or other acne areas in the shower and wipe it off when you get out.  Night and day difference for me,  going on a year now.</li>
            <li> using this to cleanse my face.  I mix it with sunflower oi, and so far I like the results.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and excellent product. Use this product combined with safflower oil to clean my face every night.</li>
            <li> So amazing on holding curl patterns. Natural hair sisters don&#x27;t hesitate :D</li>
            <li> The oil I received was rancid.</li>
            <li> This and Cayenne Pepper mixed in a sprayer, moles be gone.</li>
            <li> Working well so far for oil washes!</li>
            <li> The castor oil is fine, but the bottle wasn&#x27;t sealed well enough and it leaked during shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy again. I love this oil.</li>
            <li> We use castor oil to deter moles...just attach a sprayer to your garden hose and spray whereever you see any trails....and it is organic and feeds the plants and lawn and won&#x27;t harm pets...</li>
            <li> THE CURE for constipation!  I have really dry stools, I&#x27;ve tried everything natural and not natural to help get my bowels moving like clockwork.  This is the ONLY thing that works, and works consistently and naturally.  I tried castor oil internally before and it did nothing, that&#x27;s how backed up I was but when I started using it externally at night, rubbing on my stomach and in my navel, putting a towel and a hot pad on top until the oil was fully absorbed the next morning everything starts flowing.  It will soften and move the hardest of stools!  Before I leave in the AM I also rub some in my navel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only has it cured my constipation buy complexion is drastically improving and my hair and nails grow like crazy and you have a steady energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have nothing but good things to say, amazing how such a simple substance taken externally can assist the body so much.  Grateful is all I have to say.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered this product I only got the 8 oz sized bottle. I was very unsure if it would be worth the money. But it was and is. This oil is very useful. I use it for condition my hair (morning and night), but I also use it in my baths. A few drops in your bath water will leave your skin feeling silky smooth. Definitely opt to by the 32 oz size. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> castor oil has become my go to for everything&lt;br /&gt;hair, skin, gotten so many compliments on my skin lol&lt;br /&gt;everyone keeps asking me what i&#x27;ve been using and are&lt;br /&gt;really surprised when i tell them its castor oil&lt;br /&gt;i mix mine with ivory shea butter or little bit of curel anti itch lotion&lt;br /&gt;and put some in with my leave in conditioners for my hair (natural woman)&lt;br /&gt;it also works wonders on blemishes and rashes who knew lol&lt;br /&gt;great product and great price for the amount</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a vole repellant.  There are lots of internet articles about using a caster oil / soap / water mixture to repel voles and I&#x27;ve purchased similar products from hardware stores.  This is a much more economical method - make your own.  Maybe my hosta will survive . . . .</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT, CAN BE USED MANY WAYS, I USE IT ON MY SKIN. THE SIZE AND PRICE IS SUPER.&lt;br /&gt;GIVE IT A TRY , YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED.&lt;br /&gt;  DEANNA C</li>
            <li> I use this in my radio controlled airplane&#x27;s small two cycle engine. I mixed this oil with methanol at a 20/80 percent ratio and the engine runs well. The engine runs quieter with less mechanical noise with castor oil than with synthetic two stroke oil. Castor oil is perhaps the best lubricant for two stroke engines. It also has a nice smell to it when it leaves the muffler. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> this product realy works i use it every day i will be buying it again and telling my friends thank you</li>
            <li> My newest staple in my natural hair care routine is castor oil. I tried out this bottle because the ever-so-popular JBCO is way too expensive in my opinion, so I wanted to get something that was as close as possible to the organic stuff. This castor oil is awesome! It works very well and it&#x27;s in a HUGE bottle... LOVE it! I will definitely be getting this again.</li>
            <li> Put on age spots and they lightened up almost immediately.Anticipate a fast removal of spots.&lt;br /&gt; Also put on a blackhead overnight and the next morning, that evening it popped out with very little pressure.</li>
            <li> We use it our Ayurvedic Clinic. Thanks</li>
            <li> Very mild taste, the best ever!</li>
            <li> When I got the package I noticed a small dark spot in the corner of the box. Grrrrrrrr! oil leakage. I thought how hard can it be just to package this so it did not leak. Well the lid was taped shut, the bottle was in a sealed plastic bag, all of which was wrapped in those giant air bubbles inside the box. In reality less than a tablespoon of oil had leaked and I felt they really did try to package it as soundly as possible. The quality of the oil is very nice. It has the thick texture and no smell one would expect from castor oil. The price is awesome. So all said and done I would buy this again and recommend this to others for purchase.</li>
            <li> Tried this out because my usual brand of castor oil was more expensive. Definitely glad I found this because it saved me money and my hair loves it</li>
            <li> I received just what I ordered.  Castor Oil has multiple benefits.  I use it to make my natural hair products</li>
            <li> Used to make soap for the first time - really liked this product.</li>
    </ol>
