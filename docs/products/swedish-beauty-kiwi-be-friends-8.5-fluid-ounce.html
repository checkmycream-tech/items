            <li>Love the Swedish beauty line</li>
            <li>i had to use a knife to open it which is great because that way it cant explode or anything!</li>
            <li>I love the smell as it reminds me of the tropics.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying the KIWI Be Friends product</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I had never used a bronzer lotion before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>I love Kiwi</li>
            <li>It is a great product and works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>SMELLS GOOD, AND LEAVES YOU GOLDEN BROWN</li>
            <li>Smells sooo good and gets me really tan!</li>
            <li>Great small and works great</li>
            <li>It smells great and gave her a natural gold tan.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy or colored and absorbs easily.</li>
            <li>A lot goes a long way with this one, which is incredible.</li>
            <li>Works great, but not for a deep color.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried it in a tanning bed but this works great for outdoors, only used it a couple times and so far it has worked very well, gives me a great tan.</li>
            <li>My fianc√© is tanning to get ready for a wedding, and absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I like the mild bronzer included.</li>
            <li>Gives me a lovely, natural tan fairly quickly and leaves the skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Received product very fast!</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite lotion without spending over $100.</li>
            <li>I much, much prefer the Shea lotion, but this one is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>I tried a sample of this at my local tanning salon and fell in love immediately, but of course they didn&#x27;t carry the bottle</li>
            <li>The gym sells this lotion at a much higher price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bronzer, which I didn&#x27;t realize, but it doesn&#x27;t give that hot itchy feel after using.</li>
            <li>I have been tanning for many years and every year I try a different lotion.</li>
            <li>Bought my first bottle of this at my tanning salon for $40!&lt;br</li>
            <li>You Love Me from the same company.</li>
            <li>kind of like you smoked a little something.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing too.  </li>
            <li>It works well in the tanning beds and much cheaper than buying it at the salon.</li>
            <li>This lotion I have bought twice this year alone because it helps me tan fast and keep the color and smells</li>
            <li>this lotion didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit longer to dry after applying and doesn&#x27;t rub in quite as easily as the Shea, and this has a much stronger scent to it..</li>
            <li>Natural looking, not fake.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This lotion is very moturizing and gives you than natural tint of color.</li>
            <li>Not the normal baked after tan smell.</li>
            <li>This is a new tanning lotion for me.</li>
            <li>Made my skin so soft and supple!</li>
            <li>lotion is a medium thickness, applies easily, smells fruity, and has a very slight shimmer.</li>
            <li>This product, although it leaves the skin soft and produces an average tan has a strong odor that is not appealing after tanning.</li>

            <li> It smells good when you put it on but after you tan it smells awful....kind of like you smoked a little something.</li>

            <li> smells SO good after tanning. i&#x27;m use to that gross tanning lotion smell before and after. but this smells just like how it is in the bottle, amazing! It goes on somewhat thick, but absorbs in right after. I don&#x27;t feel greasy afterwards either. i&#x27;m definitely buying another scent after i&#x27;m done with this one. highly recommend.</li>

            <li> This has an awesome smell even after you tan. It is very moisturizing too.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this at my local tanning salon and fell in love immediately, but of course they didn&#x27;t carry the bottle so I had to order it here. This lotion is AMAZING. It has the best scent ever, like kiwi Kool-Aid and rubs in very well. And it works great for indoor tanning as well as outdoor tanning! I used it during my yearly trip to the beach for the passed 2 years with great results. Not to mention you will tan to the perfect shade of caramel, lol. This is the ONLY tanning lotion I use and I recommend it to everyone. Definitely a great lotion for the price.</li>
            <li> Received product very fast! Was very happy with service. Would order again absolutley!  Loved the lotion it is my favorite!!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this lotion.  It works well in the tanning beds and much cheaper than buying it at the salon.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended me this lotion because of the glow and the good smell. I am hooked! This lotion is very moturizing and gives you than natural tint of color. I love the smell as it reminds me of the tropics. The gym sells this lotion at a much higher price. So happy to find it online!  Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an experienced fake-baker and while I appreciate lotions with DHA, I hate the after tan smell. I&#x27;m enjoying the KIWI Be Friends product a lot.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is a medium thickness, applies easily, smells fruity, and has a very slight shimmer. It is not greasy or colored and absorbs easily. I did not notice a heavy &amp;#34;after tan&amp;#34; or DHA smell. There is an &amp;#34;after tan&amp;#34; odor when I sniff my arm arm but it wasn&#x27;t overwhelming. The Amazon price on this lotion is very good and if it didn&#x27;t have a tiny bit of shimmer in it, I would say it&#x27;s unisex. I will use the tube up and try other swedish beauty formulas.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this lotion! I had never used a bronzer lotion before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. It didn&#x27;t stain or leave streaks and smells great.</li>
            <li> This is a new tanning lotion for me. It&#x27;s a bronzer, which I didn&#x27;t realize, but it doesn&#x27;t give that hot itchy feel after using. I like the tropical light smell and it assists in great color without a sensitivity reaction.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for many years and every year I try a different lotion. This lotion I have bought twice this year alone because it helps me tan fast and keep the color and smells oh so good. This is by far my favorite lotion without spending over $100. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I love Kiwi Be Friends. It is a great product and works very well for me.  I&#x27;m getting great tanning results. Natural looking, not fake. And the scent is great too :  )</li>
            <li> I tan quite often, so this lotion didn&#x27;t do much for me. Tho it is an awesome moisturizer with a lovely fruity smell</li>
            <li> Does the job at a great price point. I like the mild bronzer included.</li>
            <li> SMELLS GOOD, AND LEAVES YOU GOLDEN BROWN</li>
            <li> Bought my first bottle of this at my tanning salon for $40!&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to look for this online. I bought it for $19 I see now that it is even cheaper. le sigh.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product if you are fair skinned and new to tanning beds. Smells good too!</li>
            <li> Bought this after I ran out of the Shea You Love Me from the same company. I much, much prefer the Shea lotion, but this one is not bad at all. A lot goes a long way with this one, which is incredible. It takes a bit longer to dry after applying and doesn&#x27;t rub in quite as easily as the Shea, and this has a much stronger scent to it.. NOT a tanning scent though. Definitely a fruity, kiwi smell but I still wouldn&#x27;t wear it just walking around. I&#x27;ve only used this outside, so I can&#x27;t attest to the after-bed smell of it. Gives me a lovely, natural tan fairly quickly and leaves the skin nice and soft.</li>
