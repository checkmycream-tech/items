            <li>She said this is the best quality wig she&#x27;s seen.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful!</li>
            <li>Worked great as a wig for sally from Nightmare Before Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Nonetheless, one of the best wigs I own.</li>
            <li>This will be amazing for my erza cosplay!</li>
            <li>This wig is soooo beautiful, I love it&lt;</li>
            <li>I love the wig!</li>
            <li>I really love this wig!</li>
            <li>Very smooth and silky fairly good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>It fits my head nice</li>
            <li>The wig it&#x27;s self is okay</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this wig.</li>
            <li>Not so full of hair but nice purchase.</li>
            <li>The bangs didn&#x27;t sweep to the side easily (wouldn&#x27;t stay in place)</li>
            <li>Even though it took a long time to ship, I could not have been more happy when I put it on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super silky and really smooth</li>
            <li>While it is true you get what you pay for this crossed the line for us.</li>
            <li>It came as described and super quick.  </li>
            <li>beautiful wig, but has little hair</li>
            <li>Has a wispy fun feel.  </li>
            <li>and it looks exactly as the picture shows.</li>
            <li>Will use seller again if my daughter needs any more Cosplay items in the future.</li>
            <li>Much better than yarn.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t complain much.</li>
            <li>This product came packed in a bag and all balled up, so much</li>
            <li>Nice color, soft feel, but messy.</li>
            <li>This wig is so realistic, yet one looks like something out of fantasy novel, like a fairy.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t expect anything lush considering the price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So soft and shine &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>In the end, it worked well enough for my classic Marvel Mystique costume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light color so don&#x27;t expect a dark wine, it is red wine.</li>
            <li>Shipping was faster than expected, however, I received it with the bangs being slightly tangled but easy fix.</li>
            <li>Please do NOT waste good money on a bad product.</li>
            <li>It is, however, rather thin, which I believe should be an easy fix I hope.</li>
            <li>It was super silky and thick.</li>

            <li> Bonne qualité, mais shipping un peu long</li>
            <li> It was also very frizzy after brushing (I didn&#x27;t have time to wet it and allow it to dry but applying a leave-in conditioner and a little almond oil helped tame it dramatically)  </li>

            <li> Hate that!</li>

            <li> The wig color was just as pictured.  However, it arrived in a messy state.  Even though it was in a hairnet, strands were poking out of the plastic bag it was supposed to be sealed in.  It took a while to brush though it.  It was also very frizzy after brushing (I didn&#x27;t have time to wet it and allow it to dry but applying a leave-in conditioner and a little almond oil helped tame it dramatically)  It also tangled pretty badly while wearing it.  It was a little thin at the very front but I didn&#x27;t expect anything lush considering the price.  The bangs didn&#x27;t sweep to the side easily (wouldn&#x27;t stay in place) so I had to cut them so that I could see.  In the end, it worked well enough for my classic Marvel Mystique costume.</li>
            <li> Frizzed at this bottom! Hate that! Can&#x27;t get the tangles out. Nice color, soft feel, but messy.</li>
            <li> This wig is so realistic, yet one looks like something out of fantasy novel, like a fairy.  Has a wispy fun feel.  Worked great as a wig for sally from Nightmare Before Christmas.  Much better than yarn.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and silky fairly good quality for the price. It was quite thin though I could see the actual cap in some places that can be fixed i guess.</li>
            <li> It was a 10 dollar wig so I can&#x27;t complain much. But it&#x27;s super small and very thin</li>
            <li> The quality of the wig is decent for the price, however it&#x27;s a little thin.&lt;br /&gt;It was also a lot softer than I would have expected.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give it four stars.</li>
            <li> When I got this wig it was just put in the bag. There were tangles and kinks all through it. The hair comes out when brushed (with wig brush). I do not recommend this wig at all</li>
            <li> The wig is rather thin but other than that i love the way it looks on me and should TOTALLY help in bring my Erza Scarlet cosplay to life!</li>
            <li> Bonne qualité, mais shipping un peu long</li>
            <li> I love the wig! It looks just as the picture is. It fits my head nice but sometimes i have some problems putting it on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light color so don&#x27;t expect a dark wine, it is red wine. Too shiny but the same as the picture. Not so full of hair but nice purchase.</li>
            <li> I really love this wig! It&#x27;s super silky and really smooth and it looks exactly as the picture shows. It is, however, rather thin, which I believe should be an easy fix I hope. Nonetheless, one of the best wigs I own.</li>
            <li> My daughter was looking for this everywhere.  I found it and ordered it for her.  She said this is the best quality wig she&#x27;s seen.  It came as described and super quick.  Will use seller again if my daughter needs any more Cosplay items in the future.</li>
            <li> 1st ever product I have brought from amazon that I was NOT happy with. This product came packed in a bag and all balled up, so much so that when we tried to untangle it it could not be done. The color was no were close to the picture. While it is true you get what you pay for this crossed the line for us. Please do NOT waste good money on a bad product.</li>
            <li> The wig it&#x27;s self is okay but it&#x27;s really tangled at first and the packaging was horrible.</li>
            <li> Shipping was faster than expected, however, I received it with the bangs being slightly tangled but easy fix.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig. Even though it took a long time to ship, I could not have been more happy when I put it on. It was super silky and thick. It did tangle a little but that&#x27;s nothing a trim cannot fix. I look forward to ordering from this company again!</li>
            <li> Beautiful! This will be amazing for my erza cosplay!</li>
            <li> This wig is soooo beautiful, I love it&lt;br /&gt;So soft and shine &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> beautiful wig, but has little hair</li>
