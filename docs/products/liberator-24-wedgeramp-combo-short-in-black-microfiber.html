            <li>I DO wish the book it comes with had more position suggestions though....</li>
            <li>This pillow is very well constructed and comes in an inconspicuous box, great for adding fire to your sex life or you can use it to prop yourself up in bed to watch TV</li>

            <li>It is ok my expectations were a little high</li>
            <li>small wedge perfect for elevating the knees while laying down to aid in reducing back strain</li>
            <li>girlfriend absolutely loves it, as do I, and we&#x27;ve only tried two positions so far.</li>
            <li>price and seems very well made&lt;br /&gt;Shipped later than expected, but still got it fast</li>

            <li> /&gt;Pay a little extra for a Liberator and get the quality craftmanship.</li>
            <li> Actually even in boring positions these can be darn nice.  </li>
            <li> Used to recover from spine surgery, this foam is really firm.</li>
            <li> very firm cushions, positions your partner as advertised.</li>
            <li> Really hard, it needs lot of breaking in</li>
