            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>It has good consistency.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not clumpy and doesn&#x27;t overload the brush, and the brush itself is good quality.  </li>

            <li>I love that it is herbal and has much better ingredients to Lowes in the department and grocery stores!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure how to rate this.</li>
            <li>This meh-scara is ok.</li>
            <li>&#x27;d say the coverage is day/work appropriate; you won&#x27;t get uber-amped false-eylash looking lashes with this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more brown, but I use this as an Eyelash Primer and it works well for that.</li>
            <li>So I bought a tube and am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is herbal.</li>
            <li>I love the brush/comb end that comes with it.  </li>
            <li>I love Palladio products, and I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Also, I love that it&#x27;s herbal, because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels just don&#x27;t wear it to the lake.</li>
            <li>I really love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Love love the brush and comb on mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d define it more as water resistant rather than proof.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I will order this product again for sure.</li>
            <li>I am really glad that it&#x27;s waterproof and doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes.:)</li>
            <li>Love it  -</li>
            <li>This is better than some products I have used before, though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for organic mascara that won&#x27;t make my eyes itch and water.  </li>
            <li>More waterproof than the others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I really like the comb and brush on the end and was so happy to find it in brown/black.  </li>
            <li>I love that the wand also has the brow and lash brushes on the end...</li>
            <li>Wish it were more easily available.</li>
            <li>One coat is enough for every day use, while two or three are good for evening wear!</li>
            <li>Removes easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to remove any excess.  </li>
            <li>It goes on thin,and rubs off easily.</li>
            <li>This mascara does not wear off by the end of the day, it doesn&#x27;t end up underneath my eyes, and it doesn&#x27;t run when I sweat or cry, yet it washes off easily with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to remove.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is pretty nice mascara.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing is that it&#x27;s available in true Auburn/Brown color</li>
            <li>It would probably be fine in winter time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is light, doesn&#x27;t clump and the brush catches every fine lash and defines it.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara when it is fresh.  </li>
            <li>It advertised being waterproof and available in brown/black.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth every time.</li>
            <li>The Palladio mascara goes on smoothly and still no clumping after 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Applies smoothly.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, no clumps.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the good coverage this mascara gives.  </li>
            <li>The mascara in brownish-black is good for a natural look.</li>
            <li>The bristle end of the brush is great - real bristles that grab your lashes just right to apply the mascara just right.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara so much!</li>
            <li>The color is great because I didn&#x27;t want black, so the dark brown looks perfect.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t add much length or volume, but I really just need something to darken my lashes and It does not run which is good.</li>
            <li>it is true.</li>
            <li>Despite the good ratings, I ended up with massive raccoon eyes with this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is natural and the attached comb and brush make it easy to separate lashes.  </li>
            <li>Super brush applicator.</li>
            <li>The brown is great for a soft natural look.</li>
            <li>The price is right and you really should not use mascara for more than a month anyway.  </li>
            <li>I would really like to have a medium brown, but it wasn&#x27;t an option, but this brown/black is very well, and is by far the best  waterproof mascara I&#x27;ve encountered thus far.</li>
            <li>I live in Houston, which is hotter than 95 degrees most of the year, and humid all year.  </li>
            <li>Also the brushes in the lid are both super useful.</li>
            <li>I really thought it would be more sweat resistant though, its really hot and humid here</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes, many products make my eyes burn for days after using them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is definately worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I researched beauty websites about natural mascaras, and the recommended brands in the articles I read either did not offer brown, or they were $35 per tube or more.  </li>
            <li>This product is my favorite mascara so far.  </li>
            <li>The built in brush/comb is a nice touch,but not a big fan of the mascara its self.</li>
            <li>The eyebrow/eyelash brush is worth the cost</li>
            <li>The look it gives is more of a natural look, it doesn&#x27;t clump or flake off.  </li>
            <li>It does not thicken my lashes, but it has such good coverage that my lashes look just as full as when I was using my old L----L mascara with primer.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes and comes off relatively easily with makeup remover wipes.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very soft and light.  </li>
            <li>The brush applicator is excellent for my needs, the black brown looks more natural than black.</li>
            <li>I really like their quality!</li>
            <li>This product was a first time shot</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but overall I am pleased and would order it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair yet found the supposed brown black to be too light on my lashes but plenty dark under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, and my lashes look good with it, but since it&#x27;s not organic or anything, there&#x27;s no particular reason to buy it over any other waterproof drugstore mascara.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly without dry clumps (my mascara pet peeve).</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly, and also has a little brush on the other end to make sure it looks natural and smooth and no clumps!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy enough to de-clump and looks nice/natural when in place/smooth.</li>
            <li>Lastly - and really importantly - the mascara formula really irritates my eyes when I&#x27;m washing it off.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about mascaras.  </li>
            <li>I think the Palladio mascara has some sort of stain in it, and I don&#x27;t need much mascara before every lash is coated.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate how is gentle on my eyes with no flaking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also so reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t wear mascara very often, but when I do I can always feel it -</li>
            <li>Better performance than I have expected.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>I use them more than I expected I would.  </li>
            <li>The wand separates lashes very well.</li>
            <li>Lasts fairly long, but smudges easily.</li>
            <li>Nope, it&#x27;s just like most other mascaras.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For many years, I was using a drugstore brand of mascara that starts and ends with the letter L, and has lash primer at one end and mascara at the other end.  </li>
            <li>Many other waterproof mascaras cause my eyes to burn and water but</li>
            <li>My eyelashes look much fuller, yet more natural than with other brands.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that my eyes don&#x27;t itch or feel dried out.  </li>
            <li>I had always thought that all mascara was pretty much the same until I tried this stuff.</li>
            <li>IT has a strong full color and actually makes my thin, non existent eyelashes feel full and lush.</li>
            <li>It does not clump and the brush grabs all the fine little hairs in my brow, so now I feel like they look normal.  </li>
            <li>This is a natural mascara that is waterproof, which is a neat option!  </li>
            <li>I found out that the ingredients, especially the parabens, in that mascara (and most other drugstore mascaras) can cause eye irritation as well as cancer.  </li>
            <li>The first one that actually lasts thro my aerobics class.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It smears badly no matter how careful I am, including using powder under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It lasts throughout the day and comes off easily with a little bit of coconut oil (what I use to remove waterproof makeup).  </li>
            <li>wearing it right now and running a finger over my lashes, they are dry and brittle feeling.  </li>
            <li>I must have brown or brown/black, and that is hard to find in a drugstore mascara, and even harder to find in a natural mascara with good ratings.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care about that, but just pointing it out in case you&#x27;re thinking you&#x27;re going to have silky, natural lashes.  </li>
            <li>I have tried nearly every waterproof mascara out there</li>
            <li>Soft, but durable.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive eyes -this</li>
            <li>After a few weeks it does not go on as clean, but I use it until it starts to clump.</li>
            <li>I thought I scored a major find with this product and was about to reorder when I realized it&#x27;s not organic at all.  </li>
            <li>It works just fine, not too hard to remove at the end of the day,  but,  </li>
            <li>I am a natural redhead, but my hair has lightened to a strawberry blonde now that I am age 49.  </li>
            <li>It actually looks like I have no mascara on at all, just darker longer natural lashes.</li>
            <li>I have bought other Palladio products in the past from a beauty store in my town and have always been really pleased with the quality for the price.</li>
            <li>This dried up very fast.</li>
            <li>It is a thinner formula than any other mascara I have used before, but the coverage is better than the thick formulas.  </li>

            <li> The look it gives is more of a natural look, it doesn&#x27;t clump or flake off.  </li>
            <li> It does not thicken my lashes, but it has such good coverage that my lashes look just as full as when I was using my old L----L mascara with primer.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes and comes off relatively easily with makeup remover wipes.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very soft and light.  </li>
            <li> The brush applicator is excellent for my needs, the black brown looks more natural than black.</li>
            <li> I really like their quality!</li>
            <li> This product was a first time shot</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but overall I am pleased and would order it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair yet found the supposed brown black to be too light on my lashes but plenty dark under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, and my lashes look good with it, but since it&#x27;s not organic or anything, there&#x27;s no particular reason to buy it over any other waterproof drugstore mascara.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly without dry clumps (my mascara pet peeve).</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly, and also has a little brush on the other end to make sure it looks natural and smooth and no clumps!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy enough to de-clump and looks nice/natural when in place/smooth.</li>
            <li> Lastly - and really importantly - the mascara formula really irritates my eyes when I&#x27;m washing it off.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about mascaras.  </li>
            <li> I think the Palladio mascara has some sort of stain in it, and I don&#x27;t need much mascara before every lash is coated.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate how is gentle on my eyes with no flaking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also so reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t wear mascara very often, but when I do I can always feel it -</li>
            <li> Better performance than I have expected.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> I use them more than I expected I would.  </li>
            <li> The wand separates lashes very well.</li>
            <li> Lasts fairly long, but smudges easily.</li>
            <li> Nope, it&#x27;s just like most other mascaras.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For many years, I was using a drugstore brand of mascara that starts and ends with the letter L, and has lash primer at one end and mascara at the other end.  </li>
            <li> Many other waterproof mascaras cause my eyes to burn and water but</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look much fuller, yet more natural than with other brands.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that my eyes don&#x27;t itch or feel dried out.  </li>
            <li> I had always thought that all mascara was pretty much the same until I tried this stuff.</li>
            <li> IT has a strong full color and actually makes my thin, non existent eyelashes feel full and lush.</li>
            <li> It does not clump and the brush grabs all the fine little hairs in my brow, so now I feel like they look normal.  </li>
            <li> This is a natural mascara that is waterproof, which is a neat option!  </li>
            <li> I found out that the ingredients, especially the parabens, in that mascara (and most other drugstore mascaras) can cause eye irritation as well as cancer.  </li>
            <li> The first one that actually lasts thro my aerobics class.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It smears badly no matter how careful I am, including using powder under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It lasts throughout the day and comes off easily with a little bit of coconut oil (what I use to remove waterproof makeup).  </li>
            <li> wearing it right now and running a finger over my lashes, they are dry and brittle feeling.  </li>
            <li> I must have brown or brown/black, and that is hard to find in a drugstore mascara, and even harder to find in a natural mascara with good ratings.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care about that, but just pointing it out in case you&#x27;re thinking you&#x27;re going to have silky, natural lashes.  </li>
            <li> I have tried nearly every waterproof mascara out there</li>
            <li> Soft, but durable.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive eyes -this</li>
            <li> After a few weeks it does not go on as clean, but I use it until it starts to clump.</li>
            <li> I thought I scored a major find with this product and was about to reorder when I realized it&#x27;s not organic at all.  </li>
            <li> It works just fine, not too hard to remove at the end of the day,  but,  </li>
            <li> I am a natural redhead, but my hair has lightened to a strawberry blonde now that I am age 49.  </li>
            <li> It actually looks like I have no mascara on at all, just darker longer natural lashes.</li>
            <li> I have bought other Palladio products in the past from a beauty store in my town and have always been really pleased with the quality for the price.</li>
            <li> This dried up very fast.</li>
            <li> It is a thinner formula than any other mascara I have used before, but the coverage is better than the thick formulas.  </li>
            <li> It seems to take a longer time to dry than others I&#x27;ve used, I kept on getting mascara under my eyes if I shut them anytime the first few minutes.</li>
            <li> Also, my eyes are extremely sensitive and water frequently due to allergies.  </li>
            <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t have the usual harsh ingredients-but I am infuriated at opening too many new tubes that are dried out!</li>
            <li> I find it smudges pretty easily for a waterproof mascara, which is annoying.</li>
            <li> A strange title, I know, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin, so if you want a natural look you can use one coat, or layer for a more dramatic look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have dry eyes and all mascaras bother my eyes.</li>
            <li> All in all, I would buy this mascara again and will very likely purchase it in black as well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is waterproof, in the sense that it doesn&#x27;t run when it gets wet.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money I can&#x27;t spare.</li>
            <li> The last one was clay-based and dried up/clumped up within a couple weeks.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a very natural, subtle mascara this is your product.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry and feel like your eyelashes are being weighted down.  </li>
            <li> My lashes and brows are blonde, and black mascara looks too harsh on me.  </li>
            <li> The prob is the other end, with the lash comb.</li>
            <li> I plan to check out any other cosmetics from this company.</li>
            <li> Until I found this stuff I always had to settle for one attribute or the other.</li>
            <li> This mascara is not worth 50 cents, let alone $6.</li>
            <li> It defines every lash down to the tip, and does not smudge.  </li>
            <li> Barley shows on eyes just makes a mess.</li>
            <li> and is nowhere near organic, even natural.  :-(</li>
            <li> Sometimes the mascara is a little clumpy when applying</li>
            <li> A little on the clumpy side.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little pricey</li>
            <li> My eyes have been watering alot the past few days due to Fall seasonal allergies, and the Palladio mascara stays in place.  </li>
            <li> Ginseng, Green Tea, Gingko Biloba, Chamomile and Aloe Vera for conditioning.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> The mascara was dried out when I got it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> it would be that since its waterproof, its a little hard to get off.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I like the idea of wearing organic, paraben-free eye products, but waterproof mascara is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a negative reaction to this mascara.</li>
            <li> I had to give it a negative</li>
            <li> Not a great lash comb as the teeth are too few and spaced out.</li>
            <li> The coating on my lashes isn&#x27;t thick or clumpy at all, and I have had no eye irritation from the Palladio mascara.  </li>
            <li> Usually, by the end of the day, I end up with red eye. :(  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to go on and the brush sucks!</li>
            <li> No good!</li>
            <li> I feel silly, but on to my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So basically it can survive a random tear, but you couldn&#x27;t go swimming or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> produc arrived on time but worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used definitely not waterproof waterproof.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s awkward to pull the wand out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I HATE CLUMPS, and this has never clumped on me.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I can remember using in perhaps 40 years.</li>
            <li> Not one of those horrible silicone-bristled brushes!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice shade for fair complexion and hair. It seems to take a longer time to dry than others I&#x27;ve used, I kept on getting mascara under my eyes if I shut them anytime the first few minutes. Lasts fairly long, but smudges easily. Also not waterproof, watering eyes washes mascara onto lower lid.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this mascara.  I like the brush, the texture of the mascara and a nice bonus is the eyebrow shaper.  I have bought other Palladio products in the past from a beauty store in my town and have always been really pleased with the quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of wearing organic, paraben-free eye products, but waterproof mascara is hard to find.  I thought I scored a major find with this product and was about to reorder when I realized it&#x27;s not organic at all.  I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking! According to the Pallidio website, this mascara is &amp;#34;enriched with 5 beneficial Herbs: Ginseng, Green Tea, Gingko Biloba, Chamomile and Aloe Vera for conditioning.&amp;#34;  That&#x27;s all it says. I feel silly, but on to my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is pretty nice mascara. It goes on very smoothly without dry clumps (my mascara pet peeve). It&#x27;s thin, so if you want a natural look you can use one coat, or layer for a more dramatic look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is waterproof, in the sense that it doesn&#x27;t run when it gets wet.  But be warned that your &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; will be ruined.  Your lashes will uncurl, clump together, be chunky, and flake. So basically it can survive a random tear, but you couldn&#x27;t go swimming or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m wearing it right now and running a finger over my lashes, they are dry and brittle feeling.  I don&#x27;t care about that, but just pointing it out in case you&#x27;re thinking you&#x27;re going to have silky, natural lashes.  Nope, it&#x27;s just like most other mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure how to rate this. It&#x27;s fine, and my lashes look good with it, but since it&#x27;s not organic or anything, there&#x27;s no particular reason to buy it over any other waterproof drugstore mascara.</li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I can remember using in perhaps 40 years. It smears badly no matter how careful I am, including using powder under my eyes. I&#x27;m very fair yet found the supposed brown black to be too light on my lashes but plenty dark under my eyes. Total waste of money I can&#x27;t spare.</li>
            <li> This meh-scara is ok. I love that it comes in brown - great for fairer complected people. I find it smudges pretty easily for a waterproof mascara, which is annoying. Sometimes the mascara is a little clumpy when applying but it&#x27;s easy enough to de-clump and looks nice/natural when in place/smooth. &#x27;d say the coverage is day/work appropriate; you won&#x27;t get uber-amped false-eylash looking lashes with this stuff. The bristle end of the brush is great - real bristles that grab your lashes just right to apply the mascara just right. Not one of those horrible silicone-bristled brushes! The prob is the other end, with the lash comb. Not a great lash comb as the teeth are too few and spaced out. Plus the cover cracked and comes of the wand so it&#x27;s awkward to pull the wand out of the tube. Lastly - and really importantly - the mascara formula really irritates my eyes when I&#x27;m washing it off. I&#x27;m using the same non-irritating face wash I&#x27;ve used for about 20 years (Purpose, from Johnson &amp; Johnson I think). So I know it&#x27;s not that. And I&#x27;ve never had another mascara of any brand/variety/age bother my eyes before. Weird.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more brown, but I use this as an Eyelash Primer and it works well for that. Also the brushes in the lid are both super useful.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara so much! I love that it is herbal and has much better ingredients to Lowes in the department and grocery stores!</li>
            <li> A strange title, I know, but it is true. I wore this waterproof mascara to our grandpa&#x27;s funeral. Obviously a lot of tears that day!! It kept up with my tears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a contact wearer and this does not bother my eyes. Removes easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> This dried up very fast.</li>
            <li> Had racoon eyes within an hour and it&#x27;s been in the 20&#x27;s and I was not sweating by any means.  Clumps and just does not look very good.  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Burns my eyes!! Can&#x27;t wear this at all. On the plus side, I do like the brow/lash comb and brush...</li>
            <li> I love this mascara when it is fresh.  After a few weeks it does not go on as clean, but I use it until it starts to clump. The price is right and you really should not use mascara for more than a month anyway.  It is definately worth the price.  The brush and comb that come with it work well.</li>
            <li> Great product. Super brush applicator. Best I&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
            <li> I had great hopes for this mascara.  I have used it for a couple weeks.  OPPS,  I noticed yesterday, that a lot of the mascara has leaked out... around the opening for the comb that comes in the same container.  It works just fine, not too hard to remove at the end of the day,  but,  I was wondering why, every time I picked it up,  I ended up with brown stains on my hand.  Hello, maybe I accidentally loosened it, myself, I don&#x27;t know, but, I have not used the attached comb, at all.  As a mascara, I give it 5 stars.  Packaging... a 1 star.  Get rid of the comb, please!</li>
            <li> Good product.  Not waterproof so it comes off.  Best brush I have found.</li>
            <li> This is a natural mascara that is waterproof, which is a neat option!  It goes on very smoothly, and also has a little brush on the other end to make sure it looks natural and smooth and no clumps!</li>
            <li> I am very picky about mascaras.  I live in Houston, which is hotter than 95 degrees most of the year, and humid all year.  I must have mascara that won&#x27;t smudge.  Also, my eyes are extremely sensitive and water frequently due to allergies.  I cannot have mascara that flakes and gets in my eyes.  I am a natural redhead, but my hair has lightened to a strawberry blonde now that I am age 49.  My lashes and brows are blonde, and black mascara looks too harsh on me.  I must have brown or brown/black, and that is hard to find in a drugstore mascara, and even harder to find in a natural mascara with good ratings.  For many years, I was using a drugstore brand of mascara that starts and ends with the letter L, and has lash primer at one end and mascara at the other end.  Because my eyes are always irritated, I have only been wearing mascara about once per week for over 10 years.  I found out that the ingredients, especially the parabens, in that mascara (and most other drugstore mascaras) can cause eye irritation as well as cancer.  I researched beauty websites about natural mascaras, and the recommended brands in the articles I read either did not offer brown, or they were $35 per tube or more.  I found Palladio brand on Amazon, and it had great reviews and an unbeatable price.  It advertised being waterproof and available in brown/black.  So I bought a tube and am so glad I did.  It defines every lash down to the tip, and does not smudge.  My eyes have been watering alot the past few days due to Fall seasonal allergies, and the Palladio mascara stays in place.  It does not thicken my lashes, but it has such good coverage that my lashes look just as full as when I was using my old L----L mascara with primer.  I think the Palladio mascara has some sort of stain in it, and I don&#x27;t need much mascara before every lash is coated.  It is a thinner formula than any other mascara I have used before, but the coverage is better than the thick formulas.  The coating on my lashes isn&#x27;t thick or clumpy at all, and I have had no eye irritation from the Palladio mascara.  I like the lash and brow brushes that are built into the cap, also.  I will continue to use this brand of mascara from now on.</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite mascara so far.  I HATE CLUMPS, and this has never clumped on me.  It goes on smooth every time. Been using my current bottle for over a month now, and still no clumps.  Goes on and stays on all day.  Love the fact that my eyes don&#x27;t itch or feel dried out.  Love that it is herbal.</li>
            <li> My 3rd purchase of this product. The brush applicator is excellent for my needs, the black brown looks more natural than black. It doesn&#x27; flake or clump up on my lashes.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the good coverage this mascara gives.  It lasts throughout the day and comes off easily with a little bit of coconut oil (what I use to remove waterproof makeup).  I love the brush/comb end that comes with it.  It makes it easy to remove any excess.  Many other waterproof mascaras cause my eyes to burn and water but Palladio Herbal Waterproof Mascara did not.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with any allergic reaction to it.  All in all, I would buy this mascara again and will very likely purchase it in black as well.  I plan to check out any other cosmetics from this company.</li>
            <li> I love Palladio products, and I love this mascara. It even lasts overnight, without smearing all over my face. The color is great because I didn&#x27;t want black, so the dark brown looks perfect. Also, I love that it&#x27;s herbal, because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I like this product. Very nice to put on, not overdone. And I like the handy brush! I really like their quality!</li>
            <li> I use this brush for eyebrows , not eyelashes.  The first one that actually lasts thro my aerobics class.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You for making this...</li>
            <li> This mascara is a good color for someone with fair skin, and zero clumping! It actually looks like I have no mascara on at all, just darker longer natural lashes.</li>
            <li> Works great. Truly waterproof.</li>
            <li> produc arrived on time but worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used definitely not waterproof waterproof. Barley shows on eyes just makes a mess.</li>
            <li> This mascara is not waterproof.  I love the way it feels just don&#x27;t wear it to the lake.</li>
            <li> I do not like it as mascara.... I use it on my eyebrows. It smears, smudges and makes my eyes burn if I use it on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara.  It never clumps, it&#x27;s very soft and light.  But don&#x27;t let the herbal label fool you.  This has parabens, etc. and is nowhere near organic, even natural.  :-(</li>
            <li> I like this mascara, it&#x27;s perfect for me. I gave it 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t add much length or volume, but I really just need something to darken my lashes and It does not run which is good. Love love the brush and comb on mascara. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> The mascara was dried out when I got it.</li>
            <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t have the usual harsh ingredients-but I am infuriated at opening too many new tubes that are dried out! Is it the mascara or the place that is sending it?</li>
            <li> This mascara is not worth 50 cents, let alone $6. It&#x27;s hard to go on and the brush sucks! No good! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Wow! I have tried nearly every waterproof mascara out there and this is just amazing. It doesn&#x27;t clump, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes and comes off relatively easily with makeup remover wipes. If I could give this a 10 star I would. Love it!</li>
            <li> The built in brush/comb is a nice touch,but not a big fan of the mascara its self.It goes on thin,and rubs off easily.I&#x27;d define it more as water resistant rather than proof.</li>
            <li> I have dry eyes and all mascaras bother my eyes. I finally found one that not only doesn&#x27;t bother them but doesn&#x27;t flake either!</li>
            <li> I have blonde eyelashes and brows.  I can use drugstore mascara on my lashes to make them show up but that mascara formula never seemed to work as well on my skimpy blonde brows.  This product was a first time shot and I love it.  It does not clump and the brush grabs all the fine little hairs in my brow, so now I feel like they look normal.  I ordered brown since that is what color mascara I use for my eyelashes also....I will order this product again for sure.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes, many products make my eyes burn for days after using them.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for two weeks and I will never use another brand.&lt;br /&gt;I picked it up at Sally Beauty Supply while I was there for hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is light, doesn&#x27;t clump and the brush catches every fine lash and defines it. One coat is enough for every day use, while two or three are good for evening wear!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  If you are looking for a very natural, subtle mascara this is your product.  The eyebrow brush is also a nice addition.</li>
            <li> Not the best.  A little on the clumpy side.</li>
            <li> I have been through numerous brands of mascara and either dislike the consistency of the mascara or they have a wimpy plastic brush or big globs on the brush.  This mascara is great!  It has good consistency.  It&#x27;s not clumpy and doesn&#x27;t overload the brush, and the brush itself is good quality.  My eyelashes look much fuller, yet more natural than with other brands.  The extra brush and comb on the end are quite helpful, too.  This mascara does not wear off by the end of the day, it doesn&#x27;t end up underneath my eyes, and it doesn&#x27;t run when I sweat or cry, yet it washes off easily with soap and water.  PLEASE, Palladio, do not change this product!</li>
            <li> The mascara in brownish-black is good for a natural look.I am really glad that it&#x27;s waterproof and doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes.:)</li>
            <li> I had always thought that all mascara was pretty much the same until I tried this stuff. It&#x27;s pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a contract lens wearer I appreciate how is gentle on my eyes with no flaking. My favorite thing is that it&#x27;s available in true Auburn/Brown color and it&#x27;s waterproof.  Until I found this stuff I always had to settle for one attribute or the other. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this again. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love it  - BUT WHAT THE HECK!  it was a $6 add-on item when I got it last month!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used.  Love that it is natural and the attached comb and brush make it easy to separate lashes.  It&#x27;s also so reasonably priced.  I have been using this mascara for a few years now.  Hope Amazon keeps selling it.</li>
            <li> I have an issue with mascara and it making my eyes itch - as well as my eyelashes.  Usually, by the end of the day, I end up with red eye. :(  This however has been different.  Doesn&#x27;t dry and feel like your eyelashes are being weighted down.  Also, I don&#x27;t wear mascara very often, but when I do I can always feel it - with this stuff I don&#x27;t feel as if I&#x27;m wearing any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, this will be my go-to mascara.</li>
            <li> Better performance than I have expected. Soft, but durable. Will order again and would recommend to anyone considering a purchase.</li>
            <li> After a while, with heat and sweat, it does smudge eventually. This is better than some products I have used before, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for organic mascara that won&#x27;t make my eyes itch and water.  The last one was clay-based and dried up/clumped up within a couple weeks.  The Palladio mascara goes on smoothly and still no clumping after 3 weeks.  If you have sensitive eyes -this one might work for you.  I haven&#x27;t had a negative reaction to this mascara.</li>
            <li> Despite the good ratings, I ended up with massive raccoon eyes with this mascara.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I really like this. IT has a strong full color and actually makes my thin, non existent eyelashes feel full and lush. It did not irritate my eyes or run, smear or smudge. The eyebrow/eyelash brush is worth the cost alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to give it a negative it would be that since its waterproof, its a little hard to get off. Coconut oil seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> More waterproof than the others I have tried.  It doesn&#x27;t smudge when I play tennis.  I really like the comb and brush on the end and was so happy to find it in brown/black.  The look it gives is more of a natural look, it doesn&#x27;t clump or flake off.  The reason I did not give it five stars is I thought it was a little pricey but overall I am pleased and would order it again.</li>
            <li> No eye irritation. Applies smoothly. Wish it were more easily available.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, no clumps.  I love that the wand also has the brow and lash brushes on the end...I use them more than I expected I would.  The mascara is non-irritating and lasts basically all day.  I might re-apply for going out at night. It&#x27;s also easy to remove.</li>
            <li> This mascara is fabulous. I never get flecks of it under my eyes at the end of the day. The brown is great for a soft natural look. The wand separates lashes very well. I will get this mascara again when I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> This mascara feels very nice, goes on smoothly. I really thought it would be more sweat resistant though, its really hot and humid here and I end up with raccoon eyes by the end of the day. It would probably be fine in winter time.</li>
            <li> I would really like to have a medium brown, but it wasn&#x27;t an option, but this brown/black is very well, and is by far the best  waterproof mascara I&#x27;ve encountered thus far.</li>
