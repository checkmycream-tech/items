            <li>Cute, well made for the price, very useful.  </li>
            <li>it was easy to set up.</li>
            <li>but if you leave it in one place and take things in and out of you should be fine.</li>
            <li>it was a cheap price&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I enjoy my organizer.</li>
            <li>Cheap and took forever to come from HongKong.</li>
            <li>I have it on the counter in my kids&#x27; bathroom for my daughter&#x27;s hair accessories being easily accessible.</li>
            <li>Small but perfect for what I was wanting them for!</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Colors are not quite as bright as I expected</li>
            <li>These are kind of cheap but work very well for my teenage girls</li>
            <li>It is more for a child then an adult.</li>
            <li>They are small, durable, look like they will be easy to clean, and have way more uses then just make up storage!</li>
            <li>Just the right size.</li>
            <li>For my needs, it was the right size.</li>
            <li>Will be great little stocking stuffers!</li>
            <li>Small, but great for the price.</li>
            <li>These are pretty containers and would be just right for lots of products and under the sink storage.</li>
            <li>I Like it so much I bought more... great for little gifts.... or secret sister items... nice for the price....</li>
            <li>Teeny tiny, but really cute and durable.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Im actually planning on buying a dozen or more of them to use in my bathroom and kitchen.</li>
            <li>Really bummed!</li>
            <li>not very big, color is nice and little compartments, but it needs to be better.  </li>
            <li>Its too small, this image is much bigger...not a good buy</li>
            <li>Handy little box to keep all my stuff in by my chair.</li>
            <li>Nice little cosmetic organizer.</li>
            <li>It would probably fall apart if you used or moved it so much</li>
            <li>I was very unimpressed when I received this in the mail.</li>
            <li>its just okay....didn&#x27;t pay much, but wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it now that I&#x27;ve seen it....</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive storage solutions.</li>
            <li>So much smaller, and seems to be really cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold much.</li>
            <li>The pockets on the side are perfect for holding things like chapstick, nail clippers, and other small things that you would normally be digging around the bottom for.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re quite handy for storing makeup, medication bottles, perfume, pens, jewelry, hair bands, and small office products like post-it notes and paper clips.</li>
            <li>but it holds several full sized bottles of bath products or a bunch of make up.</li>
            <li>Just the right size for my daily make up supplies.</li>
            <li>Must smaller than I expected but cute</li>
            <li>I love these little storage containers!</li>
            <li>At such a good price, I bought several of these little baskets to use around the house.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>Not a bad little organizer.</li>
            <li>Only holds a few things, but good for small places</li>
            <li>it barely held anything, and lacked color.</li>
            <li>Use full but to small..</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Like others said this is a good product for the price. It would probably fall apart if you used or moved it so much but if you leave it in one place and take things in and out of you should be fine. I might buy another one given the price.</li>
            <li> took over a month to get here and then they were very tiny andcheap. Wish I had seen that they were made and coming from china</li>
            <li> Very cute and nice. Smaller than the picture size but does the job.</li>
            <li> Not a bad little organizer.</li>

            <li> Very cute. I got this for a gift and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Cheap and poorly constructed.</li>
            <li> Only holds a few things, but good for small places</li>
            <li> Teeny tiny, but really cute and durable.</li>
            <li> These are pretty containers and would be just right for lots of products and under the sink storage. I&#x27;m thinking hair accessories for the grandgirls.</li>
            <li> I use it for my make-up stuff in the bathroom. Just the right size. If you are looking for something bigger, this is probably not it. Make sure you check the measurement before you buy. For my needs, it was the right size.</li>
            <li> An organizers must have</li>
            <li> Must smaller than I expected but cute&lt;br /&gt;Cheaply made but it was a cheap price&lt;br /&gt;I store hair products in them on my vanity. Works well</li>

            <li> very tiny bags.  can not hold too much if anything,  may can hold vry small trial items.  wasted money. sad</li>
            <li> I was very unimpressed when I received this in the mail. it is made of the same paper material that they use to make fancy hospital gowns and it is big enough just to hold some markers.</li>
            <li> its just okay....didn&#x27;t pay much, but wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it now that I&#x27;ve seen it....I guess you get what you pay for!!!</li>
            <li> Cute, well made for the price, very useful.  I use mine for crafts and am considering more.</li>
            <li> Colors are not quite as bright as I expected but it definitely does the trick. Don&#x27;t expect it to stand up to a lot of manhandling or abuse but for something that stays stationary it is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I enjoy my organizer. I can keep makeup in one location. I also use this as a travel organizer. I love it.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for my daily make up supplies. It looks cute on my vanity and you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>

            <li> Cheap and took forever to come from HongKong.</li>
            <li> good buy would buy again</li>
            <li> Nice little cosmetic organizer. I bought two of them and use one in the bathroom and one on my desk. Can&#x27;t bead the price and they have come in handy.</li>
            <li> Use full but to small..</li>
            <li> I use them for other items than make up. They are so cute and versatile. Thank you</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the quality.</li>
            <li> I thought it was larger, but I like it.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive storage solutions. The material resembles reusable shopping bags. Not something you&#x27;d put on your marble vanity top but great for the closet, in a drawer, or for a girl&#x27;s first organizer.</li>
            <li> I love these things. I got one for my make up and one for my coffee table to hold misc stuff in. The pockets on the side are perfect for holding things like chapstick, nail clippers, and other small things that you would normally be digging around the bottom for.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected so it doesn&#x27;t hold much but keeps small things organized</li>

            <li> To small. I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Its too small, this image is much bigger...not a good buy</li>
            <li> Obviously you get what you pay for. Extremely thin and cheap quality. Took forever to get here. I have it on the counter in my kids&#x27; bathroom for my daughter&#x27;s hair accessories being easily accessible.</li>
            <li> it was easy to set up. I love using it on my vanity and having my skincare products! Defintely would buy another one.</li>
            <li> i was not happy when i received this product. it barely held anything, and lacked color. i threw it out as soon as i opened it.</li>
            <li> I use four on my dressing table. They are a bit smaller than I would have liked but very nice and keeps everything nice and orderly.</li>
            <li> I liked the make up organizer.</li>
            <li> I love these little storage containers! Im actually planning on buying a dozen or more of them to use in my bathroom and kitchen. They are small, durable, look like they will be easy to clean, and have way more uses then just make up storage! I also love how they come in a variety of colors - the splash of color in the kitchen and bathroom will be great!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this! Do not waste your money! This is a horrible attempt at a storage box it is made out of a material one step above paper and held together with stitching that is uneven and falling off. the bottom is the thinnest piece of cardboard. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> Nice sturdy case for make up &amp; nail polishes.  Perfect size for its use.</li>
            <li> So much smaller, and seems to be really cheaply made. Really bummed! The bottles in the display picture must be travel size!</li>
            <li> Cute and functional but cheap fabric. Which is what i expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Extremely small.... Be sure you check measurements!!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter for her birthday and she is very happy with it.  It is convenient for keeping her cosmetics organized and orderly. Much better than throwing it in a drawer.</li>
            <li> I like this one..really nice to put your items in..nice cute color..Thank You!</li>
            <li> Small, but great for the price. Cute bathroom organization.  I ordered three, the orange one had a couple of small holes in the fabric.</li>

            <li> Not what I thought picture showed</li>
            <li> Small or compact but it holds several full sized bottles of bath products or a bunch of make up. Currently being used to corral medications.</li>
