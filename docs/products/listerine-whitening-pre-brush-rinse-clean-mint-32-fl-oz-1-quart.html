            <li>and I have seen a great difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Whitening has been great although I have had some problems with it.</li>
            <li>This has seemed to work well, and I&#x27;ve experienced no downsides with the Listerine rise.)</li>
            <li>my teeth are whiter and it  tastes great .</li>
            <li>Listerine has delivered a great product and I plan to continue using Listerine Whitening indefinitely.  </li>
            <li>I use it for whitening and it does the job nicely!</li>
            <li>taste is pleasant, and I&#x27;ve had no side effects although I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night for a week now.</li>
            <li>You may be pleasantly suprised.</li>
            <li>My teeth are very bright and my gums are just as healthy as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>the 2+ months I have used this product, I have been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>minute rinsing is SO MUCH BETTER than 30 minutes with tape on your teeth, lol.  </li>
            <li>It feels great and combined with brushing after the rinse, makes my mouth feel very clean.  </li>
            <li>Amazing...</li>
            <li>I can attest to the whitening power of this product, though it may not be as effective with all users.</li>
            <li>I FEEL LIKE I DESERVE SOME KIND OF COMPENSATION FOR THE</li>
            <li>I find it to be an effective product, however there are alot of inaccurate statements out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a nice mouth and now...</li>
            <li>(I am 52) and I am THRILLED with this product.</li>
            <li>If you wish to use it in the morning, it is probably best to do it after you&#x27;ve eaten breakfast, because otherwise, you won&#x27;t be tasting much of your morning meal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I would continue to use this product -</li>
            <li>/&gt;Simply put, it is very easy to use and does whiten the teeth in no time or effort.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the inside of your mouth  burning off, a very fine layer of mucose membrane.  </li>
            <li>from my first time using this product i have experienced the peeling of the mouth</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to do more than what it is meant for.</li>
            <li>Hydrogen peroxide is potent stuff.  </li>
            <li>tip of tongue burning more, underside of tongue burning more).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to know it was not just us that had this experience</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been seeing many complaints about this product, namely that it leaves a &#x27;film&#x27; over the teeth.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my teeth feel, too, as if they had just been cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li>Looks like many others agree.</li>
            <li>My front teeth were ok to start, not horrible</li>
            <li>and then I have water most of the time.</li>
            <li>After using Listerine Whitening flouride rinse as directed for 2 months, as a healthy not immunosuppressed athletic person, I got thrush in my mouth.</li>
            <li>After the swishing, I&#x27;ve also discovered that while I&#x27;m brushing, it foams up as well making the stuff work all the better.</li>
            <li>I just wish that they could have done better with the taste.</li>
            <li>Most mouthwashes make me nauseous and so I ususally avoid them.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than 6 months now.  </li>
            <li>Thank you, to all who posted and helped me realize I don&#x27;t have some exotic disease.  </li>
            <li>Hmmm, maybe I should use it again once more to see if I go into septic shock or something.  </li>
            <li>so many of you are explaining.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why they still sell it with more negatives than positives.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I loved this product at first...</li>
            <li>it was quite pleasant tasting (as moutwashes go) and had a gentle tingling sensation.</li>
            <li>guess all this means if you&#x27;re like me, and you care more about the health of your teeth than whitening, you&#x27;ll want to stick to Advanced Protection Listerine and a tartar control baking soda/peroxide toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I originally gave this a pretty good review (with reservations)</li>
            <li>respect the other reviews, but this is the best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>There are much easier and more effective ways to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li>its fine with me.</li>
            <li>My humble experience with this Listerine whitening is a great experience!</li>
            <li>I picked up a bottle last weekend thinking that it would be great for in between bleachings.   </li>
            <li>to Mexico, it&#x27;s about $3 a bottle and is the same great stuff.</li>
            <li>But after all of that, I think this stuff is great and it has lots of potential.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the white filmy</li>
            <li>If anything, this product makes my teeth feel stronger, aside from being very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it was probably just a first reaction to the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t make sense to have to buy this Listerine AND original Listerine to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>fun!</li>
            <li>burning and desensitizing of the taste buds has proved to be more than I am willing to take.  </li>
            <li>For me it doesn&#x27;t help clean it, it just irritated it.  </li>
            <li>It has a chemical flavor that doesn&#x27;t taste like the \\&quot;clean mint\\&quot; as they say.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel incredibly clean after using it--</li>
            <li>My teeth looked slightly whiter than the first day though, so I wanted to continue using this product temporarily to achieve a whiter, brighter smile! :D    </li>
            <li>I know right?!</li>
            <li>The only thing this product is good for is weight loss.  </li>
            <li>This product is great, it really does seem to help with regular &lt;br /&gt;use.  </li>
            <li>It is a mild whitening agent, not a breath freshener.</li>
            <li>I was pregnant at the time, so I had my husband try it</li>
            <li>The whitening effects of this pre-brush rinse seems almost as effective, if not more effective than a lot of whitening products you have to leave on your teeth for a much longer period of time (more like a minute than 10 seconds).</li>
            <li>To me it does not seem like a very safe product with this current formula.</li>
            <li>But as for most of brand new products, it always has the bugs where it needs work on.     </li>
            <li>to anyone who does not have a sensitive skin, I do recommend this product as an easy and cheap way to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how white my teeth are, this can&#x27;t be good for your body, it&#x27;s almost pure salt.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll have to determine if they are worth the degree of whitening you are receiving.    </li>
            <li>For me, the key to avoiding any kind of film residue on my teeth is to rinse thoroughly after brushing.</li>
            <li>now my teeth are so sore and sensitive and cant stand it any more .</li>
            <li>the &#x27;complications&#x27; aren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if the Listerine folks had put a warning about this possible side affect on their labeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-Whitening, is it really worth it to use this stuff over a bleach kit?</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has now been more than a week since I discontinued use, and my mouth is permanently salty, no matter how much clear fresh water I drink.</li>
            <li>it feels like blowing a bubble gum bubble but with your own mucus membrane...which is gross if you ask me.</li>
            <li>Used the Arm and Hammer whitening toothpaste; simply because I love the clean feeling and mouth odor of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I used it right before bed.</li>
            <li>I just wanted this thing off my tongue, right now.     </li>
            <li>It sloughs off right after the swishing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;He suggested that stopping using Listerine Whitening Pre-Brush Rinse would be the right thing to do.</li>
            <li>After all, it&#x27;s watered-down mint-flavored peroxide, right?  </li>
            <li>He said your tongue is full of glands, and that white seed-looking thing was a swollen gland filled with pus!  </li>
            <li>and I noticed right afterwards that the tip of my tongue felt funny.</li>
            <li>It was helpful to know that others have experienced the same thing, but I think I&#x27;ll hold off being totally PO&#x27;ed at Listerine.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what it was, so I used it a few more times, each time thinking, \\&quot;Surely this product woudln&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I, along with what seems like many others, have experienced weird side effects from this product.</li>
            <li>I was so impressed at how white my teeth looked after just a few uses, I was going to tell all my friends and relatives about it.</li>
            <li>Since the beginning I have experienced a slight reduction in taste after using the product, but I just considered it an inconvenience and never imagined I was killing off my taste buds completely!!    </li>
            <li>When I first bought this product, since it had \\&quot;Listerine\\&quot; on the bottle, I automatically thought that it was mouthwash.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, almost like everyone else who comments on it, I noticed that the insides of my lips and cheeks began to peel.</li>
            <li>What put my mind at ease was researching on the internet and finding so many people on Amazon reviews who had the same results.    </li>
            <li>My boyfriend uses it pretty often with no problems.</li>
            <li>At first sight, it does look like a \\&quot;film\\&quot; over my teeth</li>
            <li>Today, I rinsed with LW again, and sure enough, my mouth is peeling again.</li>
            <li>Of the 32 consumer ratings, over 20 (63%)reported one or more of the above side effects!</li>
            <li>I tried once more and discovered that the inside of my mouth was actually PEELING.</li>
            <li>I figured out today with the help of Amazon that LW emphasized every regular odors and more so allergies.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly as printed on the label.</li>
            <li>I had more of the white stringy things (mucous membrane peeling) coming out</li>
            <li>Not that I want others to suffer, but i&#x27;m glad i&#x27;m not the only one experiencing problems with this product.</li>
            <li>you love to drink tea or coffee, this helps to maintain the whiteness of your teeth on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I have used this prodcut many times, each time with the same result.</li>
            <li>This really scared me and I was going to make a Dr.s appointment!</li>
            <li>The first side effect I noticed was the skin peeling off the inside of my cheeks and gums.</li>
            <li>I must say Listerine Whitening really does the trick!</li>
            <li>I used this stuff consistently and as directed for for almost four months.  </li>
            <li>While this rinse really does help me out with whitening, I too have a problem with the inside of my mouth peeling!</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I finally read the reviews!</li>
            <li>My gums first started to die and peel away ONE HOUR after I first used the product.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty sure that the mouthwash was causing it, but I didn&#x27;t think it would be a big deal.</li>
            <li>The swelling is what alarmed me enough to search online for more info about this product.  </li>
            <li>Some people say &#x27;discoloration&#x27; - thats just the first signs of elongated taste buds - which is hairy tongue.</li>
            <li>My side/rear teeth were more yellow.</li>
            <li>As for the whitening, I have found that it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t know what was going on as clumps of skin started to form within my mouth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to pay for whiter teeth without abrasion</li>
            <li>I thought I was halucinating the first day</li>
            <li>I used the product exactly as directed for 8 days.  </li>
            <li>Thrush is rare among healthy adults -- it is more common if you have a compromised immune system (I&#x27;ve done my reading since my diagnosis).  </li>
            <li>and they said everyone has their own sensitivity with the product as with any other over-the-counter product.  </li>
            <li>For me, the main problem is gum peeling, but it also feels like someone scraped my gums with a freshly sharpened scalpel.</li>
            <li>Throughout the day I noticed that my mouth tasted funny, kind of sour...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had only good experiences with this product, which helps my teeth stay white, and plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li>but then I was certain that I noticed a difference within the first week.</li>
            <li>, not everyone will have a neutral or positive reaction as hydrogen perixide tends to make things feel \\&quot;dry\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure the peroxide kills germs, but after using it for a long time and not seeing any results, I can&#x27;t recommend it for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li>After two days not using the product my gums feel better but still not back to normal.</li>
            <li>Since I had not consumed any hot beverages or food, I was a bit perplexed and obviously concerned.</li>
            <li>I strongly advise not using this product even in smaller amounts than instructed.</li>
            <li>This morning I woke up and while brushing my teeth noticed that I had large patches of brown on my tongue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend looking into another option for whitening teeth, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend using a different mouthwash if you want fresh breath and a fresh, clean feeling in your mouth!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m guessing cause the back of my tounge was fine).</li>
            <li>Right now, my right cheek is swollen to the point that it just barely doesn&#x27;t push against my teeth.</li>
            <li>And having done telephone work, I just want to say that whoever you get on the phone when you call the company would probably face legal implications if they tried to diagnose your mouth problems.</li>
            <li>I guess you could call it disguesia, that metal taste you get, and I couldn&#x27;t taste anything very well.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the blisters, but my bottom lips was very swollen.</li>
            <li>But none of them have really worked on my teeth.</li>
            <li>And the whole day my tounge was stinging</li>
            <li>/&gt;1. followed the bottle instruction by using it BEFORE brushing and for a whole 1 MINUTE.</li>
            <li>, this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>she saw the much whiter and cleaner teeth I have now.</li>
            <li>This product is working for me, and it&#x27;s working very well.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, I don&#x27;t have the preternaturally gleaming teeth we see on TV these days, but my smile has grown considerably brighter since using this pre-brush rinse.</li>
            <li>I was VERY upset about that after I purchased the product.</li>
            <li>P.S., I dont really understand how people on here can say \\&quot;This product does not cause peeling\\&quot; or whatever.</li>
            <li>Thanks to all of you on Amazon who took the time to share your stories.</li>
            <li>this product really has me concerned.</li>
            <li>They really need to give a warning and let us know what to do about it.  </li>
            <li>but this is too much.  </li>
            <li>The whitening really does work.</li>
            <li>It really was foul-looking.</li>
            <li>Absolute horror.  </li>
            <li>I even once blamed my coffee creamer, throwing away a whole quart of 1/2&amp;1/2</li>
            <li>I have seen that some people don&#x27;t get any side effects, maybe there was not enough studies and obviously more people are sensitive than others.  </li>
            <li>Well, the next day I woke up in the morning and my mouth was much more sensitive (</li>
            <li>The longer I use it (I&#x27;m up to about 5 days and am only using it at night now), the more temperature sensitive my teeth become.  </li>
            <li>I also had trouble catching my breath.</li>
            <li>My mouth soon returned to normal!</li>
            <li>I think maybe many of the irritations that people are feeling are due to leaving this product or residue of this product in the mouth for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; more for this product than any of their other products.  </li>
            <li>It has happened to many people I see around posting on other sights.</li>
            <li>So every morning I get the same thing and have to clean it out.</li>
            <li>My teeth have experienced a small amount of whitening but relatively unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li>After the first time, I felt a the slightest hint of a sting in my right inner cheek.</li>
            <li>My teeth weren&#x27;t in great condition to start with, but within two weeks of using this product cracks in my teeth had got a lot worse, and two of them broke completely when I was eating cereal one morning!</li>
            <li>There has been several complaints about this product, I recommend that you be careful when using this product, or even better yet, DO NOT USE IT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even tried many other whitening products such as Crest Whitening strips, Colgate Simply White Whitening Gel, and many others.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks, and the following is true: &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>It honestly whitens your teeth a few shades but it doesn&#x27;t give you a \\&quot;white as the driven snow\\&quot; smile.</li>
            <li>I found that if I used for more than the recommended time, then my mouth showed slight but noticable swelling.  </li>
            <li>I used this product one more time on that second day since starting.</li>
            <li>The foaming action really made my mouth feel so much cleaner, and my teeth did seem whiter...  </li>
            <li>and he said that the chemicals in this particular breed of Listerine probably reacted in a way that (somehow) sparked an inflamatory response in my immune system.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought that grape skins had actually managed to remain in the sample that I had in my mouth as that&#x27;s exactly what it felt like.  </li>
            <li>I tried Listerine Whitening rinse, I saw a difference after the very first time and it only takes 60 seconds!!!</li>
            <li>I started noticing the difference within the first few days of using this product, but I started noticing that my teeth were more sensitive and felt weaker.</li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch listerine, i&#x27;m now looking at thousands of dollars to get everything fixed!</li>
            <li>or you can use it while in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to rinse this out of your mouth quite well and the use of a tongue scraper is highly recommended after using this whitening rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend finishing off the rinse</li>
            <li>I had been looking for an alternative to the high cost of whitening in a dental office.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2.If irritation occurs, but there is a great desire to still use this product then try to decrease the usage time to less than 60 seconds or less than twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.Do</li>
            <li>I woke up Monday morning with the normal morning breath</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally bother with reviews</li>
            <li>My doctor said the peeling can be normal for some people, it is the mucous membranes peeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for probably around six months and have had no negative side effects whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>just the normal amount of discoloration that a 26-year-old would have.  </li>
            <li>And it isn&#x27;t all too appealing when I have to use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not kidding, the lymph node in the right side of my neck actually swelled up!  </li>
            <li>SO about a week ago, I bought a new bottle, and then the problems began.</li>
            <li>THIS STUFF IS NEW</li>
            <li>I stopped using it only because I did not deem it necessary to continue to buy it as I was using a trial that came free on my Listerine.</li>
            <li>DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just using this product twice a day for three days my gums became inflamed and very sensitive.</li>
            <li>It seems some people are very sensitive to this</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I noticed the nice black stain and \\&quot;hairy\\&quot; appearance at the back of my tongue that I really knew I needed to investigate further.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really used it long enough to give a true rating.... &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>This product also made my whole mouth hurt, my tongue felt generally sore.</li>
            <li>I bought the Listerine Whitening on an impulse buy, and used it for two days and two nights, following the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li>Then the second day it felt like I had burned my tongue on hot chocolate.</li>
            <li>I became oversensitive to regular odors, my food started to taste funny.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who is contemplating the use of this product needs to be aware that one of its possible side affects is discoloration of the tongue.  </li>
            <li>It basically just freshens your breath (not even for a long time like original Listerine) and whitens (barely).  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I stopped using it for about six months because I ran out one day and was just too lazy to buy more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-The morning after that first day I used it, I noticed when I brushed my teeth a bunch of film that was on my gums.  </li>
            <li>Many people who I have spoken to that claim to have a film on their teeth afterwards usually also tell me &#x27;I use it AFTER I brush&#x27; or &#x27;I don&#x27;t brush when I use it&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>At first I figured that perhaps I was allergic, but then I \\&quot;googled\\&quot; the situation and found Amazon reviews claiming the same experience.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently doing my first set of crest whitestrips and lemme</li>
            <li>and if you ask me its time we all step back and ask ourselves just what exactly is going into consumer product today.</li>
            <li>How does one forget PEELING MOUTH ACTION!</li>
            <li>When I first used this product, I felt a slight sting on the right side of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also had the peeling gums thing after a few days of using the product, but having had oral sensitivity to other mouth washes, I really attribute it to my own reaction to the rinse.  </li>
            <li>So a few negative reviews isn&#x27;t really a good survey of the product when hundreds (thousands?) are using it now-and it was probably in a test market for a year before being released nationwide with no ill effects.  </li>
            <li>My doctor assured me that they would go away in less than a month, and warned me that I may have more pop up in the next day or two.     </li>
            <li>Maybe it doesn&#x27;t for you, but it clearly does for others, myself now included.</li>
            <li>The directions clearly tell you that it is a PRE-BRUSH rinse...</li>
            <li>Be careful not to put too much in your mouth because it foams quite a bit and can become too much to swish around in your mouth.</li>
            <li>and he said I had developed a thing called hairy tongue.</li>
            <li>He said that can happen with any whitening product to a person with a sensitive mouth.    </li>
            <li>I am absolutely horrified by this and can&#x27;t get intough with my dentist for several days.</li>
            <li>The amount of skin that comes off is in direct relation to the amount of product I use.</li>
            <li>At 5 days, they are mildly sensitive.</li>
            <li>This must be a side effect that occurs in sensitive mouths.  </li>
            <li>Sign me up for a class action law suit.</li>
            <li>it is far cheaper</li>
            <li>It is truly an offense when, 3 hours later, I still couldn&#x27;t taste much, at an Indian buffet, no less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I now have to put up with 3 overly sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Wow, I never thought Listerine Whitening could cause me to manifest symptoms of someone with the flu or an autoimmune disease.  </li>
            <li>I have developed a candida infection (thrush).  </li>
            <li>directly connect the development of the thrush to the use of this product.</li>
            <li>so I bought the regular $5 bottle and been using it for a week now and noticed that my tounge would burn and the tip would be very bumpy like it had an allerigic reaction or something.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;I am now using normal mouthwash and trying to get everything back to normal.</li>
            <li>and he told me to stop using the product immediately, that he had seen other cases of this, and a couple of days later I&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li>Then I brushed my teeth in a normal way, rinsed with water a few times, then used regular Listerine mouthwash for 30 seconds, followed by two or three more swishes with water.</li>
            <li>that the other alternatives and worth a try.</li>
            <li>On more than one occasion it has caused serious gagging.</li>
            <li>Apparently, numerous consumers are having the exact same side effect resulting from the use of your product!</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it must&#x27;ve been something in the Chinese food I had last night!!</li>
            <li>My tongue is not black</li>
            <li>I seem to be having success and wanted to see how long it would take to get completely white teeth.</li>
            <li>At a minimum, I was very close to paying the high cost of a doctor visit and lost work wages to have it checked out....and still may to see if there is any potential that your product may have caused long term damage.</li>
            <li>I think I will just put it on my toothbrush and keep it away from the rest of my mouth as much as possible, then brush normally.</li>
            <li>Well it has now been almost 2 weeks since I stopped using this product, and my mouth is finally completely back to normal.</li>
            <li>Though the difference is minimal, it is still a noticeable difference, and that is exactly what I&#x27;m looking for in a whitening agent.  </li>
            <li>Well, the next morning when I did my whole mouth-cleaning routine (as explained above)</li>
            <li>product is slightly \\&quot;foamy\\&quot; from the hydrogen peroxide, so it is useful to use before you brush your teeth</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t since because of a few statements that my skin will reproduce quickly so it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li>This is a major problem.  </li>
            <li>I had a similar lip swelling reaction when I have used plain hydrogen peroxide on a cotton swab to clean a place on my inside jaw where I had bitten it.</li>
            <li>For the money, it seems like a great deal as we all need to rinse with wash anyway to prevent bad breath.</li>
            <li>, brush combo with general Listerine antiseptic to close the deal.   </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really speak for how this product whitens because I don&#x27;t plan on using this long enough to find out!  </li>
            <li>Finding the amazon reviews where others apparently have lost skin off their gums has helped assure me, I am not dying.</li>
            <li>AS FAR BACK AS DECEMBER 2005</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 3 months, and have NEVER had such a problem.  </li>
            <li>and you can definitely feel the foaming action work.</li>
            <li>It is now 24 hours after I used it the last time and my tongue is still not back to normal.</li>
            <li>I tried using it one more time with even worse results.  </li>
            <li>And even though I recently went to the dentist and got a clean bill of health, my gums feel raw all the time and the peeling slimy film never goes away.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I was on my way to work when I had this odd sensation in my mouth, like I had a surplus of phlegm in between my cheeks and gumline.</li>
            <li>The other morning, after rinsing with it and then brushing, I noticed that the inside of my mouth was peeling (the same sensation that comes from drinking something too hot and burning the inside of one&#x27;s mouth).</li>
            <li>/&gt;The truth of the matter is you can just add a small cap of peroxide to your original Listerine dose, and you&#x27;ll get the same effect...</li>
            <li>Some have even reported more serious side effects from both short and long term use, including \\&quot;Hairy Tongue\\&quot; , Thrush, desensitized taste buds and suddenly overly sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li>The ingredients also seem to help your gums without the burn of too much alcohol, like in the other Listerine products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is one of my rare reviews simply because I don&#x27;t like bragging about stuff that drain our pocket money for little or no use.</li>
            <li>They must&#x27;ve tested this product; and considering similar comments were made by other users, I get the impression that my experience is not really that unique</li>
            <li>In all honesty, I saw a difference in the color of my teeth after the first use, but just be aware that these are very common side effects</li>
            <li>Why was my tongue developing this bizarre yellow scum?  </li>
            <li>I have used them a few times and people always say what a white, shiny smile I have.</li>
            <li>I noticed a little sensitivity in my bottom teeth the first day</li>
            <li>These are NOT minor side effects and I cannot believe this product is even on the market!</li>
            <li>I am very worried that the sour taste will not go away.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical, but this product is more effective than the expensive, customized system.</li>
            <li>It really worked for me and It is alot easier to use than ANY other whiting product!</li>
            <li>Unlike one of the other reviewers, I don&#x27;t find the taste particularly unplesant-</li>
            <li>My wife, who does not use the product, rinses about half as much.    </li>
            <li>First off - My diet consists of whole foods that are unprocessed and anti-inflammatory due to food sensitivities - I typically stay away from sugarfree gum because of adverse reactions to sucralose and aspartame.  </li>
            <li>I noticed after the 2nd time of using this product (which was on the first day of starting this product) that my teeth were slightly whiter!</li>
            <li>it only cost $4 bucks, so drastically less than other whitening products that it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>

            <li> You may be pleasantly suprised.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very bright and my gums are just as healthy as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> the 2+ months I have used this product, I have been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> minute rinsing is SO MUCH BETTER than 30 minutes with tape on your teeth, lol.  </li>
            <li> It feels great and combined with brushing after the rinse, makes my mouth feel very clean.  </li>
            <li> Amazing...</li>
            <li> I can attest to the whitening power of this product, though it may not be as effective with all users.</li>
            <li> I FEEL LIKE I DESERVE SOME KIND OF COMPENSATION FOR THE</li>
            <li> I find it to be an effective product, however there are alot of inaccurate statements out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a nice mouth and now...</li>
            <li> (I am 52) and I am THRILLED with this product.</li>
            <li> If you wish to use it in the morning, it is probably best to do it after you&#x27;ve eaten breakfast, because otherwise, you won&#x27;t be tasting much of your morning meal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I would continue to use this product -</li>
            <li> /&gt;Simply put, it is very easy to use and does whiten the teeth in no time or effort.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the inside of your mouth  burning off, a very fine layer of mucose membrane.  </li>
            <li> from my first time using this product i have experienced the peeling of the mouth</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to do more than what it is meant for.</li>
            <li> Hydrogen peroxide is potent stuff.  </li>
            <li> tip of tongue burning more, underside of tongue burning more).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to know it was not just us that had this experience</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been seeing many complaints about this product, namely that it leaves a &#x27;film&#x27; over the teeth.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my teeth feel, too, as if they had just been cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> Looks like many others agree.</li>
            <li> My front teeth were ok to start, not horrible</li>
            <li> and then I have water most of the time.</li>
            <li> After using Listerine Whitening flouride rinse as directed for 2 months, as a healthy not immunosuppressed athletic person, I got thrush in my mouth.</li>
            <li> After the swishing, I&#x27;ve also discovered that while I&#x27;m brushing, it foams up as well making the stuff work all the better.</li>
            <li> I just wish that they could have done better with the taste.</li>
            <li> Most mouthwashes make me nauseous and so I ususally avoid them.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 6 months now.  </li>
            <li> Thank you, to all who posted and helped me realize I don&#x27;t have some exotic disease.  </li>
            <li> Hmmm, maybe I should use it again once more to see if I go into septic shock or something.  </li>
            <li> so many of you are explaining.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why they still sell it with more negatives than positives.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I loved this product at first...</li>
            <li> it was quite pleasant tasting (as moutwashes go) and had a gentle tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> guess all this means if you&#x27;re like me, and you care more about the health of your teeth than whitening, you&#x27;ll want to stick to Advanced Protection Listerine and a tartar control baking soda/peroxide toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I originally gave this a pretty good review (with reservations)</li>
            <li> respect the other reviews, but this is the best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> There are much easier and more effective ways to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> its fine with me.</li>
            <li> My humble experience with this Listerine whitening is a great experience!</li>
            <li> I picked up a bottle last weekend thinking that it would be great for in between bleachings.   </li>
            <li> to Mexico, it&#x27;s about $3 a bottle and is the same great stuff.</li>
            <li> But after all of that, I think this stuff is great and it has lots of potential.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the white filmy</li>
            <li> If anything, this product makes my teeth feel stronger, aside from being very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it was probably just a first reaction to the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t make sense to have to buy this Listerine AND original Listerine to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> fun!</li>
            <li> burning and desensitizing of the taste buds has proved to be more than I am willing to take.  </li>
            <li> For me it doesn&#x27;t help clean it, it just irritated it.  </li>
            <li> It has a chemical flavor that doesn&#x27;t taste like the \\&quot;clean mint\\&quot; as they say.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel incredibly clean after using it--</li>
            <li> My teeth looked slightly whiter than the first day though, so I wanted to continue using this product temporarily to achieve a whiter, brighter smile! :D    </li>
            <li> I know right?!</li>
            <li> The only thing this product is good for is weight loss.  </li>
            <li> This product is great, it really does seem to help with regular &lt;br /&gt;use.  </li>
            <li> It is a mild whitening agent, not a breath freshener.</li>
            <li> I was pregnant at the time, so I had my husband try it</li>
            <li> The whitening effects of this pre-brush rinse seems almost as effective, if not more effective than a lot of whitening products you have to leave on your teeth for a much longer period of time (more like a minute than 10 seconds).</li>
            <li> To me it does not seem like a very safe product with this current formula.</li>
            <li> But as for most of brand new products, it always has the bugs where it needs work on.     </li>
            <li> to anyone who does not have a sensitive skin, I do recommend this product as an easy and cheap way to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how white my teeth are, this can&#x27;t be good for your body, it&#x27;s almost pure salt.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have to determine if they are worth the degree of whitening you are receiving.    </li>
            <li> For me, the key to avoiding any kind of film residue on my teeth is to rinse thoroughly after brushing.</li>
            <li> now my teeth are so sore and sensitive and cant stand it any more .</li>
            <li> the &#x27;complications&#x27; aren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if the Listerine folks had put a warning about this possible side affect on their labeling.</li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-Whitening, is it really worth it to use this stuff over a bleach kit?</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has now been more than a week since I discontinued use, and my mouth is permanently salty, no matter how much clear fresh water I drink.</li>
            <li> it feels like blowing a bubble gum bubble but with your own mucus membrane...which is gross if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Used the Arm and Hammer whitening toothpaste; simply because I love the clean feeling and mouth odor of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I used it right before bed.</li>
            <li> I just wanted this thing off my tongue, right now.     </li>
            <li> It sloughs off right after the swishing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;He suggested that stopping using Listerine Whitening Pre-Brush Rinse would be the right thing to do.</li>
            <li> After all, it&#x27;s watered-down mint-flavored peroxide, right?  </li>
            <li> He said your tongue is full of glands, and that white seed-looking thing was a swollen gland filled with pus!  </li>
            <li> and I noticed right afterwards that the tip of my tongue felt funny.</li>
            <li> It was helpful to know that others have experienced the same thing, but I think I&#x27;ll hold off being totally PO&#x27;ed at Listerine.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what it was, so I used it a few more times, each time thinking, \\&quot;Surely this product woudln&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I, along with what seems like many others, have experienced weird side effects from this product.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed at how white my teeth looked after just a few uses, I was going to tell all my friends and relatives about it.</li>
            <li> Since the beginning I have experienced a slight reduction in taste after using the product, but I just considered it an inconvenience and never imagined I was killing off my taste buds completely!!    </li>
            <li> When I first bought this product, since it had \\&quot;Listerine\\&quot; on the bottle, I automatically thought that it was mouthwash.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, almost like everyone else who comments on it, I noticed that the insides of my lips and cheeks began to peel.</li>
            <li> What put my mind at ease was researching on the internet and finding so many people on Amazon reviews who had the same results.    </li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses it pretty often with no problems.</li>
            <li> At first sight, it does look like a \\&quot;film\\&quot; over my teeth</li>
            <li> Today, I rinsed with LW again, and sure enough, my mouth is peeling again.</li>
            <li> Of the 32 consumer ratings, over 20 (63%)reported one or more of the above side effects!</li>
            <li> I tried once more and discovered that the inside of my mouth was actually PEELING.</li>
            <li> I figured out today with the help of Amazon that LW emphasized every regular odors and more so allergies.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly as printed on the label.</li>
            <li> I had more of the white stringy things (mucous membrane peeling) coming out</li>
            <li> Not that I want others to suffer, but i&#x27;m glad i&#x27;m not the only one experiencing problems with this product.</li>
            <li> you love to drink tea or coffee, this helps to maintain the whiteness of your teeth on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I have used this prodcut many times, each time with the same result.</li>
            <li> This really scared me and I was going to make a Dr.s appointment!</li>
            <li> The first side effect I noticed was the skin peeling off the inside of my cheeks and gums.</li>
            <li> I must say Listerine Whitening really does the trick!</li>
            <li> I used this stuff consistently and as directed for for almost four months.  </li>
            <li> While this rinse really does help me out with whitening, I too have a problem with the inside of my mouth peeling!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I finally read the reviews!</li>
            <li> My gums first started to die and peel away ONE HOUR after I first used the product.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty sure that the mouthwash was causing it, but I didn&#x27;t think it would be a big deal.</li>
            <li> The swelling is what alarmed me enough to search online for more info about this product.  </li>
            <li> Some people say &#x27;discoloration&#x27; - thats just the first signs of elongated taste buds - which is hairy tongue.</li>
            <li> My side/rear teeth were more yellow.</li>
            <li> As for the whitening, I have found that it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know what was going on as clumps of skin started to form within my mouth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to pay for whiter teeth without abrasion</li>
            <li> I thought I was halucinating the first day</li>
            <li> I used the product exactly as directed for 8 days.  </li>
            <li> Thrush is rare among healthy adults -- it is more common if you have a compromised immune system (I&#x27;ve done my reading since my diagnosis).  </li>
            <li> and they said everyone has their own sensitivity with the product as with any other over-the-counter product.  </li>
            <li> For me, the main problem is gum peeling, but it also feels like someone scraped my gums with a freshly sharpened scalpel.</li>
            <li> Throughout the day I noticed that my mouth tasted funny, kind of sour...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had only good experiences with this product, which helps my teeth stay white, and plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> but then I was certain that I noticed a difference within the first week.</li>
            <li> , not everyone will have a neutral or positive reaction as hydrogen perixide tends to make things feel \\&quot;dry\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure the peroxide kills germs, but after using it for a long time and not seeing any results, I can&#x27;t recommend it for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> After two days not using the product my gums feel better but still not back to normal.</li>
            <li> Since I had not consumed any hot beverages or food, I was a bit perplexed and obviously concerned.</li>
            <li> I strongly advise not using this product even in smaller amounts than instructed.</li>
            <li> This morning I woke up and while brushing my teeth noticed that I had large patches of brown on my tongue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend looking into another option for whitening teeth, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend using a different mouthwash if you want fresh breath and a fresh, clean feeling in your mouth!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m guessing cause the back of my tounge was fine).</li>
            <li> Right now, my right cheek is swollen to the point that it just barely doesn&#x27;t push against my teeth.</li>
            <li> And having done telephone work, I just want to say that whoever you get on the phone when you call the company would probably face legal implications if they tried to diagnose your mouth problems.</li>
            <li> I guess you could call it disguesia, that metal taste you get, and I couldn&#x27;t taste anything very well.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the blisters, but my bottom lips was very swollen.</li>
            <li> But none of them have really worked on my teeth.</li>
            <li> And the whole day my tounge was stinging</li>
            <li> /&gt;1. followed the bottle instruction by using it BEFORE brushing and for a whole 1 MINUTE.</li>
            <li> , this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> she saw the much whiter and cleaner teeth I have now.</li>
            <li> This product is working for me, and it&#x27;s working very well.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I don&#x27;t have the preternaturally gleaming teeth we see on TV these days, but my smile has grown considerably brighter since using this pre-brush rinse.</li>
            <li> I was VERY upset about that after I purchased the product.</li>
            <li> P.S., I dont really understand how people on here can say \\&quot;This product does not cause peeling\\&quot; or whatever.</li>
            <li> Thanks to all of you on Amazon who took the time to share your stories.</li>
            <li> this product really has me concerned.</li>
            <li> They really need to give a warning and let us know what to do about it.  </li>
            <li> but this is too much.  </li>
            <li> The whitening really does work.</li>
            <li> It really was foul-looking.</li>
            <li> Absolute horror.  </li>
            <li> I even once blamed my coffee creamer, throwing away a whole quart of 1/2&amp;1/2</li>
            <li> I have seen that some people don&#x27;t get any side effects, maybe there was not enough studies and obviously more people are sensitive than others.  </li>
            <li> Well, the next day I woke up in the morning and my mouth was much more sensitive (</li>
            <li> The longer I use it (I&#x27;m up to about 5 days and am only using it at night now), the more temperature sensitive my teeth become.  </li>
            <li> I also had trouble catching my breath.</li>
            <li> My mouth soon returned to normal!</li>
            <li> I think maybe many of the irritations that people are feeling are due to leaving this product or residue of this product in the mouth for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; more for this product than any of their other products.  </li>
            <li> It has happened to many people I see around posting on other sights.</li>
            <li> So every morning I get the same thing and have to clean it out.</li>
            <li> My teeth have experienced a small amount of whitening but relatively unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li> After the first time, I felt a the slightest hint of a sting in my right inner cheek.</li>
            <li> My teeth weren&#x27;t in great condition to start with, but within two weeks of using this product cracks in my teeth had got a lot worse, and two of them broke completely when I was eating cereal one morning!</li>
            <li> There has been several complaints about this product, I recommend that you be careful when using this product, or even better yet, DO NOT USE IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried many other whitening products such as Crest Whitening strips, Colgate Simply White Whitening Gel, and many others.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks, and the following is true: &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> It honestly whitens your teeth a few shades but it doesn&#x27;t give you a \\&quot;white as the driven snow\\&quot; smile.</li>
            <li> I found that if I used for more than the recommended time, then my mouth showed slight but noticable swelling.  </li>
            <li> I used this product one more time on that second day since starting.</li>
            <li> The foaming action really made my mouth feel so much cleaner, and my teeth did seem whiter...  </li>
            <li> and he said that the chemicals in this particular breed of Listerine probably reacted in a way that (somehow) sparked an inflamatory response in my immune system.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought that grape skins had actually managed to remain in the sample that I had in my mouth as that&#x27;s exactly what it felt like.  </li>
            <li> I tried Listerine Whitening rinse, I saw a difference after the very first time and it only takes 60 seconds!!!</li>
            <li> I started noticing the difference within the first few days of using this product, but I started noticing that my teeth were more sensitive and felt weaker.</li>
            <li> Thanks a bunch listerine, i&#x27;m now looking at thousands of dollars to get everything fixed!</li>
            <li> or you can use it while in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to rinse this out of your mouth quite well and the use of a tongue scraper is highly recommended after using this whitening rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend finishing off the rinse</li>
            <li> I had been looking for an alternative to the high cost of whitening in a dental office.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2.If irritation occurs, but there is a great desire to still use this product then try to decrease the usage time to less than 60 seconds or less than twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.Do</li>
            <li> I woke up Monday morning with the normal morning breath</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally bother with reviews</li>
            <li> My doctor said the peeling can be normal for some people, it is the mucous membranes peeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for probably around six months and have had no negative side effects whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> just the normal amount of discoloration that a 26-year-old would have.  </li>
            <li> And it isn&#x27;t all too appealing when I have to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not kidding, the lymph node in the right side of my neck actually swelled up!  </li>
            <li> SO about a week ago, I bought a new bottle, and then the problems began.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS NEW</li>
            <li> I stopped using it only because I did not deem it necessary to continue to buy it as I was using a trial that came free on my Listerine.</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just using this product twice a day for three days my gums became inflamed and very sensitive.</li>
            <li> It seems some people are very sensitive to this</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I noticed the nice black stain and \\&quot;hairy\\&quot; appearance at the back of my tongue that I really knew I needed to investigate further.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really used it long enough to give a true rating.... &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This product also made my whole mouth hurt, my tongue felt generally sore.</li>
            <li> I bought the Listerine Whitening on an impulse buy, and used it for two days and two nights, following the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li> Then the second day it felt like I had burned my tongue on hot chocolate.</li>
            <li> I became oversensitive to regular odors, my food started to taste funny.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who is contemplating the use of this product needs to be aware that one of its possible side affects is discoloration of the tongue.  </li>
            <li> It basically just freshens your breath (not even for a long time like original Listerine) and whitens (barely).  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I stopped using it for about six months because I ran out one day and was just too lazy to buy more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The morning after that first day I used it, I noticed when I brushed my teeth a bunch of film that was on my gums.  </li>
            <li> Many people who I have spoken to that claim to have a film on their teeth afterwards usually also tell me &#x27;I use it AFTER I brush&#x27; or &#x27;I don&#x27;t brush when I use it&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> At first I figured that perhaps I was allergic, but then I \\&quot;googled\\&quot; the situation and found Amazon reviews claiming the same experience.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently doing my first set of crest whitestrips and lemme</li>
            <li> and if you ask me its time we all step back and ask ourselves just what exactly is going into consumer product today.</li>
            <li> How does one forget PEELING MOUTH ACTION!</li>
            <li> When I first used this product, I felt a slight sting on the right side of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also had the peeling gums thing after a few days of using the product, but having had oral sensitivity to other mouth washes, I really attribute it to my own reaction to the rinse.  </li>
            <li> So a few negative reviews isn&#x27;t really a good survey of the product when hundreds (thousands?) are using it now-and it was probably in a test market for a year before being released nationwide with no ill effects.  </li>
            <li> My doctor assured me that they would go away in less than a month, and warned me that I may have more pop up in the next day or two.     </li>
            <li> Maybe it doesn&#x27;t for you, but it clearly does for others, myself now included.</li>
            <li> The directions clearly tell you that it is a PRE-BRUSH rinse...</li>
            <li> Be careful not to put too much in your mouth because it foams quite a bit and can become too much to swish around in your mouth.</li>
            <li> and he said I had developed a thing called hairy tongue.</li>
            <li> He said that can happen with any whitening product to a person with a sensitive mouth.    </li>
            <li> I am absolutely horrified by this and can&#x27;t get intough with my dentist for several days.</li>
            <li> The amount of skin that comes off is in direct relation to the amount of product I use.</li>
            <li> At 5 days, they are mildly sensitive.</li>
            <li> This must be a side effect that occurs in sensitive mouths.  </li>
            <li> Sign me up for a class action law suit.</li>
            <li> it is far cheaper</li>
            <li> It is truly an offense when, 3 hours later, I still couldn&#x27;t taste much, at an Indian buffet, no less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I now have to put up with 3 overly sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Wow, I never thought Listerine Whitening could cause me to manifest symptoms of someone with the flu or an autoimmune disease.  </li>
            <li> I have developed a candida infection (thrush).  </li>
            <li> directly connect the development of the thrush to the use of this product.</li>
            <li> so I bought the regular $5 bottle and been using it for a week now and noticed that my tounge would burn and the tip would be very bumpy like it had an allerigic reaction or something.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;I am now using normal mouthwash and trying to get everything back to normal.</li>
            <li> and he told me to stop using the product immediately, that he had seen other cases of this, and a couple of days later I&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li> Then I brushed my teeth in a normal way, rinsed with water a few times, then used regular Listerine mouthwash for 30 seconds, followed by two or three more swishes with water.</li>
            <li> that the other alternatives and worth a try.</li>
            <li> On more than one occasion it has caused serious gagging.</li>
            <li> Apparently, numerous consumers are having the exact same side effect resulting from the use of your product!</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it must&#x27;ve been something in the Chinese food I had last night!!</li>
            <li> My tongue is not black</li>
            <li> I seem to be having success and wanted to see how long it would take to get completely white teeth.</li>
            <li> At a minimum, I was very close to paying the high cost of a doctor visit and lost work wages to have it checked out....and still may to see if there is any potential that your product may have caused long term damage.</li>
            <li> I think I will just put it on my toothbrush and keep it away from the rest of my mouth as much as possible, then brush normally.</li>
            <li> Well it has now been almost 2 weeks since I stopped using this product, and my mouth is finally completely back to normal.</li>
            <li> Though the difference is minimal, it is still a noticeable difference, and that is exactly what I&#x27;m looking for in a whitening agent.  </li>
            <li> Well, the next morning when I did my whole mouth-cleaning routine (as explained above)</li>
            <li> product is slightly \\&quot;foamy\\&quot; from the hydrogen peroxide, so it is useful to use before you brush your teeth</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t since because of a few statements that my skin will reproduce quickly so it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> This is a major problem.  </li>
            <li> I had a similar lip swelling reaction when I have used plain hydrogen peroxide on a cotton swab to clean a place on my inside jaw where I had bitten it.</li>
            <li> For the money, it seems like a great deal as we all need to rinse with wash anyway to prevent bad breath.</li>
            <li> , brush combo with general Listerine antiseptic to close the deal.   </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really speak for how this product whitens because I don&#x27;t plan on using this long enough to find out!  </li>
            <li> Finding the amazon reviews where others apparently have lost skin off their gums has helped assure me, I am not dying.</li>
            <li> AS FAR BACK AS DECEMBER 2005</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 3 months, and have NEVER had such a problem.  </li>
            <li> and you can definitely feel the foaming action work.</li>
            <li> It is now 24 hours after I used it the last time and my tongue is still not back to normal.</li>
            <li> I tried using it one more time with even worse results.  </li>
            <li> And even though I recently went to the dentist and got a clean bill of health, my gums feel raw all the time and the peeling slimy film never goes away.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was on my way to work when I had this odd sensation in my mouth, like I had a surplus of phlegm in between my cheeks and gumline.</li>
            <li> The other morning, after rinsing with it and then brushing, I noticed that the inside of my mouth was peeling (the same sensation that comes from drinking something too hot and burning the inside of one&#x27;s mouth).</li>
            <li> /&gt;The truth of the matter is you can just add a small cap of peroxide to your original Listerine dose, and you&#x27;ll get the same effect...</li>
            <li> Some have even reported more serious side effects from both short and long term use, including \\&quot;Hairy Tongue\\&quot; , Thrush, desensitized taste buds and suddenly overly sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> The ingredients also seem to help your gums without the burn of too much alcohol, like in the other Listerine products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is one of my rare reviews simply because I don&#x27;t like bragging about stuff that drain our pocket money for little or no use.</li>
            <li> They must&#x27;ve tested this product; and considering similar comments were made by other users, I get the impression that my experience is not really that unique</li>
            <li> In all honesty, I saw a difference in the color of my teeth after the first use, but just be aware that these are very common side effects</li>
            <li> Why was my tongue developing this bizarre yellow scum?  </li>
            <li> I have used them a few times and people always say what a white, shiny smile I have.</li>
            <li> I noticed a little sensitivity in my bottom teeth the first day</li>
            <li> These are NOT minor side effects and I cannot believe this product is even on the market!</li>
            <li> I am very worried that the sour taste will not go away.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical, but this product is more effective than the expensive, customized system.</li>
            <li> It really worked for me and It is alot easier to use than ANY other whiting product!</li>
            <li> Unlike one of the other reviewers, I don&#x27;t find the taste particularly unplesant-</li>
            <li> My wife, who does not use the product, rinses about half as much.    </li>
            <li> First off - My diet consists of whole foods that are unprocessed and anti-inflammatory due to food sensitivities - I typically stay away from sugarfree gum because of adverse reactions to sucralose and aspartame.  </li>
            <li> I noticed after the 2nd time of using this product (which was on the first day of starting this product) that my teeth were slightly whiter!</li>
            <li> it only cost $4 bucks, so drastically less than other whitening products that it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li> It was like the taste-buds were hard, right on the tip of my tongue.</li>
            <li> so far i have talked with 7 other people and they say the same thing .</li>
            <li> I have also developed a constant sour taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am tempted to keep using it because I am eating less, I can&#x27;t taste anything, and I am curious as to how much skin I can lose from my gums.</li>
            <li> I KNOW how to count to 60 and KNOW how long a second is.    </li>
            <li> But apparently not.</li>
            <li> If your teeth are a little yellow because you smoke (though you shouldn&#x27;t smoke) or are addicted to tea and coffee (like me) then you&#x27;ll have to smile less, or else just stop worrying about something so trivial as a Hollywood smile.</li>
            <li> Also, since I gargled with it, the back of my mouth was affected, especially the back of my tongue which was left with a sour taste up to week after I stopped using it.    </li>
            <li> tongue and all other side effects people have mentioned can be caused by regular use of mouthwashes containing oxidizing agents, such as peroxide, or astringent agents, such as witch hazel or menthol.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I docked a star because I don&#x27;t feel the warning or directions emphasise the strength of this product or the side effects that could be dealt with enough- making many unhappy users.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that in the last 3 months  the skin inside my mouth is peeling, and my lips dry and cracking.  </li>
            <li> review is only for average lazy people who don&#x27;t like to spend lot of money or time to get a whiter teeth and don&#x27;t really care about modeling on TV to show their teeth!</li>
            <li> It is nothing extreme, but hey it is a mouthwash (that should be obvious considering our current teeth whitening technology and the price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went to the bathroom mirror, and I had a 1/2 inch PINK string (the color of my tongue) with a white ball</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so strange that none of these side effects are mentioned on the bottle.</li>
            <li> and how long did it take?</li>
            <li> My teeth are not sensitive</li>
            <li> Gross discoloration at the back of my tongue, the so called \\&quot;black tongue\\&quot; appeared after about 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I have used other whitening products and the only side affect I&#x27;ve had was sensitive teeth, which went away after a few hours</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a week--probably not long enough for this to whiten, but certainly long enough for me to figure out that this product is not safe!</li>
            <li> how long this is gonna last after I stop the product since I am NOT willing to pay for it all my life.</li>
            <li> On top of all of this, THE ENTIRE UNDERSIDE OF MY TONGUE looked white and was peeling off starting at the base.</li>
            <li> Who knows what long term use would do to your mouth!</li>
            <li> I noticed that my breakfast a couple of hours later lacked any flavor, as did any other food/drink I had.</li>
            <li> Later on in the day, I kept getting these little white stringy things (which turned out to be the mucous membranes of my mouth peeling).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products such as the whitening trays</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if considering this product and are turned off by the reviews, recall that most people won&#x27;t review a product-especially a daily, household use product-unless they have something bad to say.</li>
            <li> I have an expensive teeth whitening system (molded trays) that I had made for me by my dentist that I rarely use because it requires setting aside 30 minutes where I can&#x27;t be in public or talk on the phone.</li>
            <li> Gross, white, slimy, dead mucous membranes all over my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I know that the active ingredient in this mouthwash is hydrogen peroxide, the same stuff you buy in the pharmacy to clean/sterilize wounds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never reviewed a product on-line before, but this Listerine Whitening garbage has made me so miserable over the past couple of weeks that I am absolutely compelled to tell you that while some people may not have side effects, I most certainly did.</li>
            <li> My mouth improved every single day of not using this product.      </li>
            <li> I had 3 other smaller &#x27;&#x27;strings&#x27;&#x27; on the underside of my tongue, though they did not have the white ball on the end and were half the size of that super-nasty one.</li>
            <li> star to the product,  and ZERO stars to Listerine/Pfizer for not having the guts to tell me that this was not normal and was cells sloughing off the inside of my mouth.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve cut down to only 1-2 teaspoons of product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just poured the entire bottle down the drain and have discarded it to never be used or recommended again.</li>
            <li> Moreover, my inner lips have began peeling, although not as badly as I&#x27;ve read in many other reviews.</li>
            <li> If the &#x27;downfall&#x27; is a little residue that can easily be brushed away..</li>
            <li> So now my teeth all seem to be about the same color, and a little whiter.</li>
            <li> Really, trading slightly whiter teeth for a black tongue is not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> In any event, I&#x27;ve had no side effects but find the alleged whitening properties somewhat overstated by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> so I expected something.</li>
            <li> Currently however, I have been waking up to loads of dead skin cells, or if not...</li>
            <li> Obviously not everyone will have this reaction but I would definitely say that even a small chance of having this side effect is not worth any cosmetic benefits.  </li>
            <li> AND I SPENT 2 WEEKS LOSING MY MIND</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a few times before brushing and about 1/2 hour later feel this filmy residue all over the inside of my mouth &amp; gums leaving my mouth feeling dirtier than if I used no mouthwash at all.</li>
            <li> It had absolutely no effect on the whiteness of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The slight whitening this product might have produced is certainly not worth the discomfort, medical visit, and anti-fungal treatment.</li>
            <li> Its certainly not going to give you mirror finish on your teeth, butit WILL noticeably brighten your teeth.</li>
            <li> I pulled on it slightly, but it would not break loose.</li>
            <li> There are other alternatives to whitening that I will stick with.</li>
            <li> After following the manufacturer&#x27;s directions ASSIDUOUSLY four times (morning and evening for two consecutive days), I felt those strings of skin hanging from my pallet that are usually associated with the burns one gets from too-hot pizza (\\&quot;Is</li>
            <li> However, Tuesday morning (today), I had some of the peeling of the gums or whatever that other folks have mentioned.</li>
            <li> have used other whitening products, and find this to be the easiest to use.</li>
            <li> As some other users have described, there are side effect to this product.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> If I use the full dose, my tongue goes numb and stays that way for over an hour.  </li>
            <li> as for the person who said that the peeling may be due to the product renewing the gums -- what????  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that anyone agrees with the concept of fluoride presenting as a neurotoxin, but after my first two applications, I&#x27;ve had disturbing neurological side effects that can only be a result of the chemical make up of this product.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews here, I know what the problem is now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 4 kids naturally and the pain was not as bad as how much my mouth hurt.  </li>
            <li> Only the very tip of my tongue gets numb this way</li>
            <li> My biggest bones to pick with the product are that it doesn&#x27;t freshen your breath nearly as well as regular Listerine, and it leaves this weird, scummy residue in your mouth.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT RIGHT.</li>
            <li> somethings just not right with this stuff</li>
            <li> , take-the-skin-off-your-mouth, black tongue side effects ther other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> taste is rather unpleasant, and it has a sickly sweet aftertaste that coats your mouth.  </li>
            <li> however the side effect is not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> some icky white and gooey stuff, in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Any product that has effects like this is just not worth it.</li>
            <li> I still have the sour taste and my tongue still feels burnt.</li>
            <li> Over time, it has also created a most annoying sensation, like having cotton fabric in my mouth.</li>
            <li> To make things worse, my taste is nearly gone</li>
            <li> but I think it had just fallen down to the bottom recesses of my mouth that way.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t relate it to using the Listerine and thought I had &#x27;thrush&#x27; or some other mouth disease!</li>
            <li> Though this product seems to be whitening my teeth, it&#x27;s also doing a few other things that are a cause for concern</li>
            <li> Less than 2 weeks ago, I purchase a bottle of Listerine Whitening Rinse.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I was imagining it, but they did seem slightly whiter.    </li>
            <li> POSSIBLY HALF OF EVERYONE USING THIS PRODUCT ARE HAVING ADVERSE REACTIONS.</li>
            <li> Probably not, with trays and bleaching gels you get the stuff on your teeth where it belongs, and less of it on your gums where it doesn&#x27;t. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s freakin black hair on my tongue.</li>
            <li> Everything has started tasting bland.  </li>
            <li> If you are sensitve to the side effects, swish for less time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scary that there is no approval from the FDA on the oral nature of this product though it is not technically a food, it does enter our system in the same method.</li>
            <li> and I half to be half-dead before I&#x27;ll call a doctor.  </li>
            <li> I hope I don&#x27;t get the same serious reactions as everyone else.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I&#x27;d noticed all the extra gunk in my mouth too--but had no idea why, and just supposed it was something I was eating that kept irritating my mouth.</li>
            <li> But worst of all, it left a strange, white, filmy residue in my mouth which I would only discover later in the day where I would find myself making embarassing movements with my tongue in an attempt to dislodge the substance from my gums.  </li>
            <li> (though twice I&#x27;ve gotten a little blistery sore there that is gone by the a.m.) and the amount of skin that comes off the inside of my mouth is less (though it still comes off).  </li>
            <li> It started out mild and just occuring in the morning (after using it the previous night), but has gotten really bad and now lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, it was weird, but it wasn&#x27;t painful, like some of the other reviewers described.</li>
            <li> It looked as though I had been eating black licorice or drinking heavy duty espresso.  </li>
            <li> My tongue also burned just a little bit on the tip, and underneath.  </li>
            <li> A LITTLE</li>
            <li> I started to pannic a little, what happened, do I have a disease,</li>
            <li> In fact, if you leave this in your mouth a little longer it whitens twice as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it!  </li>
            <li> I dont usually do this sort of thing but after reading the other reviews I decided I should speak up.</li>
            <li> I am shocked that this many people have been experiencing side effects much worse than mine in less than a WEEK&#x27;s usage of this product.</li>
            <li> Am I the only one cynical enough to question the authenticity of the barrage of one-star overwrought reviews?  </li>
            <li> I have been using Listerine Whitening for maybe a few weeks now</li>
            <li> The Listerine Whitening inhibited the healing of the cut and actually made it worse.  </li>
            <li> Sorry if you are too far away to make it to Mexico, you will pay the &amp;#34;bootleg&amp;#34; price you see on the internet of up to $17 a bottle.</li>
            <li> I tried this product yesterday, and I can say a few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few months ago I used this and when I woke up the inside of my cheek was peeling.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not a fan of fearing for my life over a poor choice in mouthwash...</li>
            <li> Not feeling particularly phlemgy, this was weird, and I felt around and my finger came away with a weird, sticky looking pearly white residue.</li>
            <li> at least I&#x27;ll be saving money when I don&#x27;t have to buy this stuff anymore (and my teeth never really got any whiter either!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the pre-brush rinse for the past few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have only used Listerine pre-brush whitening once but the side affects are bad enough to make me never use it again and insist that my boyfriend, who had no side affects, throw it away immediately.  </li>
            <li> , I wanted these little *&amp;@#&amp;^!</li>
            <li> Washed my mouth thouroughly (since preoxide and other whitnening stuff are no good for gum) then</li>
            <li> Too bad, it works, but the side effects are too much to pay.</li>
            <li> This Listerine experience was really that bad.)  </li>
            <li> They because VERY chapped and painful.  </li>
            <li> the size of a small seed hanging from the tip of this &#x27;&#x27;string&#x27;&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It kills germs, yes, but it should NOT be used to replace your ordinary mouth wash.</li>
            <li> My teeth aren&#x27;t excessively discolored either;</li>
            <li> for the past 6 weeks or so.  </li>
            <li> cheaper\\&quot; :/</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a serious waste of money.</li>
            <li> But, if your mouth is in the least bit sensitive, be prepaired for this very irritating side effect!</li>
            <li> Like the stuff that comes off your hard palate when you burn your mouth with a slice of pizza.  </li>
            <li> I would personally like to give this product a negative number of stars!!!       </li>
            <li> I AM GOING TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE FDA ABOUT THIS.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the person who said that for every complaint, there are plenty of people who have no side effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a coffee drinker in my late 40s.  </li>
            <li> Obviously I did not use anymore of this crazy listerine whitening pre-brush rinse [...]</li>
            <li> Yes, if you do not brush thoroughly afterwards, you will find some gel-like residue between your teeth - as you would with all the common whitening &#x27;gels&#x27; and &#x27;strips&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I contacted my dentist who advised that this was sloughing cells from the lining of my mouth,  and that this was a common allergic/ sensitivity reaction to chemicals in mouth care products.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wondered when they&#x27;d release a whitening mouthwash (or at least, close to it).</li>
            <li> But it is much easier to use then the strips which I really hate (speak about that gelly stuff on it and the feeling of the strip in my mouth).</li>
            <li> And my taste is returning slowly.    </li>
            <li> Otherwise I am forced to stop using it and warn others.  </li>
            <li> As I ran my tongue through the inside of my mouth a thick film of skin came off and continues to do so every time I use this product.  </li>
            <li> thought I may have mouth Cancer or some other diesease!!!!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an inexpensive alternative to the dental laser procedure, that annoying night plate or any of those other so-called &#x27;miracle&#x27; whitening products, then look no further; Listerine delivers.  </li>
            <li> I really mean it.</li>
            <li> For one, there is the big complaint, the nasty white goo on your teeth.</li>
            <li> So I seriously doubt that I&#x27;ll use it again after I finish my bottle.     </li>
            <li> This wash only kills germs for bad breath</li>
            <li> So, I went to the fridge, drank a glass of water, and ate a tiny piece of chocolate to get rid of the bad taste.  </li>
            <li> Having read all of the other reviews, I am now afraid of what else may happen to my mouth if I continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t bad, but if you use it, only use a very small amount because it does foam up a lot!  </li>
            <li> But maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be so naive!  </li>
            <li> it certainly beats the nasty Zinc aftertaste of the Tarter Control</li>
            <li> AFTER I EXPERIENCED THIS AWFUL AND DISGUSTING</li>
            <li> You could see the white surface lifting up and flaking away at the base of my tongue on the under-side.    </li>
            <li> I have also NOT experienced any increase of tooth sensitivity, as some customers have claimed to have.  </li>
            <li> Also - my breath gets worse by the end of the day than before.  </li>
            <li> However, the swelling got worse after each day (I used this mouthwash every night and once in the morning).</li>
            <li> If this product is killing the outer layer of skin in my mouth (inside of cheeks), I would hate to see what this could potentially do to the tastebuds on my tongue as well!</li>
            <li> I just got done using the product and looked to see if that was normal and stumbled upon these review and was DISGUSTED.</li>
            <li> I was also starting to think that I had gotten a bottle from a bad batch!  </li>
            <li> Fortunately no hairy tongue or thrush, but its still painful.</li>
            <li> I was so scared of what I was experiencing that I was unable to sleep.  </li>
            <li> It is allergy season in Austin, and it made going outside miserable.  </li>
            <li> IF you use this product YOUR MOUTH WILL TASTE SALTY and you will have an embarrisingly disgusting white residue on your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> AND PROBABLY NOT THOROUGLY TESTED, I recommend not using this awful product unless you want a SALTY MOUTH, and an ABUNDANCE OF SODIUM RESIDUE IN THE FORM OF WHITE GOO</li>
            <li> then starting getting this disgusting&#x27;SLIME&#x27; in my mouth, and my tongue looked like it was growing cotton!</li>
            <li> Something is wrong with this product, in my view.  </li>
            <li> I started using this product 2 days ago and each day, by the end of the day, I&#x27;ve had a gross taste in my mouth and terrible breath - never had this before.</li>
            <li> have a terrible taste in mouth, a stained tongue that looks like cha-cha dancers have done a once over in the middle of the night... &lt;</li>
            <li> About two hours later, my mouth was peeling and tasted nasty.  </li>
            <li> This is unpleasant and, needless to say, disconcerting.  </li>
            <li> Let me tell you, when you wake up in the morning and you feel nasty, slimy ropes of skin all over your mouth, you get a little worried!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I keep saying to myself, \\&quot;It can&#x27;t be dangerous if it&#x27;s made by Pfizer</li>
            <li> The worst pain is on the bottom of my cheeks and under my tongue, and everything feels raw.</li>
            <li> for the faint of heart!</li>
            <li> after I stopped using it and the effects are receding slowly, however, up until yesterday, I still had that awful taste in my mouth</li>
            <li> I hope they do something about their horrible product or at least put a warning on the bottle.</li>
            <li> all you want is a smidget of whitening and some very unsettling mouth peeling...go for this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was horribly mistaken (not to mention so horrified I forced myself to call the doctor--</li>
            <li> For every bad review on here, there are probably a lot of people who have had no problems.  </li>
            <li> It was so bad one night that I wretched.</li>
            <li> My mouth is peeling... badly.</li>
            <li> be on the market if it was that bad</li>
            <li> Perhaps that is why I dont have the bad taste sensations as the rest.</li>
            <li> and I found the taste to be really bad.</li>
            <li> Then, I noticed a bad taste in my mouth and after 5 days, the inability to taste salty things.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t painful, but it was troubling, so I discontinued use.</li>
            <li> I use the prewash, brush, and then the Listerine mouthwash to get rid of the terrible flavor the prewash leaves behind.</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> AND THE STUPID PERSON SAID SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS BEFORE.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to say that that sounds stupid, but...</li>
            <li> I thought that it was just me, but now have realized that it&#x27;s the stupid Listerine Whitening.  </li>
            <li> I KNOW how to read directions, I am not an idiot.</li>
            <li> It will make your breath smell like crap and it tastes like crap.  </li>
            <li> Do NOT gargle with it or you&#x27;ll experience a very unpleasant aftertaste.  </li>
            <li> I am shocked!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
            <li> WRONG!!!  </li>
            <li> I sent Listerine a message about how awful it was sent them a link to the Amazon reviews.</li>
            <li> &quot;  I&#x27;ve discontinued using the rinse; hopefully, the nasty color will disappear soon.  </li>
            <li> This product caused me horrible side-effects.     </li>
            <li> This nasty string was just hanging there!!!</li>
            <li> I cried, I felt so disgusting.</li>
            <li> A TERRIBLE BOTHER AND NEVER USE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> But to all of you out there thinking of using this product be forewarned, it causes horrible side effects!</li>
            <li> DISGUSTING!  </li>
            <li> Yes - this product has some nasty side effects.  </li>
            <li> the toungue is a nasty thing...</li>
            <li> And as for the film gunk in your mouth...don&#x27;t ask, it&#x27;s nasty and slimy.   </li>
            <li> What an awful product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a week now and the horrible side effects have not subsided.  </li>
            <li> my experience, the worst side effect is the peeling of the inside of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s evil.</li>
            <li> Either way, it&#x27;s disgusting and is the reason why I will not be purchasing this product again.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was that nasty film</li>
            <li> Why did everything taste so nasty?  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I will never use this product again.  Only wish I&#x27;d read reviews before purchasing.  After a couple of uses my lips began to burn and tingle, then itch.  They because VERY chapped and painful.  Thinking it might be caused by something else, I quit using the Listerine Prewash for a couple of days and it cleared up.  I tried using it one more time with even worse results.  I use lip balm regularly and have never had this problem before.  There are other alternatives to whitening that I will stick with.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product, since it had \\&quot;Listerine\\&quot; on the bottle, I automatically thought that it was mouthwash. To my dismay, I came to find out that it acts like bleach (it deadens everything in your mouth). Also, since I gargled with it, the back of my mouth was affected, especially the back of my tongue which was left with a sour taste up to week after I stopped using it.    When I first started using it, almost like everyone else who comments on it, I noticed that the insides of my lips and cheeks began to peel. My tongue was left with white, stringy pieces of skin (mixed with mucus) on it that left me feeling \\&quot;scared to death\\&quot;. What put my mind at ease was researching on the internet and finding so many people on Amazon reviews who had the same results.    It is now a week or so after I stopped using it and the effects are receding slowly, however, up until yesterday, I still had that awful taste in my mouth (I still have a bit of peeling on the inside of my lips).    This product needs to be taken off of the shelf and the people who received permanent damage need to be compensated. Clearly not enough research was done on this product.</li>
            <li> This product is great, it really does seem to help with regular &lt;br /&gt;use.  And it taste great.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THE LISTERINE WHITENING FOR A COUPLE MONTHS NOW.  I HAVE BEEN NOTICING FOR A WHILE THAT MY SKIN INSIDE MY CHEEKS HAS BEEN FEELING GUMMY AND PEELING.  I ASKED MY DENTIST ABOUT IT AND HE DIDN&#x27;T KNOW WHAT IT WAS.  I THEN DECIDED TO TYPE LISTERINE WHITENING PROBLEMS IN THE KEY WORD ON GOOGLE AND FOUND OUT THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE WITH THIS SAME PROBLEM. I THINK SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE TO PULL THIS PRODUCT FROM THE MARKET.  I AM GOING TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE FDA ABOUT THIS.  WHO KNOWS WHAT THIS PRODUCT IS DOING TO US???</li>
            <li> People this product is a PRE-BRUSH RINSE it is not meant to replace listerine mouth wash. It is strictly for rinsing prior to brushing. It contains Hydrogen Preoxide for whitening not for freshening your breath. If you use just regular household peroxide to gargle you will notice the same effects including the foaming. Don&#x27;t expect it to do more than what it is meant for. I noticed the peeling too but I suspect it comes from the peroxide actually renewing your gums....who knows.</li>
            <li> Am I the only one cynical enough to question the authenticity of the barrage of one-star overwrought reviews?  In any event, I&#x27;ve had no side effects but find the alleged whitening properties somewhat overstated by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really used it long enough to give a true rating.... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also had the peeling gums thing after a few days of using the product, but having had oral sensitivity to other mouth washes, I really attribute it to my own reaction to the rinse.  For every bad review on here, there are probably a lot of people who have had no problems.  It was helpful to know that others have experienced the same thing, but I think I&#x27;ll hold off being totally PO&#x27;ed at Listerine. Hydrogen peroxide is potent stuff.  And having done telephone work, I just want to say that whoever you get on the phone when you call the company would probably face legal implications if they tried to diagnose your mouth problems. They&#x27;re probably just clerical staff.</li>
            <li> I have only used Listerine pre-brush whitening once but the side affects are bad enough to make me never use it again and insist that my boyfriend, who had no side affects, throw it away immediately.  I used this product on Monday night before I went to bed. My boyfriend uses it pretty often with no problems. I have used other whitening products and the only side affect I&#x27;ve had was sensitive teeth, which went away after a few hours so I expected something. I woke up Monday morning with the normal morning breath but my tongue was burnt on the tip and sides. I thought maybe I burnt it on something that I ate the night before. Throughout the day I noticed that my mouth tasted funny, kind of sour... I guess you could call it disguesia, that metal taste you get, and I couldn&#x27;t taste anything very well.  I still have the sour taste and my tongue still feels burnt. It&#x27;s now Thursday and I haven&#x27;t used the product since Monday night.  I sent Listerine a message about how awful it was sent them a link to the Amazon reviews. I hope they do something about their horrible product or at least put a warning on the bottle.</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just using this product twice a day for three days my gums became inflamed and very sensitive. After two days not using the product my gums feel better but still not back to normal. My teeth do appear brighter however the side effect is not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Swollen lips, blisters on inside of lips, sore tongue, after using for one week. After stopping use, the blister inside my upper lip seems to be spreading some.  My lips are swollen. I had a similar lip swelling reaction when I have used plain hydrogen peroxide on a cotton swab to clean a place on my inside jaw where I had bitten it. I didn&#x27;t get the blisters, but my bottom lips was very swollen. If you have a sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, I would not use this product. This product also made my whole mouth hurt, my tongue felt generally sore.</li>
            <li> I have been using Listerine Whitening for maybe a few weeks now and I have seen a great difference in the color of my teeth. Also, there is no \\&quot;application process\\&quot; which makes the whitening process troublesome. I&#x27;ve even tried many other whitening products such as Crest Whitening strips, Colgate Simply White Whitening Gel, and many others. But none of them have really worked on my teeth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Listerine Whitening has been great although I have had some problems with it. On the second day I had been using it, my taste \\&quot;buds\\&quot; had been numbed. And the whole day my tounge was stinging and I could not taste anything until I had swallowed it (I&#x27;m guessing cause the back of my tounge was fine). But after a while it died away but I&#x27;m sure it was probably just a first reaction to the product. Currently however, I have been waking up to loads of dead skin cells, or if not... some icky white and gooey stuff, in my mouth. At first sight, it does look like a \\&quot;film\\&quot; over my teeth but I think it had just fallen down to the bottom recesses of my mouth that way. So every morning I get the same thing and have to clean it out. Yet I do indeed use it only 2 times a day, before I brush, and then I brush afterwards but again, it may be just a skin reaction. I am wondering if I should stop using the product because of this or not... but I haven&#x27;t since because of a few statements that my skin will reproduce quickly so it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But to anyone who does not have a sensitive skin, I do recommend this product as an easy and cheap way to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> This is one of my rare reviews simply because I don&#x27;t like bragging about stuff that drain our pocket money for little or no use. My humble experience with this Listerine whitening is a great experience! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Here how I used it: &lt;br /&gt;1. followed the bottle instruction by using it BEFORE brushing and for a whole 1 MINUTE. &lt;br /&gt;2. Before I brush with my regular toothpaste I always brushed for 30sec with the foam that is left in my mouth. &lt;br /&gt;3. Washed my mouth thouroughly (since preoxide and other whitnening stuff are no good for gum) then &lt;br /&gt;4. Used the Arm and Hammer whitening toothpaste; simply because I love the clean feeling and mouth odor of this toothpaste. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Man, this stuff really works. My wife was reluctant to use it untill she saw the much whiter and cleaner teeth I have now. I really mean it. I am shocked! especially that I had no beleif in this stuff. &lt;br /&gt;Now, I have no idea how long this is gonna last after I stop the product since I am NOT willing to pay for it all my life. I have not finished the bottle yet; 1/4 left. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am not sying that it is or going to be close to what dentisit do. Not even what the crest strips acheive. But it is much easier to use then the strips which I really hate (speak about that gelly stuff on it and the feeling of the strip in my mouth). &lt;br /&gt;Simply put, it is very easy to use and does whiten the teeth in no time or effort. &lt;br /&gt;This review is only for average lazy people who don&#x27;t like to spend lot of money or time to get a whiter teeth and don&#x27;t really care about modeling on TV to show their teeth!</li>
            <li> I bought the Listerine Whitening on an impulse buy, and used it for two days and two nights, following the instructions exactly. I noticed a little sensitivity in my bottom teeth the first day but I did not think anything about it, and some slimy stuff in my mouth that I did not find until later that afternoon. Then the second day it felt like I had burned my tongue on hot chocolate. It is now 24 hours after I used it the last time and my tongue is still not back to normal. I came on here and read what people had thought about it, they shared the slimy stuff in their mouth (turned out to be skin) and the experiences about sensitivity and burning the tongue. To me it does not seem like a very safe product with this current formula. However, it works! I saw results immediately, and I wish I could keep using it as directed. I think I will just put it on my toothbrush and keep it away from the rest of my mouth as much as possible, then brush normally. I&#x27;m very disappointed, I almost wish it didn&#x27;t work, because I still want to use it.</li>
            <li> Less than 2 weeks ago, I purchase a bottle of Listerine Whitening Rinse. I began gargling with it, as directed, once a day. The other morning, after rinsing with it and then brushing, I noticed that the inside of my mouth was peeling (the same sensation that comes from drinking something too hot and burning the inside of one&#x27;s mouth). Since I had not consumed any hot beverages or food, I was a bit perplexed and obviously concerned. The next day, I was in a rush and did not rinse with Listerine Whitening....and the inside of my mouth was not peeling. Today, I rinsed with LW again, and sure enough, my mouth is peeling again. I did a \\&quot;Google\\&quot; search today that included \\&quot;mouth &amp; peeling\\&quot;. The 6th site that came up on the list was \\&quot;Amazon.com\\&quot; where consumers were rating Listerine Whitening Rinse. Apparently, numerous consumers are having the exact same side effect resulting from the use of your product! Some have even reported more serious side effects from both short and long term use, including \\&quot;Hairy Tongue\\&quot; , Thrush, desensitized taste buds and suddenly overly sensitive teeth! Of the 32 consumer ratings, over 20 (63%)reported one or more of the above side effects! These are NOT minor side effects and I cannot believe this product is even on the market! Who knows what long term use would do to your mouth! At a minimum, there should be a warning label on the bottle listing possible (rather probable) side effects. I didn&#x27;t attribute it to the Listerine at first----and thought I may have mouth Cancer or some other diesease!!!! At a minimum, I was very close to paying the high cost of a doctor visit and lost work wages to have it checked out....and still may to see if there is any potential that your product may have caused long term damage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Shortly after I started using this stuff regularly I noticed something growing on the back of my tongue. I went to the doctor and he said I had developed a thing called hairy tongue. It&#x27;s not a cancer or even harmful but it looks and feels yuk. I have also developed a constant sour taste in my mouth. And my teeth are not whiter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am now using normal mouthwash and trying to get everything back to normal. I am very worried that the sour taste will not go away. I don&#x27;t normally bother with reviews but I would like people to know about this. I obviously do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After following the manufacturer&#x27;s directions ASSIDUOUSLY four times (morning and evening for two consecutive days), I felt those strings of skin hanging from my pallet that are usually associated with the burns one gets from too-hot pizza (\\&quot;Is that cheese, or is that me?\\&quot;). I tried once more and discovered that the inside of my mouth was actually PEELING. This product should be taken off the market.</li>
            <li> I began using Listerine Whitening two weeks ago.  I noticed my teeth are actually whiter, but I also started noticing I stange changes.  I became oversensitive to regular odors, my food started to taste funny.  It was so bad one night that I wretched. I was so scared of what I was experiencing that I was unable to sleep.  I figured out today with the help of Amazon that LW emphasized every regular odors and more so allergies. It is allergy season in Austin, and it made going outside miserable.  This morning I woke up and have a hairy tongue.  I have seen that some people don&#x27;t get any side effects, maybe there was not enough studies and obviously more people are sensitive than others.  I am so dissapointed in Listerine that they would go ahead and put this product on the market with known the side effects.  I for one will do my part to bring attention to these problems.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I&#x27;d noticed all the extra gunk in my mouth too--but had no idea why, and just supposed it was something I was eating that kept irritating my mouth. It wasn&#x27;t until I noticed the nice black stain and \\&quot;hairy\\&quot; appearance at the back of my tongue that I really knew I needed to investigate further. At first, I thought it must&#x27;ve been something in the Chinese food I had last night!! But after reading all this, I guess I know what I need to do now...at least I&#x27;ll be saving money when I don&#x27;t have to buy this stuff anymore (and my teeth never really got any whiter either!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product a total of four times, but that is all it has taken to know I will stop using it. I agree with the person who said that for every complaint, there are plenty of people who have no side effects. I guess these reviews are for people who HAVE had side effects and just want to verify what the cause may be.    I began use on a Sunday morning, Sunday night and Monday morning. I noticed that my breakfast a couple of hours later lacked any flavor, as did any other food/drink I had. I immediately considered it being a side effect of the rinse as I still had the flavor of it on my tongue after 5 hours of talking, eating, and drinking.     I did use it Monday night, hoping that if I avoided it during the day, maybe it would not affect my taste. However, Tuesday morning (today), I had some of the peeling of the gums or whatever that other folks have mentioned. And my taste is returning slowly.    In all honesty, I saw a difference in the color of my teeth after the first use, but just be aware that these are very common side effects and you&#x27;ll have to determine if they are worth the degree of whitening you are receiving.    Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> This product is working for me, and it&#x27;s working very well. I&#x27;m a coffee drinker in my late 40s.  I&#x27;ve been using this Listerine product for a couple of months. I rinse with it just once daily, each morning, after drinking coffee and prior to brushing.     For me, the key to avoiding any kind of film residue on my teeth is to rinse thoroughly after brushing. This sounds obvious, but trust me, I rinse about four or five times. My wife, who does not use the product, rinses about half as much.    I can attest to the whitening power of this product, though it may not be as effective with all users. Admittedly, I don&#x27;t have the preternaturally gleaming teeth we see on TV these days, but my smile has grown considerably brighter since using this pre-brush rinse. It&#x27;s made a difference for me, and I&#x27;ll keep using it.    (By the way, I had tried a cheaper store brand pre-brush rinse twice daily prior to using Listerine, and though it whitened my teeth, it also began to eat away at the skin inside my lower lip. It wasn&#x27;t painful, but it was troubling, so I discontinued use. Based on this experience, I opted to use the Listerine product only once daily, and immediately after my morning coffee. This has seemed to work well, and I&#x27;ve experienced no downsides with the Listerine rise.)</li>
            <li> I bought this about a month ago and have been using it every day . It works great !! my teeth are whiter and it  tastes great . &lt;br /&gt;But now my teeth are so sore and sensitive and cant stand it any more . so far i have talked with 7 other people and they say the same thing . Does anyone else have thos problem ? I had to buy sensidyne , im hoping it works or off to the dentist i  go .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it whitened my teeth 2 shadows! It really worked for me and It is alot easier to use than ANY other whiting product! Buy a small bottle first and than buy a big bottle if it work&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li> ***update.  I originally gave this a pretty good review (with reservations) but now  I will discontinue using this immediately.  I woke up this morning and would say about a fourth of the tastebuds on one area of my tongue have been burned off and the inside of my cheek is burning.!  Since the beginning I have experienced a slight reduction in taste after using the product, but I just considered it an inconvenience and never imagined I was killing off my taste buds completely!!    I didn&#x27;t use it after breakfast today or after dinner this evening and already the pain is subsiding.      I guess maybe every mouth is different and others reactions may be different, but I can no longer recommend this even though it has helped whiten my teeth.  the &#x27;complications&#x27; aren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Anyone who is contemplating the use of this product needs to be aware that one of its possible side affects is discoloration of the tongue.  I used this product for two weeks.  I noticed the discoloration one morning after rinsing with the product.  It looked as though I had been eating black licorice or drinking heavy duty espresso.  According to an article on the Mayo Clinic web site, \\&quot;regular use of mouthwashes containing oxidizing agents such as peroxide may cause tongue discoloration.\\&quot;  I&#x27;ve discontinued using the rinse; hopefully, the nasty color will disappear soon.  It would have been nice if the Listerine folks had put a warning about this possible side affect on their labeling.</li>
            <li> In response to one of the glowing reviews: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I follow the directions on the bottle.  I use this as a pre-brush rinse.  Rinse for 1 minute and brush for 2 minutes. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it leaves a film on my teeth.  It does, however, cause my gums and my inner mouth to peel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Secondly, this isn&#x27;t regular Listerine.  It doesn&#x27;t even have the same ingredients as Listerine.  You&#x27;ll notice that the bottle doesn&#x27;t say anything about killing the germs that cause plaque and gingivitis.  It basically just freshens your breath (not even for a long time like original Listerine) and whitens (barely).  I was VERY upset about that after I purchased the product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The truth of the matter is you can just add a small cap of peroxide to your original Listerine dose, and you&#x27;ll get the same effect...without the mouth peeling. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t make sense to have to buy this Listerine AND original Listerine to get the job done.  That&#x27;s a serious waste of money. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I guess all this means if you&#x27;re like me, and you care more about the health of your teeth than whitening, you&#x27;ll want to stick to Advanced Protection Listerine and a tartar control baking soda/peroxide toothpaste. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If all you want is a smidget of whitening and some very unsettling mouth peeling...go for this stuff.</li>
            <li> Please know that the reason I gave this product a &#x27;&#x27;1 star&#x27;&#x27; rating is because that is the minimum rating that Amazon allows!  I would personally like to give this product a negative number of stars!!!       Listen up. I KNOW how to read directions, I am not an idiot. I KNOW how to count to 60 and KNOW how long a second is.    This product caused me horrible side-effects.     I followed the directions exactly as printed on the label. I swished this Listerine Whitening Pre-Brush Rinse in my mouth for 60 seconds, counting in my head all the way to 60. I did NOT swish it longer than directed. After spitting it out, I rinsed with water several times until I felt all of this product was out of my mouth. Then I brushed my teeth in a normal way, rinsed with water a few times, then used regular Listerine mouthwash for 30 seconds, followed by two or three more swishes with water. I did this routine once in the morning, and once again at night before bed. This is a total of twice daily.    I noticed after the 2nd time of using this product (which was on the first day of starting this product) that my teeth were slightly whiter! I thought maybe I was imagining it, but they did seem slightly whiter.    Well, the next morning when I did my whole mouth-cleaning routine (as explained above) and I noticed right afterwards that the tip of my tongue felt funny. It was like the taste-buds were hard, right on the tip of my tongue. My tongue also burned just a little bit on the tip, and underneath.  Later on in the day, I kept getting these little white stringy things (which turned out to be the mucous membranes of my mouth peeling).  My teeth looked slightly whiter than the first day though, so I wanted to continue using this product temporarily to achieve a whiter, brighter smile! :D    I used this product one more time on that second day since starting. I used it right before bed. This would make it the FOURTH AND FINAL time I would use this product.    Well, the next day I woke up in the morning and my mouth was much more sensitive (tip of tongue burning more, underside of tongue burning more). I had more of the white stringy things (mucous membrane peeling) coming out and I felt like a string was hanging from my tongue.... I pulled on it slightly, but it would not break loose. I went to the bathroom mirror, and I had a 1/2 inch PINK string (the color of my tongue) with a white ball the size of a small seed hanging from the tip of this &#x27;&#x27;string&#x27;&#x27;. This nasty string was just hanging there!!! On my tongue!!! YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW HORRIFIED THIS MADE ME. I had a freakish growth!!! I cried, I felt so disgusting. I just wanted this thing off my tongue, right now.     I had 3 other smaller &#x27;&#x27;strings&#x27;&#x27; on the underside of my tongue, though they did not have the white ball on the end and were half the size of that super-nasty one. On top of all of this, THE ENTIRE UNDERSIDE OF MY TONGUE looked white and was peeling off starting at the base. You could see the white surface lifting up and flaking away at the base of my tongue on the under-side.    I MADE A DOCTOR APPOINTMENT IMMEDIATELY, AND GOT IN THAT SAME DAY. I was freaking out. Obviously I did not use anymore of this crazy listerine whitening pre-brush rinse [...] in my mouth again.  I was so embarrassed that these growths were in my mouth, and one had a white seed-looking thing on the end.  The peeling was nothing compared to these string-growths.     MY DOCTOR TOLD ME TO NEVER USE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN. He told me that the &#x27;&#x27;string-growths&#x27;&#x27; were CYSTS. He said your tongue is full of glands, and that white seed-looking thing was a swollen gland filled with pus!  MY DOCTOR TOLD ME TO STOP USING THIS PRODUCT and they would go away. I was so scared they would not go away, I wanted these little *&amp;@#&amp;^!# removed from my tongue!!! My doctor assured me that they would go away in less than a month, and warned me that I may have more pop up in the next day or two.     My doctor said the peeling can be normal for some people, it is the mucous membranes peeling. He said that can happen with any whitening product to a person with a sensitive mouth.    (NOTE- ALTHOUGH CREST WHITE-STRIPS WERE UNAFFECTIVE FOR ME, I HAD USED THEM A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO AND NEVER HAD SIDE-EFFECTS, NO PEELING, NOTHING)      Well it has now been almost 2 weeks since I stopped using this product, and my mouth is finally completely back to normal. The white seed-looking gland on the end of that stringy CYST went away the day after not using this product. My mouth improved every single day of not using this product.      THANK YOU LISTERINE FOR GIVING ME CYSTS UNDER MY TONGUE, FREAKING ME OUT, AND MAKING MY MOUTH HURT AND PEEL. I FEEL LIKE I DESERVE SOME KIND OF COMPENSATION FOR THE [...] I ENDURED USING YOUR PRODUCT. I CALLED YOUR PHONE NUMBER AND THE STUPID PERSON SAID SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS BEFORE. WELL LIARS, IT IS OBVIOUS HERE THAT POSSIBLY HALF OF EVERYONE USING THIS PRODUCT ARE HAVING ADVERSE REACTIONS. THIS IS NOT RIGHT.</li>
            <li> Not that I want others to suffer, but i&#x27;m glad i&#x27;m not the only one experiencing problems with this product. Here&#x27;s what happened to me: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I used this product for about a year with NO side effects at all. And I actually had a lot of people compliment me on my white teeth. HOWEVER, I stopped using it for about six months because I ran out one day and was just too lazy to buy more. And I tried to convince myself that my teeth were \\&quot;naturally\\&quot; white, but of course, after six months, they started to lose their shine. SO about a week ago, I bought a new bottle, and then the problems began. For me, the main problem is gum peeling, but it also feels like someone scraped my gums with a freshly sharpened scalpel. The worst pain is on the bottom of my cheeks and under my tongue, and everything feels raw. Fortunately no hairy tongue or thrush, but its still painful. And I made the mistake of trying to eat an orange, which I will never again do in this type of circumstance. I&#x27;m stopping today and purchasing some Crest White Strips. Its a shame because, at one time, this product did work well for me.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And P.S., I dont really understand how people on here can say \\&quot;This product does not cause peeling\\&quot; or whatever. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t for you, but it clearly does for others, myself now included.</li>
            <li> I used this product 3 times.  I truly thought I was going to die.  Not only did my mouth start to peel, but ulcers formed everywhere.  I&#x27;ve had 4 kids naturally and the pain was not as bad as how much my mouth hurt.  I didn&#x27;t eat for 6 days.  The only thing this product is good for is weight loss.  My dentist had to prescribe a pain killing rinse, like liquid novacaine.  I can&#x27;t understand how this product is on the market.  I plan to contact the FDA.</li>
            <li> This product uses a number of sodium based compounds that somehow whiten your teeth. They include sodium phosphate, sodium laruyl sulfate, sodium citrate, and sodium saccharin. YES IT WHITENS YOUR TEETH, but there are definite and unforgivable problems with how it does so. For one, there is the big complaint, the nasty white goo on your teeth. This is sodium residue on your teeth. They call it a pre brush rinse because they suppose your toothbrush will remove this residue. BRUSHING DOES NOT REMOVE THE RESIDUE. IF you use this product YOUR MOUTH WILL TASTE SALTY and you will have an embarrisingly disgusting white residue on your teeth and gums. I don&#x27;t care how white my teeth are, this can&#x27;t be good for your body, it&#x27;s almost pure salt. THIS STUFF IS NEW AND PROBABLY NOT THOROUGLY TESTED, I recommend not using this awful product unless you want a SALTY MOUTH, and an ABUNDANCE OF SODIUM RESIDUE IN THE FORM OF WHITE GOO ON YOUR TEETH AND GUMS. PLEASE GOD SAVE YOURSELF A TERRIBLE BOTHER AND NEVER USE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I picked up a bottle last weekend thinking that it would be great for in between bleachings.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As others have stated: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-The taste is rather unpleasant, and it has a sickly sweet aftertaste that coats your mouth.  On more than one occasion it has caused serious gagging. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-The morning after that first day I used it, I noticed when I brushed my teeth a bunch of film that was on my gums.  Upon closer inspection, it was skin.  I started to pannic a little, what happened, do I have a disease, what is causing the skin of my gums to peel off?  Finding the amazon reviews where others apparently have lost skin off their gums has helped assure me, I am not dying. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-Whitening, is it really worth it to use this stuff over a bleach kit? Probably not, with trays and bleaching gels you get the stuff on your teeth where it belongs, and less of it on your gums where it doesn&#x27;t. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am tempted to keep using it because I am eating less, I can&#x27;t taste anything, and I am curious as to how much skin I can lose from my gums.</li>
            <li> The whitening effects of this pre-brush rinse seems almost as effective, if not more effective than a lot of whitening products you have to leave on your teeth for a much longer period of time (more like a minute than 10 seconds). In fact, if you leave this in your mouth a little longer it whitens twice as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love to drink tea or coffee, this helps to maintain the whiteness of your teeth on a daily basis. The ingredients also seem to help your gums without the burn of too much alcohol, like in the other Listerine products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is slightly \\&quot;foamy\\&quot; from the hydrogen peroxide, so it is useful to use before you brush your teeth or you can use it while in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to rinse this out of your mouth quite well and the use of a tongue scraper is highly recommended after using this whitening rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> I have been using as directed, and have found noticeable results after two weeks. I find it to be an effective product, however there are alot of inaccurate statements out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not make your mouth \\&quot;peel\\&quot;. Yes, if you do not brush thoroughly afterwards, you will find some gel-like residue between your teeth - as you would with all the common whitening &#x27;gels&#x27; and &#x27;strips&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT a gargle. This is a pre-brush RINSE. It kills germs, yes, but it should NOT be used to replace your ordinary mouth wash. It is a mild whitening agent, not a breath freshener. It should be treated as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other whitening products, and find this to be the easiest to use. If the &#x27;downfall&#x27; is a little residue that can easily be brushed away.. its fine with me. I use it for whitening and it does the job nicely!</li>
            <li> Listerine should be ashamed that they ever let this product on the market! This morning I woke up and while brushing my teeth noticed that I had large patches of brown on my tongue. Soon my tongue was covered in white hairy looking growth. Thanks to all of you on Amazon who took the time to share your stories. I am not as freaked out now. But to all of you out there thinking of using this product be forewarned, it causes horrible side effects!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for probably around six months and have had no negative side effects whatsoever.  I never knew anyone else did until reading these reviews.  I only use this mouthwash at night instead of twice a day as instructed, although sometimes I do end up using it twice in a day.  I&#x27;ve had only good experiences with this product, which helps my teeth stay white, and plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> After using the product per the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations I have had the lining of my oral mucosa peel off.  My mouth is now sore and taste has been diminished.  I only hope the reaction is temporary.  Obviously not everyone will have this reaction but I would definitely say that even a small chance of having this side effect is not worth any cosmetic benefits.  I will be writing to the FDA and consumer protection agencies.</li>
            <li> As some other users have described, there are side effect to this product. I have used this prodcut many times, each time with the same result. I too did experience the peeling inside my mouth. I was pregnant at the time, so I had my husband try it and he too had slimy sheets of something coming off the sides of his mouth. Honestly, it was weird, but it wasn&#x27;t painful, like some of the other reviewers described. I&#x27;m glad to know it was not just us that had this experience and we will not be using this again. Any product that has effects like this is just not worth it. I recommed the White Trays by  Aquafresh. I have used them a few times and people always say what a white, shiny smile I have.</li>
            <li> DISGUSTING!  I FOUND THESE REVIEWS AFTER I EXPERIENCED THIS AWFUL AND DISGUSTING SO CALLED SIDE EFFECT!  LISTERINE STILL HAS THIS PRODUCT ON THE MARKET!  I SEE THESE REVIEWS AND THERE ARE COMPLAINTS AS FAR BACK AS DECEMBER 2005 - I CALLED PHIZER NOW KNOWN AS JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON AND GOT THE SAME RESULTS AS SOME OF YOU....EVERYONES DIFFERENT....BLAH BLAH BLAH.  I PROCEEDED TO CALL THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AND THE ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE IN MY STATE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS!  PEOPLE NEED TO REPORT THESE PROBLEMS SO THAT IT IS TAKEN OFF THE MARKET!</li>
            <li> I loved this product at first... The foaming action really made my mouth feel so much cleaner, and my teeth did seem whiter...  &lt;br /&gt;I then starting getting this disgusting&#x27;SLIME&#x27; in my mouth, and my tongue looked like it was growing cotton! My throat also burned... I didn&#x27;t relate it to using the Listerine and thought I had &#x27;thrush&#x27; or some other mouth disease! This really scared me and I was going to make a Dr.s appointment! I stopped using the Listerine HOPING that might be the cause... Well- wouldn&#x27;t you know it! My mouth soon returned to normal! I felt sooo relieved! DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT! Your membranes inside your mouth will peel off! It actually makes your mouth DRIP goo! GROSS!!!</li>
            <li> I only rinsed with this listerine whitening product once, about 24 hours ago. The first side effect I noticed was the skin peeling off the inside of my cheeks and gums. That has since subsided, but I also lost my sense of taste and I am still waiting for that to return. It&#x27;s so strange that none of these side effects are mentioned on the bottle. I have to say...this product really has me concerned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never reviewed a product on-line before, but this Listerine Whitening garbage has made me so miserable over the past couple of weeks that I am absolutely compelled to tell you that while some people may not have side effects, I most certainly did. These included: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-\\&quot;felt material\\&quot; tongue feeling &lt;br /&gt;-burning tongue &lt;br /&gt;-inflamed taste buds &lt;br /&gt;-loss of taste sensation &lt;br /&gt;-salty taste in food &lt;br /&gt;-inner-cheek sores &lt;br /&gt;-thick white film on tongue &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I thought I had oral thrush, no joke. A trip to the dentist and he told me to stop using the product immediately, that he had seen other cases of this, and a couple of days later I&#x27;m fine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE! MY TEETH ARE NOT VISIBLY WHITER AND I SPENT 2 WEEKS LOSING MY MIND BECAUSE EVERYTHING TASTED OF SALT -- OR OF NOTHING AT ALL!</li>
            <li> For those that have reported the tongue problem, what did you have to do to remedy the problem and how long did it take? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 1 month and noted the discoloration/hairy tongue this morning.  I am absolutely horrified by this and can&#x27;t get intough with my dentist for several days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a few times before brushing and about 1/2 hour later feel this filmy residue all over the inside of my mouth &amp; gums leaving my mouth feeling dirtier than if I used no mouthwash at all. I agree with the other reviews.  I personally don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use it again for this reason alone!  It&#x27;s not worth it!  The taste isn&#x27;t bad, but if you use it, only use a very small amount because it does foam up a lot!  I&#x27;d recommend looking into another option for whitening teeth, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend using a different mouthwash if you want fresh breath and a fresh, clean feeling in your mouth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for alternatives to whiten my teeth so I wouldn&#x27;t have to put up with the 2 hour laser procedure, and I must say Listerine Whitening really does the trick! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By using this Listerine formula in the morning upon waking up, and before going to bed, I found that my teeth have signficantly whitened over the course of several weeks.  Though the difference is minimal, it is still a noticeable difference, and that is exactly what I&#x27;m looking for in a whitening agent.  It feels great and combined with brushing after the rinse, makes my mouth feel very clean.  I highly recommend finishing off the rinse, brush combo with general Listerine antiseptic to close the deal.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been seeing many complaints about this product, namely that it leaves a &#x27;film&#x27; over the teeth.  I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 3 months, and have NEVER had such a problem.  Many people who I have spoken to that claim to have a film on their teeth afterwards usually also tell me &#x27;I use it AFTER I brush&#x27; or &#x27;I don&#x27;t brush when I use it&#x27;.  The directions clearly tell you that it is a PRE-BRUSH rinse...you have to brush after you use it.  I have never heard of anyone having problems with this product if they follow the plainly simple directions.  It does not sting, and it does NOT leave a film on my teeth, ever.  I have also NOT experienced any increase of tooth sensitivity, as some customers have claimed to have.  If anything, this product makes my teeth feel stronger, aside from being very fresh and clean. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the 2+ months I have used this product, I have been very satisfied.  Listerine has delivered a great product and I plan to continue using Listerine Whitening indefinitely.  If you are looking for an inexpensive alternative to the dental laser procedure, that annoying night plate or any of those other so-called &#x27;miracle&#x27; whitening products, then look no further; Listerine delivers.  Its certainly not going to give you mirror finish on your teeth, butit WILL noticeably brighten your teeth.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff consistently and as directed for for almost four months.  It had absolutely no effect on the whiteness of my teeth.  My teeth aren&#x27;t excessively discolored either; just the normal amount of discoloration that a 26-year-old would have.  Nevertheless, this product did not work for me.  It tastes okay and I&#x27;m sure the peroxide kills germs, but after using it for a long time and not seeing any results, I can&#x27;t recommend it for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> I have an expensive teeth whitening system (molded trays) that I had made for me by my dentist that I rarely use because it requires setting aside 30 minutes where I can&#x27;t be in public or talk on the phone. But when I DO use it, it takes days of application to see a difference. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I tried Listerine Whitening rinse, I saw a difference after the very first time and it only takes 60 seconds!!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical, but this product is more effective than the expensive, customized system. I love the way it makes my teeth feel, too, as if they had just been cleaned at the dentist. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The taste is pleasant, and I&#x27;ve had no side effects although I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night for a week now.</li>
            <li> While this rinse really does help me out with whitening, I too have a problem with the inside of my mouth peeling! I am so glad that I finally read the reviews! Let me tell you, when you wake up in the morning and you feel nasty, slimy ropes of skin all over your mouth, you get a little worried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say, give this rinse a try. But, if your mouth is in the least bit sensitive, be prepaired for this very irritating side effect!</li>
            <li> The product has whitened my teeth. Over time, it has also created a most annoying sensation, like having cotton fabric in my mouth. I won&#x27;t replenish my supply.</li>
            <li> Though this product seems to be whitening my teeth, it&#x27;s also doing a few other things that are a cause for concern and I plan to contact Listerine about them. &lt;br /&gt;1.  If I use the full dose, my tongue goes numb and stays that way for over an hour.  And yes, my sense of taste is also diminished. &lt;br /&gt;2.  The product removes the inner membrane of my lips and cheek.  It sloughs off right after the swishing.  This is unpleasant and, needless to say, disconcerting.  The amount of skin that comes off is in direct relation to the amount of product I use. &lt;br /&gt;3.  The longer I use it (I&#x27;m up to about 5 days and am only using it at night now), the more temperature sensitive my teeth become.  At 5 days, they are mildly sensitive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In an attempt to counteract these side effects, I&#x27;ve cut down to only 1-2 teaspoons of product.  After swishing and expectorating, I use any leftover foam with my regular toothpaste and an electric toothbrush.  Only the very tip of my tongue gets numb this way (though twice I&#x27;ve gotten a little blistery sore there that is gone by the a.m.) and the amount of skin that comes off the inside of my mouth is less (though it still comes off).  Something is wrong with this product, in my view.  Why am I still using it?  I keep saying to myself, \\&quot;It can&#x27;t be dangerous if it&#x27;s made by Pfizer and it&#x27;s on the market.\\&quot;  But maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be so naive!  What I don&#x27;t understand is why these side effects aren&#x27;t mentioned on the bottle.  They must&#x27;ve tested this product; and considering similar comments were made by other users, I get the impression that my experience is not really that unique and it&#x27;s not just my mouth.  I was also starting to think that I had gotten a bottle from a bad batch!  But apparently not.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product, and my mouth has been drastically peeling every day that I&#x27;ve used it.  At first I figured that perhaps I was allergic, but then I \\&quot;googled\\&quot; the situation and found Amazon reviews claiming the same experience.  This must be a side effect that occurs in sensitive mouths.  They really need to give a warning and let us know what to do about it.  Perhaps an \\&quot;if mouth begins to peel...\\&quot; on the back of the bottle.  Otherwise I am forced to stop using it and warn others.  I also have seen no results, but have only been using it for a week.  There is one reviewer who said \\&quot;No, it does not make your mouth peel.\\&quot;  Well, speak for yourself, Dude.  My mouth is peeling... badly.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I&#x27;ve had no side effects, and it has had a whitening effect. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now as an addendum to my pre-wedding daily routine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And it only cost $4 bucks, so drastically less than other whitening products that it&#x27;s worth a shot. I&#x27;m currently doing my first set of crest whitestrips and lemme tell ya-1 minute rinsing is SO MUCH BETTER than 30 minutes with tape on your teeth, lol.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if considering this product and are turned off by the reviews, recall that most people won&#x27;t review a product-especially a daily, household use product-unless they have something bad to say. So a few negative reviews isn&#x27;t really a good survey of the product when hundreds (thousands?) are using it now-and it was probably in a test market for a year before being released nationwide with no ill effects.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Have fun! &lt;br /&gt;W</li>
            <li> I have never written a consumer review before, but I felt it was necessary in this case to warn others of the side effects.  Yes - this product has some nasty side effects.  I&#x27;ve had quite a bit of peeling in my mouth and a burning sensation in the tip of my tongue along with red, raised taste buds (feels sort of like canker sores).  Also - my breath gets worse by the end of the day than before.  This is not my imagination.  I started using this product 2 days ago and each day, by the end of the day, I&#x27;ve had a gross taste in my mouth and terrible breath - never had this before. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And as for the person who said that the peeling may be due to the product renewing the gums -- what????  I don&#x27;t want to say that that sounds stupid, but...</li>
            <li> Experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product with no problem until i cut the bottom of my tongue.  The Listerine Whitening inhibited the healing of the cut and actually made it worse.  Once the cut healed, I started to use the mouth wash again.  I found that if I used for more than the recommended time, then my mouth showed slight but noticable swelling.  To the point - I felt that brightening does occur.  It is nothing extreme, but hey it is a mouthwash (that should be obvious considering our current teeth whitening technology and the price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.Follow the directions and use as Pre-Brush Rinse - not Post-Brush Rinse.  I think maybe many of the irritations that people are feeling are due to leaving this product or residue of this product in the mouth for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.If irritation occurs, but there is a great desire to still use this product then try to decrease the usage time to less than 60 seconds or less than twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.Do not use if there are any cankersores or cuts in your mouth.  For me it doesn&#x27;t help clean it, it just irritated it.  If the mouthwash is the cause of those sores then perhaps this is not the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.Oh and I read someone say that their lips showed dryness when using.  As soon as I saw that I had peroxide on my lips when using I rinsed it off.  So if you see white bubbles on your lips during use then rinse it off - you can do this with the mouthwash still in your mouth. If there are still problems then try chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I docked a star because I don&#x27;t feel the warning or directions emphasise the strength of this product or the side effects that could be dealt with enough- making many unhappy users.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product 4 times in the last 3 days.  My gums first started to die and peel away ONE HOUR after I first used the product.  I didn&#x27;t know what it was, so I used it a few more times, each time thinking, \\&quot;Surely this product woudln&#x27;t be on the market if it was that bad...\\&quot;  This morning, sheets...SHEETS of my gums peeled off!  Gross, white, slimy, dead mucous membranes all over my mouth.  To make things worse, my taste is nearly gone and my allergies have been killing me! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;DO &lt;br /&gt;NOT &lt;br /&gt;BUY &lt;br /&gt;THIS &lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product about four times. After the first time, I felt a the slightest hint of a sting in my right inner cheek. I was pretty sure that the mouthwash was causing it, but I didn&#x27;t think it would be a big deal. However, the swelling got worse after each day (I used this mouthwash every night and once in the morning). Right now, my right cheek is swollen to the point that it just barely doesn&#x27;t push against my teeth. Moreover, my inner lips have began peeling, although not as badly as I&#x27;ve read in many other reviews. The swelling is what alarmed me enough to search online for more info about this product.  I am shocked that this many people have been experiencing side effects much worse than mine in less than a WEEK&#x27;s usage of this product. I can&#x27;t help but notice that Listerne seems to emphasize \\&quot;safely\\&quot; more for this product than any of their other products.  This infuriates me.</li>
            <li> I started noticing the difference within the first few days of using this product, but I started noticing that my teeth were more sensitive and felt weaker. My teeth weren&#x27;t in great condition to start with, but within two weeks of using this product cracks in my teeth had got a lot worse, and two of them broke completely when I was eating cereal one morning! Thanks a bunch listerine, i&#x27;m now looking at thousands of dollars to get everything fixed! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t taste food on the tip of my tongue anymore! We all want white teeth but this is too much.  Looks like many others agree.</li>
            <li> This stuff literally made me grow hair on my tongue. It should be banned. No joke. I&#x27;ve always had a nice mouth and now... there&#x27;s freakin black hair on my tongue. Some people say &#x27;discoloration&#x27; - thats just the first signs of elongated taste buds - which is hairy tongue. I&#x27;m not going into the scientifics here. It has happened to many people I see around posting on other sights. Sign me up for a class action law suit.</li>
            <li> I, along with what seems like many others, have experienced weird side effects from this product. Gross discoloration at the back of my tongue, the so called \\&quot;black tongue\\&quot; appeared after about 2 weeks of use. I just hope it goes away.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks, and the following is true: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1) My tongue is not white &lt;br /&gt;2) My tongue is not black &lt;br /&gt;3) My tastebuds are not gone &lt;br /&gt;4) My mouth is not peeling &lt;br /&gt;5) My mouth has no slime &lt;br /&gt;6) My teeth are not sensitive &lt;br /&gt;7) My mouth does not have open sores &lt;br /&gt;8) My throat does not burn &lt;br /&gt;9) My tongue tip is not sore &lt;br /&gt;9) MY TEETH ARE WHITER THAN THEY HAVE BEEN IN 25 YEARS!!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I respect the other reviews, but this is the best product I have ever used. I have never smoked or drank tea or coffee. My teeth have yellowed from age (I am 52) and I am THRILLED with this product.</li>
            <li> Before I read some of your reviews I thought I was going nuts.  Everything has started tasting bland.  I thought that it was just me, but now have realized that it&#x27;s the stupid Listerine Whitening.  It is now whitening my sink drains.</li>
            <li> I dont usually do this sort of thing but after reading the other reviews I decided I should speak up. I came here while trying to find how others&#x27; results were working out. I seem to be having success and wanted to see how long it would take to get completely white teeth. I know that the active ingredient in this mouthwash is hydrogen peroxide, the same stuff you buy in the pharmacy to clean/sterilize wounds. It seems some people are very sensitive to this and it makes sense, not everyone will have a neutral or positive reaction as hydrogen perixide tends to make things feel \\&quot;dry\\&quot;. I think perhaps part of the problem for some folks might be the length of time they swish. If you are sensitve to the side effects, swish for less time. Also try brushing your tongue beforehand to get the germs off - the toungue is a nasty thing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As for me, my results are postive. I have been using this stuff for about 1 month. My front teeth were ok to start, not horrible, I just drink one cup of coffee a day and then I have water most of the time. My side/rear teeth were more yellow. I am 40 and I guess this just happens with age. So now my teeth all seem to be about the same color, and a little whiter. For the money, it seems like a great deal as we all need to rinse with wash anyway to prevent bad breath. This wash only kills germs for bad breath so I use the Vanilla Mint regular wash that kills germs that cause gingivitis which seems to run in my family. I use it after the whitening variety. Perhaps that is why I dont have the bad taste sensations as the rest. Anyway, I hope this helps, for $7 bucks it is far cheaper that the other alternatives and worth a try. Good luck.</li>
            <li> After using Listerine Whitening Pre-Brush Rinse, I would awaken the next morning with some stringy, ropey goo in the bottom of my mouth and alongside the lower margins of my teeth.  Was it the dreaded stains coming off my teeth??  NOPE.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I contacted customer service at Listerine (Pfizer) and got a smarmy runaround. \\&quot;We are not your doctor or dentist if you want to know what it is, you need to contact them\\&quot;...... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I contacted my dentist who advised that this was sloughing cells from the lining of my mouth,  and that this was a common allergic/ sensitivity reaction to chemicals in mouth care products.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He suggested that stopping using Listerine Whitening Pre-Brush Rinse would be the right thing to do. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One star to the product,  and ZERO stars to Listerine/Pfizer for not having the guts to tell me that this was not normal and was cells sloughing off the inside of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I read with dismay the bleeding heart problems with one of the best products for cleaning and whitening of your teeth.  I read of &amp;#34;stringy things&amp;#34; and of numbness and taste buds burned.....never had one of these with this product. Now I will admit the stringy things are the same thing that our biology prof had us fetch from our mouth in biology lab and view under the microscope.  Amazing...it&#x27;s human skin and you can see the cells, that&#x27;s all nothing quite as &amp;#34;mysterious&amp;#34; as one would have your believe.  The weenies have caused Listerene to pull it from US shelves for fear of this litigious society.&lt;br /&gt;Go to Mexico, it&#x27;s about $3 a bottle and is the same great stuff. Sorry if you are too far away to make it to Mexico, you will pay the &amp;#34;bootleg&amp;#34; price you see on the internet of up to $17 a bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that anyone agrees with the concept of fluoride presenting as a neurotoxin, but after my first two applications, I&#x27;ve had disturbing neurological side effects that can only be a result of the chemical make up of this product. First off - My diet consists of whole foods that are unprocessed and anti-inflammatory due to food sensitivities - I typically stay away from sugarfree gum because of adverse reactions to sucralose and aspartame.  After using this product which contains not only sodium fluoride but also, sodium saccharin, sucralose, phosphoric acid, etc, I had immediate burning of my lips and tongue, impaired balance, coordination and dizzy spells. I also had trouble catching my breath. I&#x27;ve just poured the entire bottle down the drain and have discarded it to never be used or recommended again. It&#x27;s scary that there is no approval from the FDA on the oral nature of this product though it is not technically a food, it does enter our system in the same method.</li>
            <li> After using Listerine Whitening flouride rinse as directed for 2 months, as a healthy not immunosuppressed athletic person, I got thrush in my mouth. Never had thrush before. The slight whitening this product might have produced is certainly not worth the discomfort, medical visit, and anti-fungal treatment. I strongly advise not using this product even in smaller amounts than instructed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wondered when they&#x27;d release a whitening mouthwash (or at least, close to it). They have whitening with toothpaste, gum, and even a toothbrush. But no mouthwash. When I saw this in the store, I had to get it. Well I used it and I found the taste to be really bad. It has a chemical flavor that doesn&#x27;t taste like the \\&quot;clean mint\\&quot; as they say. And it isn&#x27;t all too appealing when I have to use it everyday. So I seriously doubt that I&#x27;ll use it again after I finish my bottle.     I need to remind people here that this is NOT a regular mouthwash! It&#x27;s a prewash that is made to work *before* your brushing. I use the prewash, brush, and then the Listerine mouthwash to get rid of the terrible flavor the prewash leaves behind. Thank goodness I&#x27;m done with it! And as for the film gunk in your mouth...don&#x27;t ask, it&#x27;s nasty and slimy.   As for the sore teeth and gums? I had no such problem at all. The pre-wash NEVER gave me a problem when it comes to being sore. But after all of that, I think this stuff is great and it has lots of potential. But as for most of brand new products, it always has the bugs where it needs work on.     As for the whitening, I have found that it works pretty well. After swishing it in my mouth for about a minute, it starts foaming and I can actually FEEL it working on my teeth...even between them. After the swishing, I&#x27;ve also discovered that while I&#x27;m brushing, it foams up as well making the stuff work all the better. So no complaints on this topic. I just wish that they could have done better with the taste.</li>
            <li> Most mouthwashes make me nauseous and so I ususally avoid them. I decided to give this one a try because of the whitening aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my suprise it was quite pleasant tasting (as moutwashes go) and had a gentle tingling sensation. Be careful not to put too much in your mouth because it foams quite a bit and can become too much to swish around in your mouth. The whitening really does work. My teeth are very bright and my gums are just as healthy as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this to anyone who hates mouthwash. You may be pleasantly suprised.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 6 months now.  I have noticed that in the last 3 months  the skin inside my mouth is peeling, and my lips dry and cracking.  I use this product as a pre-brush rinse (before brushing).  This is a major problem.  I called Pfizer and they said everyone has their own sensitivity with the product as with any other over-the-counter product.  THEY SHOULD LABEL THIS ON THE BOTTLE!  There has been several complaints about this product, I recommend that you be careful when using this product, or even better yet, DO NOT USE IT!</li>
            <li> What an awful product.  I can&#x27;t really speak for how this product whitens because I don&#x27;t plan on using this long enough to find out!  I&#x27;ve used this product for over a week now and the horrible side effects have not subsided.  Having read all of the other reviews, I am now afraid of what else may happen to my mouth if I continue to use this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In my experience, the worst side effect is the peeling of the inside of my mouth.  At first I didn&#x27;t know what was going on as clumps of skin started to form within my mouth (yes, gross I know--but the truth must be told!) As I ran my tongue through the inside of my mouth a thick film of skin came off and continues to do so every time I use this product.  I know this product is not meant to be ingested, and I don&#x27;t purposefully ingest it.  However, I wonder what any of the product that accidentally gets into my system is going to do to me.  If this product is killing the outer layer of skin in my mouth (inside of cheeks), I would hate to see what this could potentially do to the tastebuds on my tongue as well! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Does this whiten?  I don&#x27;t know!  I have only used this product for a week--probably not long enough for this to whiten, but certainly long enough for me to figure out that this product is not safe!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 2 months, it did somewhat whiten my teeth and I had no side effects. I stopped using it only because I did not deem it necessary to continue to buy it as I was using a trial that came free on my Listerine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hairy tongue and all other side effects people have mentioned can be caused by regular use of mouthwashes containing oxidizing agents, such as peroxide, or astringent agents, such as witch hazel or menthol. Its an allergic reaction, don&#x27;t blame the product.</li>
            <li> Unlike one of the other reviewers, I don&#x27;t find the taste particularly unplesant- it certainly beats the nasty Zinc aftertaste of the Tarter Control Listerine- and you can definitely feel the foaming action work. My biggest bones to pick with the product are that it doesn&#x27;t freshen your breath nearly as well as regular Listerine, and it leaves this weird, scummy residue in your mouth. The first time I used it, I was on my way to work when I had this odd sensation in my mouth, like I had a surplus of phlegm in between my cheeks and gumline. Not feeling particularly phlemgy, this was weird, and I felt around and my finger came away with a weird, sticky looking pearly white residue. It really was foul-looking. I didn&#x27;t put one and one together &#x27;til about two days later, where time made me skip the wash- and no residue. If you aren&#x27;t bothered by a feeling of something in your mouth that shouldn&#x27;t be there, perhaps this product is for you. If you are, well, stay away from this stuff- it&#x27;s evil.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about a month every day, twice a day.  My teeth have experienced a small amount of whitening but relatively unnoticeable.  To anyone wondering: This is NOT mouthwash!  It will make your breath smell like crap and it tastes like crap.  Do NOT gargle with it or you&#x27;ll experience a very unpleasant aftertaste.  It made my gums and teeth hurt.  But worst of all, it left a strange, white, filmy residue in my mouth which I would only discover later in the day where I would find myself making embarassing movements with my tongue in an attempt to dislodge the substance from my gums.  I suspect it&#x27;s leftover peroxide build up or something of that nature.  Either way, it&#x27;s disgusting and is the reason why I will not be purchasing this product again.  If you do insist on using this product, I recommend continuing to use your mouthwash, perhaps after you brush.  But I do not recommend this product.  There are much easier and more effective ways to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> I tried this product yesterday, and I can say a few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It immediately made my teeth seem whiter.  I may be imagining things&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The foaming at the mouth is gross, but it&#x27;s a price I&#x27;m willing to pay for whiter teeth without abrasion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Yes, it does make a slimy film in your mouth, but that&#x27;s not sodium buildup.  It&#x27;s the inside of your mouth  burning off, a very fine layer of mucose membrane.  Like the stuff that comes off your hard palate when you burn your mouth with a slice of pizza.  I suppose it&#x27;s from the chemicals they use for whitening the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. My tastebuds felt burnt and desensitized for about an hour after using it.  If you wish to use it in the morning, it is probably best to do it after you&#x27;ve eaten breakfast, because otherwise, you won&#x27;t be tasting much of your morning meal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. My teeth feel incredibly clean after using it--followed up with brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to continue using it until I finish the bottle, and then I will either write anohter review, or update this one.  In the meantime, it gets three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The burning and desensitizing of the taste buds has proved to be more than I am willing to take.  It is truly an offense when, 3 hours later, I still couldn&#x27;t taste much, at an Indian buffet, no less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a teeth whitener, it might work.  As a daily usage product, it is not for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the pre-brush rinse for the past few weeks.  I thought I was halucinating the first day but then I was certain that I noticed a difference within the first week. It honestly whitens your teeth a few shades but it doesn&#x27;t give you a \\&quot;white as the driven snow\\&quot; smile. I can honestly say that I would continue to use this product - I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the white filmy, take-the-skin-off-your-mouth, black tongue side effects ther other reviewers have mentioned. I&#x27;ve tried other products such as the whitening trays but they did permanent damage to my gums and I now have to put up with 3 overly sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Really, trading slightly whiter teeth for a black tongue is not worth the trouble. &lt;br /&gt;I have a terrible taste in mouth, a stained tongue that looks like cha-cha dancers have done a once over in the middle of the night... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not for the faint of heart!</li>
            <li> I was so impressed at how white my teeth looked after just a few uses, I was going to tell all my friends and relatives about it. Then, I noticed a bad taste in my mouth and after 5 days, the inability to taste salty things. Then, I lost all taste sensation and had a sore tongue. I thought maybe it was a sinus infection coming on, but after looking up on Google and finding others had the same problem when using Listerine Whitening Pre Brush, I found my answer. Too bad, it works, but the side effects are too much to pay.</li>
            <li> I used this product AS DIRECTED 2x a day for four days. I had the same gross peeling mouth experience others have reported here, but that ended after two days. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It has now been more than a week since I discontinued use, and my mouth is permanently salty, no matter how much clear fresh water I drink. (I thought I might be dehydrated, but that turned out not to be the case.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This product should be takenoff the market! I am amazed that it did not need to get ADA approval.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Listerine Whitening Pre-Brush Rinse for a couple of months now, but didn&#x27;t link my symptoms to it.  After all, it&#x27;s watered-down mint-flavored peroxide, right?  WRONG!!!  My gums have been \\&quot;peeling\\&quot; almost like a sun burn (but slimy!) for the past 6 weeks or so.  It started out mild and just occuring in the morning (after using it the previous night), but has gotten really bad and now lasts all day.  And even though I recently went to the dentist and got a clean bill of health, my gums feel raw all the time and the peeling slimy film never goes away.  I knew it wasn&#x27;t thrush because my tongue and the back of my throat aren&#x27;t affected, but I had no clue as to what else it could be.  After reading the other reviews here, I know what the problem is now.  Thank you, to all who posted and helped me realize I don&#x27;t have some exotic disease.  I will no longer use this product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not kidding, the lymph node in the right side of my neck actually swelled up!  I thought this stuff was going to work well.  I was horribly mistaken (not to mention so horrified I forced myself to call the doctor--and I half to be half-dead before I&#x27;ll call a doctor.  This Listerine experience was really that bad.)  When I first used this product, I felt a slight sting on the right side of my mouth.  I ignored it, thinking that it was me, that I had a gum problem or something.  Three days later, before bed, I swished again (this would be only the sixth usage).  About two hours later, my mouth was peeling and tasted nasty.  So, I went to the fridge, drank a glass of water, and ate a tiny piece of chocolate to get rid of the bad taste.  Then boom!  As soon as I swallowed the piece of chocolate, my lymph node swelled up.  It swelled up rapidly, too, in about nine seconds.  Absolute horror.  And I know I&#x27;m not allergic to chocolate!  I called my doc the next day and he said that the chemicals in this particular breed of Listerine probably reacted in a way that (somehow) sparked an inflamatory response in my immune system.  Wow, I never thought Listerine Whitening could cause me to manifest symptoms of someone with the flu or an autoimmune disease.  I stopped using it immediately and after a day or two the swelling went away.  Hmmm, maybe I should use it again once more to see if I go into septic shock or something.  That way, I&#x27;ll be rushed to the hospital and will get to eat yummy hospital food!  Just don&#x27;t use this stuff.  If your teeth are a little yellow because you smoke (though you shouldn&#x27;t smoke) or are addicted to tea and coffee (like me) then you&#x27;ll have to smile less, or else just stop worrying about something so trivial as a Hollywood smile.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after being a faithful listerine user for decades. I had been looking for an alternative to the high cost of whitening in a dental office. from my first time using this product i have experienced the peeling of the mouth so many of you are explaining. i have followed the directions to the letter, tried using it with several different toothpastes and get the same results. it feels like blowing a bubble gum bubble but with your own mucus membrane...which is gross if you ask me. I even once blamed my coffee creamer, throwing away a whole quart of 1/2&amp;1/2 somethings just not right with this stuff and if you ask me its time we all step back and ask ourselves just what exactly is going into consumer product today. remember, supply and demand fuels the economy.....if we demand it theyll supply it. is this what we have been demanding???</li>
            <li> A few months ago I used this and when I woke up the inside of my cheek was peeling.  It scared me off the rinse (12 weeks of this? Hell no!) but yesterday I saw this under my sink and couldn&#x27;t remember why I haven&#x27;t been using it. I know right?! How does one forget PEELING MOUTH ACTION! So I used it again and this morning, once again, peeling skin.  I thought it was that nasty film you sometimes get when you&#x27;re sleeping, except part of it was still stuck to my lip.  Because.it.was.SKIN!  Gross.&lt;br /&gt;Reading the reviews on this I don&#x27;t understand why they still sell it with more negatives than positives.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even remember what I paid, but I should have listened to my boyfriend when he said \\&quot;get the no-name, it&#x27;s cheaper\\&quot; :/</li>
            <li> I used the product exactly as directed for 8 days.  My teeth were  whiter, but ***YUCK****!  Why was my tongue developing this bizarre yellow scum?  Why did everything taste so nasty?  Why did it feel like I had hair stuck to the back of my tongue? I stopped using the product and went to the doctor.  I have developed a candida infection (thrush).  Thrush is rare among healthy adults -- it is more common if you have a compromised immune system (I&#x27;ve done my reading since my diagnosis).  I do not have a compromised immune system -- I do not have HIV, do not have cancer, do not have diabetes, do not take steroids and, although I do have an inhaler for asthma, I have not used it in months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I directly connect the development of the thrush to the use of this product. Oh, if ONLY I had read the reviews before buying.  Be smarter than I was, DON&amp;#34;T use this stuff!  I&#x27;m now on a daily regimen of disgusting-tasting medicine, and I will have to keep taking it for 14 days.  :(  BOO!!!</li>
            <li> The insides of my cheeks gradually sloughed off while tasting wine (for work) this morning.  At first I thought that grape skins had actually managed to remain in the sample that I had in my mouth as that&#x27;s exactly what it felt like.  I excused myself to remove what I felt, only to discover moments later that additional membranous residue kept clinging to my teeth.  I&#x27;m an affirmed hypochondriac, and I freaked out surreptitiously (hopefully unbeknownst to my colleagues).  Definitely not a fan of fearing for my life over a poor choice in mouthwash...</li>
            <li> I went to the dentist and they recommended Listerine for a mouth wash so I bought the regular $5 bottle and been using it for a week now and noticed that my tounge would burn and the tip would be very bumpy like it had an allerigic reaction or something. I just got done using the product and looked to see if that was normal and stumbled upon these review and was DISGUSTED. I WILL NOT USE THIS ANYMORE AND I DEMAND A REDUND. I hope I don&#x27;t get the same serious reactions as everyone else.</li>
