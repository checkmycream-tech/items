    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is THE best smelling lip balm I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect balm with the perfect vanilla.</li>
            <li>This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried almost everything.  </li>
            <li>The lime is excellent as well.  </li>
            <li>I prefer oil based rather than waxy ones so for me this was a perfect scent and feel!</li>
            <li>The best part I&#x27;ve found is that it doesn&#x27;t cause my lips to have dryness rebound.</li>
            <li>So I picked this up thinking even if it isn&#x27;t very effective as a lip balm, it would still smell and taste great!</li>
            <li>Great lip balm.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and works great!</li>
            <li>Makes a nice stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li>vanilla smells so good</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>These are wonderful lip balms: satiny texture, all natural, great design, amazing scents.</li>
            <li>: If you want an amazing organic lip balm brand go with Pangea Organics, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li>Nice shape.</li>
            <li>It fits so nicely in my pocket.  </li>
            <li>I now see why it&#x27;s so popular.</li>
            <li>Top it off, vanilla is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Since I placed this order, I have purchased three more tubes from the company.  </li>
            <li>I even love the shape of the tube.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love this lip balm</li>
            <li>Different, but very good!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is overwhelming</li>
            <li>you are still searching for a good lip balm, this one is absolutely worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love vanilla ðŸ˜ƒ in</li>
            <li>My top two favorites are this vanilla and the vata lip</li>
            <li>and I also love the way it feels.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely glad</li>
            <li>What more could you want in a lip balm?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently in love with the almond, vanilla bean, mint, night treatment (moon), and sun protection (sun) balms.</li>
            <li>And there are so many more to try. :)</li>
            <li>Definetly worth the buy !!</li>
            <li>Great scent, very natural feeling.</li>
            <li>The vanilla has a distinct but mild pleasant vanilla taste.</li>
            <li>The vanilla isn&#x27;t over powering, so I still was able to enjoy my morning cup of coffee without balm flavor messing it up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hurraw is also \\&quot;all natural, vegan and raw\\&quot;, and comes in a great variety of flavors.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>I had a good experience with this particular seller.)</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t want to apply it often anyway because of how strong it is.</li>
            <li>That being said, maybe a different kind of this brand would be better but this put me off Hurraw!</li>
            <li>But not that cheap plasticy vanilla.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product, worth every penny, cannot find in any stores</li>
            <li>First, I wanna say that vanilla is probably my all time favorite smell and taste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides another lip balm I discovered and liked, Hurraw is definitely one of the better ones I&#x27;ve tried and one I would purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, how it is not difficult/thick to apply, does not feel sticky or clumpy, and one of the best (and unexpected) things I&#x27;ve noticed about this lip balm is how it actually seems to make my lips look healthier between uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All natural, nicely scented...smells good enough to eat!  </li>
            <li>I have it on right now, and my lips feel comfortable, and supple.</li>
            <li>I like: the natural, ethical aspects of the company (vegan, non-toxic, fair trade ingredients, etc.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s obvious that the company uses only the best ingredients.</li>
            <li>This is the most overpowering lip balm I have tried in years (and I like trying every new brand of lip balm I can find).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure which ingredient is causing that, and even though I looked at the list of ingredients on their web site (forget about being able to read the fine print on the container) there does not seem to be any ingredient that would have that kind of a \\&quot;bite\\&quot; to it.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are natural and no animals participated in testing. :)</li>
            <li>Love the all natural ingredients of this lip balm</li>
            <li>It glides on and is not greasy -- is absorbed by the skin and keeps it feeling moist.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The texture is not bad, but has a slightly greasy feel (\\&quot;satiny\\&quot; as someone put it is a good word to describe it)</li>
            <li>The balm is soft and easy to apply, but not goopy or greasy.</li>
            <li>I feel like it looks pretty on too and its made with almond oil</li>
            <li>Right from the start people started buying it, and we had a whole lot of repeat customers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge vanilla fan, but this one smells so good because it&#x27;s the real stuff.  </li>
            <li>size of the tube and shape make it a bit more fun than other tubes or pots.</li>
            <li>your lips be more dry and chapped than when you started.</li>
            <li>The prices is a little higher than most drug-store lip balms, but I think is worth it, considering the care that goes into making this.</li>
            <li>I heard about Hurraw and Crazy Rumors being two of the best so decided to give Hurraw a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so addicted lol</li>
            <li>I love the other flavors but this is not on my &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; list.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used lip balm from time to time in the past to prevent chapped and cracked lips, but none has been of the outstanding quality of Hurraw!</li>
            <li>Once it has soaked in or been worn off, my lips are still left nicely moist, no flaking dry bits or still chapped feeling.</li>
            <li>This balm does not do that, and I have super sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is as true of the vanilla as it is of the other flavors.</li>
            <li>I prefer it to Burts Bees, and can appreciate that it&#x27;s vegan (which is hard to find), but ultimately I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really have to put it on very often because of the greasiness not absorbing well</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It smells completely like chocolate.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend won&#x27;t even get near me when I put this on because of how overpowering it is.</li>
            <li>it does not remotely smell like vanilla to me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will certainly buy this again and try the other flavors too!</li>

            <li> /&gt;I will certainly buy this again and try the other flavors too!</li>
            <li> likely due to the oils and possibly the candelilla wax used.</li>
            <li> reason I give it four stars instead of five is mainly due to the texture and scent, which are personal preferences.</li>
            <li> Was surprised how small it is.</li>
            <li> That said, it does not seem superficial or like it is simply sitting at the surface even though it is not very thick, but at the same time it is difficult to say how long-lasting it actually is.</li>
            <li> The containter lasts about as long as any other lip balm container.</li>
            <li> but I just learned from their website that it is to prevent it from slipping out of back pockets like their round tubes used to!</li>
            <li> I just ordered this after already having bought some of their other flavors.</li>
            <li> Re-reading other reviews where they say the smell isn&#x27;t to overpowering either</li>
            <li> It is not exactly as sweet or candy-like as some vanilla scents, but it is deeper and a little bit like frosting.</li>
            <li> Tasted a little waxy.</li>
            <li> A recent trip the grocery store found me browsing the lip balm area as my lips were totally dry and chapped and I was unable to locate any of my usual balms I keep in my bag.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how men would feel about using this.</li>
            <li> And although it&#x27;s flavored, the flavor is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> so its not too thick.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I&#x27;m confused.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it&#x27;s a bit waxy and has a weird aftertaste.</li>
            <li> unfortunately for me it was.</li>
            <li> a couple years ago I was a bit skeptical as to how well it would sell.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Was surprised how small it is. Nice shape. Pricey for the size.</li>
            <li> This is THE best smelling lip balm I have ever used. It smells like cake. It moisturizers my lips well and I love it!</li>
            <li> Great lip balm. Wonder flavor and soothing.</li>
            <li> I am a lip balm addict. And I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of balms. Top it off, vanilla is my favorite. But not that cheap plasticy vanilla. This is the perfect balm with the perfect vanilla. Buy stock in this balm, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Since I placed this order, I have purchased three more tubes from the company.  This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried almost everything.  I even love the shape of the tube.  It fits so nicely in my pocket.  The ingredients are natural and no animals participated in testing. :)</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this lip balm but unfortunately it&#x27;s a bit waxy and has a weird aftertaste. I prefer it to Burts Bees, and can appreciate that it&#x27;s vegan (which is hard to find), but ultimately I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> Great scent, very natural feeling. I like it.</li>
            <li> This vanilla is heavenly.  I&#x27;m not a huge vanilla fan, but this one smells so good because it&#x27;s the real stuff.  However, just go to the hurraw balm site.  It&#x27;s cheaper there!  The lime is excellent as well.  Different, but very good!</li>
            <li> Like many others, I have tried lots of lip balms but failed to find a brand I could rely on. I heard about Hurraw and Crazy Rumors being two of the best so decided to give Hurraw a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides another lip balm I discovered and liked, Hurraw is definitely one of the better ones I&#x27;ve tried and one I would purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like: the natural, ethical aspects of the company (vegan, non-toxic, fair trade ingredients, etc.), how it is not difficult/thick to apply, does not feel sticky or clumpy, and one of the best (and unexpected) things I&#x27;ve noticed about this lip balm is how it actually seems to make my lips look healthier between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I give it four stars instead of five is mainly due to the texture and scent, which are personal preferences. The texture is not bad, but has a slightly greasy feel (\\&quot;satiny\\&quot; as someone put it is a good word to describe it) likely due to the oils and possibly the candelilla wax used. That said, it does not seem superficial or like it is simply sitting at the surface even though it is not very thick, but at the same time it is difficult to say how long-lasting it actually is. I have it on right now, and my lips feel comfortable, and supple. I am unsure what I think of the scent. It is not exactly as sweet or candy-like as some vanilla scents, but it is deeper and a little bit like frosting. I don&#x27;t think it is overwhelming but I could see how it might not please everyone. For those wondering, I personally did not notice any taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it is not overly glossy, there is a bit of a sheen so I&#x27;m not sure how men would feel about using this. I also wanted this type of lip balm, with all its benefits, with a touch of color so I&#x27;m looking forward to trying one of their tinted versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape is a bit unusual (oval instead of round) but I just learned from their website that it is to prevent it from slipping out of back pockets like their round tubes used to! It is different but something you can get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are still searching for a good lip balm, this one is absolutely worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Side note: I had a good experience with this particular seller.)</li>
            <li> Definetly worth the buy !! I love vanilla ðŸ˜ƒ in so addicted lol</li>
            <li> Tasted a little waxy. I love the other flavors but this is not on my &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; list.</li>
            <li> Love the all natural ingredients of this lip balm and I&#x27;d hoped the vanilla smell wasn&#x27;t overpowering...unfortunately for me it was.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this after already having bought some of their other flavors. I have this vanilla, the vata lip balm, the pitta (minty) lip balm, the blue vanilla chamomile. My top two favorites are this vanilla and the vata lip balm!&lt;br /&gt;The vanilla smells so good and I also love the way it feels. I feel like it looks pretty on too and its made with almond oil so its not too thick. I prefer oil based rather than waxy ones so for me this was a perfect scent and feel!</li>
            <li> When we started selling Hurraw! lip balm in our shop a couple years ago I was a bit skeptical as to how well it would sell. I was pleasantly surprised. Right from the start people started buying it, and we had a whole lot of repeat customers. So, I decided to try it myself. I now see why it&#x27;s so popular. I&#x27;ve used lip balm from time to time in the past to prevent chapped and cracked lips, but none has been of the outstanding quality of Hurraw! It goes on easy and isn&#x27;t greasy. And although it&#x27;s flavored, the flavor is not overwhelming. This is as true of the vanilla as it is of the other flavors. The vanilla has a distinct but mild pleasant vanilla taste. It is definitely not overpowering. I also like the fact that all Hurraw! lip balms are organic and vegan. It&#x27;s obvious that the company uses only the best ingredients.</li>
            <li> First, I wanna say that vanilla is probably my all time favorite smell and taste. So I picked this up thinking even if it isn&#x27;t very effective as a lip balm, it would still smell and taste great! Yeah... it does not remotely smell like vanilla to me. It smells completely like chocolate. Re-reading other reviews where they say the smell isn&#x27;t to overpowering either and I have to say I&#x27;m confused. This is the most overpowering lip balm I have tried in years (and I like trying every new brand of lip balm I can find). My girlfriend won&#x27;t even get near me when I put this on because of how overpowering it is. I can&#x27;t imagine how the chocolate flavor potency is when the vanilla is this bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about the feel? Well, it feels okay-ish. I would say it&#x27;s too greasy and I don&#x27;t really have to put it on very often because of the greasiness not absorbing well, I don&#x27;t want to apply it often anyway because of how strong it is. That being said, maybe a different kind of this brand would be better but this put me off Hurraw! lip balms permanently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: If you want an amazing organic lip balm brand go with Pangea Organics, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I am a bit of a vanilla lip balm addict. A recent trip the grocery store found me browsing the lip balm area as my lips were totally dry and chapped and I was unable to locate any of my usual balms I keep in my bag. The Hurraw! lip balm package popped out at me. After reading through the ingredients I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m definitely glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of the tube and shape make it a bit more fun than other tubes or pots. The balm is soft and easy to apply, but not goopy or greasy. The vanilla variety does nothing to tint your lips, but I didn&#x27;t want that, I just wanted some moisture and glow. The vanilla isn&#x27;t over powering, so I still was able to enjoy my morning cup of coffee without balm flavor messing it up. The best part I&#x27;ve found is that it doesn&#x27;t cause my lips to have dryness rebound. You know you&#x27;ve had this happen. You apply a balm only to have it wear off and your lips be more dry and chapped than when you started. This balm does not do that, and I have super sensitive dry skin. Once it has soaked in or been worn off, my lips are still left nicely moist, no flaking dry bits or still chapped feeling. I reapply for that glossy look instead of feeling like I have to reapply because my lips need the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will certainly buy this again and try the other flavors too!</li>
            <li> Outstanding product, worth every penny, cannot find in any stores</li>
            <li> All natural, nicely scented...smells good enough to eat!  What more could you want in a lip balm?  Makes a nice stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li> These are wonderful lip balms: satiny texture, all natural, great design, amazing scents. I&#x27;m currently in love with the almond, vanilla bean, mint, night treatment (moon), and sun protection (sun) balms. And there are so many more to try. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which ingredient is causing that, and even though I looked at the list of ingredients on their web site (forget about being able to read the fine print on the container) there does not seem to be any ingredient that would have that kind of a \\&quot;bite\\&quot; to it. So I use Hurraw Vanilla Lip Balm here and there on my face, instead. It glides on and is not greasy -- is absorbed by the skin and keeps it feeling moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hurraw is also \\&quot;all natural, vegan and raw\\&quot;, and comes in a great variety of flavors. The containter lasts about as long as any other lip balm container. The prices is a little higher than most drug-store lip balms, but I think is worth it, considering the care that goes into making this. I look forward to trying the Cherry flavor next.</li>
            <li> Loooooove this lip balm! Smells amazing and works great!</li>
