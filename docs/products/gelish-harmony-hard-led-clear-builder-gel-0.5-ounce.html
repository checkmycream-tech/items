            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>so much more with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;About me: Non-professional with love for gels &amp; nail art.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t received mine yet, but I&#x27;m hoping to get some input:)</li>
            <li>I would appreciate any advice:)</li>
            <li>Love that this is LED because most builder gels are UV.  </li>
            <li>(this is LED light)&lt;br /&gt;Select the dual forms that fit best on your natural nails---make sure they fit from side to side, edge to edge, without overlapping or having a gap.</li>
            <li>(this is LED light)&lt;br /&gt;Select the dual forms that fit best on your natural nails---make sure they fit from side to side, edge to edge, without overlapping or having a gap.</li>
            <li>Looks like a nice product although it be cool if it came with some instructions on how to use it because I don&#x27;t know how to use it</li>
            <li>Easy to use, self leveling, makes me look like a pro...which I am.</li>
            <li>I received it very quick and would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li>Lift easily, break easily, crack easily.  </li>
            <li>I have never had to file these off because they fall off so easily.</li>
            <li>Goes on fairly easy.  </li>
            <li>but it peels up easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to form</li>
            <li>Talk about making your nails strong....</li>
            <li>And the extension is not as strong as an acrylic.</li>
            <li>The Gel is not as strong as I thought.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting with clean nails----use the very fine buffer sponge and lightly buff your nails in a downward motion from cuticle to free edge.</li>
            <li>I do my own nails and have a hard time working with the powders so this builder is a great alternative for those just learning to do their own nails.</li>
            <li>and they are slender and pretty and look like my own nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fine buffer square</li>
            <li>led light that comes with the soak off started kit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy application on clean,  dehydrated</li>
            <li>18G LED LIGHT:</li>
            <li>My instructions are based on my light</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and it lasts forever&lt;</li>
            <li>File to fit if you need to.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>nail at a time, paint a light coating of Builder Gel inside the dual form.</li>
            <li>Place inside your light and cure 5 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Paint another light coating of the builder gel inside the nail.</li>
            <li>Fit the nail to your finger and press gently--don&#x27;t make the gel squish out.</li>
            <li>Place the finger under the light and cure 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Remove</li>

            <li>Place the finger under the light and cure 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Remove</li>
            <li>I got the 18w light and it worked like I thought it should.</li>
            <li>Be prepared though - it does NOT go on as smoothly as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>Works fantastic with my led cuting light.</li>
            <li>I would cure your nail under the LED/UV light asap with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is just as strong as acrylic if applied the right way!</li>
            <li>it is quite nice, sturdy, quick to cure and looks much sleeker than acrylics.</li>
            <li>I applied over tips and it looks fantastic, cured quickly with the LED light I got in my Gelish kit.  </li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s worth every dang penny!</li>
            <li>Thanks! :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to strengthen their own nails or build long beautiful ones.</li>
            <li>I did a full set of gels with this gel</li>
            <li>Hoping it lasts and continues to look this good for several weeks!</li>
            <li>This gel has a thick consistency which is perfect for sculpting your nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty cool!</li>
            <li>Great gel for other people probably.</li>
            <li>Received quickly and well packaged.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Self taught &amp; quick learner.</li>
            <li>The hard gel is perfect to create a toenail which accepts polish and looks great for weeks while my new toenail grows back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and would definitely recommend.  </li>
            <li>What most aren&#x27;t listing that would be helpful to new comers to this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if your trying to keep your real nails long and don&#x27;t want them to break.</li>
            <li>Cured very well under my LED light.  </li>
            <li>finger from light, grab form at end with tabs and gently work it side to side to remove the dual form from the nail.</li>
            <li>finger from light, grab form at end with tabs and gently work it side to side to remove the dual form from the nail.</li>
            <li>Very forgiving unless you bump your nails under the light, then you will have a bump.  </li>
            <li>You do have to do thin layers and cure each layer to get the best effect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased the uber-cheap brands, but this is worth the money when comparing quality.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that it self levels right before your eye&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It just takes time and practice to get it right, and to understand the application abilities of the product.</li>
            <li>However, if u don&#x27;t take all the right steps it will pop off.</li>
            <li>I use the whole gelish system and I&#x27;m very pleased with all products especially this one!</li>
            <li>/&gt;To paint just lightly buff with the sponge, use your foundation and color coats like normal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To paint just lightly buff with the sponge, use your foundation and color coats like normal.</li>
            <li>I used the ph bond only and on first use, many of my gel nails popped right off my nail.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hard gel is great for creating nail extensions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s was pretty tricky the first time I applied it.</li>
            <li>It never fails me and I can always count on whatever I use, working.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Has saved me so much money!</li>
            <li>I love how this cures in only 2minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more viscous than the soak off builder gel (white jar).</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>So your probably be better off with the clear or light pink builder.</li>
            <li>I now have beautiful long nails that take very minimal upkeep.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and it last for a while if you use it correctly.</li>
            <li>Even with extra cure time it tends to peel easily</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how strong my nails are with only one coat.</li>
            <li>Im a huge fan of gelish products and I recently purchased this</li>
            <li>MAKE SURE to get at least and 18 watt  light though.</li>
            <li>in the description it says that the gel cures in 20 seconds with an LED lamp, i had to cure my nail under the lamp for a whole minute.</li>
            <li>Just as described Thanks</li>
            <li>U really can extend your nails with it.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t be sure what results you&#x27;ll have with other lights.</li>
            <li>this point the form should release cleanly from the nail and you are left with a shiny nail.</li>
            <li>this point the form should release cleanly from the nail and you are left with a shiny nail.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve watched Youtube videos of people doing these nails with other lights and their instructions didn&#x27;t work with my light or they used much longer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fine that it is NOT a soak off with acetone product as I plan to use it as a long term overlay to natural nails.  </li>
            <li>It was my first hard gel, not too satisfied</li>
            <li>Would recommend with complimentary Gelish products from the entire line.  </li>
            <li>For the price I shouldn&#x27;t have to buy more every few weeks.</li>
            <li>It has become the new fsd around my cosmo school to use in place of the damaging acrylic.  </li>
            <li>Easy to work with, cured in less than 30 seconds with an LED 8?</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>but I am pleasantly surprised with the quality of the products!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li>I dropped a large can on my toe when it fell out of the cupboard, which caused me to lose my toenail on my big toe.</li>
            <li>: Make sure it&#x27;s the hard builder and not structure&lt;</li>
            <li>I use less for a thin but strong application, which is perfect for maintaining long nails; your nails won&#x27;t bend, crack &amp; break when you accidentally jab it into everyday things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Are there any pointers on the best ways to apply the hard  gel with false tips?</li>
            <li>So this is the clear version</li>
            <li>and it is what it says, clear.</li>
            <li>What they don&#x27;t tell you is, not to apply to your natural nails.</li>
            <li>and it is a complete joke.</li>
            <li>I am applying directly to my natural nail which has allowed me to grow my nails out without them breaking.</li>
            <li>I wasted more than this costs, buying lesser quality lights.</li>
            <li>No more acrylics and easy to apply yourself.</li>
            <li>This is self-leveling which is awesome if you are an amateur and not great at shaping gel or acrylic nails (like me!)</li>
            <li>This product will keep your natural nails hard and strong.</li>
            <li>builder gel allows you to extend your nails or strengthen thin nails - the Clear is the most versatile in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My nails are paper thin right now, and this gel, with just two coats makes them a whole new nail.</li>
            <li>You have to apply it carefully so as not to get a wavy look.  </li>
            <li>totally was old.</li>
            <li>Went back to using wild thunder gel.</li>
            <li>Really strong hard gel - doesn&#x27;t go yellow!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s where I do something I have not seen in any other how to: put the finger back under the light (now minus the dual form) and cure another 20 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Trim</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s where I do something I have not seen in any other how to: put the finger back under the light (now minus the dual form) and cure another 20 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Trim</li>
            <li>I find that this hard gel lifts quickly.</li>
            <li>Not so much creating nail extensions as it is less viscous, so it runs.</li>

            <li> Make sure there are no bubbles under the form.</li>
            <li> Also make sure to use a dehydrator and a bonder.</li>
            <li> It makes it stick better.</li>
            <li> My nails look better than any (harmful) acrylic</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> I love these LED builder gels.</li>
            <li> Since using this product I have been able to grow my nails.</li>
            <li> If you like the Gelish set you will absolutely love the added strength this builder gel imparts.</li>
            <li> of course the Top It Off.</li>
            <li> Use your gel brush and nail form to create stunning nails in no time.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> brill :)</li>
            <li> Love love love this for building nails.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> so much more with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About me: Non-professional with love for gels &amp; nail art.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t received mine yet, but I&#x27;m hoping to get some input:)</li>
            <li> I would appreciate any advice:)</li>
            <li> Love that this is LED because most builder gels are UV.  </li>
            <li> (this is LED light)&lt;br /&gt;Select the dual forms that fit best on your natural nails---make sure they fit from side to side, edge to edge, without overlapping or having a gap.</li>
            <li> (this is LED light)&lt;br /&gt;Select the dual forms that fit best on your natural nails---make sure they fit from side to side, edge to edge, without overlapping or having a gap.</li>
            <li> Looks like a nice product although it be cool if it came with some instructions on how to use it because I don&#x27;t know how to use it</li>
            <li> Easy to use, self leveling, makes me look like a pro...which I am.</li>
            <li> I received it very quick and would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Lift easily, break easily, crack easily.  </li>
            <li> I have never had to file these off because they fall off so easily.</li>
            <li> Goes on fairly easy.  </li>
            <li> but it peels up easily.  </li>
            <li> Easy to form</li>
            <li> Talk about making your nails strong....</li>
            <li> And the extension is not as strong as an acrylic.</li>
            <li> The Gel is not as strong as I thought.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting with clean nails----use the very fine buffer sponge and lightly buff your nails in a downward motion from cuticle to free edge.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails and have a hard time working with the powders so this builder is a great alternative for those just learning to do their own nails.</li>
            <li> and they are slender and pretty and look like my own nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fine buffer square</li>
            <li> led light that comes with the soak off started kit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy application on clean,  dehydrated</li>
            <li> 18G LED LIGHT:</li>
            <li> My instructions are based on my light</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and it lasts forever&lt;</li>
            <li> File to fit if you need to.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> nail at a time, paint a light coating of Builder Gel inside the dual form.</li>
            <li> Place inside your light and cure 5 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Paint another light coating of the builder gel inside the nail.</li>
            <li> Fit the nail to your finger and press gently--don&#x27;t make the gel squish out.</li>
            <li> Place the finger under the light and cure 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Remove</li>
            <li> File to fit if you need to.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>

            <li> Place the finger under the light and cure 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Remove</li>
            <li> I got the 18w light and it worked like I thought it should.</li>
            <li> Be prepared though - it does NOT go on as smoothly as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> Works fantastic with my led cuting light.</li>
            <li> I would cure your nail under the LED/UV light asap with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is just as strong as acrylic if applied the right way!</li>
            <li> it is quite nice, sturdy, quick to cure and looks much sleeker than acrylics.</li>
            <li> I applied over tips and it looks fantastic, cured quickly with the LED light I got in my Gelish kit.  </li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s worth every dang penny!</li>
            <li> Thanks! :)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to strengthen their own nails or build long beautiful ones.</li>
            <li> I did a full set of gels with this gel</li>
            <li> Hoping it lasts and continues to look this good for several weeks!</li>
            <li> This gel has a thick consistency which is perfect for sculpting your nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty cool!</li>
            <li> Great gel for other people probably.</li>
            <li> Received quickly and well packaged.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Self taught &amp; quick learner.</li>
            <li> The hard gel is perfect to create a toenail which accepts polish and looks great for weeks while my new toenail grows back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and would definitely recommend.  </li>
            <li> What most aren&#x27;t listing that would be helpful to new comers to this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if your trying to keep your real nails long and don&#x27;t want them to break.</li>
            <li> Cured very well under my LED light.  </li>
            <li> finger from light, grab form at end with tabs and gently work it side to side to remove the dual form from the nail.</li>
            <li> finger from light, grab form at end with tabs and gently work it side to side to remove the dual form from the nail.</li>
            <li> Very forgiving unless you bump your nails under the light, then you will have a bump.  </li>
            <li> You do have to do thin layers and cure each layer to get the best effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the uber-cheap brands, but this is worth the money when comparing quality.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that it self levels right before your eye&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It just takes time and practice to get it right, and to understand the application abilities of the product.</li>
            <li> However, if u don&#x27;t take all the right steps it will pop off.</li>
            <li> I use the whole gelish system and I&#x27;m very pleased with all products especially this one!</li>
            <li> /&gt;To paint just lightly buff with the sponge, use your foundation and color coats like normal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To paint just lightly buff with the sponge, use your foundation and color coats like normal.</li>
            <li> I used the ph bond only and on first use, many of my gel nails popped right off my nail.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hard gel is great for creating nail extensions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was pretty tricky the first time I applied it.</li>
            <li> It never fails me and I can always count on whatever I use, working.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Has saved me so much money!</li>
            <li> I love how this cures in only 2minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more viscous than the soak off builder gel (white jar).</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> So your probably be better off with the clear or light pink builder.</li>
            <li> I now have beautiful long nails that take very minimal upkeep.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and it last for a while if you use it correctly.</li>
            <li> Even with extra cure time it tends to peel easily</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how strong my nails are with only one coat.</li>
            <li> Im a huge fan of gelish products and I recently purchased this</li>
            <li> MAKE SURE to get at least and 18 watt  light though.</li>
            <li> in the description it says that the gel cures in 20 seconds with an LED lamp, i had to cure my nail under the lamp for a whole minute.</li>
            <li> Just as described Thanks</li>
            <li> U really can extend your nails with it.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t be sure what results you&#x27;ll have with other lights.</li>
            <li> this point the form should release cleanly from the nail and you are left with a shiny nail.</li>
            <li> this point the form should release cleanly from the nail and you are left with a shiny nail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve watched Youtube videos of people doing these nails with other lights and their instructions didn&#x27;t work with my light or they used much longer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fine that it is NOT a soak off with acetone product as I plan to use it as a long term overlay to natural nails.  </li>
            <li> It was my first hard gel, not too satisfied</li>
            <li> Would recommend with complimentary Gelish products from the entire line.  </li>
            <li> For the price I shouldn&#x27;t have to buy more every few weeks.</li>
            <li> It has become the new fsd around my cosmo school to use in place of the damaging acrylic.  </li>
            <li> Easy to work with, cured in less than 30 seconds with an LED 8?</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> but I am pleasantly surprised with the quality of the products!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li> I dropped a large can on my toe when it fell out of the cupboard, which caused me to lose my toenail on my big toe.</li>
            <li> : Make sure it&#x27;s the hard builder and not structure&lt;</li>
            <li> I use less for a thin but strong application, which is perfect for maintaining long nails; your nails won&#x27;t bend, crack &amp; break when you accidentally jab it into everyday things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Are there any pointers on the best ways to apply the hard  gel with false tips?</li>
            <li> So this is the clear version</li>
            <li> and it is what it says, clear.</li>
            <li> What they don&#x27;t tell you is, not to apply to your natural nails.</li>
            <li> and it is a complete joke.</li>
            <li> I am applying directly to my natural nail which has allowed me to grow my nails out without them breaking.</li>
            <li> I wasted more than this costs, buying lesser quality lights.</li>
            <li> No more acrylics and easy to apply yourself.</li>
            <li> This is self-leveling which is awesome if you are an amateur and not great at shaping gel or acrylic nails (like me!)</li>
            <li> This product will keep your natural nails hard and strong.</li>
            <li> builder gel allows you to extend your nails or strengthen thin nails - the Clear is the most versatile in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My nails are paper thin right now, and this gel, with just two coats makes them a whole new nail.</li>
            <li> You have to apply it carefully so as not to get a wavy look.  </li>
            <li> totally was old.</li>
            <li> Went back to using wild thunder gel.</li>
            <li> Really strong hard gel - doesn&#x27;t go yellow!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s where I do something I have not seen in any other how to: put the finger back under the light (now minus the dual form) and cure another 20 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Trim</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s where I do something I have not seen in any other how to: put the finger back under the light (now minus the dual form) and cure another 20 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Trim</li>
            <li> I find that this hard gel lifts quickly.</li>
            <li> Not so much creating nail extensions as it is less viscous, so it runs.</li>
            <li> My nails are way too soft for just plain gel polish, and clear gel doesn&#x27;t do the trick either.</li>
            <li> Everything you do is going to be hard at first.</li>
            <li> Used it to fix a nail broken more than half way across with no additional reinforcements.  </li>
            <li> I bought the whole line for hard gel and they don&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> It applies easily and isn&#x27;t difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> Dries clear and firm.  </li>
            <li> I might be missing some items to complete the nails, but it is not holding up for me.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t tried this product yet because they lie to there costumers and the price is extremely high for only 0.5 oz come on ridiculous</li>
            <li> i may have used too thick a layer of builder gel the first time but on my other hand i used thinner layers and built it up that way and they cured in 30- 45secs.</li>
            <li> For my first attempt I used the hard gel under Gelish Snow Bunny in a half moon manicure style with Vegas Nights on my ring fingers.  </li>
            <li> It works with every single gel polish I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It does slowly self level, but very thick to make sculpting easy.  </li>
            <li> I utilized a professional hard gel application brush.  </li>
            <li> The structure gel on the other hand is not as thick and runs into your side walls making it super hard to sculpt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works great horrible shipping</li>
            <li> It is as expected.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really not noticeable on your nail.</li>
            <li> Was careful to avoid cuticles and side walls.  </li>
            <li> I was constantly replacing it and in a few weeks I&#x27;m  almost out of it.</li>
            <li> This product is what I expected to be.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions carefully and watched a few YT videos prior to use.  </li>
            <li> This small container will last a long time!</li>
            <li> Not sure really the difference between structure and  hard gel, just make sure the layers are THIN!!!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking to buy the dark pink builder</li>
            <li> You DO NOT NEED the entire Gelish Hard Gel set if you have the Gelish orginal set.</li>
            <li> Once the tips are glued on, do I 1)apply the hard gel over the entire nail bed and tip, or just the nail bed, or 2)file where the tip and nail meet til even?</li>
            <li> Need a drill to cut down some of the thickness</li>
            <li> it never set hard enough and would always be a little pliable which I did not like.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;Structure&amp;#34; (the white jar) before and needed two coats of that to get the same result as one thin coat of this Hard Gel.</li>
            <li> Shipping was crazy fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been watching you tube videos for ideas and have just been curing it with the little gelish</li>
            <li> It has a lot of flexibility not much difference between the hard gel and builder gel.</li>
            <li> For a few days tops.</li>
            <li> They can be applied as thick as acrylic if needed, and thick enough to sculpt a nail when you don&#x27;t have one.</li>
            <li> Definitely less foul smelling than acrylics!</li>
            <li> This is HARD GEL, if you want something to just give your nails a little hardness then you can use STRUCTURE GEL.....</li>
            <li> Not sure if gels have an expiration date and sometimes the gels peel.</li>
            <li> I love this product, there is no mixing or horrible odors.</li>
            <li> The package arrived a few weeks to late</li>
            <li> I also have the structure gel, and I&#x27;m not sure if that should be used as well.</li>
            <li> had acrylic nails lately and they were a thick mess.</li>
            <li> I noticed my nails do not bend or curl as the grow longer as my nails tend to do without Gelish Hard gel.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*HARMONY HARD LED BUILDER GEL</li>
            <li> I use Gelish Ph Bond, Pro Bond and this Hard Gel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ultra thick.</li>
            <li> I add on a thick coat of this as if it was acrylic</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how thick and sticky this was going to be.  </li>
            <li> if you do them thick you will feel heat</li>
            <li> The product is very thick and hard to apply that</li>
            <li> So I just fill in and apply a thin layer.</li>
            <li> You can extend nails, you can protect and seal broken nails and</li>
            <li> your someone who is also looking to add false tips</li>
            <li> I bought this hard gel because I have very thin nails.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product bought to use on my client and it didn&#x27;t even last her a week.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been using IBD but it could be that I got a bad kit from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Ugly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Amazing people to deal with! Great product :)</li>
            <li> Looks like a nice product although it be cool if it came with some instructions on how to use it because I don&#x27;t know how to use it so it&#x27;s just sitting there</li>
            <li> Im a huge fan of gelish products and I recently purchased this so I could start sculpting my own nails. This gel works great and the self leveling feature is a bonus for non professionals. I would definitely recommend using the pro bond to prep your nail before using this builder. I used the ph bond only and on first use, many of my gel nails popped right off my nail.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried using this on top of silk wraps and it fuses great! Need a drill to cut down some of the thickness but I&#x27;m really in love with this stuff. I&#x27;ve been watching you tube videos for ideas and have just been curing it with the little gelish led light that comes with the soak off started kit.&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered duel nail forms and can&#x27;t wait to test it out using them! Yay gelish rocks!!</li>
            <li> It is as expected. It is easy to use and it last for a while if you use it correctly. I like it okay.</li>
            <li> in the description it says that the gel cures in 20 seconds with an LED lamp, i had to cure my nail under the lamp for a whole minute. i may have used too thick a layer of builder gel the first time but on my other hand i used thinner layers and built it up that way and they cured in 30- 45secs.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it self levels right before your eye&#x27;s. It&#x27;s was pretty tricky the first time I applied it. But I got better over time and understanding of the product. And please disregard the 1 star rating by someone who has yet to even use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to buy the dark pink builder it&#x27;s really not noticeable on your nail. So your probably be better off with the clear or light pink builder.</li>
            <li> This is likely a winner.  Great viscosity.  Easy application on clean,  dehydrated, we&#x27;ll shaped and properly prepped nails.  Would recommend with complimentary Gelish products from the entire line.  No lifting and self leveling.  I utilized a professional hard gel application brush.  Was careful to avoid cuticles and side walls.  Cured very well under my LED light.  I followed the instructions carefully and watched a few YT videos prior to use.  Dries clear and firm.  If Gelish Structure is not quite the strengthening aid to require this is likely for you (I&#x27;m a fan of both).  However my thumb nails slit vertically and gradually so I knew I needed a product that meant business and I&#x27;m quite ok with meticulous fills every 3 weeks.  For my first attempt I used the hard gel under Gelish Snow Bunny in a half moon manicure style with Vegas Nights on my ring fingers.  I&#x27;m fine that it is NOT a soak off with acetone product as I plan to use it as a long term overlay to natural nails.  I did not enhance my length with this nor did I use forms to create a nail.  I noticed my nails do not bend or curl as the grow longer as my nails tend to do without Gelish Hard gel.  Hoping I made a great discovery... Fingers crossed... Literally!!!</li>
            <li> I use this to make my nails longer, read below for how I do it. This method works for me with my equipment, your mileage may vary!&lt;br /&gt;I love this gel, it is self-leveling and I get smooth results! This is HARD GEL, if you want something to just give your nails a little hardness then you can use STRUCTURE GEL.....it&#x27;s softer. I&#x27;ll do a review on that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had acrylic nails lately and they were a thick mess. Rather than go back and have them further butchered I bought this gel and now I do my own fill ins. Yes you can use this gel to do fill ins over acrylic nails! When the acrylics pop off (because that&#x27;s how schitty a job the tech did) I just replace them with a dual form gel nail and they are slender and pretty and look like my own nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I use and how I do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*GELISH 18G LED LIGHT: Yes it&#x27;s expensive. Yes it&#x27;s worth every dang penny! I wasted more than this costs, buying lesser quality lights. It works with every single gel polish I&#x27;ve tried. It never fails me and I can always count on whatever I use, working. My instructions are based on my light and I can&#x27;t be sure what results you&#x27;ll have with other lights. I&#x27;ve watched Youtube videos of people doing these nails with other lights and their instructions didn&#x27;t work with my light or they used much longer times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*HARMONY PRO BOND: Yes you want this instead of just the PH Bond. Don&#x27;t try to sub alcohol or acetone for this. Just buy it. It&#x27;s cheap and it lasts forever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*DUAL FORMS: I got the 100 pcs for about $5, I&#x27;ll try to put a link in my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*HARMONY HARD LED BUILDER GEL: Make sure it&#x27;s the hard builder and not structure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*#6 nail brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*IBD LED/UV Bonder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Very fine buffer square&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting with clean nails----use the very fine buffer sponge and lightly buff your nails in a downward motion from cuticle to free edge.

Place inside your light and cure 5 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Paint another light coating of the builder gel inside the nail. Fit the nail to your finger and press gently--don&#x27;t make the gel squish out. Make sure there are no bubbles under the form. Place the finger under the light and cure 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Remove finger from light, grab form at end with tabs and gently work it side to side to remove the dual form from the nail. If the form is not damaged you can put it back in your box and use it again.&lt;br /&gt;At this point the form should release cleanly from the nail and you are left with a shiny nail. It may be soft-ish. That&#x27;s where I do something I have not seen in any other how to: put the finger back under the light (now minus the dual form) and cure another 20 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Trim nail to desired length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To paint just lightly buff with the sponge, use your foundation and color coats like normal.

            <li> Not sure if gels have an expiration date and sometimes the gels peel.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t tried this product yet because they lie to there costumers and the price is extremely high for only 0.5 oz come on ridiculous</li>
            <li> Great to use in place of acrylic!  It has become the new fsd around my cosmo school to use in place of the damaging acrylic.  Also to good to use to strengthen nails as they grow out.  A must have for any cosmetologist or nail tech!</li>
            <li> This gel works amazing for building gel nails. Once you get the hang of it it is quite nice, sturdy, quick to cure and looks much sleeker than acrylics. Definitely less foul smelling than acrylics!</li>
            <li> Great product. MAKE SURE to get at least and 18 watt  light though. It will not work well without one. I tried it and the gel will not harden the way it should. I got the 18w light and it worked like I thought it should. Also make sure to use a dehydrator and a bonder. It makes it stick better.</li>
            <li> Talk about making your nails strong....this is the best ever.  Be prepared though - it does NOT go on as smoothly as I&#x27;d like.  It&#x27;s ultra thick. You have to apply it carefully so as not to get a wavy look.  But I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;Structure&amp;#34; (the white jar) before and needed two coats of that to get the same result as one thin coat of this Hard Gel.</li>
            <li> totally was old. didn&#x27;t work. sending back for replacement.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to fix my big toe for sandal weather. I dropped a large can on my toe when it fell out of the cupboard, which caused me to lose my toenail on my big toe. Ugly. The hard gel is perfect to create a toenail which accepts polish and looks great for weeks while my new toenail grows back. Amazing!</li>
            <li> I have used everything and this is by far the best. I cannot believe how strong my nails are with only one coat. WOW! What most aren&#x27;t listing that would be helpful to new comers to this product is you should be applying the PH Bond, then the foundation gel, THEN the builder gel. I didn&#x27;t do my foundation layer and it will peel if you do not. Hope that helps someone.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best self leveling gel I have ever worked with. My nails look better than any (harmful) acrylic I have ever had done. :)&lt;br /&gt;Plus no odor. Yay!</li>
            <li> i like all harmony products.  but it was smaller than i thought.  i would like to purchase again. nice th</li>
            <li> Product worked great and came on time!</li>
            <li> Well, it works great. What they don&#x27;t tell you is, not to apply to your natural nails. It does not come off. I&#x27;ve filed and soaked in acetone for 20 to 35 minutes and doesn&#x27;t come off. It&#x27;s great if your trying to keep your real nails long and don&#x27;t want them to break. Perfect. My problem is when they grow out, you can&#x27;t get it off. So I just fill in and apply a thin layer. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li> Stays on my clients for weeks! Easy to use, self leveling, makes me look like a pro...which I am. ;)</li>
            <li> I love these LED builder gels. My nails are way too soft for just plain gel polish, and clear gel doesn&#x27;t do the trick either. But these builder gels are awesome! They can be applied as thick as acrylic if needed, and thick enough to sculpt a nail when you don&#x27;t have one. It does slowly self level, but very thick to make sculpting easy.  So this is the clear version and it is what it says, clear.</li>
            <li> I did a full set of gels with this gel and they ALL lifted. She didn&#x27;t do anything, change her clothes maybe and they kept popping off. I have a bunch of the gelish polishes so i thought i would try this builder gel and it is a complete joke. Will stick with the IBD Builder Gel.</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of building your own gel nails, this stuff is great.  It just takes time and practice to get it right, and to understand the application abilities of the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this hard gel because I have very thin nails. Since using this product I have been able to grow my nails. The product is very thick and hard to apply that is why I only gave it a four star. I received it very quick and would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This is self-leveling which is awesome if you are an amateur and not great at shaping gel or acrylic nails (like me!) I applied over tips and it looks fantastic, cured quickly with the LED light I got in my Gelish kit.  Hoping it lasts and continues to look this good for several weeks!</li>
            <li> 2nd time ordering this one! Works fantastic with my led cuting light.</li>
            <li> Gelish Builder Gel is amazing! Very strong, and holds up well! Acrylic nails are not allowed in the hospital anymore, but gel nails are! This is just as strong as acrylic if applied the right way! I use the whole gelish system and I&#x27;m very pleased with all products especially this one! Fast shipping - great product!! This small container will last a long time!</li>
            <li> This is truly the best thing in strengthening your nails! If you like the Gelish set you will absolutely love the added strength this builder gel imparts. You DO NOT NEED the entire Gelish Hard Gel set if you have the Gelish orginal set. Just use the PH bond then a tthin coat of the Gelish Foundation and then this builder gel and of course the Top It Off. NO lifting at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your someone who is also looking to add false tips this is a perfect alternative to acrylic, much better than the Gelish Structure gel. This gel has a thick consistency which is perfect for sculpting your nails. The structure gel on the other hand is not as thick and runs into your side walls making it super hard to sculpt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a hazard when it comes to my natural nails, they always end up chipping and breaking this was the perfect solution. I add on a thick coat of this as if it was acrylic and it gives my nails enough strength to endure my brutality. Honestly you would never know the difference. When I tried building up my nails using the structure gel it never set hard enough and would always be a little pliable which I did not like.</li>
            <li> Definitely adds needed strength to my nails. I am applying directly to my natural nail which has allowed me to grow my nails out without them breaking. I find that this hard gel lifts quickly. They usually only last a week. It applies easily and isn&#x27;t difficult to work with. Will definitely continue to use this product despite lifting issues.</li>
            <li> I loved it.  Great Product!!!</li>
            <li> I do my own nails and have a hard time working with the powders so this builder is a great alternative for those just learning to do their own nails.</li>
            <li> works great horrible shipping</li>
            <li> Received quickly and well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The builder gel allows you to extend your nails or strengthen thin nails - the Clear is the most versatile in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to buy from this supplier.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how thick and sticky this was going to be.  But only because I had never used such a product.  Once I got a feel for it I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Just as described Thanks</li>
            <li> I love this product, there is no mixing or horrible odors. Use your gel brush and nail form to create stunning nails in no time. Works great with Gelish 18g led lamp.</li>
            <li> I bought the whole line for hard gel and they don&#x27;t last.  Lift easily, break easily, crack easily.  Don&#x27;t like this at all...going back to IBD</li>
            <li> This product will keep your natural nails hard and strong. No more acrylics and easy to apply yourself. You will need a LED Lamp.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product bought to use on my client and it didn&#x27;t even last her a week. Went back to using wild thunder gel.</li>
            <li> This builds a great, strong nail and I love it. For a few days tops. I have never had to file these off because they fall off so easily. The longest I managed to keep the gel on my nails was five days. Great gel for other people probably. It was my first hard gel, not too satisfied becasue I was constantly replacing it and in a few weeks I&#x27;m  almost out of it. For the price I shouldn&#x27;t have to buy more every few weeks. I&#x27;ll be looking into ibd next.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.  Goes on fairly easy.  Very forgiving unless you bump your nails under the light, then you will have a bump.  Keeps my nails from breaking.</li>
            <li> Great price - great investment! Has saved me so much money! Really strong hard gel - doesn&#x27;t go yellow! Stays on forever! I only re-apply to infill - never lifts - just brill :) Thanks! :)</li>
            <li> Not sure really the difference between structure and  hard gel, just make sure the layers are THIN!!! if you do them thick you will feel heat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it one time ever since I bought the product and it&#x27;s awesome how I just apply the coats and under the light I go. It&#x27;s pretty cool!</li>
            <li> Love love love this for building nails.</li>
            <li> Shipping was crazy fast! I think it shipped the day I ordered it! And the gel is awesome. U really can extend your nails with it. However, if u don&#x27;t take all the right steps it will pop off. And the extension is not as strong as an acrylic. So be prepared for that. But!!! My nails are paper thin right now, and this gel, with just two coats makes them a whole new nail. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The Gel is not as strong as I thought. It has a lot of flexibility not much difference between the hard gel and builder gel.</li>
            <li> I love how this cures in only 2minutes. Saves some time.</li>
            <li> This product is what I expected to be. You can extend nails, you can protect and seal broken nails and so much more with it.</li>
            <li> The hard gel is great for creating nail extensions. It&#x27;s more viscous than the soak off builder gel (white jar). I use less for a thin but strong application, which is perfect for maintaining long nails; your nails won&#x27;t bend, crack &amp; break when you accidentally jab it into everyday things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can replace the soak off builder gel, although I feel like you should have both depending on what you want to do. The soak off builder gel is great for mixing with pigments, glitters and setting in jewels/studs/cabochons. Not so much creating nail extensions as it is less viscous, so it runs. I would cure your nail under the LED/UV light asap with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me: Non-professional with love for gels &amp; nail art. My nails are brittle so gels saved me. Self taught &amp; quick learner. Patience is key. Everything you do is going to be hard at first. take the time</li>
            <li> i like it had to get use to using it.  You do have to do thin layers and cure each layer to get the best effect.</li>
            <li> Idk why it does .  but it peels up easily.  Even with extra cure time it tends to peel easily</li>
            <li> Not to happy with this product.  Would not order again</li>
            <li> Great product great seller</li>
            <li> Gets the job done! Easy to form and it&#x27;s not as sticky when it cures in the uv lamp!</li>
            <li> Easy to work with, cured in less than 30 seconds with an LED 8? Watt lamp.  Used it to fix a nail broken more than half way across with no additional reinforcements.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and would definitely recommend.  I&#x27;ve purchased the uber-cheap brands, but this is worth the money when comparing quality.  I&#x27;m not a pro and found it simple to use.  It does self level, but I helped it along with a brush.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the ease of application and the structure this gives my nails! I now have beautiful long nails that take very minimal upkeep.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to strengthen their own nails or build long beautiful ones. I&#x27;m buying more just to keep on hand for when I run out!</li>
            <li> The package arrived a few weeks to late but I am pleasantly surprised with the quality of the products! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t received mine yet, but I&#x27;m hoping to get some input:) Are there any pointers on the best ways to apply the hard  gel with false tips? I also have the structure gel, and I&#x27;m not sure if that should be used as well. Once the tips are glued on, do I 1)apply the hard gel over the entire nail bed and tip, or just the nail bed, or 2)file where the tip and nail meet til even? I would appreciate any advice:)</li>
            <li> Works amazing! I have been using IBD but it could be that I got a bad kit from Sally&#x27;s. This Gelish he&#x27;d gel has great viscosity and when applied correctly feels as strong and durable like acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> Provides strength and protection for nails.  Love that this is LED because most builder gels are UV.  I use Gelish Ph Bond, Pro Bond and this Hard Gel.  No lifting at all.  Also used this with Dual Forms and didn&#x27;t have to sculpt.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Great product, thank you.</li>
            <li> I might be missing some items to complete the nails, but it is not holding up for me. Or it could be my lack of knowledge.</li>
