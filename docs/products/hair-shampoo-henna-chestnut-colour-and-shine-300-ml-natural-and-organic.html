            <li>I used this as directed for a week and noticed my hair was a lovely darker shade of brown and my whites were a light caramel.</li>
            <li>My hair is happy, shiny and I can see some nice shades when the light falls at a specific angle.</li>
            <li>It has a light smell and does not stain.</li>
            <li>The good:  1)  Repaired my highly damaged hair, making it look and feel, soft, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>(FD&amp;C Yellow 5).&lt;br /&gt;Sounded too good to be trure..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s full of harmful chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon - please remove the word &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; associated with this product.</li>
            <li>I use this shampoo without conditioner and my hair is soft and easy to brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>If the quality still the same, I will order two more but the S &amp; H is little higher with all the combinations I did to have free delivery.</li>
            <li>sadly it IS too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>The price is also high, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I even tried letting the shampoo sit in my hair applying it directly to the grays, and no, it doesn&#x27;t cover grays.</li>
            <li>Highlights are natural.  </li>
            <li>I avoid products with un natural ingredients especially now that I&#x27;m expecting.</li>
            <li>It creates such natural looking highlights in my hair.</li>

            <li> This product is NOT Natural or organic.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients include: Cocamide DEA, PEG-55 Propylene Glycol Oleate, Benzophenone-4, Parfum (fragrance), Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Pripylparaben, Butylparaben, Disodium EDTA, CI42090</li>
            <li> I found it to dry my hair out.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of this shampoo goes a long way so don&#x27;t be too put off by the price.</li>
            <li> I was not sure from the description whether it actually added highlights but it did in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I tried a different henna shampoo that was a little less expensive after this but prefer the highlights of this shampoo and also it washes and creates suds like a normal shampoo which the other henna shampoo did not.  </li>

            <li> Also oddly enough, it was irritating for my eyes,  something I haven&#x27;t had an issue with before with  any other shampoo or conditioner .</li>

    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this was shipped well wrapped and promptly. I ended up giving it to my husband because I looked at the ingredient list and this is loaded with parabens; who would think something that had henna in it would also have chemicals? I avoid products with un natural ingredients especially now that I&#x27;m expecting.</li>
            <li> changes color gradually with regular use.</li>
            <li> The good:  1)  Repaired my highly damaged hair, making it look and feel, soft, shiny and healthy. 2) Tinted my blonde highlights to a dark caramel color (exactly what I was hoping for).  The Bad: It does not cover gray hair at all. I even tried letting the shampoo sit in my hair applying it directly to the grays, and no, it doesn&#x27;t cover grays. That&#x27;s probably because gray hair has a different texture making it resistant to coloring.</li>
            <li> Love how this product helps to maintain the color in my hair, helps to hide the grey as highlights with continued use that is.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more than I probably should have probably.  did not gradually color my grey strands that are here n there, or enhance my brown hair that I could tell. .  I found it to dry my hair out.  Also oddly enough, it was irritating for my eyes,  something I haven&#x27;t had an issue with before with  any other shampoo or conditioner . The price is also high, in my opinion. So for the product claims, no my hair didn&#x27;t feel softer, and it was irritating. The definition for 2 stars on Amazon is &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t like it&amp;#34; so I give it 2 stars.</li>
            <li> i wish america made this product for women.it is great and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Really does add color to hair, as advertised.  Plus, it is a lovely shampoo to use, suds up easily and does a great job. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed this before. I use it sometimes between coloring to slightly tint my gray hairs.  Leaves my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> I have brown hair and wanted to try something that would add some highlights without using hair dye.  This shampoo did add subtle red highlights over time and slightly darkened the color of my hair.  I was not sure from the description whether it actually added highlights but it did in my hair.  I stopped using it and my hair returned to normal color quickly.  It did not impact my hair texture, etc. at all.  I tried a different henna shampoo that was a little less expensive after this but prefer the highlights of this shampoo and also it washes and creates suds like a normal shampoo which the other henna shampoo did not.  It did not help my grays at all though.</li>
            <li> This item was for my daugther. She used and is satisfied.</li>
            <li> If you use Henna coloring, I recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I used this product long time ago, and leave your hair clean and smooth and light your natural color turning brownish. If the quality still the same, I will order two more but the S &amp; H is little higher with all the combinations I did to have free delivery.</li>
            <li> Highlights are natural.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Adds a touch of color.</li>
            <li> This product is of good quality and it gives my hair a nice lift in the colour and shine.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> My hair is happy, shiny and I can see some nice shades when the light falls at a specific angle. I use this shampoo without conditioner and my hair is soft and easy to brush.&lt;br /&gt;I have had some problems with the lid of the container (I use the shampoo at the gym) and I had some spillage.</li>
            <li> I have medium brown hair with about 30% white. I used this as directed for a week and noticed my hair was a lovely darker shade of brown and my whites were a light caramel. It doesn&#x27;t cover the white but it does make them a lot less noticeable. A little bit of this shampoo goes a long way so don&#x27;t be too put off by the price. It has a light smell and does not stain.</li>
            <li> The title and description are misleading.  This product is NOT Natural or organic.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients include: Cocamide DEA, PEG-55 Propylene Glycol Oleate, Benzophenone-4, Parfum (fragrance), Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Pripylparaben, Butylparaben, Disodium EDTA, CI42090 (FD&amp;C Blue 1), CI 17200 (D&amp;C Red 33), CI 19140 (FD&amp;C Yellow 5).&lt;br /&gt;Sounded too good to be trure.. sadly it IS too good to be true.  It&#x27;s full of harmful chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon - please remove the word &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; associated with this product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great.  It creates such natural looking highlights in my hair. It must be used regularly to work...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t add any color to white hair</li>
