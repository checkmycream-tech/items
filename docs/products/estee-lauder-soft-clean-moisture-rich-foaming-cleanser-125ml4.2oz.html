            <li> You only use a small amount ...</li>
            <li> Since you only need to use very little at a time (half of a pea size)</li>
            <li> very little of it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> in just a few minutes!  </li>
            <li> It is thick and creamy, almost like a lotion.</li>
            <li> The product comes out as a very thick pearly paste.  </li>
            <li> but this was expensive than it is sold in the mall.</li>
            <li> and it feels weird putting it on</li>

            <li> Never disappointed with this product.  Always makes my face feel moisturized after washing my makeup off. As a middle aged woman I appreciate a product that does NOT make me feel dried out.</li>
            <li> I got a 1.7 fluid oz tube of this as a part of an Estee Lauder gift set.  The product comes out as a very thick pearly paste.  Keep in mind- very little of it goes a long way.  It foams up very nicely and imparts a very pleasant delicate scent.  The product rinses off very cleanly and leaves no feeling of residue. My face feels so fresh and clean and I feel like I just treated my face to a mini-spa- in just a few minutes!  I say this is worth the higher price tag because you need to use so little of it.  I will continue using this since I love washing my face with it so much.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this product! It&#x27;s great that you only use very little because it foams up a lot. I use it with my clarisonic and I really like it!! Since you only need to use very little at a time (half of a pea size) I had the same tube for about a year or maybe more! But I do switch to my other Olay face wash sometimes, not a much though. I like the way it smells, it&#x27;s fresh and clean and after I wash my face it feels very clean.</li>
            <li> Very soft on skin i am using it since four years</li>
            <li> love, love, love. don&#x27;t ever want to be without it. use it every day. well recommended for all skin types. a must try!</li>

            <li> What I really love about  this product is that a little goes a long way. You just have to squeeze a press size amount maybe even smaller in your wet hands and rub and you get a lot of suds from it. I like how it leaves a clean feeling on your face and doesn&#x27;t really make your face dry like those other washes.</li>
            <li> I went shopping yesterday for a new cleanser and thought I&#x27;d try this one. I could not have imagined at the time what a good decision it turned out to be.
