            <li>but all in all a nice product.  </li>

            <li>It goes on VERY smooth, like silk almost.  </li>
            <li>It is very soft smooth and it blends my makeup excellently.</li>
            <li>It is a silicone-based primer that fills in all the fine lines on your face leaving your skin feeling ultra-silky smooth and ready for a flawless application of foundation.</li>
            <li>Not so waaaaw but nice and gives you a smooth feeling before make up.</li>
            <li>love how it feels, and it kept my skin matte for quite a while</li>
            <li>i love the product.</li>
            <li>I guess this product is ok.</li>
            <li>To use it, I will need to purchase darker makeup or be more strategic on how I apply the primer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve sold so many people on this product</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I just wish there was more in the bottle though</li>
            <li>I love this primer.  </li>
            <li>so i got this 4days after i ordered and with standard shipping which was fricken awesome</li>
            <li>I love 98% of elf products</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love this one.</li>
            <li>the packing is really stylish.</li>
            <li>so I probably won&#x27;t be able to use cause</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely in love with how my skin looks</li>
            <li>Love this dearly</li>
            <li>Wonderful for my larger pores.  </li>
            <li>I have given it as a gift to two friends and they love it too.</li>
            <li>works great, quality and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with the product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try that product put!</li>
            <li>it is very cool product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try anything that will help with my very, very, oily skin!!</li>
            <li>Smooth on my face</li>
            <li>Whether using liquid, cream, powder or mousse, it makes application &amp; finish smooth.</li>
            <li>I love the price much better, but there isn&#x27;t much in this container...very deceiving.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard Milk of magnesium works wonder for primer, oily skin, going to try that next, since it&#x27;s so cheap!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone that is currently using Smashbox or is just looking for an excellent primer.</li>
            <li>I think this is totally worth it for $6 on the ELF website!</li>
            <li>Which is hard plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But great news!</li>
            <li>I purchased this primer as it had great reviews and cost was minimal.  </li>
            <li>I could buy this by the bucket full.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it says how much is in there, but didn&#x27;t look, so that&#x27;s my fault. ..</li>
            <li>, it goes to quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, it works better than professional brands, and I never go a day without using it.</li>
            <li>This may be a good product with dry skin as opposed to me that has combination.</li>
            <li>then she is, she too has very oily skin!!</li>
            <li>Applying this with makeup is very smooth and natural.</li>
            <li>I dont have the best foundation at the moment so a bit hard to tell just how much of a difference the primer gives to setting it</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>Does it make my makeup more clear, I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li>Tried them all, expensive to cheap, and this is the best!!</li>
            <li>Im actually not crazy about the way makeup sits on my face after applying this product..</li>
            <li>I have gotten other people to buy this, I just love elf and this makes the makeup go on so smooth!</li>
            <li>I had previously purchased this item thought another seller here on amazon, and I loved it.</li>
            <li>Expected more from an E.L.F. Primer!</li>
            <li>It really helped minimize pores !</li>
            <li>It did however make my pores look smaller and gave my face a more polished look.</li>
            <li>When I first received this I tried it out on my hand to see if I noticed any difference.  </li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s my first time to use a primer, but I  was stunned.</li>
            <li>I love this product i just wish it was sold in larger ounces.</li>
            <li>, i will be buying again very soon!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM!!  </li>
            <li>I was very excited when it finally arrived in the mail.</li>
            <li>The bottle looks like you could get at least more then 15 uses!!</li>
            <li>I was on the hunt for a decent primer and was pretty excited when I came across this particular one by e.l.f.</li>
            <li>I normally have to blot with in 45 min.!!</li>
            <li>Love to feel on my face keeps my eye shadow on all day long</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it with a foundation that tends to be more dry.</li>
            <li>although I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it, I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like 1/5th of the whole visible bottle.</li>
            <li>I really noticed the difference it makes when I forgot to bring it on my vacation.</li>
            <li>Once you use this you will be forever spoiled, but it&#x27;s at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>It was very oily</li>
            <li>It shipped really fast too</li>
            <li>I bought the product not expecting much considering the price.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely repurchase this product again.</li>
            <li>It did help with covering pores, I have very oily skin, this didn&#x27;t make me oiler.</li>
            <li>I also use just 1 pump/drop for my whole face.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go out the door every morning to school with my kids.</li>
            <li>Everything just seems a little brighter and more crisp.  </li>
            <li>If you are serious about using a good primer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like they put a sample usage in a big bottle, well the bottle isn&#x27;t big, but they make you think there is more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times hoping each time it would be better but no such luck.</li>
            <li>I like this better than a lot of the more expensive face creams.</li>
            <li>I found this highly recommended on Amazon, so I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to primers so it could be my ignorance, but I was surprised at how much lighter it made my face.</li>
            <li>I did start using a new foundation called Kat Von D</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that the skin on my hand did look smoother so it would probably look great on my face, however, I am not sure if I got a bad batch for this primer, but it smells absolutely horrid.  </li>
            <li>It goes on feeling great but after 3 hours of wearing it under my foundation it makes me look super oily &amp; my makeup starts to breakdown &amp; be blotchy :(</li>
            <li>It holds make up long, and keeps it fresh looking all day.</li>
            <li>The first time I purchased it on amazon it was 5.99 as an &amp;#34;add on item&amp;#34; with this seller it was 8.99 (I thought it was a bigger bottle</li>
            <li>While the product may feel a bit greasy during the first few second, it very quickly absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li>I first used the popular, expensive brand.  </li>
            <li>I settled for this clear primer and</li>
            <li>and I have developed some on my for head and</li>
            <li>It has a very chemical-like smell that fades over time, but the initial blast of it made me so nauseous could not bring myself to put this on my face.</li>
            <li>It is really soft on my face.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at the difference primer makes in my foundation.</li>
            <li>I usually love all e.l.f. products but this one makes me feel like I have something sitting on my face.. thick and obnoxious.</li>
            <li>But with ELF and my new foundation, I only had to blot a couple times!</li>
            <li>What a major difference this makes on your skin.</li>
            <li>I have bought from this company a few times and really like them!</li>
            <li>The only down side is that the pump did break on me after several uses, but mine was part of the first batch that ELF put on the market and they have improved the pump since (according to their website).</li>
            <li>Eye shadow seems to really stay in place (I use various baked shadows wet and dry).  </li>

            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s my first time to use a primer, but I  was stunned.</li>
            <li> I love this product i just wish it was sold in larger ounces.</li>
            <li> , i will be buying again very soon!</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM!!  </li>
            <li> I was very excited when it finally arrived in the mail.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks like you could get at least more then 15 uses!!</li>
            <li> I was on the hunt for a decent primer and was pretty excited when I came across this particular one by e.l.f.</li>
            <li> I normally have to blot with in 45 min.!!</li>
            <li> Love to feel on my face keeps my eye shadow on all day long</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it with a foundation that tends to be more dry.</li>
            <li> although I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it, I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like 1/5th of the whole visible bottle.</li>
            <li> I really noticed the difference it makes when I forgot to bring it on my vacation.</li>
            <li> Once you use this you will be forever spoiled, but it&#x27;s at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> It was very oily</li>
            <li> It shipped really fast too</li>
            <li> I bought the product not expecting much considering the price.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely repurchase this product again.</li>
            <li> It did help with covering pores, I have very oily skin, this didn&#x27;t make me oiler.</li>
            <li> I also use just 1 pump/drop for my whole face.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go out the door every morning to school with my kids.</li>
            <li> Everything just seems a little brighter and more crisp.  </li>
            <li> If you are serious about using a good primer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like they put a sample usage in a big bottle, well the bottle isn&#x27;t big, but they make you think there is more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times hoping each time it would be better but no such luck.</li>
            <li> I like this better than a lot of the more expensive face creams.</li>
            <li> I found this highly recommended on Amazon, so I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to primers so it could be my ignorance, but I was surprised at how much lighter it made my face.</li>
            <li> I did start using a new foundation called Kat Von D</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that the skin on my hand did look smoother so it would probably look great on my face, however, I am not sure if I got a bad batch for this primer, but it smells absolutely horrid.  </li>
            <li> It goes on feeling great but after 3 hours of wearing it under my foundation it makes me look super oily &amp; my makeup starts to breakdown &amp; be blotchy :(</li>
            <li> It holds make up long, and keeps it fresh looking all day.</li>
            <li> The first time I purchased it on amazon it was 5.99 as an &amp;#34;add on item&amp;#34; with this seller it was 8.99 (I thought it was a bigger bottle</li>
            <li> While the product may feel a bit greasy during the first few second, it very quickly absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> I first used the popular, expensive brand.  </li>
            <li> I settled for this clear primer and</li>
            <li> and I have developed some on my for head and</li>
            <li> It has a very chemical-like smell that fades over time, but the initial blast of it made me so nauseous could not bring myself to put this on my face.</li>
            <li> It is really soft on my face.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at the difference primer makes in my foundation.</li>
            <li> I usually love all e.l.f. products but this one makes me feel like I have something sitting on my face.. thick and obnoxious.</li>
            <li> But with ELF and my new foundation, I only had to blot a couple times!</li>
            <li> What a major difference this makes on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have bought from this company a few times and really like them!</li>
            <li> The only down side is that the pump did break on me after several uses, but mine was part of the first batch that ELF put on the market and they have improved the pump since (according to their website).</li>
            <li> Eye shadow seems to really stay in place (I use various baked shadows wet and dry).  </li>
            <li> Yes, the actual content is very little, but just one pump on my nail is enough to cover my whole face.</li>
            <li> It is literally exactly the same formula, or at least it feels that way to me, a longtime Smashbox user.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Hispanic and it&#x27;s pretty hard to find a shade of foundation to match my skin color.</li>
            <li> This makes your foundation stay all day long.</li>
            <li> and I use it every single day</li>
            <li> I have pretty oily skin to begin with and all this stuff did was make it worse.</li>
            <li> It feels very soft and doesn&#x27;t dry hard or plastic like.</li>
            <li> I have used the Smashbox primer forever and have spent hundreds on it.</li>
            <li> Due for another bottle now..</li>
            <li> I put just a small dab on my finger, and when I went to use it the 3rd time it was gone!!</li>
            <li> With the primer a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s about the only complaint I have.</li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is the pump often breaks.</li>
            <li> Way cheaper than other brands!</li>
            <li> this product did not help make those lines less noticeable after I applied my make up.</li>
            <li> Make up glides on, and you use so much less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a full makeup girl (cover stick for trouble spots, base and loose powder)</li>
            <li> Why so little product?</li>
            <li> Later that night a few hours later, I was majorly disappointed when, not only did the primer make NO DIFFERENCE, but my face looked shinier then before with it ON.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I have tried it a few times now and find it just glides on which I like.  </li>
            <li> but I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> The Spatty can be used with all liquid makeup products, and you wont waste a drop of make up anymore.</li>
            <li> One thing I did not expect is I got literally 2 and half uses!</li>
            <li> then i&#x27;d recommend to invest on something a little pricier, but at least you&#x27;ll know you are getting what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Ill definitely buy it again.it</li>
            <li> I just put it in a small pot I have</li>
            <li> I hated not having it, and I suggest the regular one for oily skin or if you live in a humid area.</li>
            <li> Not very good for oily skin</li>
            <li> just sucks</li>
            <li> I do a small wing with my eyeliner and it will keep it in place and not smear all day!</li>
            <li> I solved this irritating problem by getting the small Spatty Daddy.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on a budget this seriously is something to pick up.  </li>
            <li> Got the product and the squirt nozzle came broken in the box.</li>
            <li> The bottle was broken and the machanism to take this stuff out is not working...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using something that is so inexpensive</li>
            <li> Sadly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> WORST STUFF</li>
            <li> I EVER PURCHASED DONOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> WORST STUFF I EVER PURCHASED DONOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not very good for oily skin but it is still a very nice primer and I would recommend it with a foundation that tends to be more dry.</li>
            <li> Not so waaaaw but nice and gives you a smooth feeling before make up.</li>
            <li> I loved it! great product!!!</li>
            <li> will buy over and over again. great price, and great product!!! Way cheaper than other brands!</li>
            <li> Applying this with makeup is very smooth and natural. Receive a lot of compliments of how the makeup looks... Due for another bottle now.. lol</li>
            <li> Worked for about s week than stopped</li>
            <li> This is amazing. Makes your skin feel silky.</li>
            <li> Love to feel on my face keeps my eye shadow on all day long</li>
            <li> It really helped minimize pores ! Ill definitely buy it again.it just sucks there&#x27;s not a lot in there .kind of a tease</li>
            <li> Best freaking primer ever... lifetime customer 🙏👍👊👏</li>
            <li> love how it feels, and it kept my skin matte for quite a while</li>
            <li> i love the product. I used it everyday.  I looks just like it was described. it is very cool product.</li>
            <li> I guess this product is ok. um it says it fills in lines and I have developed some on my for head and this product did not help make those lines less noticeable after I applied my make up. that&#x27;s about the only complaint I have. it does help the make up go on smoother though.</li>
            <li> Got the product and the squirt nozzle came broken in the box. Doesn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to primers so it could be my ignorance, but I was surprised at how much lighter it made my face. My makeup wasn&#x27;t even the correct color after using it. It did however make my pores look smaller and gave my face a more polished look. To use it, I will need to purchase darker makeup or be more strategic on how I apply the primer.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price, you don&#x27;t have to pay alot of money to get good results. Will buy this product again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I can see a difference when I use it. It feels very soft and doesn&#x27;t dry hard or plastic like. Worth the price and I&#x27;ll probably purchase this again</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using something that is so inexpensive but I kept reading reviews about how great it is and decided to just get it to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, your skin looks like it&#x27;s been air brushed. Also, use this on your hands and you won&#x27;t believe how gorgeous they look. I could buy this by the bucket full. I&#x27;ve sold so many people on this product that e.l.f. should start paying me ! LOL</li>
            <li> I purchased this primer as it had great reviews and cost was minimal.  I have tried it a few times now and find it just glides on which I like.  No tugging or rubbing.  I dont have the best foundation at the moment so a bit hard to tell just how much of a difference the primer gives to setting it but all in all a nice product.  Only issue is that cap wont snap on properly and keeps falling off but no big deal.</li>
            <li> I was on the hunt for a decent primer and was pretty excited when I came across this particular one by e.l.f. I was very excited when it finally arrived in the mail. I was going out on a date that same night and figured i&#x27;d give it a try. Later that night a few hours later, I was majorly disappointed when, not only did the primer make NO DIFFERENCE, but my face looked shinier then before with it ON. In this case I definitely got what I paid for. NOTHING. I suppose it depends on the person that uses this regarding how effective it truly is going to be. However, it simply didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money ladies. If you are serious about using a good primer then i&#x27;d recommend to invest on something a little pricier, but at least you&#x27;ll know you are getting what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used a face primer despite using makeup for the last 35 years.  Read a lot of reviews and opinions on varous colors and knew I did NOT want anything sparkly.  I settled for this clear primer and although I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it, I really like it.  It goes on VERY smooth, like silk almost.  You don&#x27;t need but one pump and it glides over your face.  I look in the mirror and can&#x27;t figure out what it is I like: does it make my face brighter?  Does it make my makeup more clear, I don&#x27;t know.  But there&#x27;s a definate difference in how my makeup looks and wears throughout the day.  I&#x27;m a full makeup girl (cover stick for trouble spots, base and loose powder) Everything just seems a little brighter and more crisp.  It can&#x27;t be a coincidence that my face has a differerent look since I started using this.  Eye shadow seems to really stay in place (I use various baked shadows wet and dry).  For the price I say give it a try, I&#x27;m sold and will be sharing my find with my teen daughter who is now into makeup.</li>
            <li> I have a combination skin and this product, when applied all over my face, turns my skin to super-oily and shiny! Not even a mattifying powder can make me non-oily again. After applying this product, I started expelling more and more oil from my pores! Recently I opened up the bottle and saw the quantity. It&#x27;s like 1/5th of the whole visible bottle. Don&#x27;t buy this! Expected more from an E.L.F. Primer!</li>
            <li> The bottle was broken and the machanism to take this stuff out is not working... I am trying to use it with my pinky finger but I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> When I first received this I tried it out on my hand to see if I noticed any difference.  I can honestly say that the skin on my hand did look smoother so it would probably look great on my face, however, I am not sure if I got a bad batch for this primer, but it smells absolutely horrid.  It has a very chemical-like smell that fades over time, but the initial blast of it made me so nauseous could not bring myself to put this on my face.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I just wish there was more in the bottle though, it goes to quick. But it works great.</li>
            <li> I love this primer.  It is really soft on my face.  I use it before my foundation and it lasts.</li>
            <li> This primer is so good that I have become an E.L.F. devotee. What a major difference this makes on your skin. Make up glides on, and you use so much less. It holds make up long, and keeps it fresh looking all day. I really noticed the difference it makes when I forgot to bring it on my vacation. My skin lost the flawless look this creates. I hated not having it, and I suggest the regular one for oily skin or if you live in a humid area. They make a hydrating one for drier skin and in drier climate (especially winter weather). I have both and use according to the weather. Once you use this you will be forever spoiled, but it&#x27;s at a very affordable price. Only complaint I have is the pump often breaks. I solved this irritating problem by getting the small Spatty Daddy. I just put it in a small pot I have and it&#x27;s actually easier to use. The Spatty can be used with all liquid makeup products, and you wont waste a drop of make up anymore.</li>
            <li> Does the job as a face primer no complaints</li>
            <li> so i got this 4days after i ordered and with standard shipping which was fricken awesome, this is AMAZING my makeup is flawless and it even leaves my skin feeling better after my makeup</li>
            <li> Sadly disappointed.  I love 98% of elf products but I don&#x27;t love this one. It goes on feeling great but after 3 hours of wearing it under my foundation it makes me look super oily &amp; my makeup starts to breakdown &amp; be blotchy :( the packing is really stylish. This may be a good product with dry skin as opposed to me that has combination.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing makes my makeup look 10x better and I use it every single day and I lovvveeee it, it&#x27;s a must have</li>
            <li> Good! Smooth on my face</li>
            <li> It was very oily so I probably won&#x27;t be able to use cause I have oily skin to begin with.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. It is very soft smooth and it blends my makeup excellently. Will be getting more!-Brisce M</li>
            <li> I keep ordering it and many of my nieces and friends are now ordering it.. that should be the best review..</li>
            <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s cheap, it works better than professional brands, and I never go a day without using it.</li>
            <li> ELF face primer works great, my makeup stays on all day just perfectly. I also use ELF eye primer on my lids and lips!</li>
            <li> This does help my makeup stay on.  I don&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> I have gotten other people to buy this, I just love elf and this makes the makeup go on so smooth!</li>
            <li> Really works! Leaves face smooth and makes make up look flawless. Good size! A tiny amount covers my face and neck. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, i like it so much</li>
            <li> Makes makeup stay on all day, my face looks like I just put my makeup on. I love it. It shipped really fast too</li>
            <li> It is very similar to Smashbox primer, but not quite up there.  I love the price much better, but there isn&#x27;t much in this container...very deceiving.  Not quite decided on if I will reorder or not.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this primer!!</li>
            <li> I bought the product not expecting much considering the price. I tried using it today after two weeks from receiving it. Maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s my first time to use a primer, but I  was stunned. It&#x27;s colourless, so you don&#x27;t notice the difference when you apply it alone, but after the foundation, concealer and powder, my skin looked smooooth and flawless. I&#x27;m absolutely in love with how my skin looks and I don&#x27;t want to remove my makeup. I would absolutely repurchase this product again.</li>
            <li> It did help with covering pores, I have very oily skin, this didn&#x27;t make me oiler. I did notice after putting on my foundation, my face looked air brushed almost!! I did start using a new foundation called Kat Von D lock it foundation, amazing coverage! So maybe using both together made the difference! One thing I did not expect is I got literally 2 and half uses! The bottle looks like you could get at least more then 15 uses!! I put just a small dab on my finger, and when I went to use it the 3rd time it was gone!! It&#x27;s like they put a sample usage in a big bottle, well the bottle isn&#x27;t big, but they make you think there is more then there is. I&#x27;m sure it says how much is in there, but didn&#x27;t look, so that&#x27;s my fault. .. But am glad I got to try it, and probably will buy more!!! I&#x27;ve heard Milk of magnesium works wonder for primer, oily skin, going to try that next, since it&#x27;s so cheap!!! People swear by this...I&#x27;ll try anything that will help with my very, very, oily skin!! Then again don&#x27;t have to worry about wrinkles!! Lol. My mom looks 10 yrs younger then she is, she too has very oily skin!! it is a pain to have to keep blotting!! But with ELF and my new foundation, I only had to blot a couple times! I normally have to blot with in 45 min.!! Yuck!!!</li>
            <li> This is simply lovely! If you&#x27;re on a budget this seriously is something to pick up.  Love this dearly omg</li>
            <li> This primer is said to be a dupe for Smashbox&#x27;s primer (which retails at about $26). It is a silicone-based primer that fills in all the fine lines on your face leaving your skin feeling ultra-silky smooth and ready for a flawless application of foundation. I do notice that when I wear this under my foundation, my skin really looks flawless. I also use just 1 pump/drop for my whole face. While the product may feel a bit greasy during the first few second, it very quickly absorbs into the skin. The only down side is that the pump did break on me after several uses, but mine was part of the first batch that ELF put on the market and they have improved the pump since (according to their website). This did not break me out in any way. I think this is totally worth it for $6 on the ELF website!</li>
            <li> I love this product i just wish it was sold in larger ounces. I do a small wing with my eyeliner and it will keep it in place and not smear all day! same goes for the rest of my make up, i will be buying again very soon!</li>
            <li> Not a fan. I usually love all e.l.f. products but this one makes me feel like I have something sitting on my face.. thick and obnoxious. I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times hoping each time it would be better but no such luck. It is also a bit shiney. I will stick with my nyx and alba spf 15.</li>
            <li> Why so little product?</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have bought from this company a few times and really like them! This time around they sent me eye shadow with my order! I&#x27;m excited to try that product put! With the primer a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This product works like a charm...smooths, fills, moisturizes, perfects skin texture so that makeup lasts all day.  Tried them all, expensive to cheap, and this is the best!! Had an issue which the seller resolved quickly, and I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE SERVICE FROM THIS SELLER!!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM!!  WILL BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the difference primer makes in my foundation. Whether using liquid, cream, powder or mousse, it makes application &amp; finish smooth. Wonderful for my larger pores.  I first used the popular, expensive brand.  Then I found ELF.  Its perfect &amp; outstanding value! Please ELF, don&#x27;t change a thing about this product!  It&#x27;s perfect just the way it is.</li>
            <li> This is a primer that you put on before your makeup.  It feels like silk. It makes makeup go on smoother and fills in lines and wrinkles. I like this better than a lot of the more expensive face creams. I have given it as a gift to two friends and they love it too.</li>
            <li> I have pretty oily skin to begin with and all this stuff did was make it worse.</li>
            <li> love the product!  works great, quality and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Very nice and smooth. When I used I like the Aperiamce of my foundation</li>
            <li> I did not expect to love this, but I LOVED it! I have used the Smashbox primer forever and have spent hundreds on it. I found this highly recommended on Amazon, so I thought I would give it a try. It is literally exactly the same formula, or at least it feels that way to me, a longtime Smashbox user. I was so pleased. I will be saving a ton of $$ and ordering this again. I highly recommend this to anyone that is currently using Smashbox or is just looking for an excellent primer. This makes your foundation stay all day long. I use this in combination with the E.L.F. finishing powder and my simple BB Cream and highlighter and it works all day...</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased this item thought another seller here on amazon, and I loved it. I&#x27;m Hispanic and it&#x27;s pretty hard to find a shade of foundation to match my skin color. But with this primer I don&#x27;t need foundation. Yes, the actual content is very little, but just one pump on my nail is enough to cover my whole face. Giving me an even tone, a perfect match to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;One pump of this primer, and masquera on my eyelashes and I&#x27;m ready to go out the door every morning to school with my kids. I ❤ it!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars?!?! The first time I purchased it on amazon it was 5.99 as an &amp;#34;add on item&amp;#34; with this seller it was 8.99 (I thought it was a bigger bottle that&#x27;s why I orded it here) but the 3 oz. Is the weight if the entire container. Which is hard plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But great news! My local Target store has added an e.l.f section and they have it for $5!! And that&#x27;s where I stock up now.</li>
            <li> Im actually not crazy about the way makeup sits on my face after applying this product.. It looks oily &amp; unnatural</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the product</li>
