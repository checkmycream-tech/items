            <li>This is a great product and I recommend it</li>
            <li>The mascara its self worked great</li>

            <li>I love this Mascara!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It really does coat your lashes very good &amp; fans them out.</li>
            <li>I have owned quite a bit of mascara, and this is by far the best mascara I have ever used!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many mascara brands and this one is top notch.</li>
            <li>Lash\\&quot; are much better products by MAC.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a mascara that&#x27;s better than this one in the longest time.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Well, the product is okay -</li>
            <li>M.A.C is the best for long wear makeup and this item does just that.</li>
            <li>Removes easily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, I&#x27;ll use it, but I won&#x27;t buy it agian.</li>
            <li>The lid doesnt quite fit</li>
            <li>popped the wand part off and attached a Walmart one and filled it with Tar.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine, but I can&#x27;t honestly say that it&#x27;s in any way superior to the drugstore brands which cost considerably less.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and love it</li>
            <li>One thing that really got me good was that it didn&#x27;t bother my eyes which is a plus because my eyes are sensitive to everything.</li>
            <li>After the top broke off it lasted me 2 days before drying out completely.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>The shipping was also very fast.</li>
            <li>For the price, the Urban Decay in the purple tube works much better than this over-priced comparable.  </li>
            <li>and it stays looking fresh the whole day.</li>
            <li>Well first of all this product looked as if it was used.</li>
            <li>Some kind of imitation remade mascara.</li>
            <li>Minimal smudging after dancing up a sweat and still goes strong!</li>
            <li>The brush is also 4x-5x the size of the real one.  </li>
            <li>but I bleive it cost twice as much.</li>
            <li>I personally liked it, i have really small lashes and this made people notice them, I had gotten it cheaper at the store</li>
            <li>cause my friend had a discount, but the price is a lil too high.</li>
            <li>For a $50 mascara I expect a little more.</li>
            <li>Now I can have full and long lashes.</li>
            <li>I bought this already having used plenty of this exact same mascara.  </li>
            <li>For the first time I decided to fork over big bucks for mascara.</li>
            <li>Came off in what seemed like elastic clumps when removing, so it is clear that there is a formula that they are not succeeding in creating.</li>
            <li>For amazing lashes, apply a coat of \\&quot;Extended Play Gigablack Lash\\&quot; followed by the \\&quot;False</li>
            <li>I have short lashes and didn&#x27;t make to much of a diffrents with me.  </li>
            <li>The mascara lasted me about 2 months and may have lasted me longer if the top of the brush hadn&#x27;t broken off.</li>
            <li>I bought my first tube of this in the store &amp; its always kinda hard getting used to a different typre of mascara brush (this one is big w/ short bristles) &amp; at first I thought, I&#x27;m not going to keep this</li>

            <li> It gets all over your face and you&#x27;re unable to control it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a friend and I am so happy she did.  This is a great product and I recommend it</li>
            <li> M.A.C is the best for long wear makeup and this item does just that. Minimal smudging after dancing up a sweat and still goes strong!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many mascara brands and this one is top notch. No clumps and doesn&#x27;t get hard . Removes easily and I no longer have to use an eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> I bought this already having used plenty of this exact same mascara.  I received it in the mail promptly and when I went to use it something seemed off.  I thought it was me, so I went to use it and the mascara is sticky and gooey and doesnt go onto your lashes. It gets all over your face and you&#x27;re unable to control it.  This is not MAC Mascara. I am an avid Mac Cosmetics wearer and this is a fake.  The brush is also 4x-5x the size of the real one.  I had a left over one that just ran out and I compared them and they are not the same product.  The lid doesnt quite fit right so it wobbles when you screw it in, its like the popped the wand part off and attached a Walmart one and filled it with Tar.  It gets everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I contacted the selled they didnt apologize or anything their response to me asking if I received a fault product was &amp;#34;I understand&amp;#34;  They are trying to sell quality products and they are faulty.</li>
            <li> I think this is not original</li>
            <li> For the price, the Urban Decay in the purple tube works much better than this over-priced comparable.  It&#x27;s fine, I&#x27;ll use it, but I won&#x27;t buy it agian.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of the MAC brand, but this is not a good mascara.  Sorry, MAC. It makes your eyelashes look thin and spidery and leaves clumps all over the place. The spacing on the bristles of the brush is very inconvenient and makes it very easy to smudge the mascara. The \\&quot;False Lashes\\&quot; and \\&quot;Extended Play Gigablack Lash\\&quot; are much better products by MAC. For amazing lashes, apply a coat of \\&quot;Extended Play Gigablack Lash\\&quot; followed by the \\&quot;False Lashes\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I love this Mascara! I haven&#x27;t found a mascara that&#x27;s better than this one in the longest time. It doesn&#x27;t leave clumps, it elongates my eyelashes, it doesn&#x27;t bleed if your eyes tear and it stays looking fresh the whole day. One thing that really got me good was that it didn&#x27;t bother my eyes which is a plus because my eyes are sensitive to everything. Now I can have full and long lashes. The shipping was also very fast.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and love it</li>
            <li> I personally liked it, i have really small lashes and this made people notice them, I had gotten it cheaper at the store cause my friend had a discount, but the price is a lil too high. But i hope i can own this mascara again! Love it!</li>
            <li> I have short lashes and didn&#x27;t make to much of a diffrents with me.  This works with people who has longer lashes.</li>
            <li> The mascara its self worked great my lashes seemed longer and the brush lets you get all of your lashes. However it does flake and makes you look like a raccoon if you cry or sweat. The mascara lasted me about 2 months and may have lasted me longer if the top of the brush hadn&#x27;t broken off. My mascara stays in my makeup bag and don&#x27;t gets thrown around, micro cracks had started about week 2. After the top broke off it lasted me 2 days before drying out completely. For a $50 mascara I expect a little more. I won&#x27;t be buying this mascara again.</li>
            <li> NOT MAC mascara. Some kind of imitation remade mascara. Came off in what seemed like elastic clumps when removing, so it is clear that there is a formula that they are not succeeding in creating.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Helps make short eyelashes look long.</li>
            <li> I have owned quite a bit of mascara, and this is by far the best mascara I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> Well, the product is okay - I guess.  I took it from a friend who, heard it from a friend who thought it had been running around.  So, I&#x27;m not really a fan of running.</li>
            <li> Not a fan! Well first of all this product looked as if it was used. Secondly the fluid within the tube looked cry! and thick.</li>
            <li> looked used but still.works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> For the first time I decided to fork over big bucks for mascara. it&#x27;s fine, but I can&#x27;t honestly say that it&#x27;s in any way superior to the drugstore brands which cost considerably less.</li>
            <li> I bought my first tube of this in the store &amp; its always kinda hard getting used to a different typre of mascara brush (this one is big w/ short bristles) &amp; at first I thought, I&#x27;m not going to keep this but after about 4-5 days I got used to it &amp; this stuff is the bomb! It really does coat your lashes very good &amp; fans them out. I hope they never discontinue it. I was told Diorshow mascara is supposed to be very similar which I have not tried but I bleive it cost twice as much.</li>
