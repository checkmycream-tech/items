            <li> I smelled this at macys and I just decided that I wanted to have it, very masculine, long lasting and unique scent, a real winner! The price is very good, almost the 1/2 on the store! Arrived on time and well packed, also the  size 4.2 Oz is very convenient! So nothing else to say, can be bought with eyes closed!</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness what a exquisite and sensational piece of art. Smells great and women love to smell me when I uses it. The smell is not too loud but had a long lasting effect</li>
            <li> COST was CHEAPER than in the store and it was a larger size.  It was also delivered very quickly without having to pay for the extra cost.  I had this cologne b4 and it smells just the same.</li>
            <li> Black is not as good as my John Varvatos Artisan (http://www.amazon.com/VARVATOS-ARTISAN-John-Varvatos-SPRAY/dp/B004I6EYYU/), which is a much nicer fragrance that I get compliments on all the time.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Like no other.</li>
            <li> Great buy. Half the price of department stores. Big bottle.</li>
            <li> I loved it, great product, super fast shipping, item packed very carefully. I am also thinking about buying another one after this one!</li>
            <li> Received many complements on smell.  At the end of the day the fragrance scent was still present.&lt;br /&gt;Also purchased another John Varvatos fragrance.</li>
