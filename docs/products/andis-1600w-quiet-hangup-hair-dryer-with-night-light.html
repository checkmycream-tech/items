            <li>I saw this unit at a hotel we stayed at and thought the night light would be a good safety factor.</li>

            <li>Bright nightlight, light weight, excellent heat and air for such a compact hair dryer.  </li>

            <li>The night light is nice to have in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I came across this while staying at a Best Western.</li>
            <li>My wife found this model hair dryer at a motel and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very Satisfied</li>
            <li>ordered two more for my home</li>
            <li>Love this wall hung hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Works great, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I love not having a hair dryer sitting on the counter.</li>
            <li>The night light is almost too bright and there is no off/on switch for it, so I unplug the unit when I don&#x27;t want the light in.  </li>
            <li>Love Love Love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s right there and the night light feature is great also.</li>
            <li>The night light is bright and useful.</li>
            <li>Just make sure don&#x27;t drop on the floor, it might damage the fan easily.</li>
            <li>Not too big, good power, good handling, wonderfull on the wall.</li>
            <li>love the night light.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up valuable drawer space in my bathroom and guests have easy access.</li>
            <li>It was easy to install; I did it myself in about 3.5 minutes (really easy).  </li>
            <li>Easy to mount</li>
            <li>This works well and easy for me to hold over my head when drying my hair.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Where did you get this wonderful little hair dryer?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li>The night light is a neat feature and won&#x27;t create a distracting moon glow that will bleed into the bedroom.</li>
            <li>It hangs on the wall and has a built-in night light.  </li>
            <li>im not a fan of the light, so i shut off the outlet</li>
            <li>Very powerful.</li>
            <li>Mounting was easy as reviews have stated and it is very strong on high</li>
            <li>It has a nice little blueish-white nightlight built in, a pleasant plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for my guest bathroom but decided to put in the master</li>
            <li>I wanted an 1875 W dryer, however, this  hair dryer (1600 W) is very powerful and dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li>--i wonder if there is a way to disable that feature; its really bright white, and is always on.  </li>
            <li>kinda cool</li>
            <li>LOVE the bright night light, it is a soft white!</li>
            <li>This thing has lots of power , dries quickly</li>
            <li>Works well and dries hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful and dries hair fast!  </li>
            <li>On the bright side, this won&#x27;t burn your hair &amp; will dry without damaging your hair.  </li>
            <li>airflow is good, though it does not get hot (only warm), and gets pretty loud on setting 2.</li>
            <li>It is however, remarkably fast drying hair and the night light works well.</li>
            <li>Powerful hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>It does have two speeds, but both are quite powerful.</li>
            <li>This is a great design and a good hairdryer for people with short hair (like me), but I cannot recommend it for people with long hair, since it would take FOREVER to dry anything longer than shoulder-length</li>
            <li>It is only a 1600 watt hair dryer, but the warm turbo air dries your hair fast and doesn&#x27;t burn.  </li>
            <li>So convenient, seems to work just fine, had it for a month so far.</li>
            <li>A must for us and most likely others.</li>
            <li>I first came across this product while staying at the MGM in Vegas in 2000.</li>
            <li>so I would know exactly where to drill the pilot holes for the screws.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd one over the course of many years.  </li>
            <li>I think it is a bit higher pitched probably from the compact design.  </li>
            <li>I also love the little night light as it&#x27;s enough to light my way to the bathroom at night!</li>
            <li>It is light and dries almost as fast a her precious large heavy one.</li>
            <li>they last a good long while.</li>
            <li>they last about five years before the motor begins to slow and the heater overheats.that is pretty good for everyday use.the wall mount is durable and a great space saver.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very recommanded.</li>
            <li>But we had to return the product as it would not heat very well.  </li>
            <li>I would have given 5 stars if it would have fit the bracket to the same dryer it was replacing</li>
            <li>A must have, space saver and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>and it is very inconspicuous.</li>
            <li>but it really blows and drys my hair in no time.</li>
            <li>Everyone who uses it wants to get one.</li>
            <li>Hubby complains, because he wants to turn on the dryer, sweep it over his head about 6 times and be finished.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient to use.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>One caution, if you have long hair it may get easily tangled in the fan.</li>
            <li>Just as other people mentioned, the nightlight is over the top, but I just use the GFI buttons on the plug to shut it it off.</li>
            <li>I do wish it had a cool setting, but not worth delving into the process again to find one with a cool setting.  </li>
            <li>He could care less : )  </li>
            <li>Just remove the hair dryer and cord from the new one and place on the wall holder and plug in.</li>
            <li>small and compact haven&#x27;t used it yet just tested it but seems to work fine!</li>
            <li>It was easy to install- took less than 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t take up much wall real estate (a big plus).</li>
            <li>It easily snaps right back in without any trouble unlike you find with some cordless tool mounts.</li>
            <li>** After about 10 months of daily use it stopped blowing hot air.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this exact same hair dryer for 20 years!  </li>
            <li>Not only is it powerful, but it is small and easy to hold onto to.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a cool setting, so if that is a concern check out the other Andis dryers.  </li>
            <li>I like also that it has a little night light built into it....</li>
            <li>Now we don&#x27;t wake each other up in the middle of the night by turning on the normal light.</li>
            <li>I admit I had not seen that type of drywall anchor before and had to be extra careful not to knock them to far into the wall, but they worked just fine.</li>
            <li>Great small blower for home, its compact and slick design.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money which is more than I can say for most of the Chinese crap coming from overseas.</li>
            <li>I think it is a bit loud.  </li>
            <li>So much easier to have this regular item on my wall in the bathroom just like hotels!  </li>
            <li>Does well so far on high speed but has overheated and shut off twice on low speed.</li>
            <li>the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the dryer blowers load and strong and does dry the hair but the heat temperature is not as hot as other dryers with the same wattage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a powerful little device.  </li>
            <li>I love how this little guy packs a big punch in a little package.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This compares well, EXCEPT, it only gets about half as hot as the Sunbeam did.  </li>

            <li> This is my 3rd one over the course of many years.  </li>
            <li> I think it is a bit higher pitched probably from the compact design.  </li>
            <li> I also love the little night light as it&#x27;s enough to light my way to the bathroom at night!</li>
            <li> It is light and dries almost as fast a her precious large heavy one.</li>
            <li> they last a good long while.</li>
            <li> they last about five years before the motor begins to slow and the heater overheats.that is pretty good for everyday use.the wall mount is durable and a great space saver.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Very recommanded.</li>
            <li> But we had to return the product as it would not heat very well.  </li>
            <li> I would have given 5 stars if it would have fit the bracket to the same dryer it was replacing</li>
            <li> A must have, space saver and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> and it is very inconspicuous.</li>
            <li> but it really blows and drys my hair in no time.</li>
            <li> Everyone who uses it wants to get one.</li>
            <li> Hubby complains, because he wants to turn on the dryer, sweep it over his head about 6 times and be finished.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient to use.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> One caution, if you have long hair it may get easily tangled in the fan.</li>
            <li> Just as other people mentioned, the nightlight is over the top, but I just use the GFI buttons on the plug to shut it it off.</li>
            <li> I do wish it had a cool setting, but not worth delving into the process again to find one with a cool setting.  </li>
            <li> He could care less : )  </li>
            <li> Just remove the hair dryer and cord from the new one and place on the wall holder and plug in.</li>
            <li> small and compact haven&#x27;t used it yet just tested it but seems to work fine!</li>
            <li> It was easy to install- took less than 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t take up much wall real estate (a big plus).</li>
            <li> It easily snaps right back in without any trouble unlike you find with some cordless tool mounts.</li>
            <li> ** After about 10 months of daily use it stopped blowing hot air.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exact same hair dryer for 20 years!  </li>
            <li> Not only is it powerful, but it is small and easy to hold onto to.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a cool setting, so if that is a concern check out the other Andis dryers.  </li>
            <li> I like also that it has a little night light built into it....</li>
            <li> Now we don&#x27;t wake each other up in the middle of the night by turning on the normal light.</li>
            <li> I admit I had not seen that type of drywall anchor before and had to be extra careful not to knock them to far into the wall, but they worked just fine.</li>
            <li> Great small blower for home, its compact and slick design.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money which is more than I can say for most of the Chinese crap coming from overseas.</li>
            <li> I think it is a bit loud.  </li>
            <li> So much easier to have this regular item on my wall in the bathroom just like hotels!  </li>
            <li> Does well so far on high speed but has overheated and shut off twice on low speed.</li>
            <li> the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the dryer blowers load and strong and does dry the hair but the heat temperature is not as hot as other dryers with the same wattage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a powerful little device.  </li>
            <li> I love how this little guy packs a big punch in a little package.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This compares well, EXCEPT, it only gets about half as hot as the Sunbeam did.  </li>
            <li> My sister burned the motor up in my second dryer with her long hair.</li>
            <li> They are well made and do last a long time.</li>
            <li> This was an exact replacement for an older model that failed.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the night light stopped working after only 2 months.</li>
            <li> After having it only 2 weeks the low blow cycle blew...I&#x27;ll continue to use until the other blows</li>
            <li> This dryer is a little loud-</li>
            <li> little hair dryer was used daily by several people,guests and visiting relatives for three years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not quiet, but I don&#x27;t think it is louder than other hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We bought this to replace an old Sunbeam 1800 watt model that finally gave up the ghost after about 8 years of hard use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems to dry,</li>
            <li> but it probably should be a single speed.</li>
            <li> high low switch is somewhat prone to failure which has occurred at least twice in the last four years; otherwise this model is quite reliable.</li>
            <li> It arrived when expected.</li>
            <li> but you may be disappointed if the low speed is important to you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to get the dryer out everyday to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> And if Amazon were brick and mortar or had a phone number where I could contact them, then possibly we could have at least discussed, and/or they could have offered to replace the dryer with a working one.  </li>
            <li> I wrote the model number down and bought this one.</li>
            <li> Broke down after 6 months.</li>
            <li> when required has been in less than a week, no questions</li>
            <li> I had purchased one of these hairdryers previously and, after a few years it died and I needed to replace it.  </li>
            <li> My daughter likes it because it takes up little space in her drawer.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a man on a mission and wasted time frustrates him to no end.  </li>
            <li> I should have heeded the other negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> As the unit is installed in my bathroom, it works well for me but not easy to take anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Takes up very little space.  </li>
            <li> Compact design takes up very little room on the wall.</li>
            <li> Have owned 4 of the 30125 model units, I like the small size and heat ranges.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You use 2 screws to screw a small metal plate onto the wall in your desired hanging location, within reach of an electrical outlet.  </li>
            <li> I poured over reviews before buying a wall-dryer and want to post since I found them so confusing.  </li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t thick so the blow power isn&#x27;t an issue with me</li>
            <li> My husband and I got tired of having a blow dryer that either took up space on the counter or got pulled off the counter every time the drawer opened.  </li>
            <li> No need to pull the unit base from the wall and mar your paint or paper.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Worth the money which is more than I can say for most of the Chinese crap coming from overseas. Thanks</li>
            <li> Perfect for anyone. I use two of these in a rental condo with zero problems.</li>
            <li> Great small blower for home, its compact and slick design.  Just make sure don&#x27;t drop on the floor, it might damage the fan easily.</li>
            <li> This thing has lots of power , dries quickly and we love the night lite</li>
            <li> Does well so far on high speed but has overheated and shut off twice on low speed. Mounting was easy as reviews have stated and it is very strong on high but it probably should be a single speed. The night light is nice to have in the bathroom. Overall I&#x27;m happy with it but you may be disappointed if the low speed is important to you.</li>
            <li> Excellent product night light turns on or off</li>
            <li> I have had an Andis 30125 for over 10 years, I like they hang up out of the way and the power they have.  The night light is bright and useful.</li>
            <li> I came across this while staying at a Best Western. It impressed me there immediately. I love how this little guy packs a big punch in a little package. I wanted something that isn&#x27;t monstrous and a labor to hold up to use. Also it doesn&#x27;t take up much wall real estate (a big plus). The night light is a neat feature and won&#x27;t create a distracting moon glow that will bleed into the bedroom. It also doesn&#x27;t demand any quirky requirement to place it back in its mount. It easily snaps right back in without any trouble unlike you find with some cordless tool mounts.</li>
            <li> Takes up very little space.  Has a nightlight.  Very powerful.</li>
            <li> My wife found this model hair dryer at a motel and fell in love with it. I wrote the model number down and bought this one. It has a nice hang-up bracket, a built-in night light, moves a surprising amount of air and works great.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is the best!  It hangs on the wall and has a built-in night light.  It is only a 1600 watt hair dryer, but the warm turbo air dries your hair fast and doesn&#x27;t burn.  I love it!  If you have ever tried one in a hotel and liked it, then this is the hair dryer for you!</li>
            <li> Excellent item, already bought one. Not too big, good power, good handling, wonderfull on the wall. Very good item. Very recommanded.</li>
            <li> The best wall mounted dryer I&#x27;ve found!  I also love the little night light as it&#x27;s enough to light my way to the bathroom at night!</li>
            <li> This is the only hair dryer I use at home.  It&#x27;s the best.  I see that some motels are now installing them in the bathrooms.  It hangs great and makes access so easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Satisfied</li>
            <li> Wanted this dryer to replace one I bought a year or so ago that broke. I wanted an 1875 W dryer, however, this  hair dryer (1600 W) is very powerful and dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li> We liked the size and fan speed of the hair dryer.  It mounted on the wall perfectly.  But we had to return the product as it would not heat very well.  A must for us and most likely others.</li>
            <li> Love the hair dryer- wonderful - easy to install and powerful and convenient in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it and give it rave reviews</li>
            <li> I redid my bath. Hung this on the medicine chest. love the night light. Great performace. THE BEST BLOWER EVER!  MAX</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for home use three years ago.  Yesterday morning after towel drying my hair, I started the dryer and a blade broke off in the turbo fan not unlike a jet engine blowing up.  There were no fragments flying around the room, it simply locked up with unmistakable fumes of wire insulation roasting. The power surge button did it&#x27;s job well by instantly shutting off.&lt;br /&gt;This little hair dryer was used daily by several people,guests and visiting relatives for three years.&lt;br /&gt;Visitors constantly remark: \\&quot;Where did you get this wonderful little hair dryer?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two more for my home this morning.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not quiet.  The thing does \\&quot;scream.\\&quot;  It is however, remarkably fast drying hair and the night light works well.</li>
            <li> great hair dryer. I would have given 5 stars if it would have fit the bracket to the same dryer it was replacing</li>
            <li> Great value.  Works well and dries hair quickly.  I wish I had bought this for the Master bath as well as the guest bath.</li>
            <li> Have owned 4 of the 30125 model units, I like the small size and heat ranges.&lt;br /&gt;Andis support (unit replacement )when required has been in less than a week, no questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;The high low switch is somewhat prone to failure which has occurred at least twice in the last four years; otherwise this model is quite reliable.</li>
            <li> Broke down after 6 months. A replacement was sent after  I spent $7.00 to return the old one.&lt;br /&gt;Guess what?? Second one burned out after 1 month. Waiting for number 3. They will pay for the&lt;br /&gt;return this third time. Always keep your receipts!</li>
            <li> Bright nightlight, light weight, excellent heat and air for such a compact hair dryer.  A must have, space saver and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and dries hair fast!  I purchased this for my mom and she absolutely loves it.  The wall mount is very handy so it doesn&#x27;t need rolled up every day like traditional ones.</li>
            <li> ***Update*** After about 10 months of daily use it stopped blowing hot air.    I poured over reviews before buying a wall-dryer and want to post since I found them so confusing.  This dryer is a little loud- but it&#x27;s a hair dryer.  The night light isn&#x27;t too bright.  If you think it is close the door before bed.  It was easy to install- took less than 5 minutes.  I do wish it had a cool setting, but not worth delving into the process again to find one with a cool setting.  Happy with my choice.</li>
            <li> My husband and I got tired of having a blow dryer that either took up space on the counter or got pulled off the counter every time the drawer opened.  I ordered this and he mounted it on the wall under a towel rack.  We use the dryer and then place it back and it is very inconspicuous.</li>
            <li> Everything is as says... the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the dryer blowers load and strong and does dry the hair but the heat temperature is not as hot as other dryers with the same wattage.</li>
            <li> Powerful hairdryer.  It doesn&#x27;t have a cool setting, so if that is a concern check out the other Andis dryers.  LOVE the bright night light, it is a soft white!</li>
            <li> Air volume is wimpy. Returned it.</li>
            <li> Love this wall hung hair dryer.  Not only is it powerful, but it is small and easy to hold onto to.  I have a tiny bathroom with no storage so a hair dryer hung on the wall is a plus.  I can&#x27;t imagine living without this now.  Love the nightlight too!</li>
            <li> Works great, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my guest bathroom but decided to put in the master and I am so glad I did. I don&#x27;t have to get the dryer out everyday to dry my hair. It&#x27;s right there and the night light feature is great also. My hair isn&#x27;t thick so the blow power isn&#x27;t an issue with me but it really blows and drys my hair in no time. I&#x27;m thinking about getting another one for our guest bath and for a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer. I first came across this product while staying at the MGM in Vegas in 2000. Twelve years later, I just ordered my 3rd one. The best part is that it&#x27;s right there on the wall when needed. It doesn&#x27;t take up valuable drawer space in my bathroom and guests have easy access. Everyone who uses it wants to get one. One caution, if you have long hair it may get easily tangled in the fan. My sister burned the motor up in my second dryer with her long hair. Great for guys. I&#x27;m buying my son one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have to say this hair dryer is a really good product. It arrived when expected. I was very pleased that it contained a template so I would know exactly where to drill the pilot holes for the screws. I admit I had not seen that type of drywall anchor before and had to be extra careful not to knock them to far into the wall, but they worked just fine. My husband and I have been using the dryer for a couple weeks now. Just as other people mentioned, the nightlight is over the top, but I just use the GFI buttons on the plug to shut it it off. I love not having a hair dryer sitting on the counter. The only reason I removed one star is I wish the dryer had lower speed. It does have two speeds, but both are quite powerful. I would not hesitate to order again and probably will for the guest bathroom.</li>
            <li> This is a great design and a good hairdryer for people with short hair (like me), but I cannot recommend it for people with long hair, since it would take FOREVER to dry anything longer than shoulder-length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We bought this to replace an old Sunbeam 1800 watt model that finally gave up the ghost after about 8 years of hard use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This compares well, EXCEPT, it only gets about half as hot as the Sunbeam did.  On the bright side, this won&#x27;t burn your hair &amp; will dry without damaging your hair.  Personally, I like it.  Hubby complains, because he wants to turn on the dryer, sweep it over his head about 6 times and be finished.  No go.  What used to take him a minute now takes 3.  But I think his hair looks healthier.  He could care less : )  He&#x27;s a man on a mission and wasted time frustrates him to no end.  Patience is a virtue, I say, as he rolls his eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has two speeds (I use low).  It was easy to install; I did it myself in about 3.5 minutes (really easy).  You use 2 screws to screw a small metal plate onto the wall in your desired hanging location, within reach of an electrical outlet.  Then just clip the dryer body onto the plate, plug in, and DONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design&#x27;s great, because the dryer can continue to cool, even after you \\&quot;hang it up,\\&quot; so you don&#x27;t have to pre-cool it or worry about it overheating in its stand.  It has a nice little blueish-white nightlight built in, a pleasant plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again?  Absolutely.  Do I recommend it?  Wholeheartedly for short haircuts.  I like it!</li>
            <li> WALL MOUNTED HAIR DRYER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had one before and liked it. Also I used one like it in a motel.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Very convenient to use.  Just like in hotels.  Compact design takes up very little room on the wall.</li>
            <li> My wife was extremely happy finding this blow dryer,works great</li>
            <li> small and compact haven&#x27;t used it yet just tested it but seems to work fine!</li>
            <li> My wife like the power and size.  I think it is a bit loud.  Easy to mount and it doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> I had purchased one of these hairdryers previously and, after a few years it died and I needed to replace it.  It&#x27;s a powerful little device.  I specifically wanted on that I could mount to the bathroom cabinet for ease of use.  I would definitely recommend this product...good product and good value.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the wall mounted hair dryer---Night light is also very nice</li>
            <li> The wife saw this on vacation at a hotel we stayed at and had to get on. She loves it so I am happy.</li>
            <li> This is very handy, and by being mounted on the wall it is out of the way when not in use and I don&#x27;t have to be concerned with tangled electrical cord in drawer.  The night light is quite bright, but not too bright.  Good purchase.</li>
            <li> This works well and easy for me to hold over my head when drying my hair.  The night light is almost too bright and there is no off/on switch for it, so I unplug the unit when I don&#x27;t want the light in.  If I needed a dryer for the gym or RV, I would choose a model with the dryer and holder as separate units so I could pack only the dryer alone.  As the unit is installed in my bathroom, it works well for me but not easy to take anywhere else.</li>
            <li> What a great item.  So much easier to have this regular item on my wall in the bathroom just like hotels!  Works great and has the ideal settings for my needs.</li>
            <li> Second one I have , works grate .</li>
            <li> My daughter likes it because it takes up little space in her drawer.  It is light and dries almost as fast a her precious large heavy one.</li>
            <li> Excellent portable hair dryer with plenty of power.</li>
            <li> loved it. broke after a year</li>
            <li> So convenient, seems to work just fine, had it for a month so far. Easy to install and looks great too.</li>
            <li> I saw this unit at a hotel we stayed at and thought the night light would be a good safety factor. Unfortunately the night light stopped working after only 2 months. I will appreciate hearing back form the vendor as to how they can correct this.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this hair dryer.  This is my 3rd one over the course of many years.  I not only use in my home but in my RV.  Great power and the size is just right .  Hangs on wall and that is a plus because it&#x27;s at you fingertips when needed.  This one just purchased replace one I have had for 10 years........they last a good long while. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This was an exact replacement for an older model that failed.  Just what the wife wanted.  Hope it outlasts us both.</li>
            <li> This thing is great.  I mounted it in our bathroom and my wife quit using her hair dryer at her make-up station and starting using this one instead.  the nightlight is a nice bonus feature.  There are no heat settings.  The default heat setting I would say is medium.  It is not quiet, but I don&#x27;t think it is louder than other hair dryers.  I think it is a bit higher pitched probably from the compact design.  Nothing is removable so I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll be needing to replace any parts.  I would buy another one if I needed one.</li>
            <li> this is the third andis hair dryer we have had. they last about five years before the motor begins to slow and the heater overheats.that is pretty good for everyday use.the wall mount is durable and a great space saver.</li>
            <li> compact size and mount makes is good. airflow is good, though it does not get hot (only warm), and gets pretty loud on setting 2. im not a fan of the light, so i shut off the outlet--i wonder if there is a way to disable that feature; its really bright white, and is always on.  update: stopped working on 11/10/2016--switch defective, no longer turns off, and both speeds are 2.</li>
            <li> Vender delivered by promised date and dryer works great. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this band of hair dryers of 15 years now. They are well made and do last a long time. I&#x27;m on my third one. They are very easy to replace. Just remove the hair dryer and cord from the new one and place on the wall holder and plug in. No need to pull the unit base from the wall and mar your paint or paper.</li>
            <li> Purchased in February 2014 and quit working in November 2014.  I should have heeded the other negative reviews.  And if Amazon were brick and mortar or had a phone number where I could contact them, then possibly we could have at least discussed, and/or they could have offered to replace the dryer with a working one.  It only worked for nine months; come on....</li>
            <li> After having it only 2 weeks the low blow cycle blew...I&#x27;ll continue to use until the other blows but I won&#x27;t buy another.</li>
            <li> Put this on the kids wall in their bathroom.  Seems to dry, hangup and quality is good.  I like also that it has a little night light built into it.... kinda cool</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exact same hair dryer for 20 years!  There&#x27;s a reason I keep buying it even though it seems to die after 4-5 yrs of constant use.  The nightlight is perfect for the master bath.  Now we don&#x27;t wake each other up in the middle of the night by turning on the normal light.</li>
