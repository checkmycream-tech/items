    <ol>
            <li> Did not receive what was pictured.</li>
            <li> The purple gem is slightly darker than in the picture, but other than that they look great. All the gems were intact and they are fine. The only thing is it arrived a day late even though I have prime shipping and it was gaurenteed. Whatever. All in all I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> They look ok to me.  Bought them as a stocking stuffer item.</li>
            <li> They only gave me two of the colors pictured. The other colors were ugly</li>
            <li> These are great for everyday wear! They don&#x27;t turn my skin green at all and they&#x27;re cute and shiny!</li>
            <li> They were cheap. One was already broken.</li>
            <li> Great belly rings, but the pink one showed up a little messed up. The metal where the large stone sits isn&#x27;t smooth and is very rough. It doesn&#x27;t look nice so I won&#x27;t wear it.</li>
            <li> The balls didn&#x27;t come off the bar</li>
            <li> Cute jewelry. No problems at all.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this for the price.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, I&#x27;m kind of hesitant about actaully putting it on. The &amp;#34;surgical steel&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t look how it appears in this picture. Most of the gems are lose and I got a blue double gem belly ring when I was supposed to get a purple.</li>
            <li> Items arrived in just a plastic bag. The crystals on 2 out of 5 were loose and just floating around in the plastic bag.  The crystals were dull not sparkly at all. I paid for over nite shipping and was completely disappointed when the order arrived. Not worth sending it back...1st I didn&#x27;t want to it (that&#x27;s why I paid extra for shipping) &amp; 2nd it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble to hopefully received the items nor damaged. Completely unsatisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Very nice but not the same colors as the picture.</li>
            <li> So cute, my step daughter will live them. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t look like picture shown, that&#x27;s for sure. Crystals are a lot smaller and duller. 2 of mine have very loose crystals at the bottom as well.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t unscrew the tops.  They were glued tight!</li>
            <li> These were a very decent quality for the price. I bought 2 sets and use the ends on a different, straight barbell. They look great and are holding up nicely.</li>
            <li> Some of the gems were loose, very annoyed.</li>
            <li> Stones look very cheap.</li>
            <li> good price came as expected</li>
            <li> Buying and shipping and the whole thing was great,plan on using it more</li>
            <li> I accidentally threw my belly ring away so I needed a replacement. This ring is slightly larger than my original and what I expected but it is good quality and fits well.  I&#x27;ve only used the clear jeweled one so far but the colored ones are pretty and I just might use them eventually.</li>
            <li> Received on time and nice looking. Really good quality</li>
            <li> Thought it was the colors as rhe picture shown but they are not don&#x27;t really like rhe colors at all ordered this lot cause of the colors shown about above</li>
            <li> The purple and pink gems are lighter than in the picture and I also did not recieve a blue ring but instead I got a green one ...arrived earlier then expected shipping date</li>
            <li> One of the stones was missing.  Pour quality checking.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t reserve the second one, instead it was green cute! But not what I paid for.</li>
            <li> 3 out of 6 of the rhinestones are not fully secure. You can hear the gem slightly rattle.  Hasn&#x27;t fallen out yet but what do you want for $5</li>
    </ol>
