            <li> Great to spray in wet hair to get tangles out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Fast Fix since it was in the different packaging, (approx. 10 years). It is a great leave in conditioner. I wish they would have left the original fragrance. It was awesome. Now, eh.</li>
            <li> i was madly in love with the catwalk fast fixx when it was in the blue bottle.  i had been using it for the past 6 years.  they said it&#x27;s the original formula, but it&#x27;s not. it smells terrible now.  i don&#x27;t even want to put this product in my hair.  just a nasty smell.  i&#x27;m already plotting how to give away the two bottles i bought of it so i&#x27;m not completely wasting my money.</li>
            <li> Awesome styling product!!</li>

            <li> Light but still holds hair in humidity</li>
            <li> When I switched to this and it wasn&#x27;t in the blue bottle, I was a little concerned.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as sticky as it used to be.  I will keep using it but I might have to venture out for a new TIGI product nect time.  I still ove their products, just seems that this one isn&#x27;t this same as it used to be.</li>

            <li> Love this product and have used for years.  I use in place of rinse out conditioner...perfect for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Ive used this product for years...they changed it, it no longer works as a leave-inconditoner for me and the smell is somewhat dirty/musky smelling.  Tossing it and going to find another brand.  Too bad, in the blue bottle is was wonderful.  This actually makes my hair more tangled!</li>
            <li> Excellent spray... works wonderfully. Thank you for the quick arrival.</li>

            <li> This product is a godsend for my fine yet curly hair. Takes away the frizz and leaves me with beautiful ringlet curls. Nourishes my hair and is light weight. I was hoping that when they changed the packaging that they didn&#x27;t change the original Fast Fixx formula and thankfully they didn&#x27;t. Wonderful product!!</li>
