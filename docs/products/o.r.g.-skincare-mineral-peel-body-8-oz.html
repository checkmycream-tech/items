            <li>Amazing stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>this is an amazing product, and I need to investigate why.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of rubbery.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li>Keeps my toes and ankles nice looking between pedicures.  </li>
            <li>I notice my skin coming off in nice circles.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s Amazing worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product after seeing all of the great reviews, and watching the tutorial videos online.</li>
            <li>This is my first time to try this product and glad to feel it does it job perfectly .</li>
            <li>And every time i use this , my skin becomes bright and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love love love it!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!</li>
            <li>I wish I could see better results on my face though.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a striking change in the way their skin can look and feel.   </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to apply it to my husband&#x27;s feet while he sleeps. :)</li>
            <li>This stuff is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>You might be better off getting a salt or sugar scrub at your favorite spa - you pay a bit more</li>
            <li>I love the feel of my skin after I use it.</li>
            <li>Make sure to mosturize after every use.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>I love using this skincare product and amazed at how well it works.  </li>
            <li>For one, the body version was cheaper and also offered more product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>First all, I received it within a timely fashion and it&#x27;s expectancy is good</li>
            <li>A bit more acidic and strong.</li>
            <li>Easy to spray and smells OK</li>
            <li>I tried it on my face, but it is too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>It also smells nice--not too strong.</li>
            <li>This would cost a whole lot more in a spa!</li>
            <li>The skin feels so smooth and silky after using it.  </li>
            <li>process was a breeze and the customer service was great since I was worried that it was the same product as the one from the trade show.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel smooth and exfoliated like when I use my body scrubs.</li>
            <li>And it leaves my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin so smooth</li>
            <li>also used on face, and helps make my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and radiant after.</li>
            <li>Made my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>My face now is smooth like a babies bottom.</li>
            <li>I think St. ives apricot walnut scrubw is more abrasive, but does a better job at exfoliating for a much cheaper price, than this $30 product.</li>
            <li>I saw so many videos and read many reviews on the product that I really wanted to see what was it about.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It makes me feel so clean, my skin is insanely soft after I rinse with warm water, and my skin reacts fine to it!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure this stuff doesn&#x27;t do what it says.</li>
            <li>and my face felt really fresh after using this!</li>
            <li>Information was all confirmed and shipment arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll come out clean and pampered.</li>
            <li>Non abrasive and smells clean too.</li>
            <li>So, you think you&#x27;re skin is clean - hah- think again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for scrubbing off dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li>Skin must be completely clean.</li>
            <li>After using it 2 times I can say I&#x27;m clean now.</li>
            <li>I feel special ....</li>
            <li>So now he got really smooth soft hands!! :)</li>
            <li>I was looking for a full body chemical peel.</li>
            <li>I love it really works</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so much smoother. :-)</li>
            <li>I love this product so much my skin peels really easy so this products helps so much!</li>
            <li>(I do remember the retailer mentioning something about an Amazon release) , guess I was lucky and fell upon it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recccomend it :)</li>
            <li>mo2N5NDBD59UWMO]]This product really works as a skin exfoliator/peel, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it tends to get dry and flaky because I took good care of my face but not my limbs.</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;ll start out by telling you I have very, very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Both are very hard to deal with and this is helping a great deal with my flare ups as well as maintaining clearer skin!</li>
            <li>Amazing and addictive, you&#x27;ll want to spray it everywhere.</li>
            <li>(And I was brave and used this on my face, it wasn&#x27;t harsh at all</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>My skin got so soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li>Aside from the fact that it&#x27;s slightly gross to rub off one&#x27;s own skin, it needs to be done.</li>
            <li>I also use a prescription retinol, but wait another 45 minutes or so after applying lotion to apply the retinol, so that the retinol will not irritate freshly exfoliated skin.</li>
            <li>Gets all the dead skin off and leaves your skin bright and clean user it on my face neck and chest</li>
            <li>Price was right and this has made a difference in the way I feel.   </li>
            <li>This is the best exfolliant, next to going to a Korean spa and getting scrubbed down.  </li>
            <li>While it does make my skin feel super soft and smooth</li>
            <li>Great customer service when I had a few questions about the product and fast shipping when I bought it.</li>
            <li>with regular pedicures and your own home remedies, it&#x27;s tough to get your feet in beautiful shape and remove all the callouses, etc.  </li>
            <li>My face is smooth and feels like my pores are 100% clear!</li>
            <li>Amazing how it gets rid of dry skin so fast!</li>
            <li>Still using it and will have more feedback later.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first bottle</li>
            <li>first ordered the O.R.G. Body Peel after reading and article about over-the-counter home peels.  </li>
            <li>I wanted my boyfriend to be able to exfoliate my back without the moans and groans of having to get off the couch.</li>
            <li>While he will on occasion work on my back, more often he is using the stuff with a mirror on his face.</li>
            <li>I love it, would buy it again definitely</li>
            <li>I also use it on my face since I did not want to buy the face spray without trying out the product first.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a bit pricey.</li>
            <li>but I believe it is healthy and this product definitely does the job in three seconds, literally.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m pretty sure the makers of this product never claimed that, only the users.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it promises to do.</li>
            <li>This product is not fake, it does exactly what it describes.  </li>
            <li>My first use</li>
            <li>I have used the &#x27;face&#x27; version of this, but decided to try the body version because there is more product for the same price.</li>
            <li>, Even thought I have no job I will still buy this product, love it until the last drop.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best product I&#x27;ve used to soften up my rough heels.</li>
            <li>item is very high quality and shipped very fast</li>
            <li>This leaves my skin so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Make sure you do not let the product dry on your skin first.</li>
            <li>the way, my skin is super sensitive.</li>
            <li>It works as promised and after washing it off, my skin feels super soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fascinating to see all of your dead skin coming off and revealing new skin.</li>
            <li>My face feels so smooth to the touch after a couple days of use, definitely can feel the dirt and years of makeup use being cleaned away as I use the product.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it as much as I should</li>
            <li>I really think it&#x27;s the product.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really see any immediate results.  </li>
            <li>Leave on for 2 minutes and gently run your fingers all over yours</li>
            <li>so it really helps breakouts on my chest.</li>
            <li>My skin was left smooth, glowing, and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>While I do really like this product I probably won&#x27;t be buying it again based on price.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and the product is well protected.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t care for it much</li>
            <li>I then rinse and use a gentle wash to wash any area exfoliated and immediately apply lotion.</li>
            <li>Not a lot of dead skin comes off but cleaned face nicely.  </li>
            <li>Afterwards your skin feels so supple &amp; soft!!!</li>
            <li>I put it on my legs, scrub it lightly with a dry wash cloth, take a shower, and then put oil on my legs.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps on doing a decent job as what it states- cleans well when done periodically.</li>
            <li>Makes skin so smooth and even, feels like I just spent hours at the spa.</li>
            <li>I really like it so far.</li>
            <li>It really helps with keeping skin soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big purchaser of organic foods and products, and will pay more to get products that are actually organic, so I am fairly educated on what an organic product really is and when products try to make exaggerated claims on their organic creds.  </li>
            <li>Then my complexion has a fresh new glow because of all the new younger skin that is now appearing.  </li>
            <li>I mainly purchased it to clear the acne scarring on my checks and chin.</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>I have very very sensitive hands.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and I can use this every day to exfoliate without seeing any chemical burns/redness.</li>
            <li>Nothing special here, not much exfoliation happening.</li>
            <li>And this organic mineral peel can dry my hands so much!!</li>
            <li>I needed help with acne and it actually helped a little, but i think this product is more so to help with the texture of your skin.</li>
            <li>Using 3 times a week to keep my face clear from all the build up from exercise.</li>
            <li>If you do not have sensitive skin on your face, it may work for you.  </li>
            <li>It is so natural that it does not even irritate my skin even though I may use it 3 times a week.</li>
            <li>had purchased an exfoliator (also natural) before Organic Mineral Peel.</li>
            <li>Immediately I sprayed the mineral peel on areas of my face that were discolored from acne, and the same results happpened when I rubbed my fingers gently, massaging the areas.  </li>
            <li>It takes so little time compared to other masks and scrubs and leaves my skin looking smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t like trying new things on it, but I heard about this brand from a friend</li>
            <li>Being big on exfolliation, it comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly doubt that is my actual skin being rubbed off.</li>
            <li>Delicate enough to be used on the face it really makes the skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very watery and you only use a tiny bit, so it lasts forever!  </li>
            <li>because I come out of the shower with my skin feeling soft and smooth, but because I can actually feel and see the dead skin crumbling off!  </li>
            <li>generally get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m completely blown away and will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I don&#x27;t care for this product though, honestly there is nothing wrong with it.</li>
            <li>This is so awesome, I had a very bad skin burn from the California sun and after my face healed i then had flakey peeling skin.</li>
            <li>The only product that helped clear up my back, shoulders, and chest area.</li>
            <li>Wait about 15 minutes for my bathroom/skin to dry completely, then use this product.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Amazing stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> this is an amazing product, and I need to investigate why.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of rubbery.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li> Keeps my toes and ankles nice looking between pedicures.  </li>
            <li> I notice my skin coming off in nice circles.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Amazing worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product after seeing all of the great reviews, and watching the tutorial videos online.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to try this product and glad to feel it does it job perfectly .</li>
            <li> And every time i use this , my skin becomes bright and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love love love it!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> I wish I could see better results on my face though.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a striking change in the way their skin can look and feel.   </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to apply it to my husband&#x27;s feet while he sleeps. :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous!  </li>
            <li> You might be better off getting a salt or sugar scrub at your favorite spa - you pay a bit more</li>
            <li> I love the feel of my skin after I use it.</li>
            <li> Make sure to mosturize after every use.</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> I love using this skincare product and amazed at how well it works.  </li>
            <li> For one, the body version was cheaper and also offered more product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Its ok.</li>
            <li> First all, I received it within a timely fashion and it&#x27;s expectancy is good</li>
            <li> A bit more acidic and strong.</li>
            <li> Easy to spray and smells OK</li>
            <li> I tried it on my face, but it is too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> It also smells nice--not too strong.</li>
            <li> This would cost a whole lot more in a spa!</li>
            <li> The skin feels so smooth and silky after using it.  </li>
            <li> process was a breeze and the customer service was great since I was worried that it was the same product as the one from the trade show.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel smooth and exfoliated like when I use my body scrubs.</li>
            <li> And it leaves my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin so smooth</li>
            <li> also used on face, and helps make my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and radiant after.</li>
            <li> Made my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> My face now is smooth like a babies bottom.</li>
            <li> I think St. ives apricot walnut scrubw is more abrasive, but does a better job at exfoliating for a much cheaper price, than this $30 product.</li>
            <li> I saw so many videos and read many reviews on the product that I really wanted to see what was it about.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It makes me feel so clean, my skin is insanely soft after I rinse with warm water, and my skin reacts fine to it!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure this stuff doesn&#x27;t do what it says.</li>
            <li> and my face felt really fresh after using this!</li>
            <li> Information was all confirmed and shipment arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll come out clean and pampered.</li>
            <li> Non abrasive and smells clean too.</li>
            <li> So, you think you&#x27;re skin is clean - hah- think again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for scrubbing off dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> Skin must be completely clean.</li>
            <li> After using it 2 times I can say I&#x27;m clean now.</li>
            <li> I feel special ....</li>
            <li> So now he got really smooth soft hands!! :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a full body chemical peel.</li>
            <li> I love it really works</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so much smoother. :-)</li>
            <li> I love this product so much my skin peels really easy so this products helps so much!</li>
            <li> (I do remember the retailer mentioning something about an Amazon release) , guess I was lucky and fell upon it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recccomend it :)</li>
            <li> mo2N5NDBD59UWMO]]This product really works as a skin exfoliator/peel, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it tends to get dry and flaky because I took good care of my face but not my limbs.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ll start out by telling you I have very, very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Both are very hard to deal with and this is helping a great deal with my flare ups as well as maintaining clearer skin!</li>
            <li> Amazing and addictive, you&#x27;ll want to spray it everywhere.</li>
            <li> (And I was brave and used this on my face, it wasn&#x27;t harsh at all</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> My skin got so soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li> Aside from the fact that it&#x27;s slightly gross to rub off one&#x27;s own skin, it needs to be done.</li>
            <li> I also use a prescription retinol, but wait another 45 minutes or so after applying lotion to apply the retinol, so that the retinol will not irritate freshly exfoliated skin.</li>
            <li> Gets all the dead skin off and leaves your skin bright and clean user it on my face neck and chest</li>
            <li> Price was right and this has made a difference in the way I feel.   </li>
            <li> This is the best exfolliant, next to going to a Korean spa and getting scrubbed down.  </li>
            <li> While it does make my skin feel super soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Great customer service when I had a few questions about the product and fast shipping when I bought it.</li>
            <li> with regular pedicures and your own home remedies, it&#x27;s tough to get your feet in beautiful shape and remove all the callouses, etc.  </li>
            <li> My face is smooth and feels like my pores are 100% clear!</li>
            <li> Amazing how it gets rid of dry skin so fast!</li>
            <li> Still using it and will have more feedback later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first bottle</li>
            <li> first ordered the O.R.G. Body Peel after reading and article about over-the-counter home peels.  </li>
            <li> I wanted my boyfriend to be able to exfoliate my back without the moans and groans of having to get off the couch.</li>
            <li> While he will on occasion work on my back, more often he is using the stuff with a mirror on his face.</li>
            <li> I love it, would buy it again definitely</li>
            <li> I also use it on my face since I did not want to buy the face spray without trying out the product first.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> but I believe it is healthy and this product definitely does the job in three seconds, literally.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m pretty sure the makers of this product never claimed that, only the users.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it promises to do.</li>
            <li> This product is not fake, it does exactly what it describes.  </li>
            <li> My first use</li>
            <li> I have used the &#x27;face&#x27; version of this, but decided to try the body version because there is more product for the same price.</li>
            <li> , Even thought I have no job I will still buy this product, love it until the last drop.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best product I&#x27;ve used to soften up my rough heels.</li>
            <li> item is very high quality and shipped very fast</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Make sure you do not let the product dry on your skin first.</li>
            <li> the way, my skin is super sensitive.</li>
            <li> It works as promised and after washing it off, my skin feels super soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fascinating to see all of your dead skin coming off and revealing new skin.</li>
            <li> My face feels so smooth to the touch after a couple days of use, definitely can feel the dirt and years of makeup use being cleaned away as I use the product.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it as much as I should</li>
            <li> I really think it&#x27;s the product.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really see any immediate results.  </li>
            <li> Leave on for 2 minutes and gently run your fingers all over yours</li>
            <li> so it really helps breakouts on my chest.</li>
            <li> My skin was left smooth, glowing, and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> While I do really like this product I probably won&#x27;t be buying it again based on price.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and the product is well protected.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for it much</li>
            <li> I then rinse and use a gentle wash to wash any area exfoliated and immediately apply lotion.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of dead skin comes off but cleaned face nicely.  </li>
            <li> Afterwards your skin feels so supple &amp; soft!!!</li>
            <li> I put it on my legs, scrub it lightly with a dry wash cloth, take a shower, and then put oil on my legs.  </li>
            <li> and it keeps on doing a decent job as what it states- cleans well when done periodically.</li>
            <li> Makes skin so smooth and even, feels like I just spent hours at the spa.</li>
            <li> I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> It really helps with keeping skin soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big purchaser of organic foods and products, and will pay more to get products that are actually organic, so I am fairly educated on what an organic product really is and when products try to make exaggerated claims on their organic creds.  </li>
            <li> Then my complexion has a fresh new glow because of all the new younger skin that is now appearing.  </li>
            <li> I mainly purchased it to clear the acne scarring on my checks and chin.</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> I have very very sensitive hands.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and I can use this every day to exfoliate without seeing any chemical burns/redness.</li>
            <li> Nothing special here, not much exfoliation happening.</li>
            <li> And this organic mineral peel can dry my hands so much!!</li>
            <li> I needed help with acne and it actually helped a little, but i think this product is more so to help with the texture of your skin.</li>
            <li> Using 3 times a week to keep my face clear from all the build up from exercise.</li>
            <li> If you do not have sensitive skin on your face, it may work for you.  </li>
            <li> It is so natural that it does not even irritate my skin even though I may use it 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> had purchased an exfoliator (also natural) before Organic Mineral Peel.</li>
            <li> Immediately I sprayed the mineral peel on areas of my face that were discolored from acne, and the same results happpened when I rubbed my fingers gently, massaging the areas.  </li>
            <li> It takes so little time compared to other masks and scrubs and leaves my skin looking smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t like trying new things on it, but I heard about this brand from a friend</li>
            <li> Being big on exfolliation, it comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly doubt that is my actual skin being rubbed off.</li>
            <li> Delicate enough to be used on the face it really makes the skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very watery and you only use a tiny bit, so it lasts forever!  </li>
            <li> because I come out of the shower with my skin feeling soft and smooth, but because I can actually feel and see the dead skin crumbling off!  </li>
            <li> generally get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m completely blown away and will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I don&#x27;t care for this product though, honestly there is nothing wrong with it.</li>
            <li> This is so awesome, I had a very bad skin burn from the California sun and after my face healed i then had flakey peeling skin.</li>
            <li> The only product that helped clear up my back, shoulders, and chest area.</li>
            <li> Wait about 15 minutes for my bathroom/skin to dry completely, then use this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is hard to exfoliate, but this product really helps!</li>
            <li> Showed them to a couple of my friends and they all agreed that this was a product that they had never really seen before but could definitely use.  </li>
            <li> My facial pores closed almost immediately.</li>
            <li> cant wait to see the long term results</li>
            <li> cause it don&#x27;t take long)</li>
            <li> I had doubts due to the mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> After watching videos and reading other&#x27;s reviews I was expecting this product to actual rub some skin off.</li>
            <li> I have not found any other exfoliant that produces similar results with no damage to my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product exfoliates well and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin.</li>
            <li> I still have dry patches after using it.</li>
            <li> It works well on dry patches of skin.</li>
            <li> It does get rid of my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Your skin (both hands and face/body) must be completely dry.</li>
            <li> Once it is dry, it will stop working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I compared the two and the Organic Mineral Peel took off more dead skin than my expensive $38 bottle (for 2.0 oz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Could not live without it now.</li>
            <li> I definitely shed a tear as I cleaned up the mess.</li>
            <li> and it is the white product itself that rubs off, not your dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> This does the trick and after only a few applications too!&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> you can actually feel the dead skin peeling off the face.  </li>
            <li> Do not use this with wet skin/damp skin, as it will not work at all. 2.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a few reviews prior to purchasing and they stated there was no real difference between the two.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical first but heard a bunch of girls talking about it.</li>
            <li> Do not use this after putting on lotion/body oil or any other type of product, as you will not see any results if you have a product on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed the product on my dry hands, skeptical user, until I began to rub my fingers on the back of my hands and instantly I could see the dry, dead skin cellls roll across my skin.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the product that&#x27;s just crumbling or if it&#x27;s my actual dead skin.</li>
            <li> I wished it was in a thicker consistency so it doesn&#x27;t run down my face.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see how clean my skin felt after using this product.   </li>
            <li> Also half the price of the face version.</li>
            <li> Heeltastic and Dr. Scholl&#x27;s helped a little bit</li>
            <li> I do have some darker spots that appear a little lighter after using it.  </li>
            <li> but I did notice a difference after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> and I use it a few times a week.  </li>
            <li> face to see dead skin just peel off.</li>
            <li> The dead skin cellls rolled up and dropped off into the bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li> It is all that dead skin.</li>
            <li> I saw zero difference sucks because i spent almost 30 dollars.ill keep using just not to waste.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work plain and simple😠</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s dead skin</li>
            <li> Have used this in the past and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I do it removes all the dead skin on my face, arms, wherever!  </li>
            <li> This takes all my dead skin off my body!</li>
            <li> and it is doing wonders with removing the dead skin!</li>
            <li> I was anxiously waiting for the delivery.</li>
            <li> Truly a hidden beauty secret.</li>
            <li> I told amazon this and got my refund at least on the one I had not used (as I had ordered two).</li>
            <li> When I finally got it, it was broken :(</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how much dead skin I could rub off my body using this.  </li>
            <li> I can be wrong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical but will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I dropped it on the counter and the glass shattered.</li>
            <li> Smells so bad I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> If I have to say...there is one bad thing.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I got this product and looked at the label, and could not find ANY organic ingredients on there.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased the product after reading the reviews, but kept an open mind. After testing the product on my foot, leg, and face, I determined that the product dries onto your skin and it is the white product itself that rubs off, not your dead skin cells. I am brown skinned, and what is rubbing off is clearly white like the product itself. I think St. ives apricot walnut scrubw is more abrasive, but does a better job at exfoliating for a much cheaper price, than this $30 product. So I am returning it because the novelty of it does not justify the price.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product after seeing all of the great reviews, and watching the tutorial videos online. The beading that occurs when using this product is not actually your skin coming off as people say it is, but actually the product itself balling up. It&#x27;s kind of rubbery.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I do still like the product. I feel that it does make my skin softer especially if I use it on the back of my hands. I wish I could see better results on my face though.</li>
            <li> It works just like in the video on their site. Completely Amazing! I love love love it! Could not live without it now.</li>
            <li> Have only used once, but did not work for me??</li>
            <li> I found this product one night surfing online, as I was shopping for beauty products. I used this product according to the instructions and found it amazing to see and feel the difference on my skin. I was shocked to see how clean my skin felt after using this product.   Great customer service when I had a few questions about the product and fast shipping when I bought it. Price was right and this has made a difference in the way I feel.   I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a striking change in the way their skin can look and feel.   You can find this product on: orgskincare.com or visit them on FaceBook by using your search button O.R.G. Cosmeceuticals</li>
            <li> Was skeptical first but heard a bunch of girls talking about it. Decided to  give it a try and I&#x27;m glad I did.  Makes skin so smooth and even, feels like I just spent hours at the spa. Works greats on legs and elbows! Truly a hidden beauty secret.</li>
            <li> Marvelous product.  Have used this in the past and will continue to use it.  My husband and I both use it on our faces, elbows, feet!  The skin feels so smooth and silky after using it.  This would cost a whole lot more in a spa!</li>
            <li> I saw this on one of my fitness blogs. I have been in a constant search for something like this. Perfect after working out for your face or body. Very excited to try on my feet! I have skin issues of Psoriasis and eczema. Both are very hard to deal with and this is helping a great deal with my flare ups as well as maintaining clearer skin!</li>
            <li> This product exfoliates well and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin. Highly recccomend it :)</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2N5NDBD59UWMO]]This product really works as a skin exfoliator/peel, and is easy to use. Look at this video of my boyfriend&#x27;s foot!! You can actually SEE results.</li>
            <li> I saw this product at a trade show a couple of weeks ago and was impressed with the results with the sample bottle I received there.  Showed them to a couple of my friends and they all agreed that this was a product that they had never really seen before but could definitely use.  To my surprise I found this product on Amazon after my sample ran out (I do remember the retailer mentioning something about an Amazon release) , guess I was lucky and fell upon it.  Went ahead and ordered...process was a breeze and the customer service was great since I was worried that it was the same product as the one from the trade show.  Information was all confirmed and shipment arrived quickly.  The peel works just as flawlessly as it did from my sample.  My face feels so smooth to the touch after a couple days of use, definitely can feel the dirt and years of makeup use being cleaned away as I use the product.  This is definitely going to be a part of my daily routine from here on out.  This product works as advertised and then some, very happy about my purchase.  A+++ for a product that actually clears up my skin and face and doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> This is the best exfolliant, next to going to a Korean spa and getting scrubbed down.  Being big on exfolliation, it comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this works at all. The supposed skin that comes off just looks like the product crumbling with itself. I didn&#x27;t feel smooth and exfoliated like when I use my body scrubs. Total hoax in my opinion. I can be wrong but I&#x27;m pretty sure this stuff doesn&#x27;t do what it says.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I put it on my legs, scrub it lightly with a dry wash cloth, take a shower, and then put oil on my legs.  My legs stay &amp;#34;flake free&amp;#34; for a week.  This is just the best exfoliator for your body.  I tried it on my face, but it is too strong for me.  If you do not have sensitive skin on your face, it may work for you.  For my arms and legs, it is perfect.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it as much as I should but I did notice a difference after a few weeks. Still using it and will have more feedback later.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best product I&#x27;ve used to soften up my rough heels. (Gross, I know). Heeltastic and Dr. Scholl&#x27;s helped a little bit but I had to use for a week to see results. With this peel, I saw results immediately. I totally recommend it. I&#x27;m going to have to apply it to my husband&#x27;s feet while he sleeps. :)</li>
            <li> Amazing. I had doubts due to the mixed reviews. But I&#x27;m completely blown away and will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s dead skin I&#x27;m rolling off or if it&#x27;s the product itself. I really think it&#x27;s the product.  I&#x27;m skeptical but will continue to use it. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again, though. It&#x27;s not blowing me away. I still have dry patches after using it.</li>
            <li> My skin is hard to exfoliate, but this product really helps!</li>
            <li> You notice it work instantly and my face felt really fresh after using this! Totally a thumbs up in my book!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous!  It&#x27;s very watery and you only use a tiny bit, so it lasts forever!  I&#x27;m still on my first bottle and I use it a few times a week.  Whenever I do it removes all the dead skin on my face, arms, wherever!  And I know it does, not only because I come out of the shower with my skin feeling soft and smooth, but because I can actually feel and see the dead skin crumbling off!  Then my complexion has a fresh new glow because of all the new younger skin that is now appearing.  Love it!!! 5 STARS!!!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to everyone. I use it with the mineral peel face and they both work great on my skin. It is so natural that it does not even irritate my skin even though I may use it 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product about five times now and I don&#x27;t really see any immediate results.  I do have some darker spots that appear a little lighter after using it.  You might be better off getting a salt or sugar scrub at your favorite spa - you pay a bit more but it&#x27;s definitely it and you&#x27;ll come out clean and pampered.</li>
            <li> You can use this stuff anywhere! It works well on dry patches of skin. I mainly purchased it to clear the acne scarring on my checks and chin. It&#x27;s been month and the scars are starting to fade away. I also noticed that the peel helped with my blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased an exfoliator (also natural) before Organic Mineral Peel. I compared the two and the Organic Mineral Peel took off more dead skin than my expensive $38 bottle (for 2.0 oz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is in liquid form and it does run. I wished it was in a thicker consistency so it doesn&#x27;t run down my face. I love the feel of my skin after I use it. Make sure to mosturize after every use.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much my skin peels really easy so this products helps so much!</li>
            <li> When I finally got it, it was broken :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not worry about return or refund since I returned from europe a month after it was delivered.</li>
            <li> Amazing and addictive, you&#x27;ll want to spray it everywhere. Also half the price of the face version. (And I was brave and used this on my face, it wasn&#x27;t harsh at all and I have very sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I first ordered the O.R.G. Body Peel after reading and article about over-the-counter home peels.  This stuff is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I&#x27;m a skeptic at heart even after watching some video online and reading reviews.  I decided to give it a try and have to tell you this is my 4th bottle!&lt;br /&gt;Even with regular pedicures and your own home remedies, it&#x27;s tough to get your feet in beautiful shape and remove all the callouses, etc.  This does the trick and after only a few applications too!&lt;br /&gt;Try it...you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a full body chemical peel. This was one option. I wanted my boyfriend to be able to exfoliate my back without the moans and groans of having to get off the couch. While he will on occasion work on my back, more often he is using the stuff with a mirror on his face. His massive blackhead problem is now gone when he bothers to use it regularly. I have discovered Cure Aqua Gel for my needs. A bit more acidic and strong. Of all of the chemical peel regular use products, this is a must have along with cure. Love</li>
            <li> I love using this skincare product and amazed at how well it works.  I will be ordering more and giving as gifts to my friends!</li>
            <li> Smells so bad I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Seems to work great for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great!! Amazing how it gets rid of dry skin so fast! I love it, would buy it again definitely</li>
            <li> Nothing special here, not much exfoliation happening. Easy to spray and smells OK gives it 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I had thought that it was my skin peeling but its just the product. I saw zero difference sucks because i spent almost 30 dollars.ill keep using just not to waste. But will not atm plan to purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! This takes all my dead skin off my body! It&#x27;s Amazing worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> this is great I love it really works</li>
            <li> I like that you can actually feel the dead skin peeling off the face.  Afterwards your skin feels so supple &amp; soft!!!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as great as I thought it would be. Not sure if it&#x27;s the product that&#x27;s just crumbling or if it&#x27;s my actual dead skin.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love! Instant peel for entire body. Best results on my neck &amp; chest. Great gift for a friend too.</li>
            <li> First all, I received it within a timely fashion and it&#x27;s expectancy is good and it keeps on doing a decent job as what it states- cleans well when done periodically.</li>
            <li> Loved it. I&#x27;m using Retin-A acne gel and it is doing wonders with removing the dead skin! And it leaves my skin so smooth. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like it so far. It does get rid of my dry skin. Makes my skin feel so much smoother. :-)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work plain and simple😠</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Using 3 times a week to keep my face clear from all the build up from exercise. It makes your skin so smooth</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I was shocked at how much dead skin I could rub off my body using this.  Keeps my toes and ankles nice looking between pedicures.  It also smells nice--not too strong.</li>
            <li> No reports from the person it went to, but then, she has over 1100 bottle, sachets, packets, jars and etc on both levels of the house...so, no surprise.</li>
            <li> This is great! The only product that helped clear up my back, shoulders, and chest area. I also use it on my face since I did not want to buy the face spray without trying out the product first. Non abrasive and smells clean too. Unfortunately, I dropped it on the counter and the glass shattered. I definitely shed a tear as I cleaned up the mess. I am ordering more!!!</li>
            <li> Does not work.  I had doubts about it working, so I sprayed some on my dinner table to see the effect...it beaded up, just as it would on my skin...... My table is glass, by the way. I told amazon this and got my refund at least on the one I had not used (as I had ordered two).</li>
            <li> product works as directions say it should</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible! Leave on for 2 minutes and gently run your fingers all over yours face to see dead skin just peel off. I workout a lot so it really helps breakouts on my chest. I&#x27;m buying another bottle.</li>
            <li> Works as described.  This is a good size bottle,&lt;br /&gt;Have also used on face, and helps make my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a bit pricey. But after buying it, I love it! Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> I just got this but after trying it out I guess I can say it does what it claims to do. I decided to get the body version even though I plan on using this on my face. For one, the body version was cheaper and also offered more product. I&#x27;ve read a few reviews prior to purchasing and they stated there was no real difference between the two. Not to mention if I decide to use it on my body I can.</li>
            <li> product is great. Glass bottle isn&#x27;t my favorite because I would ideally like to have it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I like it.  It really helps with keeping skin soft. I needed help with acne and it actually helped a little, but i think this product is more so to help with the texture of your skin.</li>
            <li> I was anxiously waiting for the delivery. I saw so many videos and read many reviews on the product that I really wanted to see what was it about.&lt;br /&gt;I used it as soon as it arrived. Oh my! It worked beautifully. It does what it says. My facial pores closed almost immediately. My skin was left smooth, glowing, and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I cant wait to see the long term results, I guess I will update this review often.&lt;br /&gt;Completely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, my skin is super sensitive. I am allergic to almost every product out there, from creams to makeup. I felt nothing with the peel, and that made me happy. Truly organic.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Gets all the dead skin off and leaves your skin bright and clean user it on my face neck and chest</li>
            <li> this is an amazing product, and I need to investigate why. It softens the skin instantly, especially on the legs, arms, places where&lt;br /&gt;it tends to get dry and flaky because I took good care of my face but not my limbs. It is costly to peel, and replenish your entire body..but I believe it is healthy and this product definitely does the job in three seconds, literally.</li>
            <li> Its ok. Wasn&#x27;t super impressed. Not a lot of dead skin comes off but cleaned face nicely.  Would  try a different exfoliator next time</li>
            <li> I got it like a week ago and tried twice on legs, foot and my face. My skin got so soft and smooth!  Very good moisturizer after it is a MUST! I use jojoba oil and works perfect! If I have to say...there is one bad thing. I have very very sensitive hands. And this organic mineral peel can dry my hands so much!! So do my legs&amp;foot is now my husband&#x27;s job!( I do my face by myself cause it don&#x27;t take long) So now he got really smooth soft hands!! :)</li>
            <li> I love the face peel and this is the perfect product for the body.</li>
            <li> After watching videos and reading other&#x27;s reviews I was expecting this product to actual rub some skin off. While it does make my skin feel super soft and smooth I highly doubt that is my actual skin being rubbed off. After trying it on my white skin and my boyfriend&#x27;s Latino skin,I have concluded that it is the product itself. But I&#x27;m pretty sure the makers of this product never claimed that, only the users. While I do really like this product I probably won&#x27;t be buying it again based on price.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it promises to do. I sprayed the product on my dry hands, skeptical user, until I began to rub my fingers on the back of my hands and instantly I could see the dry, dead skin cellls roll across my skin.  I could not believe what I was seeing.  It felt like silk rubbing on your skin, but the visible results were seen in seconds.  Immediately I sprayed the mineral peel on areas of my face that were discolored from acne, and the same results happpened when I rubbed my fingers gently, massaging the areas.  The dead skin cellls rolled up and dropped off into the bathroom sink.  AMAZING!!!  I am not one who often writes reviews, but when I purchase a product and the results surprise myself, I have to share the news.  This product is not fake, it does exactly what it describes.  The results are seen instantly, right before your own eyes!!!</li>
            <li> Works just as it claims to work. It&#x27;s so fascinating to see all of your dead skin coming off and revealing new skin. I recommend everyone to try it.</li>
            <li> So, you think you&#x27;re skin is clean - hah- think again. Then use this. This is great, esp. for athletes.</li>
            <li> This really works. This is my first time to try this product and glad to feel it does it job perfectly . I could actually see my skin exfoliating. And every time i use this , my skin becomes bright and smooth.</li>
            <li> Delicate enough to be used on the face it really makes the skin soft and smooth. I would definitely recommend it to a friend</li>
            <li> This stuff works. I notice my skin coming off in nice circles. It is all that dead skin. My face feels smooth and radiant after. I don&#x27;t know why I don&#x27;t care for this product though, honestly there is nothing wrong with it. I think I will try something else next time.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product! My first use I felt a difference! My face is smooth and feels like my pores are 100% clear! I used some on my hands as well and they feel great too. Beauty Buddha is a great seller as well! Fast shipping and the product is well protected. I give them a 5 star as well!</li>
            <li> Ehhhh. Didn&#x27;t care for it much</li>
            <li> I use it for my feet and hands. It works as promised and after washing it off, my skin feels super soft.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Made my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I got this product and looked at the label, and could not find ANY organic ingredients on there.  I believe the standard for saying a product is organic means it needs to be 95% organic material outside water and salt.  The third fourth and fifth ingredients on the label are chemicals... I cannot believe this product is organic by any standards, or even made with organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big purchaser of organic foods and products, and will pay more to get products that are actually organic, so I am fairly educated on what an organic product really is and when products try to make exaggerated claims on their organic creds.  Beware if you think you are buying an organic product.... which this product is NOT.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product. I heard about this from fitness you tuber, Cassey Ho. I&#x27;m so glad I did! It takes so little time compared to other masks and scrubs and leaves my skin looking smooth and fresh. It&#x27;s great for scrubbing off dry skin in the winter. I purchased the &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; but find that it still works great on my face, too.</li>
            <li> This is so awesome, I had a very bad skin burn from the California sun and after my face healed i then had flakey peeling skin. My face now is smooth like a babies bottom. Awesome product, I recommend this to my family. They loved it.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ll start out by telling you I have very, very sensitive skin. I generally don&#x27;t like trying new things on it, but I heard about this brand from a friend and I wanted to try it. Aside from the fact that it&#x27;s slightly gross to rub off one&#x27;s own skin, it needs to be done. I use both the body and face exfoliator about three times a week. It makes me feel so clean, my skin is insanely soft after I rinse with warm water, and my skin reacts fine to it! I&#x27;m officially hooked on this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have used the &#x27;face&#x27; version of this, but decided to try the body version because there is more product for the same price. I have very sensitive skin, and I can use this every day to exfoliate without seeing any chemical burns/redness. I have not found any other exfoliant that produces similar results with no damage to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who say the product does not work, here are my suggestions: 1. Your skin (both hands and face/body) must be completely dry. Do not use this with wet skin/damp skin, as it will not work at all. 2. Skin must be completely clean. Do not use this after putting on lotion/body oil or any other type of product, as you will not see any results if you have a product on your skin.  3. Make sure you do not let the product dry on your skin first. The product must be massaged on your skin while it is still quite damp. Once it is dry, it will stop working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally get out of the shower. Wait about 15 minutes for my bathroom/skin to dry completely, then use this product. I then rinse and use a gentle wash to wash any area exfoliated and immediately apply lotion. I also use a prescription retinol, but wait another 45 minutes or so after applying lotion to apply the retinol, so that the retinol will not irritate freshly exfoliated skin.</li>
            <li> LOVE!  bought for myself and mother!</li>
            <li> After using it 2 times I can say I&#x27;m clean now. Everytime I use it I feel special ...., Even thought I have no job I will still buy this product, love it until the last drop.</li>
            <li> item is very high quality and shipped very fast</li>
            <li> I never used anything for my face, except a Pond lotion. Read the great reviews on this, ordered it and now love it. This leaves my skin so soft and clean.</li>
