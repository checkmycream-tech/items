            <li>This concealer isn&#x27;t nearly as good as the FULL COVERAGE concealer that Mary Kay did away with.  </li>

            <li>Many thanks!</li>
            <li>Love the concealer and fast shipment.</li>
            <li>Good enough to cover up my pimple scars...</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and does what the product claim.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to get a better deal on this product because the prices go up and the quantity goes down.</li>
            <li>Arrived exactly as seen in picture!</li>
            <li>Thanks much!!!</li>
            <li>but, I couldn&#x27;t find the right eye concealer for me that wouldn&#x27;t break my wallet.  </li>
            <li>Good coverage with little amount.</li>
            <li>On a hot day it covered so well, that I had no worries. .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay because you obviously don&#x27;t use concealer everywhere.</li>
            <li>and I tried telling them that folks really bid the full coverage one up high on other sites for the old good concealer</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Reasonable price for this product .</li>
            <li>Blends into eye area very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for  this help.</li>
            <li>Highly reccommended !</li>
            <li>Also thanks to amazon</li>
            <li>I didnt really like the way it looked at all</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend and will be shopping here again!</li>
            <li>They did away with the good one and brought out this one that covers nothing and is only half the size for the same price.  </li>
            <li>Very natural  looking, and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>greenness is cover-able with my powder, but just be aware that if you don&#x27;t need anymore yellow on your skin, maybe don&#x27;t go with the beige.</li>
            <li>It appears as white spots ( light spots ) on face even though I bland it well.</li>
            <li>I was \\&quot;blessed\\&quot; with lovely dark under eye circles, and this concealer seemed to make them disappear without giving me a yellowish-tone glow, which I have known other concealers to do.</li>

            <li> Hard to select right color from a picture is the only problem.</li>
            <li> and all they did was warn me from buying it on Amazon so much for my complaint</li>
            <li> I have used other concealers, but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to other people.</li>
            <li> I have never used Mary Kay concealer before, my only complaint (besides the smallness) is that the concealer is a bit too yellow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands as well</li>
            <li> It made a small difference on my acne spots but made an ever bigger difference when I patted it under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do and less expensive than buying it from a representative</li>
            <li> Helps hide dark spots</li>
            <li> Helps lighten dark circles under eyes and around nose and chin.  </li>
            <li> It conceals my acne scars and hides the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> but they could have cared less.  </li>
            <li> Under my eyes looks almost green when I have just the concealer on under them.</li>
            <li> Container is a little small.</li>
            <li> bags- and dark circles--- just wished it was a permanent fix!!</li>
            <li> but it did make a small improvement.</li>
            <li> My usual shade for mineral foundation is beige 1 .</li>
            <li> They are too greedy and only wanted to sell this lame concealer.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what to suggest otherwise, if anyone has any suggestions let me know!</li>
            <li> Covers everything without being heavy or thick!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you have broken capallaries.  </li>

            <li> At my age it is good to have something to put under your foundation.  I have used other concealers, but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Helps lighten dark circles under eyes and around nose and chin.  Blends well with foundation.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This concealer is the best, and I&#x27;m glad I can still get it through Amazon. I hope its availability continues.</li>
            <li> Good enough to cover up my pimple scars... Would I buy again? Yeah, maybe.</li>
            <li> I used to use Clinic but it was too cakey for me.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands as well but, I couldn&#x27;t find the right eye concealer for me that wouldn&#x27;t break my wallet.  Someone recommended this to me and I&#x27;ve been a fan since!  Only concealer I&#x27;d use.  So glad I can order them online because I don&#x27;t know anyone that sells Mary Kay :)</li>
            <li> Color darker than I wanted but I chose it, so...but good quality material.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mary Kay forever and I love it it&#x27;s the only&lt;br /&gt;makeup I can use and was excited to see they sell it on&lt;br /&gt;Amazon Thank You</li>
            <li> I love it!!!!! the product it&#x27;s amazing! Great price and arrived in time. I don&#x27;t have nothing to complain. M</li>
            <li> I received my order and use it all the time. I absolutely love it!! I will order again!</li>
            <li> I love Mary Kay products, I have been using them for many years.  It&#x27;s nice to get a better deal on this product because the prices go up and the quantity goes down.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this product and have been using it for almost a week, overtop of my Mary Kay Medium Coverage Foundation. It made a small difference on my acne spots but made an ever bigger difference when I patted it under my eyes. I was \\&quot;blessed\\&quot; with lovely dark under eye circles, and this concealer seemed to make them disappear without giving me a yellowish-tone glow, which I have known other concealers to do. If you are going to use it under your eyes I recommend it... if you want to use it on acne marks, you can probably do without but it did make a small improvement.</li>
            <li> Conceals spots and blemished effectively, the colour is perfect and spreads nicely.  I would definitely recommend this product to other people.</li>
            <li> The only concealer that I have every used that actually works! I won&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> The best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> great price for this concealer and will order again.  Thank yu</li>
            <li> works very well, good seller</li>
            <li> I can wear this over my foundation for blemishes and sun spots and it blends in perfectly. It also evens skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for years and will not use anything else!  It conceals my acne scars and hides the dark circles under my eyes.  Love it!  I&#x27;ll never use anything else!</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and this did the trick. It&#x27;s not visible at all. I&#x27;m in heaven. On a hot day it covered so well, that I had no worries. . DD</li>
            <li> I need the help for  under my eyes. Thanks for  this help.</li>
            <li> Container is a little small. It&#x27;s okay because you obviously don&#x27;t use concealer everywhere. I have never used Mary Kay concealer before, my only complaint (besides the smallness) is that the concealer is a bit too yellow. Under my eyes looks almost green when I have just the concealer on under them. I already have yellow/beige undertones on my skin, so I think maybe I would benefit from a pinker undertone instead of yellow.&lt;br /&gt;The greenness is cover-able with my powder, but just be aware that if you don&#x27;t need anymore yellow on your skin, maybe don&#x27;t go with the beige. I am not sure what to suggest otherwise, if anyone has any suggestions let me know!</li>
            <li> Amazing product ! Highly reccommended !</li>
            <li> Perfect but choose one color darker. My usual shade for mineral foundation is beige 1 . So I ordered concealer beige 1 as well. But beige 1 concealer can&#x27;t cover well. It appears as white spots ( light spots ) on face even though I bland it well. Now I&#x27;m using with beige 2 concealer while I&#x27;m using beige 1 mineral foundation powder. It matches and perfect look. I love you Mary Kay. Also thanks to amazon that&#x27;s where I can get cheap for this.</li>
            <li> Will order again!  Thanks much!!!</li>
            <li> I have always used this concealer, is good and not irritating to my skin</li>
            <li> This concealer isn&#x27;t nearly as good as the FULL COVERAGE concealer that Mary Kay did away with.  They did away with the good one and brought out this one that covers nothing and is only half the size for the same price.  This is why I don&#x27;t buy ANY MARY KAY anymore!!!  I even called corporate about it and all they did was warn me from buying it on Amazon so much for my complaint and I tried telling them that folks really bid the full coverage one up high on other sites for the old good concealer but they could have cared less.  They are too greedy and only wanted to sell this lame concealer.  Don&#x27;t buy this if you have broken capallaries.  It is like using NOTHING and it won&#x27;t stay on either.</li>
            <li> Color was off, even though I ordered one shade lighter than my foundation. I didnt really like the way it looked at all, it just looks cakey!</li>
            <li> This is a great concealer and your price was better than anyone else!! Would highly recommend and will be shopping here again! Many thanks!</li>
            <li> i love , love , love Mary K concealers they really do the job</li>
            <li> Love the product &amp; it arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this concealer.</li>
            <li> If you know your shade and have used this product before, it&#x27;s the same thing at a great price! Get it from amazon!</li>
            <li> Darker than I was expecting it to be. I wear a 304 beige in foundation and assumed the beige concealer would match. I guess I need a shade lighter.</li>
            <li> Smooth, creamy, so-so coverage; although the color I chose was too light.. Another plus is that its &amp;#34;build able&amp;#34; so I&#x27;m able to darken it à bit.</li>
            <li> Never leave home without it!!!  I love this concealer.</li>
