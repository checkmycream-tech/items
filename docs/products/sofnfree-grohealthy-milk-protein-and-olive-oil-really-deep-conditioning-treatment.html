    <ol>
            <li>But it worked so good on her hair!!</li>
            <li>I can just imagine how great it would turn out!</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>amazing!</li>
            <li>Price Was Good,</li>
            <li>Hoping It Will Turn Out Good</li>
            <li>so this is a good</li>
            <li>This is a really good conditionor.</li>
            <li>have to say I loved the result.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and will continue using it.      </li>
            <li>Well the first try was REMARKABLE!!!!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>( nice)</li>
            <li>:) I love it!</li>
            <li>However, Love the stuff, love the price, thumbs up!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s strong!</li>
            <li>And it was AMAZING how easily the comb went through her hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to buy more.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products.  </li>
            <li>, I put a plastic cap on her hair for about 30 -45 more minutes.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, it stays for quite a while.</li>
            <li>I love the tingling.</li>
            <li>I would also recommend that you try it out when you plan to stay at home for a while since the smell is so potent.</li>
            <li>Out of all the conditioners I have used, this one is now at the top of my list.</li>
            <li>So I will be buying much more of this.</li>
            <li>I really love the way it feels in my hair</li>
            <li>my twist out keeps a better shape.</li>
            <li>and I love the cool sensation.</li>
            <li>I was wondering why they only had packets for this great product</li>
            <li>I bought 2 of these packs from Wal-Mart because they were cheap.</li>
            <li>This is a great deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I sat under the dryer with it for about 20 minutes and after I rinsed it out my hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>I loved how manageable and soft my hair was after the rinse</li>
            <li>to add some more to my cart right now.</li>
            <li>it is true that the menthol is strong, it&#x27;s like Tiger Balm.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft and beautiful with a soft scent.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I like the conditioner because, when it is applied to your hair and scalp, you immediately feel a cool and refreshed tingling sensation.</li>
            <li>I tried the milk protein &amp; olive oil really deep conditioning treatment two weeks ago and LOVED it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not a bad</li>
            <li>The scent of the product is mild, not too perfumy at all.  </li>
            <li>went to the salon and forgot my coal tar shampoo that i use to treat my mildly flaky scalp.</li>
            <li>After you wash it off, your hair instantly feels silky smooth but the scent is still very strong.     </li>
            <li>It smells soft, mild, and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Smell Is Light And Gentle</li>
            <li>My hair felt great, as it dried as well.</li>
            <li>After having used this product for the 3rd week, I can honestly say I saw improvement, in the texture of my hair.  </li>
            <li>The creamy consistency is nice and I bought two because I thought one wouldn&#x27;t be enough.</li>
            <li>The comb went right through my hair, no tangles or knots.</li>
            <li>this is the first time my curls felt on fleek</li>
            <li>first of all, let me start by saying I did NOT buy this on amazon.</li>
            <li>This conditioner does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>I would try the sample pack first to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li>but i will say i have no flakes even after being under the hot dryer for a hour..</li>
            <li>Turned out one was MORE than enough!</li>
            <li>I found it interesting because it didn&#x27;t hurt my eyes at all like cut onions do, but it had the same watering eye effect.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three months now, and overall I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what my hair needs.</li>
            <li>you have to use the whole pack!</li>
            <li>usually use Hair Mayo from Africa&#x27;s Best ,adding virgin olive oil, jojoba oil and rosemary oil for my deep condit&#x27; which gives a LOT of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The Milk and Olive delivered  more protein than my usual mix, I can feel my hair resist humidity better and</li>
            <li>I have suffered from a dry scalp for so many years that I can&#x27;t even remember.  </li>
            <li>My hair is relaxed and feels super soft.  </li>
            <li>I also think the smell of this product easily smells comparable to a blue menthol cough</li>
            <li>It is very creamy and you receive a nice amount in the little packet.</li>
            <li>On My Very Sentive Nose</li>
            <li>I really should have bought like 3-4 packs for her.</li>
            <li>After I rinsed it all out, I sprayed the leave in treatment on it which works very well also.</li>
            <li>was much easier to comb out.</li>
            <li>This product does deliver a really tingly sensation.  </li>
            <li>After each use, my hair was much easier to manage and shinier as well.</li>
            <li>After my hair feels sooo soft and continues to smell fresh until I wash it again.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would recommend trying the Sofn&#x27;free</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful, so powerful that it resembles a burning sensation without actually burning.</li>
            <li>My main reason for trying it was my scalp not for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t exactly understand the need for menthol at first, but later looked into it and came to find that the menthol helps to stimulate the scalp and promote the growth of healthier hair.</li>
            <li>I generally sit under the hot dryer for about 20-30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It really penetrates the scalp and leaves the hair soft.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how much product comes in this sample size packet.</li>
            <li>It felt like I had applied Ben Gay or some other mentholated rub.</li>
            <li>I actually have the conditioner on my head right now</li>
            <li>As I was shopping for other items, I decided to buy the Sofn&#x27;free Milk conditioner to try it out.</li>
            <li>Made My Hair Very Soft</li>
            <li>never felt my hair so soft ever !</li>
            <li>I tried this deep conditioner for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I first discovered this product at my local Walmart.</li>
            <li>After using it for the first time, I left it on my hair for 30-45 minutes with just a cap, and no heat.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely too intense for me!</li>
            <li>My hair is more then halfway down my back</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is fine, so long, and very thick, and gets tangled so easily.</li>
            <li>I bought 1 packet and tried it out on my 7yr old daughters hair.</li>
            <li>It also made her hair really soft.</li>
            <li>It made my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft.</li>
            <li>With this, my hair was so soft, not just as I was rinsing the product out but after towel drying my hair as well.</li>
            <li>makes my hair soft ...</li>
            <li>Okay so I have Dominican thick hair and let me tell you hunty</li>
            <li>I am a 4a natural, thick, healthy hair and my hair gets a lot of compliments:)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i barely saw any of my new growth that i was trying to hide</li>
            <li>(it sounds worse than it really is to me, and I have sensitivities to strong products)</li>
            <li>This product is decently thick but easily spreadable.</li>
            <li>The added benefit is that my hair was so soft the stylist barely had to detangle my lower back length hair.</li>
            <li>The dry patches in my scalp are CLEAR!  </li>
            <li>My hair for some months, didn&#x27;t seem to want to smooth out, but stayed very thick and  frizzy.  </li>

            <li> Made My Hair Very Soft</li>
            <li> never felt my hair so soft ever !</li>
            <li> I tried this deep conditioner for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I first discovered this product at my local Walmart.</li>
            <li> After using it for the first time, I left it on my hair for 30-45 minutes with just a cap, and no heat.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely too intense for me!</li>

            <li> makes my hair soft ...</li>
            <li> Okay so I have Dominican thick hair and let me tell you hunty</li>
            <li> I am a 4a natural, thick, healthy hair and my hair gets a lot of compliments:)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i barely saw any of my new growth that i was trying to hide</li>
            <li> (it sounds worse than it really is to me, and I have sensitivities to strong products)</li>
            <li> This product is decently thick but easily spreadable.</li>
            <li> The added benefit is that my hair was so soft the stylist barely had to detangle my lower back length hair.</li>
            <li> The dry patches in my scalp are CLEAR!  </li>
            <li> My hair for some months, didn&#x27;t seem to want to smooth out, but stayed very thick and  frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I also after i use it and flat iron my hair</li>
            <li> Just a little Wild Growth Oil to seal and soften, that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna stick with it, though, and see if it makes a difference in the long run.  </li>
            <li> I blew dried by hair and it was so soft to the touch, like silk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this at walmart for less then a dollar seeing there was only two packs left.</li>
            <li> I have used Keri Care for dry and itchy scalp and it didn&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li> I always leave my deep conditionning for a few hours, using some heat in the last 30 mn.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to keep getting the single packets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I can imagine that blow-drying would be a piece of cake and it would turn out smoother and less frizzier than without the deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> and it comes in a big tub and not in a little package as shown.</li>
            <li> Usually after washing, my hair is very course and hard to comb out with all the tangles.</li>
            <li> Just like the other user said you do feel a the coolness of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it every other week</li>
            <li> Very thick, natural hair here.</li>
            <li> For 97 cents, I will definitely use it at least monthly.  </li>
            <li> When I put it on my head it feels really fresh, kinda like a cold feeling and it smells like mint.</li>
            <li> and it was simple to put my thick hair in a ponytail.</li>
            <li> I say that because my eyes started to water and fall down my face while I was still applying.</li>
            <li> Other than the fact that this makes my eyes, nose and throat burn a little while I&#x27;m washing it out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less than $1 at Wal Mart</li>
            <li> My hair was less frizzy, even though I think it&#x27;s time for a touch up.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a sample of the leave in conditioner (liquid spray) and it helped a little.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions on the packet and after I let it sit in her hair for a little bit</li>
            <li> Towel Dried My Hair After Washing It Out For 10 Min.</li>
            <li> The reason I decided to try this out is because I shower everyday, use a blow dryer, and straightener.</li>
            <li> It usually takes me 2 hrs to wash and blow dry her hair because her hair was always so hard to work with.</li>

            <li> Okay so I have Dominican thick hair and let me tell you hunty this is the first time my curls felt on fleek ( nice) never felt my hair so soft ever ! I applied it then say under the dryer for 30 mins it worked wonders !!</li>
            <li> I tried this deep conditioner for the first time.  My hair is pressed with a hotcomb and is short (layered short around face)and very coarse. My hair for some months, didn&#x27;t seem to want to smooth out, but stayed very thick and  frizzy.  Whenever I would straighten it out, I would go outside and the hair would go \\&quot;poof\\&quot;.      Anyway, I like the conditioner because, when it is applied to your hair and scalp, you immediately feel a cool and refreshed tingling sensation. The scent of the product is mild, not too perfumy at all.  It is very creamy and you receive a nice amount in the little packet. I generally sit under the hot dryer for about 20-30 minutes.  After having used this product for the 3rd week, I can honestly say I saw improvement, in the texture of my hair.  It was smoother and easier to handle, after using it. I am very pleased and will continue using it.      I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As I was shopping for other items, I decided to buy the Sofn&#x27;free Milk conditioner to try it out. I actually have the conditioner on my head right now and I love the cool sensation. I can feel my head tingling. It smells soft, mild, and refreshing. I can&#x27;t wait to buy more.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from a dry scalp for so many years that I can&#x27;t even remember.  I have tried so many products.  I ordered a sample of the leave in conditioner (liquid spray) and it helped a little.  So when I was at Walmart and saw this item for 97 cents, I decided to try it.  Well the first try was REMARKABLE!!!!  After one use, I don&#x27;t have ANY flakes.  The dry patches in my scalp are CLEAR!  I am blessed to have found this product.  My hair is relaxed and feels super soft.  My main reason for trying it was my scalp not for my hair.  I have used Keri Care for dry and itchy scalp and it didn&#x27;t work as well.  For 97 cents, I will definitely use it at least monthly.  PRAISE THE LORD!!!</li>
            <li> Didnt Feel The Tingy Feeling Until 5 Min. Later..... I Did This With Out Heat, I Have Mixed Hair That Is Almost Impossiable To Control. Smell Is Light And Gentle On My Very Sentive Nose.... Price Was Good, Made My Hair Very Soft And Bouncy(Naturly Is Just Made It Bouncier!) Towel Dried My Hair After Washing It Out For 10 Min. Then Wrapped It For The Night.... Hoping It Will Turn Out Good In The Morning!! Overall: Going To Buy Agian!!!</li>
            <li> Just like the other user said you do feel a the coolness of the product. I also after i use it and flat iron my hair i barely saw any of my new growth that i was trying to hide so this is a good must inbetween salon visits or whenever you want to do your next perm.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! first of all, let me start by saying I did NOT buy this on amazon. I first discovered this product at my local Walmart. It is only 97cents for a packet. I bought 1 packet and tried it out on my 7yr old daughters hair. It was not enough for her hair I really should have bought like 3-4 packs for her. But it worked so good on her hair!! My daughter&#x27;s hair is fine, so long, and very thick, and gets tangled so easily. It usually takes me 2 hrs to wash and blow dry her hair because her hair was always so hard to work with. But NOT when I use this! I followed the directions on the packet and after I let it sit in her hair for a little bit so I  could comb it through evenly, I put a plastic cap on her hair for about 30 -45 more minutes. And it was AMAZING how easily the comb went through her hair. Even after I washed all the conditioner out! Any product that can make HER hair managable has my vote. It also made her hair really soft. After I rinsed it all out, I sprayed the leave in treatment on it which works very well also. I was wondering why they only had packets for this great product but I see they now have a 16 oz. jar. I just ordered one on amazon, because theirs is the cheapest I could find and they did not have it at Walmart. It is a must have for african american hair. Try it you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner does exactly what it says. It really penetrates the scalp and leaves the hair soft. I use this stuff weekly. If you haven&#x27;t tried it, go for it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. FYI-you can pick up this same packet at your local Walmart for 97 cents.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It leaves your hair soft and beautiful with a soft scent. I would try the sample pack first to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this at walmart for less then a dollar seeing there was only two packs left.I was like this stuff must be fire!!I went to the salon and forgot my coal tar shampoo that i use to treat my mildly flaky scalp.I was so upset because I was going out of town and the last thing i wanted was flaky scalp on my vacay.Well when i had this applied to my scalp and sitting under the dryer my scalp felt like it was penetrated by a tingling menthol like sensation.I was soooo overjoyed I had noooo idea this helped with flaky scalps.The added benefit is that my hair was so soft the stylist barely had to detangle my lower back length hair.She used a small tooth comb to roller set me with no problems with tangles..seriously!My hair is still pin curled and setting while i write this review but i will say i have no flakes even after being under the hot dryer for a hour..amazing!</li>
            <li> Very thick, natural hair here. I bought 2 of these packs from Wal-Mart because they were cheap. Used one, and gave one to my mom because I wanted her to experience it. Let&#x27;s just say, after a month she hadn&#x27;t used it yet, so I took it back! :) I love it! I love the smell, it stays for quite a while. The creamy consistency is nice and I bought two because I thought one wouldn&#x27;t be enough. Turned out one was MORE than enough! I loved how manageable and soft my hair was after the rinse and it was simple to put my thick hair in a ponytail. I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the result of using it but I can imagine that blow-drying would be a piece of cake and it would turn out smoother and less frizzier than without the deep conditioner. Next time I use it, I&#x27;ll be blow-drying and flat-ironing my hair. I can just imagine how great it would turn out! I love the tingling. It&#x27;s powerful, so powerful that it resembles a burning sensation without actually burning. I don&#x27;t know if that makes sense. I say that because my eyes started to water and fall down my face while I was still applying. I found it interesting because it didn&#x27;t hurt my eyes at all like cut onions do, but it had the same watering eye effect. That wowed me for a minute. I need to find a container of this stuff in stores. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> I tried the milk protein &amp; olive oil really deep conditioning treatment two weeks ago and LOVED it. It made my hair so soft and manageable. I have no perm and my hair was much easier to comb out.This WILL be a staple in my hair care routine from now on However, don&#x27;t buy this from Amazon. It&#x27;s less than $1 at Wal Mart</li>
            <li> This product does deliver a really tingly sensation.  Once I covered my hair, I could feel it so much that it almost got annoying.  I look at it as a way to tell that the product is doing something.  My hair was less frizzy, even though I think it&#x27;s time for a touch up.  You definitely get enough to cover your entire head.  I give it four stars because I&#x27;ve only tried it once.  I&#x27;m gonna stick with it, though, and see if it makes a difference in the long run.  &#x27;Bout to add some more to my cart right now.</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft. A lot comes in the small pack. I have about 4 1/2 inches of thick hair.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three months now, and overall I can&#x27;t complain. After each use, my hair was much easier to manage and shinier as well. I have very thick hair and after using my usual clarifying shampoo. This is exactly what my hair needs. I didn&#x27;t exactly understand the need for menthol at first, but later looked into it and came to find that the menthol helps to stimulate the scalp and promote the growth of healthier hair. Other than the fact that this makes my eyes, nose and throat burn a little while I&#x27;m washing it out (it sounds worse than it really is to me, and I have sensitivities to strong products), it&#x27;s not a bad a product at all.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this until they don&#x27;t sell it anymore! When I put it on my head it feels really fresh, kinda like a cold feeling and it smells like mint. After my hair feels sooo soft and continues to smell fresh until I wash it again.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how much product comes in this sample size packet. My hair is more then halfway down my back, it&#x27;s thick and I can get two uses from this packet. The reason I decided to try this out is because I shower everyday, use a blow dryer, and straightener. Even though I use heat protection spray, I know I do a lot of damage to it. This product is decently thick but easily spreadable. Once I put it on my hair, I immediately felt tingling, and I agree that it was a annoying tingling feeling which didn&#x27;t go away for a while. I also think the smell of this product easily smells comparable to a blue menthol cough drop- it&#x27;s strong! After you wash it off, your hair instantly feels silky smooth but the scent is still very strong.     Overall, I would recommend trying the Sofn&#x27;free GroHealthy Milk Protein and Olive Oil Really Deep Conditioning Treatment. I would also recommend that you try it out when you plan to stay at home for a while since the smell is so potent.</li>
            <li> Out of all the conditioners I have used, this one is now at the top of my list. After using it for the first time, I left it on my hair for 30-45 minutes with just a cap, and no heat. As I was washing it out of my hair I immediately felt a difference in the texture of my hair. Usually after washing, my hair is very course and hard to comb out with all the tangles. With this, my hair was so soft, not just as I was rinsing the product out but after towel drying my hair as well. The comb went right through my hair, no tangles or knots. My hair felt great, as it dried as well. I tried to use my regular deep conditioner the next time I washed my hair and now it just won&#x27;t do. So I will be buying much more of this. I hope it comes out in a bottle so I don&#x27;t have to keep getting the single packets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is a great deep conditioner. I received it today and decided to try it out. I sat under the dryer with it for about 20 minutes and after I rinsed it out my hair silky and smooth. I will definitely be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> you have to use the whole pack! I thought this was going to come in a bottle, regardless they should sell these in packs of 3-4 not individually.</li>
            <li> This is a really good conditionor. I really love the way it feels in my hair and it comes in a big tub and not in a little package as shown.</li>
            <li> When I applied the cream, my scalp was on fire! It felt like I had applied Ben Gay or some other mentholated rub. I only had it on for about 2 minutes, before I had to rinse it out. This product is definitely too intense for me!</li>
            <li> I am a 4a natural, thick, healthy hair and my hair gets a lot of compliments:)&lt;br /&gt;I usually use Hair Mayo from Africa&#x27;s Best ,adding virgin olive oil, jojoba oil and rosemary oil for my deep condit&#x27; which gives a LOT of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have added this treatemnt to the mix. it is true that the menthol is strong, it&#x27;s like Tiger Balm. I always leave my deep conditionning for a few hours, using some heat in the last 30 mn. I blew dried by hair and it was so soft to the touch, like silk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I loved the result. The Milk and Olive delivered  more protein than my usual mix, I can feel my hair resist humidity better and my twist out keeps a better shape. Just a little Wild Growth Oil to seal and soften, that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do not think I&#x27;d use it every week, the protein may make my hair stiff. I&#x27;ll use it every other week, I think that would be enough. However, Love the stuff, love the price, thumbs up!</li>
