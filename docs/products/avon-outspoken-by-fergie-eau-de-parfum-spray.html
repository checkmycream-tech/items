            <li>Received this as a gift for my birthday and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I thought, by the description, that it would be more fruity (berry)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I bought it for myself :) .</li>
            <li>Love this smell.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is wonderful, but evaporates in 1-2 hours, if it lasts that long.  </li>
            <li>It is not too strong and lingers most of the day.</li>
            <li>Good for day and night, very versatile...</li>
            <li>but other that price was awesome</li>
            <li>Perfume was true to what is posted!</li>
            <li>this made it easy to buy it.</li>
            <li>cheap price.</li>
            <li>The fragrance lasts a long time and the price was great, a lot cheaper than buying from the Avon lady.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great scent for a night out, quite affordable and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>It arrived exactly on Mother&#x27;s day and my mother love it.</li>
            <li>It is very unique, and you won&#x27;t find another scent that is exactly like it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d hoped Outspoken would be different, but as of now, Avon and I have parted company for good</li>
            <li>And it arrive quickly.</li>
            <li>The bottle is adorable and though it&#x27;s not the highest of high class designs, you&#x27;re paying for something that works well.  </li>
            <li>All the perfumes seem to be more like body sprays, for a high price.</li>
            <li>The scent is very pretty.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s becoming more popular lately.  </li>
            <li>Subtle, very pleasant.</li>
            <li>and this one wasn&#x27;t even worth that.</li>
            <li>I love the soft smell.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>, just right.</li>
            <li>The bottle is pretty too.</li>
            <li>Smells just as it should, and looks exactly as displayed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 24 and a female, dudes love this smell.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure at first because i&#x27;m not big on buying performrrs signature perfume</li>
            <li>I wish they offered a pure parfum version of Outspoken.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really feminine but hardcore as well.  </li>
            <li>I have upwards of thirty different perfumes and this one does not smell like anything else I have, so it is quite unique.  </li>
            <li>and it has replaced many of my other perfumes.</li>
            <li>This will most likely be the only perfume I&#x27;ll wear.</li>
            <li>It has great staying power, so I must have gotten a bad bottle the first time around.  </li>
            <li>it has a really nice scent, like nothing i&#x27;ve smell really different , just wish it last a little longer and it says its a parfum</li>
            <li>I really like it and definitely don&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li>Much easier ordering through Amazon than tracking down an Avon distributor as that is where I purchased this the first time.</li>
            <li>recently purchased another bottle of this directly from the Avon website, and it is a completely different experience.  </li>

            <li> Much easier ordering through Amazon than tracking down an Avon distributor as that is where I purchased this the first time.</li>
            <li> recently purchased another bottle of this directly from the Avon website, and it is a completely different experience.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a scent I wear everyday, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li> Despite some of the reviews on here that say the ones purchased from Amazon don&#x27;t last as long, I find no difference between this one and the sample I have.</li>
            <li> The downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> Stays on long.</li>
            <li> so i expected it to last a little longer</li>
            <li> To the other reviewer who said that buying from a dealer outside Amazon may be why your Outspoken didn&#x27;t last long on you: no, that&#x27;s just the poor quality of Avon recently.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells of soap and baby powder mixed in not strong at all but stays on your body.</li>
            <li> I will not use any other perfume out there.</li>
            <li> I think I remember reading a magazine article a few years back saying they added the smell of leather, which a lot of people hate, but I love the smell of leather.  </li>
            <li> I looked to Amazon for it and got it half price.  </li>
            <li> And it was delivered in less time that was estimated.  </li>
            <li> and I also think it is a little musky.</li>
            <li> Reminds me a little bit of Poison Perfume, but milder.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always bought this from my usual rep, but since money is tight</li>
            <li> Usually when I don&#x27;t like the smell of a perfume I spray it in my room</li>
            <li> hard to find so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s flowery without being too flowery, and edgy without being too edgy.  </li>
            <li> My Jennifer Aniston perfume basically fell apart after less than a year, and it was three times as expensive when I got it.</li>
            <li> Little expensive</li>
            <li> so different!!!Dark lethery!!Yummy!Tou ill get tons and tons of compliments!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great quality, fits well.</li>
            <li> Great product. .. fast shipping</li>
            <li> I absolutley LOVE this perfume!I totally reccomend this perfume it&#x27;s so different!!!!!It smells so different!!!Dark lethery!!Yummy!Tou ill get tons and tons of compliments!</li>
            <li> This smells good but it just doesn&#x27;t last on me.  I have upwards of thirty different perfumes and this one does not smell like anything else I have, so it is quite unique.  I just wish it lasted longer.  I bought this from an outside seller, not Avon, so maybe that has something to do with it.  The shipping from the seller was awesome though; very fast and they protected the package very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 2/22/12&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased another bottle of this directly from the Avon website, and it is a completely different experience.  This has since become my favorite perfume to date.  It has great staying power, so I must have gotten a bad bottle the first time around.  This is such a good scent, and I change my rating to 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> it has a really nice scent, like nothing i&#x27;ve smell really different , just wish it last a little longer and it says its a parfum so i expected it to last a little longer but other that price was awesome , shipping was good,</li>
            <li> It has a scent I like. Kind of woodsy. Definitely not flowery and I also think it is a little musky.</li>
            <li> This fragance is really delicious. It&#x27;s girly, there&#x27;s berries and something exotic in it. Good for day and night, very versatile... I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have a question about this product. The bottle of the parfum come just like that or in a packaged?</li>
            <li> Outspoken by Fergie is by far the best scent ever offered by Avon.  I love it.  It&#x27;s flowery without being too flowery, and edgy without being too edgy.  The downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I wish they offered a pure parfum version of Outspoken.  Maybe that would last all day.</li>
            <li> I came across this perfume when someone left a sample of it where I work. Despite some of the reviews on here that say the ones purchased from Amazon don&#x27;t last as long, I find no difference between this one and the sample I have. I love the scent and it&#x27;s long-lasting. I&#x27;d buy this again in the future.</li>
            <li> Perfume was true to what is posted!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product, It is not an over powering smell. Subtle, very pleasant. And it arrive quickly. I will be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell of this at all. Usually when I don&#x27;t like the smell of a perfume I spray it in my room and this one wasn&#x27;t even worth that. I gave it away to someone else who just sprays it in their car.</li>
            <li> I love the soft smell.  It is not too strong and lingers most of the day. Great product.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this from someone and really liked it.  So then I went looking to purchase, only to finally find out it was an Avon product.  I didn&#x27;t want to have to contact an Avon rep and was pleased I was able to get it through Amazon at a good price.  The scent is very pretty.  Reminds me a little bit of Poison Perfume, but milder.  The bottle is pretty too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always bought this from my usual rep, but since money is tight I looked to Amazon for it and got it half price.  And it was delivered in less time that was estimated.  So I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of my favorites. The fragrance lasts a long time and the price was great, a lot cheaper than buying from the Avon lady.</li>
            <li> Avon Outspoken by Ferige has become my favorite perfume!  I get lots of compliments on it and it stays on all day! I would recommend it to anyone!  I have been using Outspoken for about a year now and it has replaced many of my other perfumes.</li>
            <li> its nice, i love the smell. cheap price. hard to find so this made it easy to buy it. thank for selling.....</li>
            <li> Smells just as it should, and looks exactly as displayed.  I just started using it and haven&#x27;t had any problems with the sprayer or anything else.  Much easier ordering through Amazon than tracking down an Avon distributor as that is where I purchased this the first time.</li>
            <li> Received this as a gift for my birthday and fell in love with it. It&#x27;s a great scent for a night out, quite affordable and lasted a long time. This will most likely be the only perfume I&#x27;ll wear.</li>
            <li> This is my signature perfume. This perfume smells great. I will not use any other perfume out there. It&#x27;s smells of soap and baby powder mixed in not strong at all but stays on your body. I&#x27;m 24 and a female, dudes love this smell. Go fergie!!!!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a scent I wear everyday, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t love it.  It&#x27;s really feminine but hardcore as well.  I think I remember reading a magazine article a few years back saying they added the smell of leather, which a lot of people hate, but I love the smell of leather.  It is very unique, and you won&#x27;t find another scent that is exactly like it.  It&#x27;s totally rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll and that&#x27;s becoming more popular lately.  For me, it&#x27;s a good smell.  The bottle is adorable and though it&#x27;s not the highest of high class designs, you&#x27;re paying for something that works well.  I&#x27;ve had this for two..ish years and the spray on the bottle still works well.  My Jennifer Aniston perfume basically fell apart after less than a year, and it was three times as expensive when I got it.</li>
            <li> had looked for this everywhere, I love it, wear it all the time, get so many compliments on how good I smell, love it</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for someone, but it smells amazing. Thank You!</li>
            <li> To the other reviewer who said that buying from a dealer outside Amazon may be why your Outspoken didn&#x27;t last long on you: no, that&#x27;s just the poor quality of Avon recently.  All the perfumes seem to be more like body sprays, for a high price. This fragrance is wonderful, but evaporates in 1-2 hours, if it lasts that long.  I&#x27;d hoped Outspoken would be different, but as of now, Avon and I have parted company for good</li>
            <li> I really like it and definitely don&#x27;t regret buying it. I thought, by the description, that it would be more fruity (berry) but it&#x27;s ok. I like it. Would make a nice gift. I bought it for myself :) . My friends rave about it.</li>
            <li> Love this smell. It&#x27;s the only perfume I use. Little expensive but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
