            <li> I ordered Millenium DAY Renewal Cream, of 2.5 oz.  But the seller sent me Night renewal cream of 1.7 oz.  This is the worst purchase ever!!!!</li>
            <li> I love ordering my special products online...Great job, Amazon!</li>
            <li> I been using this for years love it</li>
            <li> I have used this for years , tried other grocery store national brands &amp; my face is gritty by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;Not this moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;This seller is great.</li>
            <li> It is everything I&#x27;ve loved about it for 30 years.  As my skin got drier with age, it still meets my needs.  It is moist -- not greasy -- and light.  A little bit goes a long way. And, as an added bonus, I get many compliments on how great my skin looks.</li>
            <li> This product feels lovely on the skin.  It is light, not greasy and works well under makeup.  The fragrance is pleasant.</li>
            <li> non-greasy, lightly scented moisturizer that really helps my aging skin stay supple. Soaks in quickly and easily before I put my makeup on.</li>
            <li> A great product. Used it for years and I am told I have really nice skin.  I would definitely reoreder it!</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery. Great product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Arden always has good products - some I like better than others.  I like this one just fine and I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice and helpful! Very good!Very good!Very good!Very good!Very good!Very good!Very good!Very good!Very good!Very good!Very good!Very good!Very good!Very good!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I use this product every morning under my makeup. It is light weight and my skin feels incrediable after putting it on.  Would defintely recommend it for all skin types.</li>
            <li> I was so upset when Elizabeth Arden Millenium products were taken off the market because I had used them since they were introduced. I have tried all the so-called replacements but nothing works for me like Millenium!</li>
            <li> I love the product and have used it since it first came on the market.  In recent years it is hard to find.  Please continue to offer Elizabeth Arden Millenium Day Renewal Emulsion.</li>
            <li> I buy this for her when I can find it. It is not offered by Elizabeth Arden anymore. Too bad........it is the only lotion that she really likes.  I hope I can continue to find it n Amazon for a while.......</li>
            <li> Thank you very much is an excellent product and my mom is been using that for many years,thanks again for this product I hope to buy more from you in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this emulsion and will reorder it. It is very moisturizing and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;Also I wanted to let you know that I have made two purchases.  First I bought it from Nutrisaver and the item arrived unboxed. Since I had not way of knowing if it was a counterfeit or an item used and returned, I decided to buy it again from a different seller, this time from Nets Shopper. The cream arrived in its original packaging: sealed box, instructions and a little spoon.&lt;br /&gt;I think that sellers should warn the customers when they are sending unboxed items. Some people think this is not the place to review the vendor, but the Feedback Rating does not help on this matter.  Although I have already reviewed both sellers chances are that nobody had read them because we usually read just the percentage ratings and the last few reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate when reviewers specify the name of the vendor so I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for many years and love it.</li>
            <li> The only daily moisturizer I use, blends in quickly, and I get complements on my skin...byw I am 69 years old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over twenty years. Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do if it were discontinued. It has a nice light feel, has no perfumey smell  and does the job. It does not make my rosacea worse, so it&#x27;s a win-win for me.</li>
