            <li>Its very easy to work with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a jell fan, however Hicks by far is the best hair jell I have used.</li>
            <li>By far, the best edge control.</li>
            <li>but it would be nice to be able to get it here.  </li>
            <li>This one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>products\\&quot; but Hicks is by far the best.</li>

            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>tried it at a hair show and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>So glad my hair stylist recommended this.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>But I love this product and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  in love with  this Hicks product.</li>
            <li>I love this edge control.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than almost every edge control I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really glad I got to try it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied every time.</li>
            <li>When I first apply this product my edges look AMAZING!</li>
            <li>otherwise the product will build up on your hair and not work as well:)</li>
            <li>Thought I finally found the best edge tamer there is.</li>
            <li>the product holds edges &#x27;ok&#x27; but it flakes up just like all the others.</li>
            <li>I put this on and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>You may have a better experience with it</li>
            <li>They run close, but I love Hicks.</li>
            <li>I used to buy the ORS edge control and decided to try this because I thought it would be the a lot better.</li>
            <li>But nope, it was a \\&quot;little\\&quot; better because it didn&#x27;t flake up</li>
            <li>Works better than the others.  </li>
            <li>I love it, so you will love it.</li>
            <li>i did love it when I had relaxed hair</li>
            <li>I love this hair product.</li>
            <li>Also smells ok.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I found the ecostyle gel works better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this gel.  </li>
            <li>This product works well in maintaining hairstyles that are elaborately arranged and for smoothing the hairline.</li>
            <li>Once it sets in, the firmness of its texture decreases and you&#x27;re better able to style your hair which is why I gave it four stars.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll really love it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just okay</li>
            <li>my hair was still pliable after applying it which allowed me to change my hair style as many times as i wanted.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly in the winter because I sweat a lot in the summer, but it holds in the hot/humid weather too.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>delivery was on time, but product was just okay.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like the feel of product in your hair this may not be for you, but I love it.</li>
            <li>The more you brush/comb, the flatter it gets.</li>
            <li>But for the most part I like the product.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this.</li>
            <li>After using many products out there that claim to \\&quot;tame\\</li>
            <li>I apply it to the outer most edges of my hair where its the thinnest on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love that the product smooths my edges without leaving any residue.  </li>
            <li>Many people have recommended this product to me.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works better on people with softer hair or relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>Works great when my edges are straight.</li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than using gel on my hair all the time.</li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;m happy to say this really works.  </li>
            <li>I had watched so many youtube reviews on this product</li>
            <li>So far this is the best that I have used to smooth my edges and tames my fly-aways.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>So let me begin: The product does not hold for more than five minutes.</li>
            <li>I love this product for my edges.</li>
            <li>The next morning, my edges were perfectly tamed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with the results and will never go back to another edge-tamer product.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure to rub it in well to get rid of the residue look</li>
            <li>this and many more video&#x27;s to come.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how this work wonders for my hair.</li>

            <li>/&gt;This is a great product and if you have realistic expectations you will benefit the most from it.</li>
            <li>Nice clean non-over bearing scent.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t that much better than olive oil ecostyler mixed with jam (my own lil mixture lol).</li>
            <li>I quickly purchased a container for my own use.  </li>
            <li>I had gorgeous beautiful black waves in my hair with no flakes</li>

            <li>Love it especially on virgin hair works great</li>
            <li>this is great for a ponytail and it is good to use everyday.</li>
            <li>It melts easily so stay away from heat, humidity, or sweating.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend using an oil-based hair gel.</li>
            <li>Yes at first when you apply it looks amazing but blink twice</li>
            <li>But or my sisters Hicks works wonderful for their edges to be laid down..</li>
            <li>I have tried them all, and this is the best hands down.</li>
            <li>Lays those unpermed edge down real good..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a good edge control for when I have a sew in or a new hairstyle.</li>
            <li>This product doe smooth out your edges pretty well but its seems to work even better with relaxed hair or fine hair!</li>
            <li>but if your have fine it it will work with no problem</li>
            <li>My edges were laid and when I applied it on my leave out by flat twisting (twisting my hair as if I was doing a cornrow) the hair matched beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I wanted light control and smoothing..</li>
            <li>But it did straighten and smooth kinks.</li>
            <li>and it keeps smooth throughout the day without buildup.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a great product.</li>
            <li>It is great for Afro American hair</li>
            <li>I think it gives great hold and also doesn&#x27;t leave your hair flaky after numerous uses.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that this hair product is available in beauty supply stores on the east coast but NOT in the west coast.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to keep my edges looking smooth when I am stretching my relaxers.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to give me a smoother look when I slap my hair back in a ponytail and Hicks works great.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product</li>
            <li>Granted they are not \\&quot;nappy\\&quot; but they do not remain smooth.  </li>
            <li>It blends into hair nicely, doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot of brushing to work into hair.  </li>
            <li>Your edges will be smooth, sleek and under control.</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>The hold is precise and glossy.</li>
            <li>It worked wonderfully to smooth my edges.</li>
            <li>free to ask any questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the absolute best edge control I have yet to try, I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>It has a good lasting time and even when it does seem to fade or give into the frizz, it still looks nice; not as fresh, but nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good for natural hair and it holds for days.</li>
            <li>This is a best product to tame my edges</li>
            <li>Great for edges... waaayyy better than any other edge control.</li>
            <li>Works good for most of the day, but doesn&#x27;t hold all day long.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I was so excited about the arrival of this styling gel.</li>
            <li>I love this product, edges look like just relaxed hair, keeps my edges straight and smooth between braidings.</li>
            <li>Just make sure the tooth brush doesn&#x27;t have ridges like the kind that is used for reaching the back of your gums.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good product for me.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this product however  is that it doesn&#x27;t get flaky.</li>
            <li>Hicks Edges really does it&#x27;s magic on my  two daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough good things about it</li>
            <li>I was amazed, the hold set in so quickly.  </li>
            <li>My hair is super curly</li>
            <li>I arrived quick and packaged well.  </li>
            <li>SUPER FAST DELIVERY!!</li>
            <li>Great product for laying down edges.  </li>
            <li>overall great product for anyone who likes high buns or pony tails</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff, don&#x27;t leave any flakes or white residue, my daughter loves it!</li>
            <li>works good but don&#x27;t expect it to work if its hot outside</li>
            <li>exactly what it says!</li>
            <li>My edges became really straight and smooth.</li>
            <li>It makes my edges smooth and straight, without the flaking and hardness of a gel.</li>
            <li>If you have freshly relaxed hair</li>
            <li>almost 8 hour hold makes it worth it for me.</li>
            <li>So far I had Hicks in for 3 days and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I have mixed reviews about this product.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and this does seem to work SLIGHTLY better on relaxed individuals.</li>
            <li>Then weeks later I purchased my own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the buildup</li>
            <li>i just got a fresh relaxer and that is the look i wont at all times.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>So worth the money...</li>
            <li>but this is worth the bucks.</li>
            <li>I think when considering what the product does and its use, it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I needed something to make them appear freshly relaxed because I don&#x27;t relax my edges often.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li>I am in love with this one by far.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the cost, no flakes.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I must admit it is worth every $15.  </li>
            <li>And the best part of all is it&#x27;s not greasy or oily or stiff, but soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>This was my second purchase, I bought my last one a year ago and loved it!</li>
            <li>Very good product doesnt leave my hair hard does a good job of slicking my edges down will buy again</li>
            <li>I used it right away.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is that this is not the right type of edge control for my hair.</li>
            <li>It melts right off.</li>
            <li>RIGHT NOW...</li>
            <li>This is not the right product for edge control.  </li>
            <li>I first used hicks when i fresh came out the beauty salon with a fresh press.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend for strong hold and no flakes!</li>
            <li>It lays the edges somewhat but not as good as the reviews that I&#x27;ve read previously.</li>
            <li>I have 3c/4a hair and my texture is not course at all its soft with really fine &amp;#34;baby hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I was amazed by how good it laid my edges DOWN!</li>
            <li>Love the brand, but you can find for cheaper on the actual hicks website.</li>
            <li>Thanks will buy again!</li>
            <li>I applied it only to one side at first to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li>At first he said you have a pony tail now, but hey you know how men are.</li>
            <li>Even if it successfully managed to slick edges</li>
            <li>you get when you first put it on.  </li>
            <li>I can find others that work the same for a better price.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>At first this seemed like it was going to work for me.</li>
            <li>After that first day you can forget it..</li>
            <li>Should have known that you get what you pay for (sometimes:), my hairdresser uses a similar product that is $20 a pop, but works like a charm!!</li>
            <li>it melts in sunny or hot weather though 😐</li>
            <li>the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered Hicks Edges pomade and fell in love with it instantly.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased with how Hicks Edges performed.</li>
            <li>But now that I&#x27;m natural, and when I want the front to be smooth this stuff does the trick.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I needed to make my hair blend</li>
            <li>Looked great at first but did not last that long.  </li>
            <li>this will sit in bathroom cabinet and more than likely go unused</li>
            <li>Product works exactly as it states it does.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nappily yours ;)</li>
            <li>I will admit this slicks your hair down really nicely and at first i was all oooo and aaahs when i first used it then</li>
            <li>I have natural (African-American) hair and wear it curly a lot, and when I wear my  hair straight, I use this to smooth out my edges when they start to flare up.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me and I have to say, I am so happy I spent the extra money on this.</li>
            <li>It smells clean and professional.</li>
            <li>My edges stayed smooth for more than a few hours with no reapplication needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no expert, but these products must be water-based, because after a while, I am back to a fro on the sides and a straight pony-tail on top.</li>
            <li>I have been natural for a little over a year and could not find anything to smooth down my edges for the perfect bun</li>
            <li>For years, I have being using beeswax to smooth my edges; generally, while wearing a bun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and it works great especially if you have natural hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is  pretty straight on the sides but EDEGES keeps them in check, even my gray hair.</li>
            <li>If I did not have to travel so far to return the product, I would have returned it quickly.  </li>
            <li>When you first apply it, it produces a nice sleek look, but after a few minutes it no longer looks that way.</li>
            <li>Overall, my new found product love.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and probably only works better for those with softer textures.</li>
            <li>This edge control is pretty decent.</li>
            <li>It kind of made my hair feel a little too gunky though.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to lay my hair down</li>
            <li>as described and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this product everywhere it lasts forever and is very well priced.</li>
            <li>it may have been just a litle much for me.</li>
            <li>about a hour later i found myself needing to reapply or smooth again.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I use hick&#x27;s edges on a daily basis to smooth my edges</li>
            <li>Yes it costs twice as much but to get</li>
            <li>I will absolutely continue to use.</li>
            <li>Also I do notice some very minimumal flaking</li>
            <li>After that u can&#x27;t really tell I used it.  </li>
            <li>Also, even if it worked nothing justifies 14 dollars for this much gel.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and does the job very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really like this product because it does what it advertise to do .</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter how much you put on your edges after that it just doesn&#x27;t lay.</li>
            <li>i dont sweat much.</li>
            <li>I really like Hicks Edges</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I use it in the morning as I am getting ready</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very frugal</li>
            <li>Too sticky to use for much else.</li>
            <li>But be warned, Pump is the real deal; it&#x27;s a \\&quot;protein hold</li>
            <li>Will never order this again nor pay this much for gel.</li>
            <li>(smooth it back) and tie a skinny scarf around the edges for 5-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>really do the job by laying all peace of hair</li>
            <li>HICKS will get those edges straight.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it</li>
            <li>I have 3b hair, and this product works really well on my edges.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping A+++++++</li>
            <li>was very suprised that this company sold this product.</li>
            <li>What I really like is that there is no flaking or discoloration.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely had to for this.</li>
            <li>It holds very well.</li>
            <li>My edges stay smooth the entire day without curling or lifting up!</li>
            <li>now its my very 1st one so please hang on in there</li>
            <li>I have medium length hair with a fairly smooth Black/Native American hair texture.  </li>
            <li>I have been told to use the Creme Of Nature Argon Edge Control it holds really well and doesn&#x27;t flake</li>
            <li>After getting my hair nicely done, she put in on as a last step before I left the salon.  </li>
            <li>May work better on a different hair texture I have natural hair that is classified as hair type 3C.</li>
            <li>It arrived pretty quickly, however when i opened the product it looked as if it was used prior.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of edge tamers and this one, makes it look like I actually have a relaxer, or at least a good grade of hair, which I do not!</li>
            <li>This stuffs works great, my only problem is that the product does flake up &amp; leaves a grey like substance if not brushed into the hair well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or flake up after applying and it last for about a week after one application if the hair is clean when applied.</li>
            <li>I just wet the brush, brush my hair, and my edges are as smooth as my first application.  </li>
            <li>Hicks Edges gives you a more natural look while relieving you of kinky dry edges.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t hold for long in the nice slick and smooth</li>
            <li>But considering the facr that it lays my curls flat at all is worth it!</li>
            <li>&amp; normally I would never pay this much for this type of product...</li>
            <li>but this product is definitely, most definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and my edges were straight after using this!  </li>
            <li>I left it on overnight and the the next day all of the greasy product had migrated into my fine strands!</li>
            <li>and i have try so many others that didn&#x27;t lay my hair down and didn&#x27;t give it the shine that i got in just one use of the hick edge pomade</li>
            <li>Olive oil edge works better and cost less.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only temporary as they revert quite quickly even ehen</li>
            <li>Maybe mainly because I don&#x27;t have relaxed hair</li>
            <li>In being realistic, this is not a relaxer or a substitute for a relaxer.</li>
            <li>Hicks is highly overrated.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>So long as you use it on clean hair, it will not flake</li>
            <li>And you don&#x27;t even have to apply more edge control just a little water.</li>
            <li>so i apply Elasta QP mango butter and olive oil hair milk and a little grape seed oil to my edges and nape first lightly combed it in and then applied the hick edges and OMG&lt;</li>
            <li>This product works the best and only leaves a slight white residue sometimes as opposed to other products that leave a much thicker residue all of the time.</li>
            <li>, this worked for me and my hair is 4C, very kinky/coarse, in its natural state.</li>
            <li>I normally wash my hair once a week.  </li>
            <li>or if i get in the least bit warm.</li>
            <li>I think this product is more for relaxed hair than natural hair, because it really dried out my hair, but it really works.</li>
            <li>I love it and have been using it for a few years.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found any thing better than this product for laying down natural hair edges.</li>
            <li>I even thought maybe my scalp is dry, so I use to add oil before I used the hicks then applied oil on top of it, but white and flake-ness still occurred.</li>
            <li>Enough hold for hair to be layed for 12+ hours but still easy to restyle for the next day.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without....</li>
            <li>I need to SHAVE my hair for new growth.</li>
            <li>Used this once and have made it a new staple.</li>
            <li>The price point is the first thing and the fact that as soon as I went outside in the heat my edges curled right back up.</li>
            <li>My first reaction was an elongated \\&quot;wooooooow\\&quot; as I applied this product to my kinky coily hairline that normally springs right back when I try to get it to stay flat.</li>
            <li>Works well, way better than any edge gel that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I first was introduced to hicks total transformations by latoya (lil&#x27; waynes daughters mother\\&quot;, through twitter.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s nice and thick but not so thick that it pulls and damages my baby hair.</li>
            <li>but I have natural hair and nothing has snatched my edges like this ever!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I love it though.  </li>
            <li>Especially for the higher price.</li>
            <li>First time I used this product but it won&#x27;t be the last time.</li>
            <li>this is my first time purchasing this product after researching several reviews on You tube!</li>
            <li>The crisp look won&#x27;t last through a work out or forever</li>
            <li>Most of them either didn&#x27;t hold past me getting out the front door, flaked,</li>
            <li>Also when I first started using it my edges were really short.</li>
            <li>gr8 product really works well sooo glad i brought this product a bit expensive to be shipped to the uk but its worth it</li>
            <li>Does a fantastic job of smoothing down my hair and keeping it in place.</li>
            <li>Although it is non-greasy it is a bit tacky, so it takes just a bit to smooth those edges down.</li>
            <li>This hicks edge control is a must have for any kind of hair i have to say that i was suspicious at first, how was it possible to lay your edges down without using a super thick alcohol based gel but to my surprise  </li>
            <li>The only thing that will curl or smooth my edges long term</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing it even laid down my wet edges....</li>
            <li>I have tried many edge products and they all fell short of holding edges down for an extended amount of time.</li>
            <li>This product really lays DOWN my edges like it&#x27;s a fresh relaxer.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and when I put on my edges lay very straight and flat without me having to brush them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had gray hair since I was teenager and could never tame them but</li>
            <li>but I still use it everyday for the minimum control that it can provide and I have noticed my edges are growing in tremendously!</li>
            <li>But like others have said, it doesn&#x27;t hold the tiny edge hairs / baby hairs super flat all day, and you will have to re-apply.</li>
            <li>If you have ethnic hair and wear it natural</li>
            <li>Professional, speedy delivery.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for 2 1/2 year&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This is a must have product if you are wearing your hair natural or not.  </li>
            <li>I wish there was like a buy 1 get 2 for a discount deal so far I have purchased 3 in a 4 month time span.</li>
            <li>Does not wok for natural hair</li>
            <li>I have natural hair about 4b.</li>
            <li>So My old stylist used to use this all the time on her clients</li>
            <li>but now that I am natural I feel like all</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and hicks</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>and I use natural hair products.  </li>
            <li>it says it work on natural hair which it didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I am a natural girl with 3c/4a hair..</li>
            <li>As a woman with natural hair</li>
            <li>My hair was soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>It does nothing for my 4A natural hair.</li>
            <li>I use it when wearing my hair straight only.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural, won&#x27;t be purchasing again...</li>
            <li>it gets really sticky and sometimes turns your hair white</li>
            <li>But when my hair is in its natural state doesn&#x27;t seem to work well.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t hold my semi natural edges all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural for 10 years and needed something to keep the edges under control.  </li>
            <li>I have natural 4c hair.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use too much because it will leave a white cast.</li>
            <li>i have natural 4b hair</li>
            <li>I have been natural for 2 years</li>
            <li>I am an all natural girl who also rocks indian hair sew-ins from time to time...</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t work as well on natural hair as I would expect.</li>
            <li>I have been natural for almost a year &amp; this stuff controls your curls, or waves or whatever your hair type may be.</li>
            <li>My hair is very coarse... very unmanageable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought two jars so far.</li>
            <li>I am transitioning from permed hair to natural hair.</li>
            <li>I am natural, and I do straightened my hair.</li>
            <li>so I would have not completely wasted my money on this Hick Edge Control product</li>
            <li>Doesnt work well on kinky natural hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this product directly from my stylist.</li>
            <li>The hair on my edges and nape are now completely unmanageable.</li>
            <li>Works well but requires washing frequently</li>
            <li>After trying it for two days, it really does not work even as well as the current product that I use from Carol&#x27;s daughter.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and needed something that would &amp;</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue and my edges stay straight/slick the whole day</li>
            <li>and I have a natural 4B/4C hair type.</li>
            <li>If you wear your hair natural , or relaxed, or just about any way this product is for you.</li>
            <li>I was introduce to this product by my beautician as this gel is not harsh like others on the market.</li>
            <li>You will need to apply, tie down, and let it dry appropriately.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a little pricey, but hair products that have good ingredients usually are.</li>
            <li>A SEXY SLICK BACK LOOK .THIS</li>
            <li>No other lays my hair like Hicks!</li>
            <li>I have natural hair that&#x27;s not very coarse especially around the edges, but is very curly.</li>
            <li>, you place alittle on your edges and it really goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Normally this product isn&#x27;t greasy &amp; it holds all day, however this formula that I received isn&#x27;t the same as in the store.</li>
            <li>Just a true waste of 15.00 for me.</li>
            <li>The price may be high compared to other holding gels, etc., but I spent countless dollars on products that claimed to do what this one does and those products didn&#x27;t work, so I figure it easily balances out.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and thin.</li>
            <li>i have natural hair that I currently wear straight (flat ironed).</li>
            <li>/&gt;this product they slicked my edges right on down.</li>
            <li>Hair lays right down</li>
            <li>I finally found a product that works on my natural hair!</li>
            <li>I also love wetting my entire head and applying a handful to slick all of my hair when I do a snatch back</li>
            <li>A bit expensive than the other edge controls but this one worked great.</li>
            <li>every woman with curly thick  to fine hair should have a jar.</li>
            <li>In high heat temps it does not hold for long periods of time :</li>
            <li>and my edges were still smooth without being hard and flaky.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think their is a smell associated with it, just a clear white gel.</li>
            <li>but if you are transitioning or a total natural then you may want to think again.</li>
            <li>I have natural 4c hair and currently I am wearing a weave to give my hair a break.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised that others have said it doesn&#x27;t last them all day because it does for me</li>
            <li>You have to do the same old method that you&#x27;d use with any gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for several years</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and this works initially when I put it on my edges, but once I step out into the heat</li>
            <li>For African American women, not much out there that&#x27;s better to hold the edges down for a bun.</li>
            <li>Works better when my hair is straighten vs. Natural, but doesn&#x27;t last long.. I&#x27;ve even tried to tying my hair down and still doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li>this is one of my essential hair items to lay my edges down right so that they can match the texture of the weave</li>
            <li>The exact product I previously used.</li>
            <li>and the past is to put the product on and use a flat cut tooth brush to smooth the edges evenly.</li>
            <li>I think it made my hair a little more heavy than I was used to.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product since my hair was very thin on the edges and short from breakage, It did not take much to get my hair to lay down</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different types of edge control products and this one by far beats them all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American with natural 4c hair</li>
            <li>It gives me slick edges likeci have a fresh relaxer.</li>
            <li>curly again i can say that when i put it on a night and lay it down with a scarf it does help hold for a few hours but still not all day it leaves a nastyy white look to my hair and recently ive been noticing that my scalp is really flaky and sore is it worth 17 bucks..</li>
            <li>This really lay down your edges</li>
            <li>I was really shiny and it did not hold down my kinky 4c edges.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural since June 2010 and my hair type is beyond any single letters you can come up with.</li>
            <li>so I positively need something heavy for these edges.</li>
            <li>My edges stays a little straight for maybe 30mins or so.  </li>
            <li>A little works very well on my edges and does not leave residue.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I took a shot on hicks because the reviews were good</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get good results, which is a plus.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s better than almost every edge control I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really glad I got to try it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m satisfied every time.</li>
            <li> When I first apply this product my edges look AMAZING!</li>
            <li> otherwise the product will build up on your hair and not work as well:)</li>
            <li> Thought I finally found the best edge tamer there is.</li>
            <li> the product holds edges &#x27;ok&#x27; but it flakes up just like all the others.</li>
            <li> I put this on and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> You may have a better experience with it</li>
            <li> They run close, but I love Hicks.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the ORS edge control and decided to try this because I thought it would be the a lot better.</li>
            <li> But nope, it was a \\&quot;little\\&quot; better because it didn&#x27;t flake up</li>
            <li> Works better than the others.  </li>
            <li> I love it, so you will love it.</li>
            <li> i did love it when I had relaxed hair</li>
            <li> I love this hair product.</li>
            <li> Also smells ok.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> I found the ecostyle gel works better.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this gel.  </li>
            <li> This product works well in maintaining hairstyles that are elaborately arranged and for smoothing the hairline.</li>
            <li> Once it sets in, the firmness of its texture decreases and you&#x27;re better able to style your hair which is why I gave it four stars.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll really love it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just okay</li>
            <li> my hair was still pliable after applying it which allowed me to change my hair style as many times as i wanted.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly in the winter because I sweat a lot in the summer, but it holds in the hot/humid weather too.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> delivery was on time, but product was just okay.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the feel of product in your hair this may not be for you, but I love it.</li>
            <li> The more you brush/comb, the flatter it gets.</li>
            <li> But for the most part I like the product.  </li>
            <li> Love love love this.</li>
            <li> After using many products out there that claim to \\&quot;tame\\</li>
            <li> I apply it to the outer most edges of my hair where its the thinnest on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love that the product smooths my edges without leaving any residue.  </li>
            <li> Many people have recommended this product to me.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works better on people with softer hair or relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> Works great when my edges are straight.</li>
            <li> I love the way it goes on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than using gel on my hair all the time.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m happy to say this really works.  </li>
            <li> I had watched so many youtube reviews on this product</li>
            <li> So far this is the best that I have used to smooth my edges and tames my fly-aways.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> So let me begin: The product does not hold for more than five minutes.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my edges.</li>
            <li> The next morning, my edges were perfectly tamed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with the results and will never go back to another edge-tamer product.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure to rub it in well to get rid of the residue look</li>
            <li> this and many more video&#x27;s to come.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how this work wonders for my hair.</li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It works but it reminds me of the Product &amp;#34;let&#x27;s Jam&amp;#34; except it cost more.</li>
            <li> Product goes on with a shine and looks great with very a normal amount.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great product and if you have realistic expectations you will benefit the most from it.</li>
            <li> Nice clean non-over bearing scent.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t that much better than olive oil ecostyler mixed with jam (my own lil mixture lol).</li>
            <li> I quickly purchased a container for my own use.  </li>
            <li> I had gorgeous beautiful black waves in my hair with no flakes</li>
            <li> Just make sure you follow the instructions and make sure your hair is always clean before the application of the product...</li>
            <li> As soon as I put this product on it smooth out my edges \\&quot;:)\\</li>
            <li> Great product &#x3D; no flake, not heavy, no build up</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, it would have been nice to get my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> I was really amazed at how good the product works on virgin hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does cost too much because I have found a very cheap Brand at the dollar store that works even better!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake the hair stays soft and smooth!!!</li>
            <li> Many start off looking great, smooth edges, shiny and overall healthy looking edges and leaving my hairstyle looking uniformed and neat.</li>
            <li> Remember that the instructions does say make sure you apply it to clean hair ladies.</li>
            <li> Love it especially on virgin hair works great</li>
            <li> this is great for a ponytail and it is good to use everyday.</li>
            <li> It melts easily so stay away from heat, humidity, or sweating.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend using an oil-based hair gel.</li>
            <li> Yes at first when you apply it looks amazing but blink twice</li>
            <li> But or my sisters Hicks works wonderful for their edges to be laid down..</li>
            <li> I have tried them all, and this is the best hands down.</li>
            <li> Lays those unpermed edge down real good..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good edge control for when I have a sew in or a new hairstyle.</li>
            <li> This product doe smooth out your edges pretty well but its seems to work even better with relaxed hair or fine hair!</li>
            <li> but if your have fine it it will work with no problem</li>
            <li> My edges were laid and when I applied it on my leave out by flat twisting (twisting my hair as if I was doing a cornrow) the hair matched beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I wanted light control and smoothing..</li>
            <li> But it did straighten and smooth kinks.</li>
            <li> and it keeps smooth throughout the day without buildup.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> It is great for Afro American hair</li>
            <li> I think it gives great hold and also doesn&#x27;t leave your hair flaky after numerous uses.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that this hair product is available in beauty supply stores on the east coast but NOT in the west coast.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to keep my edges looking smooth when I am stretching my relaxers.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to give me a smoother look when I slap my hair back in a ponytail and Hicks works great.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product</li>
            <li> Granted they are not \\&quot;nappy\\&quot; but they do not remain smooth.  </li>
            <li> It blends into hair nicely, doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot of brushing to work into hair.  </li>
            <li> Your edges will be smooth, sleek and under control.</li>
            <li> Overall great product.</li>
            <li> The hold is precise and glossy.</li>
            <li> It worked wonderfully to smooth my edges.</li>
            <li> free to ask any questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the absolute best edge control I have yet to try, I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> It has a good lasting time and even when it does seem to fade or give into the frizz, it still looks nice; not as fresh, but nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good for natural hair and it holds for days.</li>
            <li> This is a best product to tame my edges</li>
            <li> Great for edges... waaayyy better than any other edge control.</li>
            <li> Works good for most of the day, but doesn&#x27;t hold all day long.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I was so excited about the arrival of this styling gel.</li>
            <li> I love this product, edges look like just relaxed hair, keeps my edges straight and smooth between braidings.</li>
            <li> Just make sure the tooth brush doesn&#x27;t have ridges like the kind that is used for reaching the back of your gums.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good product for me.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this product however  is that it doesn&#x27;t get flaky.</li>
            <li> Hicks Edges really does it&#x27;s magic on my  two daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough good things about it</li>
            <li> I was amazed, the hold set in so quickly.  </li>
            <li> My hair is super curly</li>
            <li> I arrived quick and packaged well.  </li>
            <li> SUPER FAST DELIVERY!!</li>
            <li> Great product for laying down edges.  </li>
            <li> overall great product for anyone who likes high buns or pony tails</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff, don&#x27;t leave any flakes or white residue, my daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> works good but don&#x27;t expect it to work if its hot outside</li>
            <li> exactly what it says!</li>
            <li> My edges became really straight and smooth.</li>
            <li> It makes my edges smooth and straight, without the flaking and hardness of a gel.</li>
            <li> If you have freshly relaxed hair</li>
            <li> almost 8 hour hold makes it worth it for me.</li>
            <li> So far I had Hicks in for 3 days and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have mixed reviews about this product.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and this does seem to work SLIGHTLY better on relaxed individuals.</li>
            <li> Then weeks later I purchased my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the buildup</li>
            <li> i just got a fresh relaxer and that is the look i wont at all times.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> So worth the money...</li>
            <li> but this is worth the bucks.</li>
            <li> I think when considering what the product does and its use, it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I needed something to make them appear freshly relaxed because I don&#x27;t relax my edges often.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> I am in love with this one by far.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the cost, no flakes.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I must admit it is worth every $15.  </li>
            <li> And the best part of all is it&#x27;s not greasy or oily or stiff, but soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase, I bought my last one a year ago and loved it!</li>
            <li> Very good product doesnt leave my hair hard does a good job of slicking my edges down will buy again</li>
            <li> I used it right away.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is that this is not the right type of edge control for my hair.</li>
            <li> It melts right off.</li>
            <li> RIGHT NOW...</li>
            <li> This is not the right product for edge control.  </li>
            <li> I first used hicks when i fresh came out the beauty salon with a fresh press.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for strong hold and no flakes!</li>
            <li> It lays the edges somewhat but not as good as the reviews that I&#x27;ve read previously.</li>
            <li> I have 3c/4a hair and my texture is not course at all its soft with really fine &amp;#34;baby hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was amazed by how good it laid my edges DOWN!</li>
            <li> Love the brand, but you can find for cheaper on the actual hicks website.</li>
            <li> Thanks will buy again!</li>
            <li> I applied it only to one side at first to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li> At first he said you have a pony tail now, but hey you know how men are.</li>
            <li> Even if it successfully managed to slick edges</li>
            <li> you get when you first put it on.  </li>
            <li> I can find others that work the same for a better price.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> At first this seemed like it was going to work for me.</li>
            <li> After that first day you can forget it..</li>
            <li> Should have known that you get what you pay for (sometimes:), my hairdresser uses a similar product that is $20 a pop, but works like a charm!!</li>
            <li> it melts in sunny or hot weather though 😐</li>
            <li> the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered Hicks Edges pomade and fell in love with it instantly.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased with how Hicks Edges performed.</li>
            <li> But now that I&#x27;m natural, and when I want the front to be smooth this stuff does the trick.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I needed to make my hair blend</li>
            <li> Looked great at first but did not last that long.  </li>
            <li> this will sit in bathroom cabinet and more than likely go unused</li>
            <li> Product works exactly as it states it does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nappily yours ;)</li>
            <li> I will admit this slicks your hair down really nicely and at first i was all oooo and aaahs when i first used it then</li>
            <li> I have natural (African-American) hair and wear it curly a lot, and when I wear my  hair straight, I use this to smooth out my edges when they start to flare up.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me and I have to say, I am so happy I spent the extra money on this.</li>
            <li> It smells clean and professional.</li>
            <li> My edges stayed smooth for more than a few hours with no reapplication needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert, but these products must be water-based, because after a while, I am back to a fro on the sides and a straight pony-tail on top.</li>
            <li> I have been natural for a little over a year and could not find anything to smooth down my edges for the perfect bun</li>
            <li> For years, I have being using beeswax to smooth my edges; generally, while wearing a bun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and it works great especially if you have natural hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is  pretty straight on the sides but EDEGES keeps them in check, even my gray hair.</li>
            <li> If I did not have to travel so far to return the product, I would have returned it quickly.  </li>
            <li> When you first apply it, it produces a nice sleek look, but after a few minutes it no longer looks that way.</li>
            <li> Overall, my new found product love.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and probably only works better for those with softer textures.</li>
            <li> This edge control is pretty decent.</li>
            <li> It kind of made my hair feel a little too gunky though.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to lay my hair down</li>
            <li> as described and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this product everywhere it lasts forever and is very well priced.</li>
            <li> it may have been just a litle much for me.</li>
            <li> about a hour later i found myself needing to reapply or smooth again.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I use hick&#x27;s edges on a daily basis to smooth my edges</li>
            <li> Yes it costs twice as much but to get</li>
            <li> I will absolutely continue to use.</li>
            <li> Also I do notice some very minimumal flaking</li>
            <li> After that u can&#x27;t really tell I used it.  </li>
            <li> Also, even if it worked nothing justifies 14 dollars for this much gel.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and does the job very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it does what it advertise to do .</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how much you put on your edges after that it just doesn&#x27;t lay.</li>
            <li> i dont sweat much.</li>
            <li> I really like Hicks Edges</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning as I am getting ready</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very frugal</li>
            <li> Too sticky to use for much else.</li>
            <li> But be warned, Pump is the real deal; it&#x27;s a \\&quot;protein hold</li>
            <li> Will never order this again nor pay this much for gel.</li>
            <li> (smooth it back) and tie a skinny scarf around the edges for 5-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> really do the job by laying all peace of hair</li>
            <li> HICKS will get those edges straight.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it</li>
            <li> I have 3b hair, and this product works really well on my edges.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping A+++++++</li>
            <li> was very suprised that this company sold this product.</li>
            <li> What I really like is that there is no flaking or discoloration.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely had to for this.</li>
            <li> It holds very well.</li>
            <li> My edges stay smooth the entire day without curling or lifting up!</li>
            <li> now its my very 1st one so please hang on in there</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair with a fairly smooth Black/Native American hair texture.  </li>
            <li> I have been told to use the Creme Of Nature Argon Edge Control it holds really well and doesn&#x27;t flake</li>
            <li> After getting my hair nicely done, she put in on as a last step before I left the salon.  </li>
            <li> May work better on a different hair texture I have natural hair that is classified as hair type 3C.</li>
            <li> It arrived pretty quickly, however when i opened the product it looked as if it was used prior.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of edge tamers and this one, makes it look like I actually have a relaxer, or at least a good grade of hair, which I do not!</li>
            <li> This stuffs works great, my only problem is that the product does flake up &amp; leaves a grey like substance if not brushed into the hair well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or flake up after applying and it last for about a week after one application if the hair is clean when applied.</li>
            <li> I just wet the brush, brush my hair, and my edges are as smooth as my first application.  </li>
            <li> Hicks Edges gives you a more natural look while relieving you of kinky dry edges.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t hold for long in the nice slick and smooth</li>
            <li> But considering the facr that it lays my curls flat at all is worth it!</li>
            <li> &amp; normally I would never pay this much for this type of product...</li>
            <li> but this product is definitely, most definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and my edges were straight after using this!  </li>
            <li> I left it on overnight and the the next day all of the greasy product had migrated into my fine strands!</li>
            <li> and i have try so many others that didn&#x27;t lay my hair down and didn&#x27;t give it the shine that i got in just one use of the hick edge pomade</li>
            <li> Olive oil edge works better and cost less.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only temporary as they revert quite quickly even ehen</li>
            <li> Maybe mainly because I don&#x27;t have relaxed hair</li>
            <li> In being realistic, this is not a relaxer or a substitute for a relaxer.</li>
            <li> Hicks is highly overrated.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So long as you use it on clean hair, it will not flake</li>
            <li> And you don&#x27;t even have to apply more edge control just a little water.</li>
            <li> so i apply Elasta QP mango butter and olive oil hair milk and a little grape seed oil to my edges and nape first lightly combed it in and then applied the hick edges and OMG&lt;</li>
            <li> This product works the best and only leaves a slight white residue sometimes as opposed to other products that leave a much thicker residue all of the time.</li>
            <li> , this worked for me and my hair is 4C, very kinky/coarse, in its natural state.</li>
            <li> I normally wash my hair once a week.  </li>
            <li> or if i get in the least bit warm.</li>
            <li> I think this product is more for relaxed hair than natural hair, because it really dried out my hair, but it really works.</li>
            <li> I love it and have been using it for a few years.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any thing better than this product for laying down natural hair edges.</li>
            <li> I even thought maybe my scalp is dry, so I use to add oil before I used the hicks then applied oil on top of it, but white and flake-ness still occurred.</li>
            <li> Enough hold for hair to be layed for 12+ hours but still easy to restyle for the next day.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without....</li>
            <li> I need to SHAVE my hair for new growth.</li>
            <li> Used this once and have made it a new staple.</li>
            <li> The price point is the first thing and the fact that as soon as I went outside in the heat my edges curled right back up.</li>
            <li> My first reaction was an elongated \\&quot;wooooooow\\&quot; as I applied this product to my kinky coily hairline that normally springs right back when I try to get it to stay flat.</li>
            <li> Works well, way better than any edge gel that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I first was introduced to hicks total transformations by latoya (lil&#x27; waynes daughters mother\\&quot;, through twitter.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s nice and thick but not so thick that it pulls and damages my baby hair.</li>
            <li> but I have natural hair and nothing has snatched my edges like this ever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I love it though.  </li>
            <li> Especially for the higher price.</li>
            <li> First time I used this product but it won&#x27;t be the last time.</li>
            <li> this is my first time purchasing this product after researching several reviews on You tube!</li>
            <li> The crisp look won&#x27;t last through a work out or forever</li>
            <li> Most of them either didn&#x27;t hold past me getting out the front door, flaked,</li>
            <li> Also when I first started using it my edges were really short.</li>
            <li> gr8 product really works well sooo glad i brought this product a bit expensive to be shipped to the uk but its worth it</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job of smoothing down my hair and keeping it in place.</li>
            <li> Although it is non-greasy it is a bit tacky, so it takes just a bit to smooth those edges down.</li>
            <li> This hicks edge control is a must have for any kind of hair i have to say that i was suspicious at first, how was it possible to lay your edges down without using a super thick alcohol based gel but to my surprise  </li>
            <li> The only thing that will curl or smooth my edges long term</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing it even laid down my wet edges....</li>
            <li> I have tried many edge products and they all fell short of holding edges down for an extended amount of time.</li>
            <li> This product really lays DOWN my edges like it&#x27;s a fresh relaxer.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and when I put on my edges lay very straight and flat without me having to brush them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had gray hair since I was teenager and could never tame them but</li>
            <li> but I still use it everyday for the minimum control that it can provide and I have noticed my edges are growing in tremendously!</li>
            <li> But like others have said, it doesn&#x27;t hold the tiny edge hairs / baby hairs super flat all day, and you will have to re-apply.</li>
            <li> If you have ethnic hair and wear it natural</li>
            <li> Professional, speedy delivery.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for 2 1/2 year&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This is a must have product if you are wearing your hair natural or not.  </li>
            <li> I wish there was like a buy 1 get 2 for a discount deal so far I have purchased 3 in a 4 month time span.</li>
            <li> Does not wok for natural hair</li>
            <li> I have natural hair about 4b.</li>
            <li> So My old stylist used to use this all the time on her clients</li>
            <li> but now that I am natural I feel like all</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and hicks</li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> and I use natural hair products.  </li>
            <li> it says it work on natural hair which it didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I am a natural girl with 3c/4a hair..</li>
            <li> As a woman with natural hair</li>
            <li> My hair was soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> It does nothing for my 4A natural hair.</li>
            <li> I use it when wearing my hair straight only.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural, won&#x27;t be purchasing again...</li>
            <li> it gets really sticky and sometimes turns your hair white</li>
            <li> But when my hair is in its natural state doesn&#x27;t seem to work well.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t hold my semi natural edges all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural for 10 years and needed something to keep the edges under control.  </li>
            <li> I have natural 4c hair.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use too much because it will leave a white cast.</li>
            <li> i have natural 4b hair</li>
            <li> I have been natural for 2 years</li>
            <li> I am an all natural girl who also rocks indian hair sew-ins from time to time...</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t work as well on natural hair as I would expect.</li>
            <li> I have been natural for almost a year &amp; this stuff controls your curls, or waves or whatever your hair type may be.</li>
            <li> My hair is very coarse... very unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two jars so far.</li>
            <li> I am transitioning from permed hair to natural hair.</li>
            <li> I am natural, and I do straightened my hair.</li>
            <li> so I would have not completely wasted my money on this Hick Edge Control product</li>
            <li> Doesnt work well on kinky natural hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product directly from my stylist.</li>
            <li> The hair on my edges and nape are now completely unmanageable.</li>
            <li> Works well but requires washing frequently</li>
            <li> After trying it for two days, it really does not work even as well as the current product that I use from Carol&#x27;s daughter.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and needed something that would &amp;</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue and my edges stay straight/slick the whole day</li>
            <li> and I have a natural 4B/4C hair type.</li>
            <li> If you wear your hair natural , or relaxed, or just about any way this product is for you.</li>
            <li> I was introduce to this product by my beautician as this gel is not harsh like others on the market.</li>
            <li> You will need to apply, tie down, and let it dry appropriately.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little pricey, but hair products that have good ingredients usually are.</li>
            <li> A SEXY SLICK BACK LOOK .THIS</li>
            <li> No other lays my hair like Hicks!</li>
            <li> I have natural hair that&#x27;s not very coarse especially around the edges, but is very curly.</li>
            <li> , you place alittle on your edges and it really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Normally this product isn&#x27;t greasy &amp; it holds all day, however this formula that I received isn&#x27;t the same as in the store.</li>
            <li> Just a true waste of 15.00 for me.</li>
            <li> The price may be high compared to other holding gels, etc., but I spent countless dollars on products that claimed to do what this one does and those products didn&#x27;t work, so I figure it easily balances out.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and thin.</li>
            <li> i have natural hair that I currently wear straight (flat ironed).</li>
            <li> /&gt;this product they slicked my edges right on down.</li>
            <li> Hair lays right down</li>
            <li> I finally found a product that works on my natural hair!</li>
            <li> I also love wetting my entire head and applying a handful to slick all of my hair when I do a snatch back</li>
            <li> A bit expensive than the other edge controls but this one worked great.</li>
            <li> every woman with curly thick  to fine hair should have a jar.</li>
            <li> In high heat temps it does not hold for long periods of time :</li>
            <li> and my edges were still smooth without being hard and flaky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think their is a smell associated with it, just a clear white gel.</li>
            <li> but if you are transitioning or a total natural then you may want to think again.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4c hair and currently I am wearing a weave to give my hair a break.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised that others have said it doesn&#x27;t last them all day because it does for me</li>
            <li> You have to do the same old method that you&#x27;d use with any gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for several years</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and this works initially when I put it on my edges, but once I step out into the heat</li>
            <li> For African American women, not much out there that&#x27;s better to hold the edges down for a bun.</li>
            <li> Works better when my hair is straighten vs. Natural, but doesn&#x27;t last long.. I&#x27;ve even tried to tying my hair down and still doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> this is one of my essential hair items to lay my edges down right so that they can match the texture of the weave</li>
            <li> The exact product I previously used.</li>
            <li> and the past is to put the product on and use a flat cut tooth brush to smooth the edges evenly.</li>
            <li> I think it made my hair a little more heavy than I was used to.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product since my hair was very thin on the edges and short from breakage, It did not take much to get my hair to lay down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different types of edge control products and this one by far beats them all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with natural 4c hair</li>
            <li> It gives me slick edges likeci have a fresh relaxer.</li>
            <li> curly again i can say that when i put it on a night and lay it down with a scarf it does help hold for a few hours but still not all day it leaves a nastyy white look to my hair and recently ive been noticing that my scalp is really flaky and sore is it worth 17 bucks..</li>
            <li> This really lay down your edges</li>
            <li> I was really shiny and it did not hold down my kinky 4c edges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural since June 2010 and my hair type is beyond any single letters you can come up with.</li>
            <li> so I positively need something heavy for these edges.</li>
            <li> My edges stays a little straight for maybe 30mins or so.  </li>
            <li> A little works very well on my edges and does not leave residue.</li>
            <li> It lays the edges down upon first application, then a few seconds later, my hair is back in its natural state.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t really hold my edges down for long.</li>
            <li> but mine has been like every other edge control, tight and right while going on and</li>
            <li> I am a black female and my hair is not hard to manage.</li>
            <li> It lays your edges and &amp;#34;kitchen&amp;#34; down very well almost like you have a relaxer, lasts all day, no alcohol, doesn&#x27;t dry your hair</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and bought this based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s very sticky, even when you only use small amounts.</li>
            <li> You only need a teeney weeny bit too so the tub should last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Applying this products to my natural hair does very well, it does maintain the hold; however, it tends to make my hair just a little wavy after a few hours.</li>
            <li> And while it doesn&#x27;t stay super shiny and wet looking all day,man o&#x27; man, once you grab all of your hair with a ponytail holder it will hold your hair DOWN all day!!!</li>
            <li> It does slick your edges very well without the excess build up.</li>
            <li> But, it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Within two months they are long enough to go into a ponytail.</li>
            <li> Natural hair for 5 years, works to slick down edges without too much shine (like jam)</li>
            <li> it does not hold my natural hair down for long only about 30 mins and</li>
            <li> I have non-permed natural hair and now I&#x27;m stuck with another product that will not hold the edges down as advertised.</li>
            <li> It seems to provide hold for 10 minutes or less before needing to reapply which is pretty much a waste of my time.</li>
            <li> I bought several different edge gels, pomades and creams to hold my edges down when pulling my hair back.  </li>
            <li> It turns your hair white and DRY!</li>
            <li> I sometimes flat iron my hair to wear it in a straight up-do with a ponytail extension... or at least, I would LIKE TO.</li>
            <li> Even though it doesn&#x27;t last a long time, my hair still stays down and it does  not DRY out my hair</li>
            <li> It leaves white residue no matter how little i apply and my edges are lifted back up like 20 mins later.</li>
            <li> I HAVE LONG HAIR</li>
            <li> I find that it does gold my edges in tact but not for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I expected it to last for 2 days!</li>
            <li> I have been using Hick Edges for a long time</li>
            <li> the style shows how long day of a day I had.  </li>
            <li> It even works on grey edges.</li>
            <li> and it holds my edges for what I need, but doesn&#x27;t hold that long through out the day.</li>
            <li> I ave ran across in a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair is very kinky and just absolutely thick and needs a touch up about every 6 weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m down to my last jar, but on my next purchase, I plan to try it all over and not just on my edges.</li>
            <li> Now back in my perm days I would not have needed this stuff; even when I was 2 -3 months into a perm I could lay my edges flat with a little spittle (I know, gross), a touch of 99 cent gel, or a dab of mousse / hair spray.</li>
            <li> I have 4b/4c hair and decided to get a 3b weave from ONYC which was not smart since I left a lot of leave out.  </li>
            <li> But since I&#x27;m a sucker for trying new things I went back to it.</li>
            <li> the thicker the area of hair you apply it to, the less likely you will see it last.</li>
            <li> It holds well, but just like every other edge control it does not last long.</li>
            <li> The price is a little more expensive than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Downside - same as one of my other 4c hair favourites</li>
            <li> so I decided to give it a try since my other product  Olive Oil Edge Control seems to leave a white film in my hair.</li>
            <li> MAKE YOUR HAIR FEEL STICKY DRY ..</li>
            <li> I did use it to twist dry hair and the twists were elongated and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Have tried others, you could see the gel and appeard dry.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt even make my hair dry</li>
            <li> No good doesn&#x27;t hold long and it&#x27;s very sticky and it makes my hair very dry and flakey</li>
            <li> These days a lot of black woman are going natural and need something to lay down those edges.</li>
            <li> if you use it and tie down your edges for a couple of hours, it will last all day!</li>
            <li> but hicks edge control held them down and wasn&#x27;t greasy or create white stuff on my hair.</li>
            <li> Lays down longer and actually grows your edges!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 jars and plan to be a repeat customer for a very long time!</li>
            <li> Really holds my edges down without making the hair feel hard</li>
            <li> But be warned it does dry your hair out!</li>
            <li> because Im natural when I use it it&#x27;ll stick down for a few minutes before my hair poofs up</li>
            <li> I thought it would lay them down flat and hold</li>
            <li> No flakiness and only need a little.</li>
            <li> Edges lay for a little while and then frizz back up.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a must have for those people with natural hair who struggle with the frizz and have a hard time getting their hair into a neat ponytail.</li>
            <li> I apply everyday all around my edges in the morning and it last all day.</li>
            <li> I have really rough edges</li>
            <li> But do not overuse or pile on everyday because it will turn white</li>
            <li> I added a few drops of essential oils and rubbed my hands together before applying it to my hair.</li>
            <li> I will admit that there is no flacking, but it just doesn&#x27;t hold like I expected.</li>
            <li> This product does not hold as well as I expected it to hold...</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, curly and natural, no relaxer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional and my hair doesn&#x27;t just lay down</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t hold my edge up down for long and I&#x27;m a guy</li>
            <li> my hair has not because excessively dry and brittle (like it does with black gel) does not harden and then flake throughout the day (like with eco styling gel).</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> You only need to use very little.  </li>
            <li> I use only a small amount when applying it.  </li>
            <li> Then he said oh one side looks straighter than the other.</li>
            <li> The small container lasted me about 5 days on my edges only.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I only use a small amount around my edges and it stay laid almost all day.</li>
            <li> Thick, flakey, last only a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I was thoroughly dissolutioned and disenfranchised with the other products I tried.  </li>
            <li> It will eventually take off your edges so be careful!</li>
            <li> As for the supplier I will buy other items.</li>
            <li> Usually, after styling and using gel or other edge protectors, my hair begins to curl back up.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t had one in about 5 months due to keeping my hair weaved up</li>
            <li> I use a little of this mixed with a little water, and then brush into my edges.  </li>
            <li> I have tried Hicks and other products for edge control.  </li>
            <li> it slayed my nappy edges without leaving my hair dry &amp; stiff.  </li>
            <li> Tightly curly edges will have a harder time getting your hair to stay down.</li>
            <li> I have very thick natural hair</li>
            <li> It not only smooths my edges, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard or sticky.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I have to wash my hair after 2 uses, which is about every 3 days.  </li>
            <li> I  had purchased this product at the local beauty store but lately could not find it.</li>
            <li> It is not worth $15.00.</li>
            <li> Not worth spending over $7.</li>
            <li> Save your money because it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> The product came next day as promised in the late afternoon and came as advertised.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and coarse</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse 4C hair and have yet to find an edge control that works.</li>
            <li> I have very unruly 4 type hair that is difficult to lay down.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hold my sides down like the way I wanted it too.</li>
            <li> This lays down almost any hair type.  </li>
            <li> It holds down my edges all day.</li>
            <li> , ie spritz, hair spray, gel, head band to hold it down,  </li>
            <li> It does what it says it does, holds your edges down.</li>
            <li> and I tried putting it on at night then tying my hair down</li>
            <li> Place a scarf over the area to tie it down for 10 mins to mold the gel in place.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> It will keep your &amp;#34;baby hairs&amp;#34; down  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re slicking your hair down, it&#x27;ll become as if it were plastered in place.</li>
            <li> but if you tie the edges down with a silk scarf in between down time you can pro-long how it lasts throughout the day and limit building up product too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It straightened and laid my edges down.</li>
            <li> it lays down for maybe a min</li>
            <li> Adds shine &amp; lays your hair down for days.</li>
            <li> This gel holds thoses edges down without being flaky or caking up.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting something that would lay the edges down.</li>
            <li> I put it on my edges and tie them down for a while before I leave the house .</li>
            <li> It smoothes the hair edges extremely well and stays put for hours!   </li>
            <li> Works very well on edges and ends, especially during humid, bad hair, summer days.</li>
            <li> and if i put it on my side burns even less time.  </li>
            <li> aslo, i am black.</li>
            <li> But if your hair is straightened, texlaxed, texturized, or slightly curly it works.</li>
            <li> But I have found that if I wet my hair, apply this stuff and then use an extra firm hold spray like Pump, them suckers ain&#x27;t going nowhere!</li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;s a greasy mess</li>
            <li> ( tight ponytail / bun).</li>
            <li> Then I wrapped a tight scarf around my head.</li>
            <li> made my hair dry and/or hard.  </li>
            <li> I put just a little bit of Hicks on my edges and my hair lays all day.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money or frustration!</li>
            <li> All in all, it is not worth $15!</li>
            <li> I will have to wait a little while to see how well it aids with the regrowth of edges though.  </li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re like me, mix this with a little bit of the eco-styler gel and it will hold all day.  </li>
            <li> I used this the night before styling with a little holding spray.</li>
            <li> &quot; then that slick waxy, shiny greasy look of other edge controls.</li>
            <li> All you need is a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Reminds me of JAM a little.</li>
            <li> and I reapplied a little towards the end of the day which was no problem.  </li>
            <li> A little heavy and shiny.</li>
            <li> and I have very thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I am currently transitioning from relaxer to natural hair and Edges has been a God-send for my bad hair days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of these products over the years</li>
            <li> If i use it a few days in a row my hair feels tacky.  </li>
            <li> it does it make my hair wave and curl up like gel after a few min of having it on</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s too expensive for me to buy something that doesn&#x27;t completely work for me; but I will acknowledge it for it&#x27;s growth aid.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> The setbacks is that the texture is too firm and a bit oily, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of your money.</li>
            <li> It had a few dips in it as if somebody had used it already.</li>
            <li> I noticed it started flaking after a few days of using it.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works on others hair, for my hair, it makes my hair look &amp;#34;nappy&amp;#34;  after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Learned of this product after watching YouTube videos of people offering their opinions that this product will slick down your edges well.  </li>
            <li> Slick down edges without flaking</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been looking for something to tame my edges.</li>
            <li> A touch-up won&#x27;t tame it.</li>
            <li> My edges have been a little thin lately but ever since I began using this product on a daily basis, thinning is no longer an issue.</li>
            <li> Raw.</li>
            <li> and I use very little to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> I was not pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Edge gels don&#x27;t usually work on me at all or make my edges curlier which defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> The product does do what it says it&#x27;s going to do \\&quot;SLICK and STRAIGHTEN\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I use it on my three girl&#x27;s hair because it doesn&#x27;t cause excessive dryness or any damage to their hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get sticky, or chalk/waxy and doesn&#x27;t cause excessive oiliness or shine.</li>
            <li> and i will also say the the slick look and shine lasted all day and night</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong it does slick your edges back and in place.</li>
            <li> Have tried a small amount as well as generous amount</li>
            <li> n shines my hard to tame edges.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard but it temporarily flattens out kinks and coils when putting your hair into a ponytail.</li>
            <li> I also asked the young lady that worked there if she heard any bad complaints about it</li>
            <li> It just feels icky.  .  </li>
            <li> but I do not have thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Everyone asked her how does she get her edges to become very slick with her sew-ins; and she said hicks.</li>
            <li> Hold hair down but if humidity is out forget it will fail.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive &amp; doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped</li>
            <li> This is not good gel at all.</li>
            <li> This product also leaves a very nasty white residue even with minimal amounts applied.</li>
            <li> BUT when I left the house and got to work, my edges where curled up and fuzzy \\&quot;:(\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Thick!</li>
            <li> but she has thin hair on the sides.</li>
            <li> My edges where beginning to thin out and look raggedy; however, with edges it controls my edges with nourishing ingredients to promote growth.</li>
            <li> I applied a thin layer to my edges</li>
            <li> It does not leave my hair feeling heavy or dirty</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s game over.</li>
            <li> I hate that I spent $20 on this container and all that occurs is build up.</li>
            <li> after hearing rave reviews, I am a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use to use the olive oil edge control and hated it because it would cause my hair to get dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I will not be purchasing this procduct again.</li>
            <li> a bit expensive for the size of the product</li>
            <li> I often have a difficult time styling my hair.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> &quot; that ain&#x27;t for the faint of heart.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li> The 4 and 5 star reviews seem fake.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this product, but I still wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> Sorry,  just didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> This product is a bit expensive but you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> and sadly i must say it is disappointing me</li>
            <li> It looked like I had bad dandruff.</li>
            <li> I have nothing works!! :(</li>
            <li> , what did I just spend $15 on a worthless product</li>
            <li> And boy was I was shocked at the results!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Works horrible for me and anyone I&#x27;ve tried this on.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product!</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product for me.</li>
            <li> works wonders but smells nasty !</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last all day but it works for a while.   Update: This product also turns white and flakes which is a no-go for me. So I&#x27;m now giving it  2 stars instead of 3.</li>
            <li> It holds well, but just like every other edge control it does not last long. For me, it only lasts about 2-3 hours and then it&#x27;s a greasy mess</li>
            <li> as described and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> If you have ethnic hair and wear it natural this is the best way to control the baby hair around the edges. I have been looking for this product everywhere it lasts forever and is very well priced.</li>
            <li> Amazing hold, smells nice and NO FLAKING!</li>
            <li> The product was okay. It kind of made my hair feel a little too gunky though. I wanted light control and smoothing..it may have been just a litle much for me. My beautician asked immediately when I went in for a wash, &amp;#34;What is this in your hair?&amp;#34; She could tell I had used something different. I think it made my hair a little more heavy than I was used to. But it did straighten and smooth kinks.</li>
            <li> I HAVE LONG HAIR I WAS LOOKING TO GIVE ME A SEXY SLICK BACK LOOK .THIS WAS PERFECT .DID&#x27;NT MAKE YOUR HAIR FEEL STICKY DRY .. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> This stuffs works great, my only problem is that the product does flake up &amp; leaves a grey like substance if not brushed into the hair well.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with this product. I am a black female and my hair is not hard to manage. I saw someone raving about this product on youtube so I thought I would try it. It didn&#x27;t hold my sides down like the way I wanted it too. I gave it to my sister in law and she likes it but she has thin hair on the sides. I will just have to keep searching.</li>
            <li> This lays down almost any hair type.  If you have ruff edgfes you need this.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or flake up after applying and it last for about a week after one application if the hair is clean when applied.</li>
            <li> I love this, I use this when I&#x27;m wearing weaves for my edges and it keeps smooth throughout the day without buildup. I will continue to buy</li>
            <li> Hicks is highly overrated. If you have freshly relaxed hair then I&#x27;m sure this is great but if you are transitioning or a total natural then you may want to think again. I will admit this slicks your hair down really nicely and at first i was all oooo and aaahs when i first used it then about a hour later i found myself needing to reapply or smooth again. I will say that it great if your wear your hair in a ponytail or any style that requires tension/ pull but to me it isn&#x27;t that much better than olive oil ecostyler mixed with jam (my own lil mixture lol). I have 3c/4a hair and my texture is not course at all its soft with really fine &amp;#34;baby hair&amp;#34;. Hope this helps</li>
            <li> Love this product. tried it at a hair show and fell in love with it. I have very coarse hair around my edges and when I used&lt;br /&gt;this product they slicked my edges right on down. Non oily.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Hicks Edges!  My hair is very fine and thin. I have, what I call, fly-away hair around my edges.  I put just a little bit of Hicks on my edges and my hair lays all day.  The next day I don&#x27;t even need to reapply.  I just wet the brush, brush my hair, and my edges are as smooth as my first application.  My only complaint is that I have to wash my hair after 2 uses, which is about every 3 days.  I normally wash my hair once a week.  Overall, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product, edges look like just relaxed hair, keeps my edges straight and smooth between braidings. Will purchase again and again. Thanks</li>
            <li> I have natural 4c hair and currently I am wearing a weave to give my hair a break. I use hick&#x27;s edges on a daily basis to smooth my edges and I love this stuff. I&#x27;m surprised that others have said it doesn&#x27;t last them all day because it does for me and I have very thick coarse hair. So glad my hair stylist recommended this.</li>
            <li> Love the brand, but you can find for cheaper on the actual hicks website. Walmart is also now carrying it.</li>
            <li> Hicks is the best product for my hair. Holds hair in place without stickiness.  Washes out great. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this. The fact that it has Castor oil in it just makes me beam! It does cost too much because I have found a very cheap Brand at the dollar store that works even better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of these products over the years and I ultimately ended up going back to this one. It WILL NOT hold your edges ALL day but it is as close as it gets. Yes it costs twice as much but to get almost 8 hour hold makes it worth it for me. I am done experimenting........ for now.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my stylist. My edges where beginning to thin out and look raggedy; however, with edges it controls my edges with nourishing ingredients to promote growth. Love it...</li>
            <li> Love it! Fast shipping and works great! Thanks will buy again!</li>
            <li> Works better when my hair is straighten vs. Natural, but doesn&#x27;t last long.. I&#x27;ve even tried to tying my hair down and still doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for edges and it works great but can build up quickly.  I use only a small amount when applying it.  I did use it to twist dry hair and the twists were elongated and shiny.  This is not this product&#x27;s intended use but nevertheless it had great results.  Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is as good as it says. if you use it and tie down your edges for a couple of hours, it will last all day!</li>
            <li> Learned of this product after watching YouTube videos of people offering their opinions that this product will slick down your edges well.  I like it.  It has not flaked, just held my hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little pricey, but hair products that have good ingredients usually are.</li>
            <li> I was in the hair care store and I saw it on the shelf. When I saw the eye popping price I put it back on the shelf. But since I&#x27;m a sucker for trying new things I went back to it. I also asked the young lady that worked there if she heard any bad complaints about it and she said no not at all. She even added that she had never use it but it flies off of the shelf and everyone is buying it. So I said well I will try it and see how it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this moment I have relaxed medium length hair and in need of a touch up. I applied it only to one side at first to be on the safe side. And boy was I was shocked at the results! My edges became really straight and smooth. And the best part of all is it&#x27;s not greasy or oily or stiff, but soft to the touch. The trick that I always use when it comes to my edges no matter what I&#x27;ve used in the present and the past is to put the product on and use a flat cut tooth brush to smooth the edges evenly. Just make sure the tooth brush doesn&#x27;t have ridges like the kind that is used for reaching the back of your gums. The final test was to see if my husband could tell the difference. I put the Hicks in on one side only and pulled my hair back in a pony tail and asked him look at my hair and tell me what you notice. At first he said you have a pony tail now, but hey you know how men are. Then he said oh one side looks straighter than the other. So far I had Hicks in for 3 days and so far so good. I apply everyday all around my edges in the morning and it last all day. Remember that the instructions does say make sure you apply it to clean hair ladies. But I love this product and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Awesome sauce.  Professional, speedy delivery.  As advertised product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I have really rough edges but hicks edge control held them down and wasn&#x27;t greasy or create white stuff on my hair. And you don&#x27;t even have to apply more edge control just a little water. I love this stuff. I finally found something for my edges.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work at all...I applied it to my edges and 3 minutes later they sticking back up...Plus if a white residue.</li>
            <li> Works well, way better than any edge gel that I have used in the past. Edge gels don&#x27;t usually work on me at all or make my edges curlier which defeats the purpose. This one does not do that. I will absolutely continue to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve had yet. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine persuaded me to purchase Hicks.  I&#x27;m not a jell fan, however Hicks by far is the best hair jell I have used.</li>
            <li> I  had purchased this product at the local beauty store but lately could not find it. Was very glad to locate it on Amazon. The exact product I previously used. Works very well on edges and ends, especially during humid, bad hair, summer days.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely great product!  It smoothes the hair edges extremely well and stays put for hours!   Will definitely be buying again!  One of the best hair products for smoothing edges that I have found.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this product to me. I find that it does gold my edges in tact but not for a long period of time. Also I do notice some very minimumal flaking</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job of smoothing down my hair and keeping it in place. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen reviews about this product on YouTube, which made me want to purchase this product. I&#x27;ve been natural for 2 1/2 year&#x27;s and I&#x27;ve been looking for something to tame my edges. Honestly, I have mixed reviews about this product. The product does do what it says it&#x27;s going to do \\&quot;SLICK and STRAIGHTEN\\&quot;. However, I found that the hold ONLY stay for a while. It&#x27;s NOT an all day hold. As soon as I put this product on it smooth out my edges \\&quot;:)\\&quot; BUT when I left the house and got to work, my edges where curled up and fuzzy \\&quot;:(\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the weather because I did purchase this product in the summer or what. I will see how this product do in the winter. Needless to say I will not be purchasing this procduct again. I will stick to my Eco-style and Pro-style gel.</li>
            <li> My edges stays a little straight for maybe 30mins or so.  After that u can&#x27;t really tell I used it.  The small container lasted me about 5 days on my edges only.  My hair is thick and coarse so maybe it&#x27;s meant for softer textured hair.</li>
            <li> This seems to be the only gel that works for my 4c type hair. It holds down my edges all day. The only issue I have with it is that after a couple of days you have to wash your hair otherwise you will get that white build up look.</li>
            <li> Worst the best on my edges. Gives me that perfect look I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like at all.</li>
            <li> This product meets my hair needs. I&#x27;m  in love with  this Hicks product.</li>
            <li> Works great, does not flake, stays pit all day, smoothest the edges, and straighten the hair.  It is great for Afro American hair</li>
            <li> This is not good gel at all. It turns your hair white and DRY! Plus it&#x27;s very sticky, even when you only use small amounts.</li>
            <li> I love this edge control. It&#x27;s better than almost every edge control I&#x27;ve used. I think it gives great hold and also doesn&#x27;t leave your hair flaky after numerous uses. I was introduced to it by one of the hairstylist I used and I&#x27;m really glad I got to try it.</li>
            <li> Bought this based on rave reviews. It looked good for literally 5 minutes. After 5 minutes it turned greasy and my edges lifted up. My hair is 4c so it may work on looser curls. Also, even if it worked nothing justifies 14 dollars for this much gel. Especially one that is greasy and does not hold.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I&amp;#34;ve used it for over 3 years and I&#x27;m satisfied every time. This is a great product wish it could be purchased at national beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Normally this product isn&#x27;t greasy &amp; it holds all day, however this formula that I received isn&#x27;t the same as in the store. I think it&#x27;s a dupe!</li>
            <li> No no no no noooo. Works horrible for me and anyone I&#x27;ve tried this on. Even if it successfully managed to slick edges it&#x27;s only temporary as they revert quite quickly even ehen I use a scarf to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; the hold. This product also leaves a very nasty white residue even with minimal amounts applied. I have natural hair and this does seem to work SLIGHTLY better on relaxed individuals. I paid $16 for this at my local BSS after all the trace reviews and can definitely say this is a total skip for me. Not worth the money or frustration!</li>
            <li> My stylist has been using this on my edges for years...it&#x27;s perfect for hold without drying out the hair like gel....no white crunchy flakiness.  In fact, years ago, when I lost a majority of my hair, this product made my edges GROW!  I swear by it.</li>
            <li> This is a must have product if you are wearing your hair natural or not.  Provides really good shine to your hair as well as holds the hair in place.  Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky and makes your hair looks as though it is relaxed.  Amazing product!</li>
            <li> I am currently transitioning from relaxer to natural hair and Edges has been a God-send for my bad hair days. My husband has locks and he uses it also. I use it on my three girl&#x27;s hair because it doesn&#x27;t cause excessive dryness or any damage to their hair. I wish there was like a buy 1 get 2 for a discount deal so far I have purchased 3 in a 4 month time span.</li>
            <li> Before you buy the hicks total transformations please read this review. I first was introduced to hicks total transformations by latoya (lil&#x27; waynes daughters mother\\&quot;, through twitter. Everyone asked her how does she get her edges to become very slick with her sew-ins; and she said hicks. I have noticed that this hair product is available in beauty supply stores on the east coast but NOT in the west coast. I first used hicks when i fresh came out the beauty salon with a fresh press. I used a friends hicks container and used just a tab on my edges; it worked fine and blended in nice. Then weeks later I purchased my own. Hicks is a good product for others but NOT FOR ME! It says it does not flake but it does for me. It makes my edges become white and have build up. I even thought maybe my scalp is dry, so I use to add oil before I used the hicks then applied oil on top of it, but white and flake-ness still occurred. I hate that I spent $20 on this container and all that occurs is build up. I have even used Edge Control, and Hair Lace Virgin and those as well flake up. But or my sisters Hicks works wonderful for their edges to be laid down.. So be mindful of when you purchase this hair, you might have awesome results then you might not.</li>
            <li> Best edge control, you don&#x27;t have to worry about that greasy feeling</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product! It was recommended by my beautician. It is not worth $15.00. I will continue to use my $5.00 QP Mango Butter.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this stuff in any stores ! Love it !!!</li>
            <li> Great product &#x3D; no flake, not heavy, no build up</li>
            <li> Does not wok for natural hair</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff, don&#x27;t leave any flakes or white residue, my daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders! You don&#x27;t need a relaxer when you have this!</li>
            <li> When I first apply this product my edges look AMAZING! however, this edge control does not last throughout the day and for $15 I expected it to last for 2 days! (over exaggerating, but it still should last longer than an hour or 2). All in all, it is not worth $15!</li>
            <li> I finally found a product that works on my natural hair! Just make sure you follow the instructions and make sure your hair is always clean before the application of the product...otherwise the product will build up on your hair and not work as well:)</li>
            <li> Thought I finally found the best edge tamer there is. After about fifteen minutes my hair looks as if I haven&#x27;t put anything on it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is hair crack! I LOVE IT! I have used multiple edge controls and they&#x27;re all either make my hair greasy or my edges and baby hair rolls up within an hour or two! A little goes a long way! It holds all day and does not get greasy. It&#x27;s the absolute best edge control I have yet to try, I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Best edge control on the market.  Doesn&#x27;t get sticky, or chalk/waxy and doesn&#x27;t cause excessive oiliness or shine. Lightweight and does the job very well.</li>
            <li> This really lay down your edges</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase!!!!!</li>
            <li> the product holds edges &#x27;ok&#x27; but it flakes up just like all the others.</li>
            <li> Very good gel holds the hair and does not cake up plus you can brush or comb through it when it dries very nice product.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s nice and thick but not so thick that it pulls and damages my baby hair. Great stuff</li>
            <li> This is one of the best edge control products I&#x27;ve ever purchased!!! But do not overuse or pile on everyday because it will turn white and there is quite a bit of buildup.  A little goes a long way.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the buildup but I have natural hair and nothing has snatched my edges like this ever!</li>
            <li> Very good product doesnt leave my hair hard does a good job of slicking my edges down will buy again</li>
            <li> After a lot of thinking I purchased it. I&#x27;m not sure I love it though.  I have natural hair about 4b. I don&#x27;t pull my hair up often,  I&#x27;m not a professional and my hair doesn&#x27;t just lay down so I gave this a 3.  I put this on and I absolutely love it.  Hair lays right down and I use very little to get the job done.  But, it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  I&#x27;m talking about an hour tops and if i put it on my side burns even less time.  I don&#x27;t know if you have to doctor it, ie spritz, hair spray, gel, head band to hold it down,  but it doesn&#x27;t hold for long in the nice slick and smooth you get when you first put it on.  The hair stays in place its just not as polished it just frizzes up and you see those rebellious roots start to kick up.  I don&#x27;t like the build up.  If i use it a few days in a row my hair feels tacky.  Almost like I have a wax on it.  It just feels icky.  .  You may have a better experience with it but mine has been like every other edge control, tight and right while going on and an hour later it looks like you did nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always stuck between this and Keracare. They run close, but I love Hicks. Lays down longer and actually grows your edges!</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and it doesn&#x27;t flake. It just doesn&#x27;t last all day for me. Maybe mainly because I don&#x27;t have relaxed hair</li>
            <li> I used to buy the ORS edge control and decided to try this because I thought it would be the a lot better. Especially for the higher price. But nope, it was a \\&quot;little\\&quot; better because it didn&#x27;t flake up but the hold was just the same. Not worth spending over $7.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the rave reviews. Yes at first when you apply it looks amazing but blink twice and your edges have curled back up and the product is white and gummy. I will never use this agin nor recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works better than the others.  Highly recommended. I love it, so you will love it. By far, the best edge control.</li>
            <li> I just got it in the mail and could not wait to try it so i apply Elasta QP mango butter and olive oil hair milk and a little grape seed oil to my edges and nape first lightly combed it in and then applied the hick edges and OMG&lt;br /&gt;this is the best ever. I am 7 weeks post and i have try so many others that didn&#x27;t lay my hair down and didn&#x27;t give it the shine that i got in just one use of the hick edge pomade plus i like the fact that it help your edges&lt;br /&gt;grow and not break them off and i will also say the the slick look and shine lasted all day and night this stuff&lt;br /&gt;is the BEST my hair looked like i just got a fresh relaxer and that is the look i wont at all times.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for 2 years now and love it!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product! It makes my edges smooth and straight, without the flaking and hardness of a gel.</li>
            <li> Great product for laying down edges.  A bit pricey though.</li>
            <li> So My old stylist used to use this all the time on her clients so I started using it and I love it! well........i did love it when I had relaxed hair but now that I am natural I feel like all it does it make my hair wave and curl up like gel after a few min of having it on or if i get in the least bit warm. If youre relaxed its amazing hold</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to keep my edges looking smooth when I am stretching my relaxers. It seems to be doing the job and leaves no residue or hardness. I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product. Works well on my fly away edges and does not cause build up. Also smells ok.</li>
            <li> i love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very good product and my edges are really better with this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will re order !!!</li>
            <li> it does not hold my natural hair down for long only about 30 mins and that  all .... but if your have fine it it will work with no problem ... use it  my sister hair works great</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does, holds your edges down. I was looking for something to give me a smoother look when I slap my hair back in a ponytail and Hicks works great. It holds all day. No white or sticky residue.</li>
            <li> It worked well, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again. The price is a little more expensive than I&#x27;d like. I can find others that work the same for a better price.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do.  I absolutely love it!!  I&#x27;ve tried several different types of edge control products and this one by far beats them all.</li>
            <li> It lays the edges somewhat but not as good as the reviews that I&#x27;ve read previously. I found the ecostyle gel works better. I purchased them both at the same time. it is cheaper and comes in a larger container. I will use this since I bought it already but I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product since my hair was very thin on the edges and short from breakage, It did not take much to get my hair to lay down and it did not give me any flakiness or discolor. I really like this product. My granddaughter is a competitive cheerleader and she recently used it, no problems, no flakes and her hair held well in the ponytail.</li>
            <li> Love it especially on virgin hair works great</li>
            <li> I guess I don&#x27;t know how to use edge stylers. I find they leave a white residue on my edges. If anyone has suggestions or tips, I&#x27;m all ears.</li>
            <li> I just received this hair gel 3/2/15. I used it right away.  My hair stayed in place  all  day. Left my hair  soft,manageable. Will be purchasing again. I love it.</li>
            <li> The best edge control that I&#x27;ve tried on my nappy edges! I have tried a lot of edge tamers and this one, makes it look like I actually have a relaxer, or at least a good grade of hair, which I do not!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product everytime I use it. It gives me slick edges likeci have a fresh relaxer. I have natural hair and hicks is the only edge control that I can say works for me</li>
            <li> It smells great. I have natural hair and when I put on my edges lay very straight and flat without me having to brush them.  I gave it 3 out 5 because it doesn&#x27;t last all day and I tried putting it on at night then tying my hair down but that still doesn&#x27;t make it last all day. It is still a good product.</li>
            <li> I love this gel.  I had gorgeous beautiful black waves in my hair with no flakes and I received several compliments plus I slept on it and I will woke up looking beautiful.  I have natural hair and I use natural hair products.  I tried Creme of Nature Perfect Edges and I received comments about flakes in my hair plus it didn&#x27;t hold my hair longer than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Honestly it didnt work for me it says it work on natural hair which it didn&#x27;t because Im natural when I use it it&#x27;ll stick down for a few minutes before my hair poofs up and it is a bit sticky but hey to each his own but it&#x27;s not for me</li>
            <li> Nothing special. i have natural hair that I currently wear straight (flat ironed). This doesn&#x27;t really hold my edges down for long. Within 30 mins they&#x27;re curled up again. You have to do the same old method that you&#x27;d use with any gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Apply gel.&lt;br /&gt;2. Brush in direction you want it.&lt;br /&gt;3. Place a scarf over the area to tie it down for 10 mins to mold the gel in place.&lt;br /&gt;4. Remove and hope it holds.</li>
            <li> Good product. .even works on lacefront wigs.</li>
            <li> This edge control is pretty decent. I have thick, coarse 4C hair and have yet to find an edge control that works. This hasn&#x27;t managed to control my edges but I still use it everyday for the minimum control that it can provide and I have noticed my edges are growing in tremendously! My edges have been a little thin lately but ever since I began using this product on a daily basis, thinning is no longer an issue. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this product again after I finish it, it&#x27;s too expensive for me to buy something that doesn&#x27;t completely work for me; but I will acknowledge it for it&#x27;s growth aid.</li>
            <li> The best edge control thats out and Ive tried mostly all of them!</li>
            <li> At first this seemed like it was going to work for me. I applied a thin layer to my edges and I liked how it looked. I didn&#x27;t like how greasy thge poduct felt on my edges,but I thought it would soak in and still hold. not! I left it on overnight and the the next day all of the greasy product had migrated into my fine strands! On top of that.. My edges didn&#x27;t hold!  Disaster! It took me awhile to wash the gunk out of my hair. What a waste.</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of great reviews about Hicks that is why i purchased this product. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it does slick your edges back and in place. But it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I had a youtuber recommend this for edge control. It is amazing. It has the feeling of elasta qp&#x27;s glaze but doesn&#x27;t get greasy and holds like proclaim protein gel. Enough hold for hair to be layed for 12+ hours but still easy to restyle for the next day. Finally something that won&#x27;t tear my edges up.</li>
            <li> a bit expensive for the size of the product but it works great</li>
            <li> For my hair. It is very soft and probably only works better for those with softer textures. I have 4d hair and my hair just laughed at that stuff.</li>
            <li> this is great for a ponytail and it is good to use everyday. no build up at all.&lt;br /&gt;you should try it.</li>
            <li> It will keep your &amp;#34;baby hairs&amp;#34; down  that&#x27;s foresure . overall great product for anyone who likes high buns or pony tails</li>
            <li> This product works well in maintaining hairstyles that are elaborately arranged and for smoothing the hairline. The setbacks is that the texture is too firm and a bit oily, in my opinion. The firmness makes it a chore to apply to the hair to my liking. To provide a visual, think of tape being applied to leather then removing it. Now imagine trying to maneuver your hair after applying this product to it. Ouch! :^D  Once it sets in, the firmness of its texture decreases and you&#x27;re better able to style your hair which is why I gave it four stars. If you&#x27;re looking for a product that will smooth your hairline this is a great product for that.</li>
            <li> great shipping time &amp; product works great! I would purchase again!! First time I used this product but it won&#x27;t be the last time.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it does what it advertise to do . It&#x27;s great!! You&#x27;ll really love it.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and bought this based on other reviews. After I finish washing and straightening my hair I put this on my edges with a scarf and it turns out beautifully. However the next day or maybe 5 or so hours later it&#x27;s like pooff!!!! It becomes frizzy and unmanageable. After that first day you can forget it.. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much you put on your edges after that it just doesn&#x27;t lay.</li>
            <li> Hold hair down but if humidity is out forget it will fail. Non greasy which is good it&#x27;s just okay</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last at all</li>
            <li> Works good for most of the day, but doesn&#x27;t hold all day long.  It&#x27;s a little expensive &amp; doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped</li>
            <li> i put it on and by 3 hours i have to re apply... i dont sweat much. aslo, i am black.</li>
            <li> This hicks edge control is a must have for any kind of hair i have to say that i was suspicious at first, how was it possible to lay your edges down without using a super thick alcohol based gel but to my surprise  it slayed my nappy edges without leaving my hair dry &amp; stiff.  my hair was still pliable after applying it which allowed me to change my hair style as many times as i wanted.</li>
            <li> I really like Hicks Edges this is my first time purchasing this product after researching several reviews on You tube! This product doe smooth out your edges pretty well but its seems to work even better with relaxed hair or fine hair! Without a relaxer it seems to work similar to Let&#x27;s Jam Gel , In high heat temps it does not hold for long periods of time :</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had this stuff and I tried hers. I was amazed by how good it laid my edges DOWN! So I had to get one of my own because my friend is stingy, lol. I love this stuff! I only use a small amount around my edges and it stay laid almost all day. I use it mostly in the winter because I sweat a lot in the summer, but it holds in the hot/humid weather too. Even though it doesn&#x27;t last a long time, my hair still stays down and it does  not DRY out my hair so that&#x27;s the best thing about this stuff. Also, this is not the kind of stuff that you can keep applying because it builds up quicker than my hair gel! You should wash your hair BEFORE applying this stuff. Overall, it&#x27;s a good product for me.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product and I&#x27;m a product junkie. I think it&#x27;s one of the best on the market.</li>
            <li> The product does a wonderful job taming your edges. It is worth the money. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is another product that I tried because of the rave reviews on various blogs/websites. This is a horrible product for me. I am a natural girl with 3c/4a hair..I do not like that this product seems to repel moisture. It feel sticky and is a lint magnet. It just did not work for me at all and won&#x27;t be ordered again. Should have known that you get what you pay for (sometimes:), my hairdresser uses a similar product that is $20 a pop, but works like a charm!!</li>
            <li> Product does what it says it will do... However, product leaves flakey and gummy feelings residue once it dries..</li>
            <li> All I can say is that this is not the right type of edge control for my hair. It melts right off.</li>
            <li> It does not work good for my edges. Keracare Edge Tamer works best for me. It&#x27;s about the same price as Hicks but it&#x27;s smaller.</li>
            <li> My first reaction was an elongated \\&quot;wooooooow\\&quot; as I applied this product to my kinky coily hairline that normally springs right back when I try to get it to stay flat. You only need a teeney weeny bit too so the tub should last for a long time. Downside - same as one of my other 4c hair favourites (My Honey Child 4c Hair Creme) - is that I cannot get it here in the UK nor can I find a supplier that will ship it here. I have a sis in NJ who sends it on to me but it would be nice to be able to get it here.  Still giving it 5 stars though because it deserves every star despite the hassle to get it here xx</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It keeps my hair looking nice when it&#x27;s in a ponytail.</li>
            <li> this product didn&#x27;t help my edges at all. I thought it would lay them down flat and hold but it didn&#x27;t - I won&#x27;t purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;Note: my comment has nothing to do witht the seller, just the product.</li>
            <li> Awesome edge control! I have tried them all, and this is the best hands down.</li>
            <li> Love this item!!!! Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best edge control products I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> delivery was on time, but product was just okay.</li>
            <li> GET THIS RIGHT NOW...it&#x27;s amazing it even laid down my wet edges.... So worth the money...just saying</li>
            <li> I wish I had never purchased this product. I have been using Hick Edges for a long time and I think the content in which was in those containers call Hick Edges was a knock off product. I would like a refund.</li>
            <li> Great with clean hair! Follow the directions and all should be well. Don&#x27;t like that it melts in sunny or hot weather though 😐</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! As a woman with natural hair I often have a difficult time styling my hair. If you don&#x27;t like the feel of product in your hair this may not be for you, but I love it. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard but it temporarily flattens out kinks and coils when putting your hair into a ponytail. The more you brush/comb, the flatter it gets. I think it&#x27;s a must have for those people with natural hair who struggle with the frizz and have a hard time getting their hair into a neat ponytail.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist used this after I got a sew-in on my edges.  I quickly purchased a container for my own use.  I use it in the morning as I am getting ready but before I leave the house, my edges have lifted.  Granted they are not \\&quot;nappy\\&quot; but they do not remain smooth.  I would not recommend spending $17 on this product.</li>
            <li> This does not cape up on the edges. Great product works for me.</li>
            <li> Really holds hair and smells great! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is a best product to tame my edges</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  Gets flaky after about an hour of being applied. Does not keep hair sleek. Olive oil edge works better and cost less.</li>
            <li> I have tried many edge products and they all fell short of holding edges down for an extended amount of time. Many start off looking great, smooth edges, shiny and overall healthy looking edges and leaving my hairstyle looking uniformed and neat. As the day wears on, the shine is lost, the hold disappears, the edges starts to curl back up and by the time you get home the style shows how long day of a day I had.  Sometimes I would have to freshen up the edges later on in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered Hicks Edges pomade and fell in love with it instantly.  I added a few drops of essential oils and rubbed my hands together before applying it to my hair. Its very easy to work with. It blends into hair nicely, doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot of brushing to work into hair.  I was amazed, the hold set in so quickly.  My hair was soft to the touch.  I have to say I am totally impressed.  I will have to wait a little while to see how well it aids with the regrowth of edges though.  But for the most part I like the product.  Will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> I love, love, LOVE this product!! I just received this product on Wednesday.  And after hearing and reading great reviews I decided to buy it. This product really lays DOWN my edges like it&#x27;s a fresh relaxer. And it smells very nice!</li>
            <li> amazing hold for your edges.</li>
            <li> Great product will purchase again! Didn&#x27;t think it was gonna be this great!! I use this product on my clients they love it!</li>
            <li> Love love love this. I have been natural for a little over a year and could not find anything to smooth down my edges for the perfect bun and this actually works. I&#x27;m very frugal but this is worth the bucks.</li>
            <li> After using many products out there that claim to \\&quot;tame\\&quot; your edges, this worked for me and my hair is 4C, very kinky/coarse, in its natural state. My edges stayed smooth for more than a few hours with no reapplication needed. Overall, I am pleased with how Hicks Edges performed. The price may be high compared to other holding gels, etc., but I spent countless dollars on products that claimed to do what this one does and those products didn&#x27;t work, so I figure it easily balances out. I hope it works for you.</li>
            <li> For African American women, not much out there that&#x27;s better to hold the edges down for a bun. Too sticky to use for much else.</li>
            <li> If there is a better edge cream, I don&#x27;t know it!!!!! This stuff is AMAZING!!!!! I have natural hair that&#x27;s not very coarse especially around the edges, but is very curly. Now back in my perm days I would not have needed this stuff; even when I was 2 -3 months into a perm I could lay my edges flat with a little spittle (I know, gross), a touch of 99 cent gel, or a dab of mousse / hair spray. But now that I&#x27;m natural, and when I want the front to be smooth this stuff does the trick. I also love wetting my entire head and applying a handful to slick all of my hair when I do a snatch back ( tight ponytail / bun). And while it doesn&#x27;t stay super shiny and wet looking all day,man o&#x27; man, once you grab all of your hair with a ponytail holder it will hold your hair DOWN all day!!! Shoot for several days! But be warned it does dry your hair out! FYI: The best thing for dry hair is Salerm 21 (LOVE IT!!!). But like others have said, it doesn&#x27;t hold the tiny edge hairs / baby hairs super flat all day, and you will have to re-apply. But considering the facr that it lays my curls flat at all is worth it! But I have found that if I wet my hair, apply this stuff and then use an extra firm hold spray like Pump, them suckers ain&#x27;t going nowhere! But be warned, Pump is the real deal; it&#x27;s a \\&quot;protein hold spray\\&quot; that ain&#x27;t for the faint of heart. Your hair will not move!!! If you&#x27;re doing a roller set it will stay through a hurricane!!! If you&#x27;re slicking your hair down, it&#x27;ll become as if it were plastered in place. And the only way to \\&quot;reverse\\&quot; the hold is with water or by washing Pump out. There are two kinds of Pump, the one I&#x27;m referring to is a liquid that looks like pink-lemonade.  HAPPY STYLING!!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited about the arrival of this styling gel. A good friend recommended it with rave reviews. However after a week of use, I must say I am not a fan! It does nothing for my 4A natural hair. It lays the edges down upon first application, then a few seconds later, my hair is back in its natural state. I will admit that there is no flacking, but it just doesn&#x27;t hold like I expected.</li>
            <li> My favorite Gel ! Doesn&#x27;t leave my fave looking greasy even when I work out and it&#x27;s great for baby hairs !</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of your money. It doesn&#x27;t do anymore than the 1.99, gel does. Just a true waste of 15.00 for me. Will never order this again nor pay this much for gel.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does but it doesnt last all day.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hick&#x27;s Edges for a while now and have seen it priced from around $12-$16 in stores and online (including shipping). I think when considering what the product does and its use, it is well worth the money. I have natural (African-American) hair and wear it curly a lot, and when I wear my  hair straight, I use this to smooth out my edges when they start to flare up. In being realistic, this is not a relaxer or a substitute for a relaxer. It has a good lasting time and even when it does seem to fade or give into the frizz, it still looks nice; not as fresh, but nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using this product alone and not in combination with any others. I use it when wearing my hair straight only. It does not leave a residue, but will build up over time. I apply it to the outer most edges of my hair where its the thinnest on my skin. the thicker the area of hair you apply it to, the less likely you will see it last. I apply it to the edges and brush it (smooth it back) and tie a skinny scarf around the edges for 5-15 minutes. I then remove the silk scarf to reveal beautiful edges. The crisp look won&#x27;t last through a work out or forever but if you tie the edges down with a silk scarf in between down time you can pro-long how it lasts throughout the day and limit building up product too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and if you have realistic expectations you will benefit the most from it.</li>
            <li> really do the job by laying all peace of hair</li>
            <li> Really holds my edges down without making the hair feel hard</li>
            <li> I love that the product smooths my edges without leaving any residue.  Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> HICKS will get those edges straight. It was exactly what I needed to make my hair blend</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without....</li>
            <li> Lays those unpermed edge down real good.. No flakiness and only need a little.</li>
            <li> Many people have recommended this product to me. I really wanted to like it but it doesn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately. It leaves white residue no matter how little i apply and my edges are lifted back up like 20 mins later. Maybe it works better on people with softer hair or relaxed hair. I&#x27;m natural, won&#x27;t be purchasing again...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and it works great especially if you have natural hair. It lays your edges and &amp;#34;kitchen&amp;#34; down very well almost like you have a relaxer, lasts all day, no alcohol, doesn&#x27;t dry your hair and it actually made my edges grow which was a plus. However, I wear weaves now and it tends to be a bit greasy as the weave starts to look shiny by end of the week. Otherwise a great product!</li>
            <li> amazing product, but once you start reaching towards the end of the edge control jar it gets really sticky and sometimes turns your hair white</li>
            <li> Works great when my edges are straight. But when my hair is in its natural state doesn&#x27;t seem to work well. It does not leave my hair feeling heavy or dirty</li>
            <li> works wonders but smells nasty !</li>
            <li> I love the way it goes on but it doesn&#x27;t hold my semi natural edges all day. I think it would be perfect if I was relaxed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good edge control for when I have a sew in or a new hairstyle. &amp; this is perfect. Great hold, doesn&#x27;t cake or flake up. **I have relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> No good doesn&#x27;t hold long and it&#x27;s very sticky and it makes my hair very dry and flakey I&#x27;ll stick too Creme of Nature Argan oil Perfect Edges Control it holds longer smells amazing keeps my hair nice and shiny worth my money</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing - best edge cream I have ever used and have tried many!&lt;br /&gt;Does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li> Awesome great for natural hair</li>
            <li> Thick, flakey, last only a few minutes.  Product goes on with a shine and looks great with very a normal amount.  I watched videos online and then purchased at the recommendation of my hair dresser.  After getting my hair nicely done, she put in on as a last step before I left the salon.  I was impressed. Now I know why she waited just before I left the salon.  By the time I looked in a mirror after leaving and purchasing some on my own  for $14.99, I had my hair revert and it was flakey (even the labeling says non-flakey that&#x27;s why I bought it)..  I&#x27;m natural for 10 years and needed something to keep the edges under control.  This is not the right product for edge control.  Read all the 1 and 2 star reviews before purchasing any product then make up your mind regarding purchase. The 4 and 5 star reviews seem fake.  If I did not have to travel so far to return the product, I would have returned it quickly.  NOT recommended!!  Beware.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It&#x27;s better than using gel on my hair all the time. It&#x27;s a must have product.</li>
            <li> I think this product is more for relaxed hair than natural hair, because it really dried out my hair, but it really works.</li>
            <li> The best edge control i&#x27;ve ever used BUT...it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> This gel will keep your edges in place all day, even if it&#x27;s humid outside.  I bought 2 jars and plan to be a repeat customer for a very long time!</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, curly and natural, no relaxer.  I bought several different edge gels, pomades and creams to hold my edges down when pulling my hair back.  Most of them either didn&#x27;t hold past me getting out the front door, flaked, made my hair dry and/or hard.  I was thoroughly dissolutioned and disenfranchised with the other products I tried.  I took a shot on hicks because the reviews were good and I needed something.  Well I&#x27;m happy to say this really works.  No flaking, greasy residue, hard/dry hair and it does hold for a while.  I sweat in my head/hair.  So if you&#x27;re like me, mix this with a little bit of the eco-styler gel and it will hold all day.  Your edges will be smooth, sleek and under control.</li>
            <li> It worked. Didn&#x27;t flake. Recommended by my sister&#x27;s friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone. A bit expensive than the other edge controls but this one worked great.</li>
            <li> I had watched so many youtube reviews on this product so I thought I would give it a try. I have natural 4c hair. I have tried ORS edge control, murray&#x27;s pomade, ecostyler, basically I have tried a lot of products. When I put it on, I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. It straightened and laid my edges down. However, 45 minutes later, I noticed white flakes. It looked like I had bad dandruff. I&#x27;m going to probably give this to my relaxed friend. No repurchase for me.</li>
            <li> Thick! Does the job but will not last. Edges lay for a little while and then frizz back up.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> The only thing that will curl or smooth my edges long term</li>
            <li> Do not purchase. Did not perform as demonstrated on YouTube. Looked great at first but did not last that long.  Save your money because it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a friend. It is my go to control to use with weaves. You can&#x27;t use too much because it will leave a white cast. Overall great product.</li>
            <li> Works well to control edges.</li>
            <li> I have 3b hair, and this product works really well on my edges.</li>
            <li> I have very unruly 4 type hair that is difficult to lay down.  So far this is the best that I have used to smooth my edges and tames my fly-aways.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping A+++++++</li>
            <li> so ive been using this for quite a while and sadly i must say it is disappointing me i have natural 4b hair and i use this on my edges it lays down for maybe a min than im curly again i can say that when i put it on a night and lay it down with a scarf it does help hold for a few hours but still not all day it leaves a nastyy white look to my hair and recently ive been noticing that my scalp is really flaky and sore is it worth 17 bucks.. ahh no</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Great for edges... waaayyy better than any other edge control.</li>
            <li> was very suprised that this company sold this product. every woman with curly thick  to fine hair should have a jar.</li>
            <li> What I really like is that there is no flaking or discoloration. But it doesn&#x27;t last long. My hair is super curly so I just had to understand that my edges are just going curl.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have used it before and will continue to use it. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the fuss is all about. my hair dresser raved about this stuff so I decided to purchase it here because it was cheaper too.  Its leaves a white residue on the sides and its sticky, not a fan.  this will sit in bathroom cabinet and more than likely go unused</li>
            <li> I use EcoStyler and purchased this because of youtube.  I&#x27;m back with Ecostyler.  I have been natural for 2 years but I do not have thick hair.  It is very easy to lay my hair down but I didn&#x27;t like how this compared to EcoStyler so I gave it away.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! HOWVEVER, as with all edge controllers, it shouldn&#x27;t be used every day. It will eventually take off your edges so be careful! But it works wonders.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. It does grow your edges- although that wasn&#x27;t my issue- I needed something to make them appear freshly relaxed because I don&#x27;t relax my edges often.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone. It arrived pretty quickly, however when i opened the product it looked as if it was used prior. It had a few dips in it as if somebody had used it already.</li>
            <li> I am an all natural girl who also rocks indian hair sew-ins from time to time...this is one of my essential hair items to lay my edges down right so that they can match the texture of the weave and I can KEEP my edges lol.</li>
            <li> As a cosmetologist this is the best priced edge control. It doesn&#x27;t flake the hair stays soft and smooth!!!</li>
            <li> I arrived quick and packaged well.  I used it 3 times it is not all that it is cracked up to be.  I don&#x27;t like the white flakes it leaves in my hair when it dries.  I won&#x27;t buy this product again.  As for the supplier I will buy other items.</li>
            <li> This is is the best edge control I have come across yet. No other lays my hair like Hicks! Awesome.</li>
            <li> Natural hair for 5 years, works to slick down edges without too much shine (like jam) my hair has not because excessively dry and brittle (like it does with black gel) does not harden and then flake throughout the day (like with eco styling gel). Now my sister is buying herself a jar.</li>
            <li> This works real good for edges but it does cause breakage. I recommend not using regularly and putting oil on edges before this product</li>
            <li> Hicks is the truth. Simple. But it doesn&#x27;t work as well on natural hair as I would expect. But if your hair is straightened, texlaxed, texturized, or slightly curly it works. You will need to apply, tie down, and let it dry appropriately. Tightly curly edges will have a harder time getting your hair to stay down. It melts easily so stay away from heat, humidity, or sweating.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff on the planet....I have been natural for almost a year &amp; this stuff controls your curls, or waves or whatever your hair type may be. Nice clean non-over bearing scent. Yeah, it&#x27;s a bit pricey &amp; normally I would never pay this much for this type of product...but it&#x27;s worth the money and I&#x27;ve already ordered my second batch. Adds shine &amp; lays your hair down for days. You&#x27;ll not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with natural 4c hair and I&#x27;m telling you this product has my edges laid for the GODS! I never write reviews on things I purchase on Amazon and I absolutely had to for this. I used it before going to work and 12 hours later I happened too look in the mirror and my edges were still smooth without being hard and flaky. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get good results, which is a plus. This will be my go to product from now on!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this product, but I still wanted to try it. So let me begin: The product does not hold for more than five minutes. When you first apply it, it produces a nice sleek look, but after a few minutes it no longer looks that way. For the price I paid, it would have been nice to get my money&#x27;s worth.  The only good thing about this product however  is that it doesn&#x27;t get flaky.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my edges. I have been using it since 2007. It has castor oil in it which is great, and my edges get smooth and STAY smooth. It even works on grey edges. My mom uses it too.</li>
            <li> Best edge control I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> This product has no fakes and holds for hours.  I love it and have been using it for a few years.</li>
            <li> YES! This product was recommended to me and I have to say, I am so happy I spent the extra money on this. My hair is very coarse... very unmanageable. I sometimes flat iron my hair to wear it in a straight up-do with a ponytail extension... or at least, I would LIKE TO. Usually, after styling and using gel or other edge protectors, my hair begins to curl back up. I&#x27;m no expert, but these products must be water-based, because after a while, I am back to a fro on the sides and a straight pony-tail on top. I used this product last weekend and I could not believe how well it held and did not revert the texture of my hair. I used this the night before styling with a little holding spray. Then I wrapped a tight scarf around my head. The next morning, my edges were perfectly tamed. I&#x27;m impressed with the results and will never go back to another edge-tamer product.</li>
            <li> It holds very well. Not greasy at all. I noticed it started flaking after a few days of using it. So long as you use it on clean hair, it will not flake</li>
            <li> The best edge control I have ever used. I&#x27;ve bought two jars so far. The hold is precise and glossy. It smells clean and professional. I&#x27;m always going to be a fan.</li>
            <li> gr8 product really works well sooo glad i brought this product a bit expensive to be shipped to the uk but its worth it</li>
            <li> I like the hold.I dislike that it leaves a white residue around my edges. It&#x27;s not oily so thats a good thing.</li>
            <li> This gel holds thoses edges down without being flaky or caking up.  It&#x27;s not greasy and there&#x27;s no residue.  You only need to use very little.  The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t have the all day lasting effect.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on reading other reviews. I am transitioning from permed hair to natural hair. I was expecting something that would lay the edges down. Instead of doing that, this stuff feels like gummy paste and looks filmy.</li>
            <li> Too good to be true.  Highest rating ever for this product. Hicks Edges really does it&#x27;s magic on my  two daughter&#x27;s hair. I was really amazed at how good the product works on virgin hair.&lt;br /&gt;I applied Hicks Edges on their hair after a good&lt;br /&gt;shampoo and conditioner, Bye, pressing comb!!!Their hair looked as if they had a relaxer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for several years and I&#x27;ve tried almost every edge smoother out. This one is by far the best. My edges stay smooth the entire day without curling or lifting up! You have to make sure to rub it in well to get rid of the residue look but it&#x27;s working it.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:105b37bc805739a2b92eeac3f2717ed1]] Please watch the video, now its my very 1st one so please hang on in there lol. However, Hicks Edges is a great product and trust me, I have use all the edge control products out there. I am in love with this one by far. Hicks Edges do not cake up of flake. Hicks Edges gives you a more natural look while relieving you of kinky dry edges. Its like you got aka \\&quot;good hair\\&quot; then that slick waxy, shiny greasy look of other edge controls. Now one thing about me! I am going to always keep it 100% and tell you like it is... I hold not punches... If you respect those type of reviews... Watch this and many more video&#x27;s to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Keeping it Raw.Angel7</li>
            <li> works good but don&#x27;t expect it to work if its hot outside</li>
            <li> For years, I have being using beeswax to smooth my edges; generally, while wearing a bun. I have used several \\&quot;holding products\\&quot; but Hicks is by far the best. I am natural, and I do straightened my hair. Applying this products to my natural hair does very well, it does maintain the hold; however, it tends to make my hair just a little wavy after a few hours. Overall, my new found product love. I introduced this to mother and she loves it as well. It will work great for all hair types.</li>
            <li> The is the best edge control we have found. It does not leave a white residue and it holds well.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! Have tried others, you could see the gel and appeard dry.  If I didn&#x27;t put it on I wouldn&#x27;t know it was there</li>
            <li> Maybe it works on others hair, for my hair, it makes my hair look &amp;#34;nappy&amp;#34;  after a few hours.  I have medium length hair with a fairly smooth Black/Native American hair texture.  Have tried a small amount as well as generous amount and it does not matter. I get the same result. Sorry,  just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I rather use shea butter, water, profectiv and keeps my edges in place all day!</li>
            <li> Always the best for smoothing out your edges. It is well worth the cost, no flakes.</li>
            <li> Ok so I have seen many great reviews on you tube about this product so I decided to give it a try since my other product  Olive Oil Edge Control seems to leave a white film in my hair. But low and behold this product holds my hair fir about 1 hour and it started lifting and curling up I could not believe it, what did I just spend $15 on a worthless product lol yep seems so. My hair is very kinky and just absolutely thick and needs a touch up about every 6 weeks but I haven&#x27;t had one in about 5 months due to keeping my hair weaved up so I positively need something heavy for these edges. I have been told to use the Creme Of Nature Argon Edge Control it holds really well and doesn&#x27;t flake so I&#x27;m on my way to the store to get this and see how it works lol good thing I have 2 daughters who are bi racial so I would have not completely wasted my money on this Hick Edge Control product sorry but this product is definitely, most definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how this work wonders for my hair. I will be ordering some soon.</li>
            <li> I saw many Youtubers using this product so I had to give it a try. It does slick your edges very well without the excess build up. I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Hicks edges works perfectly.  I&#x27;ve tried Olive Oil Edge Control, Murray&#x27;s, Jam, Gel, you name it and none of them come close to Hicks Edges.  It not only smooths my edges, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard or sticky.  I&#x27;ve been natural since June 2010 and my hair type is beyond any single letters you can come up with. I would recommend Hicks without hesitation.  I&#x27;m down to my last jar, but on my next purchase, I plan to try it all over and not just on my edges.</li>
            <li> Works wonders! One of the only edge control gel that works. A little heavy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and this works initially when I put it on my edges, but once I step out into the heat it&#x27;s game over. I think the product works well but it does not do well in Chicago heat and frankly I don&#x27;t know what to do about it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good for natural hair and it holds for days. Also doesnt look Like oil at all. I JUST LUV IT</li>
            <li> Great product.  Slick down edges without flaking</li>
            <li> Best price in town for one of my staples!</li>
            <li> This product is to pricey. I could have bought a jar of JAM that would do the same thing. Doesnt work well on kinky natural hair. I went dancing and the product dripped into my eyes. I&#x27;ll stick to two dollar pro style gel.</li>
            <li> I love this edges.  It&#x27;s great for taming those unruly hairs. My hair is  pretty straight on the sides but EDEGES keeps them in check, even my gray hair. I&#x27;ve had gray hair since I was teenager and could never tame them but edges definitely helps with that now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT STUFF.  IT&#x27;S WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> I bought this product directly from my stylist. It worked wonderfully to smooth my edges. But beware!!! After continued usage, it turned my hair into straw! The hair on my edges and nape are now completely unmanageable. A touch-up won&#x27;t tame it. I need to SHAVE my hair for new growth. I strongly recommend using an oil-based hair gel.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I have very thick natural hair and it holds my edges for what I need, but doesn&#x27;t hold that long through out the day.</li>
            <li> My favorite edge control!! This was my second purchase, I bought my last one a year ago and loved it! I use to use the olive oil edge control and hated it because it would cause my hair to get dry and flaky. I would look like I had glue in my hair by the end of the day but this gel DOES NOT!! It doesnt even make my hair dry, you place alittle on your edges and it really goes a long way. I don&#x27;t think their is a smell associated with it, just a clear white gel. Definitely recommend for strong hold and no flakes!</li>
            <li> Great.  I have natural hair and my edges were straight after using this!  I use a little of this mixed with a little water, and then brush into my edges.  Works like a charm!  I will never buy anything else!!!!!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t hold my edge up down for long and I&#x27;m a guy</li>
            <li> Does a good job .. ordering again</li>
            <li> Works well but requires washing frequently or it&#x27;ll just curl up instead of taming your edges. I like Syntonics better.</li>
            <li> SUPER FAST DELIVERY!! GREAT PRODUCT!!!! LEAVES NO WHITE RESIDUE- UNLIKE OLIVE OIL&#x27;S EDGE CONTROL!! I WILL BE BUYING MORE OF THIS PRODUCT SOON!</li>
            <li> Product works exactly as it states it does. I was quite impressed, It did not leave my hair white and flaky. All you need is a little bit.  It is worth the price. can&#x27;t say enough good things about it</li>
            <li> I searched for this product after seeing rave videos on youtube. I must admit it is worth every $15.  Works great, does not buildup.  If you are trying to stretch your relaxers...get this product!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested this product for my edges and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  After trying it for two days, it really does not work even as well as the current product that I use from Carol&#x27;s daughter. I have non-permed natural hair and now I&#x27;m stuck with another product that will not hold the edges down as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and needed something that would &amp;#34;truly have my edges laid. Hicks lays n shines my hard to tame edges. Reminds me of JAM a little. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have tried Hicks and other products for edge control.  This product works the best and only leaves a slight white residue sometimes as opposed to other products that leave a much thicker residue all of the time.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  A little works very well on my edges and does not leave residue.</li>
            <li> Try it...it&#x27;s ok. The product does not hold all day like it claims but it&#x27;s the best choice I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the best hair product I have ever used.  It tames your edges!</li>
            <li> I have 4b/4c hair and decided to get a 3b weave from ONYC which was not smart since I left a lot of leave out.  On Youtube I found a video on blending and the vlogger msvirgo823 used this product.  I was traveling to Haiti in two days so I ordered it next day on Amazon and it did not disappoint.  My edges were laid and when I applied it on my leave out by flat twisting (twisting my hair as if I was doing a cornrow) the hair matched beautifully.  I love this product it held well in humid conditions and I reapplied a little towards the end of the day which was no problem.  This product is a bit expensive but you get what you pay for.  I&#x27;m ordering two more on Amazon and will try the Hicks Pomade since there were many good reviews for it.  The product came next day as promised in the late afternoon and came as advertised.  I took out the hair and will be trying this to do a ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to ask any questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nappily yours ;)</li>
            <li> After hearing many great things about this product I decided to try it. I have been searching for the perfect edge control for a while and thought this was it, this is not it. It seems to provide hold for 10 minutes or less before needing to reapply which is pretty much a waste of my time. May work better on a different hair texture I have natural hair that is classified as hair type 3C.</li>
            <li> Best ever hair gel!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It was in good condition when it was received. But does nothing for my hair it didn&#x27;t do what it said it would but the type of hair I have nothing works!! :(</li>
            <li> This product does not hold as well as I expected it to hold...after hearing rave reviews, I am a little disappointed. The price point is the first thing and the fact that as soon as I went outside in the heat my edges curled right back up. It DOES leave a white residue(see photo). Even though it doesn&#x27;t hold as well it does soften your edges so I guess that is reason enough to continue to use it. I do not think I will be repurchasing it however</li>
            <li> FYI, I DO NOT WORK FOR THE COMPANY. I have been using this product for over five years now and I love it. I use it and then I put on Eco Styler gel and wrap my hair with a scarf. It doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue and my edges stay straight/slick the whole day and I have a natural 4B/4C hair type. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> One of my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; edge control products.</li>
            <li> If you wear your hair natural , or relaxed, or just about any way this product is for you. Although it is non-greasy it is a bit tacky, so it takes just a bit to smooth those edges down.</li>
            <li> Works well.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I didnt feel like is as good as the design essentials. I was really shiny and it did not hold down my kinky 4c edges.</li>
            <li> I was introduce to this product by my beautician as this gel is not harsh like others on the market.</li>
            <li> This product works well but has to be re-applied throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any thing better than this product for laying down natural hair edges. I have use another product similar for a decade. Used this once and have made it a new staple.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t received it yet. From the reviews I&#x27;ve read I&#x27;m sure I will love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I put it on my edges and tie them down for a while before I leave the house . It lasts all day &amp; its not greasy like jam or nothing . It looks very smooth. Also when I first started using it my edges were really short. Within two months they are long enough to go into a ponytail. It&#x27;s really amazing how my edges grew. Now I can get them braided for my sew ins ! Lol</li>
            <li> It works but it reminds me of the Product &amp;#34;let&#x27;s Jam&amp;#34; except it cost more. Would I but again....it would have to be on sale.</li>
            <li> Good for edges.  No flaking and white build up.  Definitely would recommend using for all purposes.  Best edge control I ave ran across in a long time.</li>
            <li> The holding power not as great as I thought. However, there is no flaking or unsightly residue. The product is fair.</li>
            <li> These days a lot of black woman are going natural and need something to lay down those edges. This works for my edges. I will order again!</li>
