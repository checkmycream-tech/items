            <li>These flossers are not the best I have ever purchased.  </li>

            <li>These are really great Floss Picks that have a barbed end for good cleaning between your teeth and</li>
            <li>Tastes good</li>
            <li>I AM going to buy dentek again, because i do know they make good floss picks- just not these ones.</li>
            <li>My teeth are fairly close together</li>
            <li>Would like to say I can spot a good deal when I see ones</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe they can put these on the market and feel good about them.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like the plastic floss, since I don&#x27;t think it does as good of a job.</li>
            <li>My teeth are fairly close together and need thinner floss.</li>
            <li>These are great, convenient and affordable also very easy to use, I love them!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought some dentek from walgreens and have been loving them.</li>
            <li>, but these Triple Clean by DenTek have been great.  </li>
            <li>It breaks very easily.</li>
            <li>The CVS brand are by far the best I have found.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using dentek flosspicks for 5 years now, and I&#x27;ve generally been very happy.</li>
            <li>The new and improved triple clean ones are the best ones I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Now I have 5 more packages I don&#x27;t know what to do with because I would never ever give these to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love floss picks.</li>
            <li>I think these are the most effective pick available.</li>
            <li>Okay  quality.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy the Pack of 90 until you try this brand and are satisfied.</li>
            <li>These are the 3rd brand I&#x27;ve tried, and I like them the best.  </li>
            <li>and therefore more</li>
            <li>I just love flossing.</li>
            <li>I used Plackers before - I will probably just chuck these and buy more plackers I guess.  </li>
            <li>The flavor of the floss is okay.</li>
            <li>I had much better luck with Plackers, or even store brand.  </li>
            <li>These things just make it much more fun!</li>
            <li>I think you get a better clean with this</li>
            <li>Sure, these \\&quot;floss picks\\&quot; will get your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>The floss does not break anywhere as easily.</li>
            <li>Also, the pick on the end bends easily.  </li>
            <li>floss breaks way too easy.</li>
            <li>The floss has the right thickness, and the price is much much better than walmart&lt;br /&gt;I will buy them again for sure</li>
            <li>As always Amazon shipped quick and the product arrived as described, but more often than not the floss will pull out of the flosser.  </li>
            <li>and once again because my dentist offered me a free sample.   </li>
            <li>DenTek makes a cheap flosser: the floss shreds and/or separates from the pick.</li>
            <li>Worth it for a better check-up.</li>
            <li>Often the floss component comes free of the plastic part when flossing tighter gaps.</li>
            <li>free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works great if u actually use them correctly.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t take them for free now.</li>
            <li>I would give zero stars if that option was available.</li>
            <li>DONT USE IT EVEN IF SOMEONE GIVES IT FOR FREE.</li>
            <li>FAR superior product -</li>
            <li>find the pick part of this tool to be very useful.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced much loosening that would require a new pick during one flossing session.</li>
            <li>I attribute this to more consistent flossing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE--Now in March, 2015 I bought 3 bags of the DenTek Triple Clean from CVS Pharmacy</li>
            <li>Now in March, 2015 I bought 3 bags of the DenTek Triple Clean from CVS Pharmacy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;The special string scrubs between the teeth thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I bought them, mostly because I could floss my kids&#x27; teeth so much easier.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s good enough.  </li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s good because I want to finish the pack as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s only good if you want to use ONE pick per tooth....</li>
            <li>The good ones have WHITE</li>
            <li>No bad breath over here ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜†</li>
            <li>I bought this exact product at Walmart and they break fairly easily.</li>
            <li>They are quick and efficient and even my kids use them.</li>
            <li>And if you do use these, you&#x27;ll also quickly understand why having to wrestle with the pick to get the floss between your teeth is a problem:  </li>
            <li>Never buying this particular product, better yet, this brand, again.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the floss loosens very easily on these, so it might be good for one or two teeth, but then you need a new one because it&#x27;s too loose to work again.  </li>
            <li>I can floss with this one right after flossing with a glide and see a significant difference.</li>
            <li>but they simply aren&#x27;t as effective as the triple clean.</li>
            <li>This is very deceptive!!  </li>
            <li>to clarify, the product I loved so much was actually the dentek COMFORT floss.</li>
            <li>The Triple Clean Floss Picks are too large for my teeth.</li>
            <li>Be sure and get the Triple Clean with the white floss--and the &amp;#34;No Break Floss Guaranteed&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It shredded right away</li>
            <li>All right, I recommend.</li>
            <li>have tried many brands of these flossing picks and these are hands down my favorite ones.</li>
            <li>The floss shreds right after the first tooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used others and this problem does not occur as easily and frequently as these do.  </li>
            <li>Like many people, I have been an infrequent flosser because of the hassle of using regular floss.</li>
            <li>When I first saw floss picks</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, my first experience was with</li>
            <li>Anyway these shred after the first tooth and the string is way too think.  </li>
            <li>I buy this brand from my local drug store and love them.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Didnt like them at first.</li>
            <li>And last can&#x27;t fit the one&#x27;s with perpendicular floss back in my molars easily, and I do just fine with these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid flosser and always use floss picks.</li>
            <li>My teeth are fairly tight, yet many flossers work fine.  </li>
            <li>Obviously this is a disposable product and its not designed for long term use, but you&#x27;ll need one for your top teeth and one for the bottom most times.</li>
            <li>These are a somewhat newer version of the old triple clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Dentek, because although they may not be the most rigid floss piks, I don&#x27;t have much room between some of my teeth and the actual toothpick end</li>
            <li>I was surprised at all the negative reviews, these are by far the best floss sticks I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I was really just ecstatic about the price, since these can cost a pretty penny at the store</li>
            <li>used.&lt;br /&gt;These are of very low quality and shreds easily.</li>
            <li>If you have spaces between your teeth, perhaps the green floss model would be OK, but l will get the newer version!  </li>
            <li>Most recent shipment was the \\&quot;new and improved\\</li>
            <li>I feel like these flossers are more flimsy than Dentek Triple Clean picks I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>These are better than our last store-bought bag of picks of the same exact brand and type!</li>
            <li>Then my Target stopped carrying them, instead, they have a whole wall of the DenTek products.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know why.  </li>
            <li>They are much stronger</li>
            <li>The plastic is much stronger than others</li>
            <li>These totally make flossing fun again and actually is a lot more convenient for me now.</li>
            <li>The floss would not even fit between some of my back teeth.</li>
            <li>And, the floss does not have too much wax.</li>
            <li>It took 5 flossers to do my whole mouth.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I are both very satisfied with this purchase, which should last for a long time for the two of us!</li>
            <li>I mean, flossing is always good.</li>
            <li>But the older version has a far more rigid frame, and you could actually floss.</li>
            <li>Other brands that I have used hold up much better than these did.  </li>
            <li>The two main reason were that the floss thread would get shredded when I was half-way done, and it would dig into the skin of my fingers if I applied too much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the DenTek floss picks.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel they work as well as the older version.</li>
            <li>, therefore I cannot review it here, and besides I use something else for that particular</li>
            <li>The ones I got from Amazon today must be the older picks.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand all of the negative reviews except perhaps they may not be best if your teeth are very tight.  </li>
            <li>they are really sharp and they break really easily when flossing between your</li>
            <li>The floss material itself is somehow rough and feels abrasive, unlike OralB picks which are smooth.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, most floss products out there are a waste of money.</li>
            <li>If you have spaces between your teeth, perhaps the green floss model would be OK, but l will get the newer version!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; falls apart after two teeth and isn&#x27;t strong enough for back teeth.  </li>
            <li>The floss used in these shred very easily and are hard to remove once inserted between your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Shreds on first - second use</li>
            <li>Will be back, thanks!</li>
            <li>Only good for people with ridiculously gapped teeth&lt;</li>
            <li>Floss isn&#x27;t waxed and is instead some kind of woven thread which is weak.  </li>
            <li>I love flossing with flossers and when my local store was out of the ones I typically purchased, I bought these.</li>
            <li>If the spaces between your teeth are tight, these will most likely break.</li>
            <li>Earlier today, I broke EIGHT of them on a single spot before one of them was strong enough to floss that particular space.</li>
            <li>They not only break left and right, the pick (non-floss) end is too fat and weak to be effective at all.  </li>
            <li>floss picks are SO much easier to use than regular dental floss.</li>
            <li>But it may take 12 on these things to actually complete your task.</li>
            <li>used the old ones that shredded.</li>
            <li>The floss breaks almost instantly and the pick end breaks off in between your teeth within seconds, absolute garbage.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>These make it way easier to floss, and so I am more likely to do it everyday.  </li>
            <li>and I find that many different, cheep, products break after just a few teeth.</li>
            <li>I had a few moments where I thought I would not be able to get the pick back out again.</li>
            <li>is sharp enough to fit in those gaps.</li>
            <li>My teeth are not particularly tight, but I have to force these both in and out between my teeth.</li>
            <li>Nothing profound or lyrical â€“</li>
            <li>These  dental floss picks are easier to use than regular floss and you get so many that they  can last a few months</li>
            <li>bought these at a local store because I ran out of floss and they didn&#x27;t have what I normally</li>
            <li>above two criticisms are also my typical criticisms of cheap generic floss.</li>
            <li>I try all sorts and generally buy a bag every time I go shopping.</li>
            <li>These I can barely get through all my teeth before the floss sags or shreds.</li>
            <li>The floss is TOO THICK to fit in between my teeth properly&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE--after using these for 6 months, the hygienist noticed that my gums bled less with my last cleaning [as in &amp;#34;hardly at all&amp;#34;]!</li>
            <li>and of the 10 or so I&#x27;ve used, not a single one has resulted in shredded floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both are fairly weak floss, and they shred easily on any ncomposite dental work.</li>
            <li>Even the plastic around the floss is poor quality and bends easily.  </li>
            <li>It took me at least 4 picks to floss my teeth because the floss stretches out so quickly, there isn&#x27;t enough tensile strength to get it between my teeth.</li>
            <li>I get that a pointy pick is better than a dull one, but these little monsters would work for finger-prick blood testers.  </li>
            <li>the minus side, the space for the floss is rather narrow - it&#x27;s ok for the front teeth, but it is difficult to fit the floss between the back teeth because the floss part isn&#x27;t long enough.  </li>

            <li> Oh, and the floss loosens very easily on these, so it might be good for one or two teeth, but then you need a new one because it&#x27;s too loose to work again.  </li>
            <li> I can floss with this one right after flossing with a glide and see a significant difference.</li>
            <li> but they simply aren&#x27;t as effective as the triple clean.</li>
            <li> This is very deceptive!!  </li>
            <li> to clarify, the product I loved so much was actually the dentek COMFORT floss.</li>
            <li> The Triple Clean Floss Picks are too large for my teeth.</li>
            <li> Be sure and get the Triple Clean with the white floss--and the &amp;#34;No Break Floss Guaranteed&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It shredded right away</li>
            <li> All right, I recommend.</li>
            <li> have tried many brands of these flossing picks and these are hands down my favorite ones.</li>
            <li> The floss shreds right after the first tooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used others and this problem does not occur as easily and frequently as these do.  </li>
            <li> Like many people, I have been an infrequent flosser because of the hassle of using regular floss.</li>
            <li> When I first saw floss picks</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my first experience was with</li>
            <li> Anyway these shred after the first tooth and the string is way too think.  </li>
            <li> I buy this brand from my local drug store and love them.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Didnt like them at first.</li>
            <li> And last can&#x27;t fit the one&#x27;s with perpendicular floss back in my molars easily, and I do just fine with these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid flosser and always use floss picks.</li>
            <li> My teeth are fairly tight, yet many flossers work fine.  </li>
            <li> Obviously this is a disposable product and its not designed for long term use, but you&#x27;ll need one for your top teeth and one for the bottom most times.</li>
            <li> These are a somewhat newer version of the old triple clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Dentek, because although they may not be the most rigid floss piks, I don&#x27;t have much room between some of my teeth and the actual toothpick end</li>
            <li> I was surprised at all the negative reviews, these are by far the best floss sticks I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I was really just ecstatic about the price, since these can cost a pretty penny at the store</li>
            <li> used.&lt;br /&gt;These are of very low quality and shreds easily.</li>
            <li> If you have spaces between your teeth, perhaps the green floss model would be OK, but l will get the newer version!  </li>
            <li> Most recent shipment was the \\&quot;new and improved\\</li>
            <li> I feel like these flossers are more flimsy than Dentek Triple Clean picks I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> These are better than our last store-bought bag of picks of the same exact brand and type!</li>
            <li> Then my Target stopped carrying them, instead, they have a whole wall of the DenTek products.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know why.  </li>
            <li> They are much stronger</li>
            <li> The plastic is much stronger than others</li>
            <li> These totally make flossing fun again and actually is a lot more convenient for me now.</li>
            <li> The floss would not even fit between some of my back teeth.</li>
            <li> And, the floss does not have too much wax.</li>
            <li> It took 5 flossers to do my whole mouth.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I are both very satisfied with this purchase, which should last for a long time for the two of us!</li>
            <li> I mean, flossing is always good.</li>
            <li> But the older version has a far more rigid frame, and you could actually floss.</li>
            <li> Other brands that I have used hold up much better than these did.  </li>
            <li> The two main reason were that the floss thread would get shredded when I was half-way done, and it would dig into the skin of my fingers if I applied too much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the DenTek floss picks.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel they work as well as the older version.</li>
            <li> , therefore I cannot review it here, and besides I use something else for that particular</li>
            <li> The ones I got from Amazon today must be the older picks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all of the negative reviews except perhaps they may not be best if your teeth are very tight.  </li>
            <li> they are really sharp and they break really easily when flossing between your</li>
            <li> The floss material itself is somehow rough and feels abrasive, unlike OralB picks which are smooth.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, most floss products out there are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> If you have spaces between your teeth, perhaps the green floss model would be OK, but l will get the newer version!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; falls apart after two teeth and isn&#x27;t strong enough for back teeth.  </li>
            <li> The floss used in these shred very easily and are hard to remove once inserted between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Shreds on first - second use</li>
            <li> Will be back, thanks!</li>
            <li> Only good for people with ridiculously gapped teeth&lt;</li>
            <li> Floss isn&#x27;t waxed and is instead some kind of woven thread which is weak.  </li>
            <li> I love flossing with flossers and when my local store was out of the ones I typically purchased, I bought these.</li>
            <li> If the spaces between your teeth are tight, these will most likely break.</li>
            <li> Earlier today, I broke EIGHT of them on a single spot before one of them was strong enough to floss that particular space.</li>
            <li> They not only break left and right, the pick (non-floss) end is too fat and weak to be effective at all.  </li>
            <li> floss picks are SO much easier to use than regular dental floss.</li>
            <li> But it may take 12 on these things to actually complete your task.</li>
            <li> used the old ones that shredded.</li>
            <li> The floss breaks almost instantly and the pick end breaks off in between your teeth within seconds, absolute garbage.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> These make it way easier to floss, and so I am more likely to do it everyday.  </li>
            <li> and I find that many different, cheep, products break after just a few teeth.</li>
            <li> I had a few moments where I thought I would not be able to get the pick back out again.</li>
            <li> is sharp enough to fit in those gaps.</li>
            <li> My teeth are not particularly tight, but I have to force these both in and out between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Nothing profound or lyrical â€“</li>
            <li> These  dental floss picks are easier to use than regular floss and you get so many that they  can last a few months</li>
            <li> bought these at a local store because I ran out of floss and they didn&#x27;t have what I normally</li>
            <li> above two criticisms are also my typical criticisms of cheap generic floss.</li>
            <li> I try all sorts and generally buy a bag every time I go shopping.</li>
            <li> These I can barely get through all my teeth before the floss sags or shreds.</li>
            <li> The floss is TOO THICK to fit in between my teeth properly&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE--after using these for 6 months, the hygienist noticed that my gums bled less with my last cleaning [as in &amp;#34;hardly at all&amp;#34;]!</li>
            <li> and of the 10 or so I&#x27;ve used, not a single one has resulted in shredded floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both are fairly weak floss, and they shred easily on any ncomposite dental work.</li>
            <li> Even the plastic around the floss is poor quality and bends easily.  </li>
            <li> It took me at least 4 picks to floss my teeth because the floss stretches out so quickly, there isn&#x27;t enough tensile strength to get it between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I get that a pointy pick is better than a dull one, but these little monsters would work for finger-prick blood testers.  </li>
            <li> the minus side, the space for the floss is rather narrow - it&#x27;s ok for the front teeth, but it is difficult to fit the floss between the back teeth because the floss part isn&#x27;t long enough.  </li>
            <li> &quot; These are very thin and probably more resistant to breaking</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for the other Dentek flossers but I can honestly say I hated flossing with Dentek Triple Clean</li>
            <li> I have used many different flossers, and these are easily the worst ones yet.</li>
            <li> The first time I used these I found the rope like floss to be so thick</li>
            <li> And the points bend very easily, so it&#x27;s more likely you&#x27;ll end up stabbing yourself in the gums than removing whatever is stuck between your molars.  </li>
            <li> I really wonder if the company took the earlier negative feedback to the lab and had the techs re-engineer</li>
            <li> They tear up quickly and leave behind bits of floss rather than removing food/plaque</li>
            <li> I am partial to flat floss/Glide, but regular ones work too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Squeak is the wrong word, they scratch like nails on chalkboard, and the sound is unbearable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am curious to see if the hygienist notices a difference at my next cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first tooth, the floss goes limp and pretty much useless</li>
            <li> However if you do have very tight teeth I would recommend starting with the thin plastic ribbon type until you learn how your teeth are situated well enough to maneuver the triple clean.</li>
            <li> The floss doesn&#x27;t remain taut in the pick, so after the first tooth, they are pretty much impossible to use.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to worry about the floss digging or cutting into my skin and the floss is strong enough to stay intact while I floss in between all my teeth.</li>
            <li> The pick side is sharp and flimsy, it actually chipped off in my teeth.</li>
            <li> I used to break what seemed like every other with different brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> the odds of stabbing yourself in the fingers are pretty high if you have to handle the thing for very long.  </li>
            <li> PLEASE TELL HIM/HER TO PUT THE ORAL B FLOSS ON THEIR SHELVES AGAIN, before I loose my teeth...</li>
            <li> These new ones are weak, and they only bend.</li>
            <li> Also (and even more annoyingng), the floss component will fall apart between your molars, leaving floss threads tangling from your teeth, which are impossible to floss out.</li>
            <li> I went through almost half the pack just trying to floss my upper teeth because they kept breaking.</li>
            <li> The floss is round, not flat.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased these in a store and wanted to buy in bulk to keep from having to go back to the store for them over and over and to save a little money.</li>
            <li> For many years I was frustrated when it came to floss in between my teeth.</li>
            <li> If you love being frustrated, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using many different floss picks for the last few months, and this one is by far the worst.</li>
            <li> These floss picks lack any sort of durability since the floss piece breaks shortly after a few teeth.  </li>
            <li> Expect a 90-count pack to last you a few weeks because you will go though two or three of them in one flossing.</li>
            <li> The picks are now green instead of white and the floss has been changed; it&#x27;s now a lighter flossâ€“it fits where it didn&#x27;t used toâ€“</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit of plastic waste each time, but the benefit is terrific.  </li>
            <li> I was not aware that there was a company who made a bad flosser, the store brands are better than this.</li>
            <li> The bad reviews have to be for the older version of this product, these are with white floss not green.</li>
            <li> Regular picks create so much waste, but this brand will not do either, so I will seek out other options.</li>
            <li> have had to only use the glide type floss in the past and those would break after only a few teeth.</li>
            <li> These are thicker then some of the other brands and will shred if there is no space between your teeth.</li>
            <li> the pick is so SHARP</li>
            <li> I do not understand the other reviewers who state that the string breaks or shreds.</li>
            <li> I usually have to use several to finish the job.</li>
            <li> No more purple fingers from wrapping regular floss!  </li>
            <li> The pick is extremely flexible and just bends when you try to use it.</li>
            <li> I have to use 4 to do what 1 of other brands would do.</li>
            <li> Careful!</li>
            <li> TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be better off buying some yarn and trying to floss with that than using this crap.</li>
            <li> The other end of the pick is not useful</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sooo bad they actually caught on a filling and ripped it right out.</li>
            <li> The floss is a little rough, I like it like that.</li>
            <li> I guess I had this false idea that things are actually tested and smart people and research are behind the products I buy.</li>
            <li> The double floss sucks as well...</li>
            <li> have objected to floss picks in the past because they seem like a waste of plastic, but after my dental hygienist recommended them, I now use them daily.  </li>
            <li> It seems like DenTek got it right for a short period, but has lousy quality control and even worse customer service.</li>
            <li> It seems like DenTek got it right for a short period, but has lousy quality control and even worse customer service.</li>
            <li> Go with some other brand!</li>
            <li> The tension on the string is poor and the string completely shreds if your teeth are tight.</li>
            <li> The floss is rough and gets stuck in tight places, almost feels like it&#x27;s going to pull my teeth out with it!</li>
            <li> Other brands I can re-use a few times before they shred.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad because I really try to \\&quot;go green\\&quot; whenever possible.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my previous brand and ended up with these instead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE--I just received a 3 pack from Amazon [previous purchase had been from Walmart].</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid they&#x27;re making things worse than better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only reason I haven&#x27;t thrown these is the trash is because they rightly belong in a sharps container and (stupid - I know)</li>
            <li> A note--my teeth are so tight that I have to bite down on the floss pick in order to get the floss between my teeth!</li>
            <li> A note--my teeth are so tight that I have to bite down on the floss pick in order to get the floss between my teeth!</li>
            <li> I discovered this little beauties almost 4 years ago</li>
            <li> Now these little pieces of junk are going to end up costing me hundreds of dollars to replace a filling.</li>
            <li> I ended up stabbing myself repeatedly and it really really really friggin&#x27; HURTS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It shreds almost immediately, so you have to go through a few each time to get to every tooth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I carry a few of these in my purse ALWAYS.</li>
            <li> So I have to waste another pick just to get the floss out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve broken several while in my mouth and then the floss is stuck between my teeth.</li>
            <li> dentist recommended these a few years ago and I&#x27;ve used them ever since.</li>
            <li> After a few teeth, the string will come off on one end and you will end up using a few just to finish flossing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve injured my gums with them a few times trying to wrestle with them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this junk.</li>
            <li> [Summer, 2014] I have tight teeth, and common floss shreds and/or breaks--as do the other floss picks</li>
            <li> I know I have tight teeth and usually get the ribbon, satin, glide versions</li>
            <li> Complete garbage, impossible to hold with the sharp skinny little handle that pokes into your palm when you use it.</li>
            <li> I have tight teeth and these won&#x27;t break!</li>
            <li> The floss is hard to slide down between your teeth and the floss will start to break apart after one or two slides.</li>
            <li> I have very tight teeth and go</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly baffling how bad these are, like they actually make me question the foundation of our society that these actually got put into production.</li>
            <li> The floss does not glide and shreds after very little use.</li>
            <li> I usually have to use 2-3 picks each time I floss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lazy sort of person perhaps, I do not like the string floss (won&#x27;t do that).  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t make it past 2 or 3 teeth without them shredding.  </li>
            <li> I understand the reviewers who have had that problem with these in the past</li>
            <li> I wonder how these got past product review when they fray off into your teeth after one use.</li>
            <li> To floss once, you need at least 4-5 sticks as string breaks after flossing a few (4-5) teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always shredding and it just plain sucks.</li>
            <li> However, these are not a good choice for someone who has teeth that are tightly spaced.</li>
            <li> OralB beats the hell out of these pieces of crap, often lasting me several cleanings before breaking.</li>
            <li> I got so bored of single floss.</li>
            <li> Hard to get in between teeth.</li>
            <li> I have yet to floss my teeth with them without breaking at least one.</li>
            <li> the thread is so thick it sounds like nails scratching on chalkboard when I use these.</li>
            <li> They were to thick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe you like the perpendicular plastic floss and thick picks...</li>
            <li> These floss picks are too thick.</li>
            <li> They are thick and got stuck in my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> The Dentek ones designed for back teeth were just as bad too.</li>
            <li> I hate being so worked up over such a small item</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken through one yet.</li>
            <li> My experience is the plastic ribbon type break and this thick piece of rope is unlikely to yield.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re that frustrating to use.  </li>
            <li> it is WAY too thick and uncomfortable to stick in between your teeth to dig anything out</li>
            <li> This is difficult to describe, but trust me - if you try these you&#x27;ll understand what I mean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Floss isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d usually bother writing a review for, but I wanted to let the unhappy folks know that it appears DenTek has listened and made a change for the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very hard to get in place and then difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> These are by far the worst floss picks I have ever used.</li>
            <li> These are by far the worst.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, the floss is very weak.</li>
            <li> Incredibly uncomfortable</li>
            <li> They are useless.  </li>
            <li> toothpick end is also useless.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re difficult to get in between your teeth.</li>
            <li> They have an abrasive, uncomfortable feel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very disappointed by this product, as it failed to meet even the minimal functional requirements of a flossing pick.</li>
            <li> These are hands down the worst floss picks I have ever used.</li>
            <li> While flossing I&#x27;m always afraid that I&#x27;m going to damage my teeth (feels like using sewing thread...).  </li>
            <li> I worry about seagulls or whatever stabbing themselves at the dump.</li>
            <li> I am just so distraught.</li>
            <li> Despite being labeled &amp;#34;Triple Clean&amp;#34; they have GREEN floss, and they ARE terrible.</li>
            <li> WRONG MOVE!</li>
            <li> Maybe cheaper, but useless... :(</li>
            <li> Then the floss on this shreds like crazy and for some reason is impossible to pull out of your teeth after it is in.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Most recent shipment was the \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; version with \\&quot;no break floss.\\&quot; These are very thin and probably more resistant to breaking but I don&#x27;t feel they work as well as the older version. I do not recommend this product any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old Review:&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many brands of these flossing picks and these are hands down my favorite ones. I don&#x27;t understand all of the negative reviews except perhaps they may not be best if your teeth are very tight.  These are thicker then some of the other brands and will shred if there is no space between your teeth.</li>
            <li> The floss has the right thickness, and the price is much much better than walmart&lt;br /&gt;I will buy them again for sure</li>
            <li> I bought this brand because they are recyclable. Sadly, the floss is very weak. Other brands I can re-use a few times before they shred. These I can barely get through all my teeth before the floss sags or shreds. It&#x27;s too bad because I really try to \\&quot;go green\\&quot; whenever possible. Regular picks create so much waste, but this brand will not do either, so I will seek out other options.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using another brand and thought they were all same.  But this one is crap.  It gets stuck in teeth.  It&#x27;s the worst.</li>
            <li> Like many people, I have been an infrequent flosser because of the hassle of using regular floss. When I first saw floss picks I bought them, mostly because I could floss my kids&#x27; teeth so much easier. Then I tried it for myself and have been a regular flosser ever since. Unfortunately, my first experience was with the Crest Glide Floss Picks -a FAR superior product - and I could pick them up at Target. Then my Target stopped carrying them, instead, they have a whole wall of the DenTek products. I  tried the DenTek product twice, once because Target stopped carrying the Crest Glide Floss Picks and once again because my dentist offered me a free sample.   The bottom line is this- floss picks are SO much easier to use than regular dental floss. They are quick and efficient and even my kids use them. Unfortunately, most floss products out there are a waste of money. DenTek makes a cheap flosser: the floss shreds and/or separates from the pick. Unless you can find the Crest Glide flossers, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I love flossing with flossers and when my local store was out of the ones I typically purchased, I bought these. WRONG MOVE! It shredded right away and it was almost impossible to floss bc it did not glide. It took a lot of strength to pull it out. Hate these!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I can find these floss in town everywhere.  I really don&#x27;t know why.  These are the worst ever! While flossing I&#x27;m always afraid that I&#x27;m going to damage my teeth (feels like using sewing thread...).  So, if you know a manager (or you are one) in Walgreen&#x27;s, CVS, Target etc. PLEASE TELL HIM/HER TO PUT THE ORAL B FLOSS ON THEIR SHELVES AGAIN, before I loose my teeth...I&#x27;m VERY disappointed with this brand. I would never switch if I could find the Oral B products in stores!  Maybe cheaper, but useless... :(</li>
            <li> Just awful!  These floss picks lack any sort of durability since the floss piece breaks shortly after a few teeth.  Expect a 90-count pack to last you a few weeks because you will go though two or three of them in one flossing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using many different floss picks for the last few months, and this one is by far the worst. It shreds almost immediately, so you have to go through a few each time to get to every tooth. And the floss gets stuck in your teeth quite often after the thread breaks, necessitating the use of ANOTHER floss pick to get out the remnants of the one stuck in your teeth!</li>
            <li> I bought this exact product at Walmart and they break fairly easily. I usually have to use 2-3 picks each time I floss.</li>
            <li> It took me at least 4 picks to floss my teeth because the floss stretches out so quickly, there isn&#x27;t enough tensile strength to get it between my teeth. And the needle-sharp pick end is horrible! I ended up stabbing myself repeatedly and it really really really friggin&#x27; HURTS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I haven&#x27;t thrown these is the trash is because they rightly belong in a sharps container and (stupid - I know) I worry about seagulls or whatever stabbing themselves at the dump.</li>
            <li> Seriously. I ran out of my previous brand and ended up with these instead. These are crap. the pic on the back pokes you. It feels like flossing with yoyo string. I am just so distraught. Please save your money and purchase something else. I am going back to Plackers Micromint. I can&#x27;t speak for the other Dentek flossers but I can honestly say I hated flossing with Dentek Triple Clean</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Tastes good&lt;br /&gt;- Can brush between crevices because of the ropey texture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Only good for people with ridiculously gapped teeth&lt;br /&gt;- Shreds on first - second use</li>
            <li> These flossers are not the best I have ever purchased.  As always Amazon shipped quick and the product arrived as described, but more often than not the floss will pull out of the flosser.  Other brands that I have used hold up much better than these did.  Obviously this is a disposable product and its not designed for long term use, but you&#x27;ll need one for your top teeth and one for the bottom most times.</li>
            <li> Picked these up at Kmart on my break at work.  I had something stuck in my tooth and figured I need some flossers.  Anyway these shred after the first tooth and the string is way too think.  I don&#x27;t think I can use these again, gonna have to garbage them.  I was not aware that there was a company who made a bad flosser, the store brands are better than this.</li>
            <li> I will never buy this again. The floss is hard to slide down between your teeth and the floss will start to break apart after one or two slides. It is so bad I just trashed it.</li>
            <li> Complete garbage, impossible to hold with the sharp skinny little handle that pokes into your palm when you use it. Then the floss on this shreds like crazy and for some reason is impossible to pull out of your teeth after it is in. It&#x27;s truly baffling how bad these are, like they actually make me question the foundation of our society that these actually got put into production. I guess I had this false idea that things are actually tested and smart people and research are behind the products I buy. I need to go have a drink.</li>
            <li> I buy this brand from my local drug store and love them. These are either knock offs or not waxed, they break and get stuck between my teeth, takes up to 6 to get the job done, donâ€™t buy.</li>
            <li> For many years I was frustrated when it came to floss in between my teeth. The two main reason were that the floss thread would get shredded when I was half-way done, and it would dig into the skin of my fingers if I applied too much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the DenTek floss picks. I discovered this little beauties almost 4 years ago and I have been a devoted fan of them ever since. They are advertised to have a triple cleaning feature however I only use both the pick and the floss features. I&#x27;ve never tried the tongue cleaning feature, therefore I cannot review it here, and besides I use something else for that particular function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started to use these DenTek picks I don&#x27;t need to worry about the floss digging or cutting into my skin and the floss is strong enough to stay intact while I floss in between all my teeth. One of these picks is enough for me to floss all my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus, these picks are made of plastic that can be recycled.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s good enough.  The floss is a little rough, I like it like that. Feels like some work is getting done.  The floss is round, not flat.  I haven&#x27;t experienced much loosening that would require a new pick during one flossing session.</li>
            <li> They work great.  They are much stronger then they use to be.  I can use one pick for my entire mouth.</li>
            <li> These make it way easier to floss, and so I am more likely to do it everyday.  Worth it for a better check-up.</li>
            <li> These are pathetic. I end up using 6 picks every time I floss. But, it&#x27;s good because I want to finish the pack as soon as possible. And, I swear I will never ever buy these things again</li>
            <li> Yuck! I bought some dentek from walgreens and have been loving them. I was honestly shocked at all the bad reviews on this product and went ahead and ordered a subscription for this item... so 6 packages arrived in the mail. I opened and use them and UGH- THEY ARE UNWAXED and the thread is so thick it sounds like nails scratching on chalkboard when I use these. Incredibly uncomfortable and I wince everytime I use it. Now I have 5 more packages I don&#x27;t know what to do with because I would never ever give these to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: AVOID.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also to clarify, the product I loved so much was actually the dentek COMFORT floss. Those are great.</li>
            <li> These are really great Floss Picks that have a barbed end for good cleaning between your teeth and also a floss end. I use these all the time and they are a great value for the money.</li>
            <li> These are among the worst floss picks I have ever used. If the spaces between your teeth are tight, these will most likely break. I have yet to floss my teeth with them without breaking at least one. Earlier today, I broke EIGHT of them on a single spot before one of them was strong enough to floss that particular space.</li>
            <li> These are by far the worst floss picks I have ever used. They shred just after 2 uses. I went through almost half the pack just trying to floss my upper teeth because they kept breaking. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I feel like these flossers are more flimsy than Dentek Triple Clean picks I have purchased in the past. The floss portion is sturdy though... I haven&#x27;t broken through one yet.</li>
            <li> These are hands down the worst floss picks I have ever used. The thread frayed with each tooth, with fibers getting stuck in my teeth, till it broke.The pick side is sharp and flimsy, it actually chipped off in my teeth.</li>
            <li> Great. My favourite floss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using dentek flosspicks for 5 years now, and I&#x27;ve generally been very happy. These flosspicks, however, SUCK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It breaks very easily. If I start on the back teeth with the tighter gap, they last 2teeth.&lt;br /&gt;2. They SQUEAK when you floss. Squeak is the wrong word, they scratch like nails on chalkboard, and the sound is unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above two criticisms are also my typical criticisms of cheap generic floss. I AM going to buy dentek again, because i do know they make good floss picks- just not these ones.</li>
            <li> I bought it, I like or it works for me or the recipient of the item or it makes the college students in the family happy.  Nothing profound or lyrical â€“ whatever I bought, it does what I want it to do.</li>
            <li> Keep on buying cause I like them.</li>
            <li> I carry a few of these in my purse ALWAYS.</li>
            <li> Which is six packages of 90 floss picks.  On the plus side, that&#x27;s a lot of floss picks.  These things will probably last me the rest of my life, if I keep using them.&lt;br /&gt;On the minus side, the space for the floss is rather narrow - it&#x27;s ok for the front teeth, but it is difficult to fit the floss between the back teeth because the floss part isn&#x27;t long enough.  This is difficult to describe, but trust me - if you try these you&#x27;ll understand what I mean.  And if you do use these, you&#x27;ll also quickly understand why having to wrestle with the pick to get the floss between your teeth is a problem:  the pick is so SHARP the odds of stabbing yourself in the fingers are pretty high if you have to handle the thing for very long.  I get that a pointy pick is better than a dull one, but these little monsters would work for finger-prick blood testers.  And the points bend very easily, so it&#x27;s more likely you&#x27;ll end up stabbing yourself in the gums than removing whatever is stuck between your molars.  Oh, and the floss loosens very easily on these, so it might be good for one or two teeth, but then you need a new one because it&#x27;s too loose to work again.  Sigh.  They were inexpensive.  Now I know why. Cannot recommend.</li>
            <li> terrible. they are really sharp and they break really easily when flossing between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I thought i was getting the originals when ordered.</li>
            <li> these are the worst. My teeth are fairly close together and I find that many different, cheep, products break after just a few teeth. This one shreds and leaves pieces of floss in between each and every tooth. I need a minimum of 4 picks to floss my teeth, then another couple to try and get the floss out from between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I prefer this over floss anytime. I think you get a better clean with this but that&#x27;s just my opinion.</li>
            <li> These serve their purpose. I carry them in my purse in case I need something while eating out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lazy sort of person perhaps, I do not like the string floss (won&#x27;t do that).  My wife brought these home for me to try, Hooked!  Would like to say I can spot a good deal when I see ones so I stocked up.  Will be back, thanks!</li>
            <li> These are a somewhat newer version of the old triple clean. Both are fairly weak floss, and they shred easily on any ncomposite dental work. But the older version has a far more rigid frame, and you could actually floss. These new ones are weak, and they only bend. The same xompany has an &amp;#34;Xtra Clean&amp;#34; pick out there that is double floss. The double floss sucks as well...but that is waht the frame was like.</li>
            <li> Sure, these \\&quot;floss picks\\&quot; will get your teeth clean. But it may take 12 on these things to actually complete your task. Often the floss component comes free of the plastic part when flossing tighter gaps. Also (and even more annoyingng), the floss component will fall apart between your molars, leaving floss threads tangling from your teeth, which are impossible to floss out. If you love being frustrated, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I love floss picks. I try all sorts and generally buy a bag every time I go shopping. The first time I used these I found the rope like floss to be so thick I had a few moments where I thought I would not be able to get the pick back out again. I know I have tight teeth and usually get the ribbon, satin, glide versions but they simply aren&#x27;t as effective as the triple clean. I can floss with this one right after flossing with a glide and see a significant difference. I do not understand the other reviewers who state that the string breaks or shreds. My experience is the plastic ribbon type break and this thick piece of rope is unlikely to yield. I think these are the most effective pick available. However if you do have very tight teeth I would recommend starting with the thin plastic ribbon type until you learn how your teeth are situated well enough to maneuver the triple clean.</li>
            <li> These are better than our last store-bought bag of picks of the same exact brand and type! The floss does not break anywhere as easily. My husband and I are both very satisfied with this purchase, which should last for a long time for the two of us!</li>
            <li> They do not last at all... Will get stuck in your teeth and won&#x27;t floss well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only good if you want to use ONE pick per tooth.... DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> These things are F!@#ing terrible. The floss material stretches out and frays almost immediately, which promptly becomes lodged in my teeth. So I have to waste another pick just to get the floss out. The floss material itself is somehow rough and feels abrasive, unlike OralB picks which are smooth. OralB beats the hell out of these pieces of crap, often lasting me several cleanings before breaking. OralB from now on for me.</li>
            <li> Okay  quality.These break as opposed to what advertised.</li>
            <li> The floss used in these shred very easily and are hard to remove once inserted between your teeth.  I&#x27;ve used others and this problem does not occur as easily and frequently as these do.  Also, the pick on the end bends easily.  I usually have to use several to finish the job.</li>
            <li> These  dental floss picks are easier to use than regular floss and you get so many that they  can last a few months and you&#x27;ll save money in the end.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted.  I had purchased these in a store and wanted to buy in bulk to keep from having to go back to the store for them over and over and to save a little money.</li>
            <li> Didnt like them at first.They were to thick.Hard to get in between teeth.But after I got used to them I dont like any others</li>
            <li> Give these another shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the old ones that shredded. It bothered me, but not enough to stop buying them. I ordered this 6 pack last week and, to my surprise, an updated product arrived. The picks are now green instead of white and the floss has been changed; it&#x27;s now a lighter flossâ€“it fits where it didn&#x27;t used toâ€“and of the 10 or so I&#x27;ve used, not a single one has resulted in shredded floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Floss isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d usually bother writing a review for, but I wanted to let the unhappy folks know that it appears DenTek has listened and made a change for the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Floss\\&quot; falls apart after two teeth and isn&#x27;t strong enough for back teeth.  Terrible product.  Floss isn&#x27;t waxed and is instead some kind of woven thread which is weak.  Purchase something else.</li>
            <li> I mean, flossing is always good. These things just make it much more fun!</li>
            <li> I have used floss picks for some time and can&#x27;t go without them.  I have had several brands and have never had any issues, until I bought these.  They are useless.  Can&#x27;t make it past 2 or 3 teeth without them shredding.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> The Triple Clean Floss Picks are too large for my teeth. They&#x27;re very hard to get in place and then difficult to remove. I&#x27;ve broken several while in my mouth and then the floss is stuck between my teeth. Don&#x27;t buy the Pack of 90 until you try this brand and are satisfied.</li>
            <li> These are the 3rd brand I&#x27;ve tried, and I like them the best.  [Summer, 2014] I have tight teeth, and common floss shreds and/or breaks--as do the other floss picks I&#x27;ve tried. I understand the reviewers who have had that problem with these in the past [it&#x27;s a PAIN when floss shreds or breaks!!], but these Triple Clean by DenTek have been great.  I really wonder if the company took the earlier negative feedback to the lab and had the techs re-engineer them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the pick part of this tool to be very useful. It is textured to maximize the scrubbing power between the teeth.  The plastic is much stronger than others I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have objected to floss picks in the past because they seem like a waste of plastic, but after my dental hygienist recommended them, I now use them daily.  Yes, it&#x27;s a bit of plastic waste each time, but the benefit is terrific.  No more purple fingers from wrapping regular floss!  Instead of flossing 2 to 3 times a week, I now floss 2 to 3 times a day.  I am curious to see if the hygienist notices a difference at my next cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE--after using these for 6 months, the hygienist noticed that my gums bled less with my last cleaning [as in &amp;#34;hardly at all&amp;#34;]! I attribute this to more consistent flossing. What ever brand you use, the point of floss picks is to make flossing easier--and therefore more frequent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE--I just received a 3 pack from Amazon [previous purchase had been from Walmart]. Despite being labeled &amp;#34;Triple Clean&amp;#34; they have GREEN floss, and they ARE terrible. I am returning them. The good ones have WHITE floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picks I received  are not in the packaging shown on the Amazon website--which has &amp;#34;NO BREAK FLOSS--GUARANTEED!&amp;#34;--on the front. This is very deceptive!!  They are the &amp;#34;Triple Clean&amp;#34; model, but they do not have the &amp;#34;No Break Floss&amp;#34; logo.  The ones I got from Amazon today must be the older picks. Be sure and get the Triple Clean with the white floss--and the &amp;#34;No Break Floss Guaranteed&amp;#34; emblem on the front.  A note--my teeth are so tight that I have to bite down on the floss pick in order to get the floss between my teeth! [You can imagine the stress on my fingers with regular floss wrapped around them!] If you have spaces between your teeth, perhaps the green floss model would be OK, but l will get the newer version!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE--Now in March, 2015 I bought 3 bags of the DenTek Triple Clean from CVS Pharmacy [No Break Floss Guaranteed] and they are terrible!  They have the white floss, but it comes out of the plastic, and the plastic &amp;#34;pick&amp;#34; part is flimsy--making it more difficult to hold, to floss and to use the pick. I called the company, and was on hold for 15 minutes.  After 5 minutes I decided to just send an email. By the time I finished the note and sent it off, they had STILL not answered the phone.  It seems like DenTek got it right for a short period, but has lousy quality control and even worse customer service.

            <li> This is the Best floss ever. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;The special string scrubs between the teeth thoroughly.</li>
            <li> The floss breaks almost instantly and the pick end breaks off in between your teeth within seconds, absolute garbage. The CVS brand are by far the best I have found.</li>
            <li> I have very tight teeth and go have had to only use the glide type floss in the past and those would break after only a few teeth. I was surprised at all the negative reviews, these are by far the best floss sticks I have ever used. They will fray a bit on some teeth but DON&amp;#34;T BREAK!! And it is scrubbing floss something I could never use on some of my teeth till now!!</li>
            <li> These are great, convenient and affordable also very easy to use, I love them!!!&lt;br /&gt;My dentist recommended these a few years ago and I&#x27;ve used them ever since.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently in dental school so I take care of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I bought these at a local store because I ran out of floss and they didn&#x27;t have what I normally used.&lt;br /&gt;These are of very low quality and shreds easily. Stay away from this product and go with either Oral-B or Plackers.</li>
            <li> These picks are truly horrible.  They not only break left and right, the pick (non-floss) end is too fat and weak to be effective at all.  Go with some other brand!</li>
            <li> These are horrible.  I can&#x27;t believe they can put these on the market and feel good about them.  They stretch immediately making it impossible to floss.  They usually don&#x27;t last one mouth cleaning session as they also break.  Even the plastic around the floss is poor quality and bends easily.  I hate being so worked up over such a small item but they&#x27;re that frustrating to use.  I ended up tossing them.  The Plackers brand is the way to go.  They&#x27;re a solid alternative and last!</li>
            <li> These are great. The bad reviews have to be for the older version of this product, these are with white floss not green. I have tight teeth and these won&#x27;t break! Would recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Dentek, because although they may not be the most rigid floss piks, I don&#x27;t have much room between some of my teeth and the actual toothpick end is sharp enough to fit in those gaps. I also don&#x27;t like the plastic floss, since I don&#x27;t think it does as good of a job. And last can&#x27;t fit the one&#x27;s with perpendicular floss back in my molars easily, and I do just fine with these. I was really just ecstatic about the price, since these can cost a pretty penny at the store and I just nabbed 6 bags for thirteen dollars with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe you like the perpendicular plastic floss and thick picks... these aren&#x27;t for you then. But these are for me.</li>
            <li> I use floss picks every day, but I think I&#x27;m going to have to throw these away. My teeth are not particularly tight, but I have to force these both in and out between my teeth. They don&#x27;t shred for me, but they do stretch and warp.</li>
            <li> I got so bored of single floss. These totally make flossing fun again and actually is a lot more convenient for me now. I just love flossing. It works great if u actually use them correctly. No bad breath over here ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜†</li>
            <li> Do not buy these floss picks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The floss is TOO THICK to fit in between my teeth properly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) After the first tooth, the floss goes limp and pretty much useless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The other end of the pick is not useful AT ALL it is WAY too thick and uncomfortable to stick in between your teeth to dig anything out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heed mine and everyone else&#x27;s reviews.  Wish I had known this before I picked them up at Target.</li>
            <li> Bought these at my local pharmacy because they didn&#x27;t Plackers. The tension on the string is poor and the string completely shreds if your teeth are tight. After a few teeth, the string will come off on one end and you will end up using a few just to finish flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpick end is also useless. The pick is extremely flexible and just bends when you try to use it. Never going to purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> I wish that i&#x27;d looked up the amazon reviews for these before I purchased these at the local store.  They are terrible.  The floss doesn&#x27;t remain taut in the pick, so after the first tooth, they are pretty much impossible to use.  I used Plackers before - I will probably just chuck these and buy more plackers I guess.  The Dentek ones designed for back teeth were just as bad too.</li>
            <li> I have found this brand to be incredibly flimsy. I have to use 4 to do what 1 of other brands would do. I bought them on sale but I wouldn&#x27;t take them for free now. I would give zero stars if that option was available. Beware.</li>
            <li> floss breaks way too easy.</li>
            <li> These are the worst Floss picks I have used. The floss does not glide and shreds after very little use. I am throwing these away and getting something different. Wow. Terrible. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid flosser and always use floss picks. These are probably the worst I&#x27;ve tried. They&#x27;re difficult to get in between your teeth. They tear up quickly and leave behind bits of floss rather than removing food/plaque (also means you have to use about 4 of them to floss once). They have an abrasive, uncomfortable feel. I&#x27;ve injured my gums with them a few times trying to wrestle with them. For whatever reason I wanted to finish the packet so I kept using them. BAD IDEA. They&#x27;re sooo bad they actually caught on a filling and ripped it right out. Now these little pieces of junk are going to end up costing me hundreds of dollars to replace a filling. Careful!</li>
            <li> I have used many different flossers, and these are easily the worst ones yet. My teeth are fairly tight, yet many flossers work fine.  I am partial to flat floss/Glide, but regular ones work too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the case of the Dentek flossers, I find that they often shred, getting stuck between my teeth, or one end of the floss gets pulled out of the flosser.  After trying several of the Dentek flossers, I gave up and threw the bag away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed by this product, as it failed to meet even the minimal functional requirements of a flossing pick.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be better off buying some yarn and trying to floss with that than using this crap. I wonder how these got past product review when they fray off into your teeth after one use.</li>
            <li> Got it at Walgreens. To floss once, you need at least 4-5 sticks as string breaks after flossing a few (4-5) teeth. DONT USE IT EVEN IF SOMEONE GIVES IT FOR FREE. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> These floss picks are too thick. My teeth are fairly close together and need thinner floss. The floss would not even fit between some of my back teeth. The flavor of the floss is okay. It is not an overpowering mint. And, the floss does not have too much wax. However, these are not a good choice for someone who has teeth that are tightly spaced. I will not buy these again.</li>
            <li> I have used several brands of flossers.  These are by far the worst.  They are thick and got stuck in my teeth.  They shredded and broke.  It took 5 flossers to do my whole mouth.  I had much better luck with Plackers, or even store brand.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this junk.</li>
            <li> The new and improved triple clean ones are the best ones I&#x27;ve ever used. Went through a 90 pack and didn&#x27;t break one! I used to break what seemed like every other with different brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> There floss gets stuck in my teeth and I&#x27;m afraid they&#x27;re making things worse than better. They also break, I have to use 3 for everytime I floss. Save your money!!!!</li>
            <li> These things are terrible. The floss is rough and gets stuck in tight places, almost feels like it&#x27;s going to pull my teeth out with it! It&#x27;s always shredding and it just plain sucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Plackers, but ran out and this was the only item in store.  What a piece of junk.  The floss shreds right after the first tooth.  My teeth are by no means too close together, yet the floss gets stuck and I have to literally yank to get it out.  Never buying this particular product, better yet, this brand, again.</li>
            <li> All right, I recommend.</li>
