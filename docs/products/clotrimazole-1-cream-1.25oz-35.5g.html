    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>One of the best creams I&#x27;ve found....</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>This one has worked great for me, and best of all, it is carried by my Dollar Tree Dollar Store, at 1.25 ounces for one dollar!  </li>
            <li>A great price through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great service and delivery.  </li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>Contrary to the claim on this products Drug Facts - it may not be effective under nails - it is quite effective.</li>
            <li>Great product as does exactly what it says on the box.</li>
            <li>sure to slather this cream on almost 1 inch beyond the border of the infected site as the fungus will jump to the untreated surrounding skin and spread!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;You may need more than 1 tube of this as you want to be generous with this cream and do it frequently.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is more like toothpaste.</li>
            <li>People don&#x27;t realize that you can use this on a variety of skin ailments, including tinea veriscolor, the odor isn&#x27;t overwhelming or offensive, it works.</li>
            <li>AM SURE SOMEONE WILL TAKE OUR MONEY AND FORGET ABOUT FEED BACKS..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li>I am sure it will take some months before the nails grow from out of the sealing process</li>
            <li>I will by more once I have finished the tube.</li>
            <li>Clotrimazole is effective and this is a good deal on a generic product.</li>
            <li>My feet are smooth and I am not itching between my toes.</li>
            <li>Under a weeks time of adequately submerging my toes in this product, the fungus under the nails has significantly reduced, and color already restored.</li>
            <li>simple that, good, which is good enough.</li>
            <li>That would be fine if it worked, but it just hasn&#x27;t for me, and because of the thicker consistency, even though there is more in the tube by volume than other brands, I tend to use more.</li>
            <li>but it did stop the itching right away.</li>
            <li>this product came exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The medication itself is fine, however I have bought several tubes of this product.</li>
            <li>So I got it much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>no odor and fast working.  </li>
            <li>It is really helping me</li>
            <li>There are several different active ingredients out there on the market, and each may work best on different types of fungus.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure whether or not I received a defective batch or what since most of the other reviews are positive, but I&#x27;m a long-time clotrimazole user and I&#x27;m always looking for ways to stock up more inexpensively.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the brand of foot cream for a few weeks now and it seems Tinactin and Lamisil work better at curing athletes foot.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li>But, I am pretty certain that this product is reaching those yellow spores, stagnant, near the cuticle line.</li>
            <li>ON THE OTHER HAND IF FEEDBACK OF YOUR CHOICE MUST BE FILLED OUT WASTING MY TIME</li>
            <li>Same as the higher priced brand name Clotrimazole cream but cheaper.</li>
            <li>Also available locally in dollar General for only .88 Cent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s as potent as other well known brand name creams</li>
            <li>This product is same active ingredient (Clotrimazole 1%) as the higher priced national brands.  </li>
            <li>No need whatever to spend the big bucks for the major brand.</li>
            <li>So read the lables closely, and if one product is not working for a particular issue, you may need to try one with a different active ingredient.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Does the job for itchy little red bumps rash around panty line of upper thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the other generic clotrimazole 1% that is only $0.41 and $3.49 shipping, which is sold by another seller here on Amazon.  It is only 1 oz.  So it is smaller and takes longer to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tube, by Natureplex, is substantially bigger as it is 1.25 oz and is cheaper as an Amazon Prime member.  I don&#x27;t pay for shipping and I get it in 2 days.  So I got it much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this.  You will see improvement within 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To deal with the itch, I put on a generic 1% hydrocortisone anti-itch cream.  Then I put on the clotrimazole 1% anti-fungal cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to slather this cream on almost 1 inch beyond the border of the infected site as the fungus will jump to the untreated surrounding skin and spread!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may need more than 1 tube of this as you want to be generous with this cream and do it frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I read that if the fungus spreads to other parts of the body, you may want to try Fluconazole (Diflucan).  It is a pill taken once.  You need a prescription for this and they have a generic version that is only about $20-30.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the brand of foot cream for a few weeks now and it seems Tinactin and Lamisil work better at curing athletes foot.&lt;br /&gt;its cheaper and does work just seems to take longer.</li>
            <li> Not only is it 88¢ at Walmart but you don&#x27;t have to wait to have it shipped...obviously. It didn&#x27;t work for me to cure but it did stop the itching right away. To get rid of athlete&#x27;s foot get undecylenic acid, they have an Equate brand at Walmart for about $5 and it will cure it all, even in the nails.</li>
            <li> Wipes away my athlete foot symptoms after 2 or 3 days&#x27; application. No need whatever to spend the big bucks for the major brand.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. It protects against the yeast Athletic foot infection. I work out a pool everyday and make&lt;br /&gt;sure I use this foot cream. A great price through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This products cleans up the fungus, and leaves the rest up to you to keep it from coming back. I will buy it again if i need too.</li>
            <li> One of the best creams I&#x27;ve found....no odor and fast working.  Great service and delivery.  Will definitely purchase again.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy.</li>
            <li> had been trying some of the sprays with no luck....this lotion is not only soothing for dry cracked feet, but definitely heals them as well.</li>
            <li> This product is same active ingredient (Clotrimazole 1%) as the higher priced national brands.  There are several different active ingredients out there on the market, and each may work best on different types of fungus.  So read the lables closely, and if one product is not working for a particular issue, you may need to try one with a different active ingredient.  This one has worked great for me, and best of all, it is carried by my Dollar Tree Dollar Store, at 1.25 ounces for one dollar!  The name brand products would be closer to 10 dollars for the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/22/12:  I recently saw this same product at Walmart for $0.88</li>
            <li> Same as the higher priced brand name Clotrimazole cream but cheaper. Also available locally in dollar General for only .88 Cent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s as potent as other well known brand name creams</li>
            <li> Works great! Got rid of my little thing I had goin on  between my baby toe!:-(  Yes I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> simple that, good, which is good enough. The drug did the job it was intended for, take care of those nasty fungus, lol&lt;br /&gt;Had an Ex for it, went to pharmacy to get equivalent but refused it at $39 + tax &#x3D; $43, ridiculous</li>
            <li> $1 at Dollar Tree. Tried it. Doesn&#x27;t get rid of Athletes Foot.</li>
            <li> My Podiatrist recommended this for my athletics foot. It seems to be working. My feet are smooth and I am not itching between my toes. Very cheap compared to other expensive creams out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether or not I received a defective batch or what since most of the other reviews are positive, but I&#x27;m a long-time clotrimazole user and I&#x27;m always looking for ways to stock up more inexpensively. The clotrimazole that I&#x27;ve always used, whether name brand or generic, has been a white cream or paste. This stuff is more like toothpaste. That would be fine if it worked, but it just hasn&#x27;t for me, and because of the thicker consistency, even though there is more in the tube by volume than other brands, I tend to use more. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> The medication itself is fine, however I have bought several tubes of this product. Each time there was a big bubble in the middle of the tube which amounted to about 50% of the volume in the tube. I would guess that each tube contained between .63 and .75 ounces of the product rather than 1.25 ounces. I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> People don&#x27;t realize that you can use this on a variety of skin ailments, including tinea veriscolor, the odor isn&#x27;t overwhelming or offensive, it works.</li>
            <li> I FIND IT A COMPLETE AND USELESS METHOD OF GETTING FEEDBACK ON PRODUCTS YOU HAVE SOLD TO ME.IF YOU WOULD JUST LOOK AT OUR FILE OF PURCHASES YOU MIGHT WONDER WHY THIS PERSON KEEPS BUYING??? ON THE OTHER HAND IF FEEDBACK OF YOUR CHOICE MUST BE FILLED OUT WASTING MY TIME AM SURE SOMEONE WILL TAKE OUR MONEY AND FORGET ABOUT FEED BACKS..CHEERS</li>
            <li> Clotrimazole is effective and this is a good deal on a generic product. I&#x27;ll buy more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li> I have had athletes foot and fungus under the nails for over 5 years. Contrary to the claim on this products Drug Facts - it may not be effective under nails - it is quite effective. After a week of applying approximately a dime size droplet,and spreading lightly, the yellow began to reside, and color re-appeared. I am sure it will take some months before the nails grow from out of the sealing process they which  has aided in the spores sealing off the oxygen for growth purposes. But, I am pretty certain that this product is reaching those yellow spores, stagnant, near the cuticle line. Great Product. I have tried Tolnaftate, and Udecyclenic Acid with very, very little affects. Under a weeks time of adequately submerging my toes in this product, the fungus under the nails has significantly reduced, and color already restored.</li>
            <li> this product came exactly as described. It did the same thing as Lotrimin for a fraction of the price! I would definitely get this again.</li>
            <li> It is really helping me</li>
            <li> Great product as does exactly what it says on the box. I will by more once I have finished the tube.</li>
