            <li>Love the eye shadows though!</li>
            <li>Colors are beautiful, goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily and although it looks as great as a liquid liner, it does not smudge like one.</li>
            <li>Love this gift set very pretty colors great value for your money!</li>
            <li>nude set, neatly packaged in a kit, seems to be a great fit for me.</li>

            <li>The colors are nice and do not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>I liked the mascara as well.</li>
            <li>but this product was so nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for those of us that like to enhance our beauty but still look natural doing it.</li>
            <li>Excellent essential kit for the price!</li>
            <li>The eye shadow is equivalent to beauty store brands, for sure.</li>
            <li>I love the mascara, and believe it is also the equivalent of a beauty store brand.</li>
            <li>And yes I have used Physicans Formula on many occasions</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s 9 shades in varying sizes of okay to deal with too f</li>
            <li>pigment is truly okay</li>

            <li>On another note, love the product</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my favorite...</li>
            <li>Physicians formula is my favorite line.</li>
            <li>I love this Physicians Formula makeup</li>
            <li>and I love this package.</li>
            <li>I like to layer the eyeliner by tight-lining my top with one color and the bottom with another.</li>
            <li>They all seem to stay in place for most of the day.</li>
            <li>Love physicians formula eye wear</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>Love the eye shadows.</li>
            <li>The brand makes a much better mascara so don&#x27;t buy this for the mascara.  </li>
            <li>They would be better if divided though.</li>
            <li>I love this set.</li>
            <li>I love all the color combinations (two eye shadows and a coordinating, darker eye liner color).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Eyeliners are ok.</li>
            <li>the liners are nice, they go on smooth but the mascara is just meh.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I love sephora</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to tolerate it better than others.</li>
            <li>I love the eyeliners that come in this kit.</li>
            <li>I did get better results using a sponge eyeshadow applicator.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love this brand....</li>
            <li>When the eye shadow is applied or swatched with the use of your fingers, it is nicely pigmented and smooth; however, the product can not be picked up by a makeup brush.</li>
            <li>I will repurchase the eyeliner for sure.</li>
            <li>Eyeshadows are super light &amp; you need to apply a lot to get a good color.</li>
            <li>New product no package damage great deal</li>
            <li>The shadows are lovely, buttery and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The colors were very shimmery and smooth and looked quite beautiful when the light catches it.</li>
            <li>but everything else is very cool and shimmery</li>
            <li>wow it was a great price.</li>
            <li>happy)&lt;br /&gt;-Brown eyeliner is very unique and both are acceptable for the more &amp;#34;day&amp;#34; or 15 minute get ready kind of days (when sealed with a shadow)&lt;br</li>
            <li>the other products are great!</li>
            <li>I like it fine.  </li>
            <li>The eyeliners are smooth and easy to apply and leave a clean line that is easy to draw.</li>
            <li>And the eyeshadow colors look very pretty!</li>
            <li>This would be great for a younger person.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not glittery, but it adds shimmer and light around your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really enjoy Physicians Formula products.</li>
            <li>the brown is too light</li>
            <li>I really loved that this product came with pretty much everything needed to do my eye makeup.</li>
            <li>They are nicely pigmented and have a high level of shimmer.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t use the mascara much but the eyeliner is ok but seems to smear easily.  </li>
            <li>The lighter one is a unique light brown shade, very pretty and quite shimmery.</li>
            <li>The liners are very soft and apply nicely.  </li>
            <li>Special price deal at the time.</li>
            <li>Nicely surprised how nice this was.</li>
            <li>Mascara was the only good part of this combo</li>
            <li>so I was pleasantly surprised to find all of these items in one nicely priced kit.</li>
            <li>Will use until I can either suck up the $$$ for a better quality set or just as a top shimmer for current products.</li>
            <li>Loved everything except mascara has no liquid and is super dry.</li>
            <li>My new favorite make-up.</li>
            <li>The colors were pretty, and I was excited to put it on.</li>
            <li>I have an incredible amount of allergies and sensitivities to chemicals and this product didn&#x27;t bother me in the least, it just wasn&#x27;t what I thought I was getting.</li>
            <li>but this was still worth it</li>
            <li>My main issue is that the eyeliner and mascara wipe off so easy.</li>
            <li>The price alone is worth just the eye liner.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have quite a few but have found they are more cost effective on Amazon</li>
            <li>This kit is useful and compact.</li>
            <li>It is highly pigmented and super smooth.  </li>
            <li>I am really happy with the eye shadow, mascara, and the black eyeliner!</li>
            <li>The Mascara and the Black are eyeliner are absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>It went right in the bin.</li>
            <li>The black eyeliner goes on smooth and extremely easy but the gold eyeliner does not go on easy at all.</li>
            <li>: I think it is okay, for me it is too light and not very pigmented and it is too close together</li>
            <li>It is super clumpy, I really would not use it all the time.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pretty but they are also very metallic, so if you prefer matte shadows this is not for you.</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>So far, I have only used them dry and they have been perfect.</li>
            <li>One of the three box came damage outside but all the products inside are ok.</li>
            <li>I love everything in this package except the mascara, which is only passable.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty affordable for all that you get.</li>
            <li>and  it may my eyes more blue.</li>
            <li>Seems to last most of the day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but I don&#x27;t know what the big wand/little wand is all about.</li>
            <li>I love the lighter eyeliner on my waterline to make the eyes look bigger.</li>
            <li>Sad, because I loved the light, but perfectly smooth coverage and miss that ease.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many especially eye liners and all the ones I&#x27;ve tried they make me feel</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m willing to continue to try this product b/c</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I need; some eyeshadow, eyeliner and mascara.</li>
            <li>This is the first Physicians Formula product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It would probably look good on a pale ginger, though.</li>
            <li>I will be back to review how good it actually worked.</li>
            <li>I am a makeup addict, and I have tried a large selection of higher name brands and drug store items.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Liner will crease if not sealed pretty much</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow is great,  use a different brush other than the spongy thingy that comes with it.  </li>
            <li>this makeup is equally good in quality, if not better....</li>
            <li>While I prefer Stila liquid eyeliner, I really liked the Black eyeliner included in this kit.</li>
            <li>so you could easily get the colors mixed up.</li>
            <li>The brown part of the mascara does not show up much, but the black part is nice.</li>
            <li>Eyeshadow is very shimmery/sparkly.</li>
            <li>Before the real details I must also add that PF used to be my spurge a la drugstore makeup</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than in the drugstores</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t use much</li>
            <li>The eyeliners work really well</li>
            <li>and it also runs out really fast.</li>
            <li>I tried it haha.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>is a very lite brown.</li>
            <li>Therefore, the shadows are very irridescent.</li>
            <li>I really like the colors in this makeup set.</li>
            <li>Also I don&#x27;t wear a whole lot of makeup</li>
            <li>But that is not all, there is other reasons to love this set.</li>
            <li>The shadows are beautiful once they are on, but the brush that comes with the shadow is useless.  </li>
            <li>I usually wear, plus I liked having that all in one eye make up in one box.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a lite gray and the brown isn&#x27;t a dark brown</li>
            <li>my new favorites!</li>
            <li>I love the black...</li>
            <li>The eyeliner dulled out the first time I used it and was not black when applied.</li>
            <li>i love this little kit  </li>
            <li>It works very well with my sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>So in my opinion it is worth the ten dollars but</li>
            <li>Each palette I&#x27;ve purchased seemed to have two colors I really liked, with the third being always too dark.</li>
            <li>It says hypoallergenic which is the reason I bought it because my skin is very sensitive to makeup.</li>
            <li>i have very, very sensitive skin....</li>
            <li>I personally love the mascara and have forsaken the ten other tubes in my bag.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever find an eyeliner and mascara that don&#x27;t cause a reaction unless I&#x27;m willing to spend an enormous amount of money.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need or use more than that Other than the occasional lip gloss</li>
            <li>Overall, a decent product, I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to put so much elbow grease into getting the product out.</li>
            <li>The natural colors in this set make it almost look like you are not wearing make-up.</li>
            <li>I completely agree with the reviewer that said the colors were a bit too shimmer-y.  </li>
            <li>First mascara in a long time that I can wear every day without irritation!!  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li>but the eye shadow and liner are exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as rich as expected; it&#x27;s lighter, more difficult to apply.</li>
            <li>I had to use an old brush from a different brand.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t actually used the products yet, but its exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>The next day, I was back to normal, but I will never use this product again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The eyeshadows are all very pretty colors, however they are hard to put on using a brush.</li>

            <li> It goes on easily and although it looks as great as a liquid liner, it does not smudge like one.</li>
            <li> Love this gift set very pretty colors great value for your money!</li>
            <li> nude set, neatly packaged in a kit, seems to be a great fit for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product is good - but the problem is the pack design.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice and do not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> I liked the mascara as well.</li>
            <li> but this product was so nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for those of us that like to enhance our beauty but still look natural doing it.</li>
            <li> Excellent essential kit for the price!</li>
            <li> The eye shadow is equivalent to beauty store brands, for sure.</li>
            <li> I love the mascara, and believe it is also the equivalent of a beauty store brand.</li>
            <li> And yes I have used Physicans Formula on many occasions</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s 9 shades in varying sizes of okay to deal with too f</li>
            <li> pigment is truly okay</li>
            <li> :) I LOVE the bronze/ nude eye liner and mascara...</li>
            <li> a must buy for anyone who wants a color on a great price</li>
            <li> Love everything</li>
            <li> On another note, love the product</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my favorite...</li>
            <li> Physicians formula is my favorite line.</li>
            <li> I love this Physicians Formula makeup</li>
            <li> and I love this package.</li>
            <li> I like to layer the eyeliner by tight-lining my top with one color and the bottom with another.</li>
            <li> They all seem to stay in place for most of the day.</li>
            <li> Love physicians formula eye wear</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> Love the eye shadows.</li>
            <li> The brand makes a much better mascara so don&#x27;t buy this for the mascara.  </li>
            <li> They would be better if divided though.</li>
            <li> I love this set.</li>
            <li> I love all the color combinations (two eye shadows and a coordinating, darker eye liner color).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Eyeliners are ok.</li>
            <li> the liners are nice, they go on smooth but the mascara is just meh.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I love sephora</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to tolerate it better than others.</li>
            <li> I love the eyeliners that come in this kit.</li>
            <li> I did get better results using a sponge eyeshadow applicator.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> love this brand....</li>
            <li> When the eye shadow is applied or swatched with the use of your fingers, it is nicely pigmented and smooth; however, the product can not be picked up by a makeup brush.</li>
            <li> I will repurchase the eyeliner for sure.</li>
            <li> Eyeshadows are super light &amp; you need to apply a lot to get a good color.</li>
            <li> New product no package damage great deal</li>
            <li> The shadows are lovely, buttery and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The colors were very shimmery and smooth and looked quite beautiful when the light catches it.</li>
            <li> but everything else is very cool and shimmery</li>
            <li> wow it was a great price.</li>
            <li> happy)&lt;br /&gt;-Brown eyeliner is very unique and both are acceptable for the more &amp;#34;day&amp;#34; or 15 minute get ready kind of days (when sealed with a shadow)&lt;br</li>
            <li> the other products are great!</li>
            <li> I like it fine.  </li>
            <li> The eyeliners are smooth and easy to apply and leave a clean line that is easy to draw.</li>
            <li> And the eyeshadow colors look very pretty!</li>
            <li> This would be great for a younger person.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not glittery, but it adds shimmer and light around your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really enjoy Physicians Formula products.</li>
            <li> the brown is too light</li>
            <li> I really loved that this product came with pretty much everything needed to do my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> They are nicely pigmented and have a high level of shimmer.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use the mascara much but the eyeliner is ok but seems to smear easily.  </li>
            <li> The lighter one is a unique light brown shade, very pretty and quite shimmery.</li>
            <li> The liners are very soft and apply nicely.  </li>
            <li> Special price deal at the time.</li>
            <li> Nicely surprised how nice this was.</li>
            <li> Mascara was the only good part of this combo</li>
            <li> so I was pleasantly surprised to find all of these items in one nicely priced kit.</li>
            <li> Will use until I can either suck up the $$$ for a better quality set or just as a top shimmer for current products.</li>
            <li> Loved everything except mascara has no liquid and is super dry.</li>
            <li> My new favorite make-up.</li>
            <li> The colors were pretty, and I was excited to put it on.</li>
            <li> I have an incredible amount of allergies and sensitivities to chemicals and this product didn&#x27;t bother me in the least, it just wasn&#x27;t what I thought I was getting.</li>
            <li> but this was still worth it</li>
            <li> My main issue is that the eyeliner and mascara wipe off so easy.</li>
            <li> The price alone is worth just the eye liner.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have quite a few but have found they are more cost effective on Amazon</li>
            <li> This kit is useful and compact.</li>
            <li> It is highly pigmented and super smooth.  </li>
            <li> I am really happy with the eye shadow, mascara, and the black eyeliner!</li>
            <li> The Mascara and the Black are eyeliner are absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> It went right in the bin.</li>
            <li> The black eyeliner goes on smooth and extremely easy but the gold eyeliner does not go on easy at all.</li>
            <li> : I think it is okay, for me it is too light and not very pigmented and it is too close together</li>
            <li> It is super clumpy, I really would not use it all the time.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty but they are also very metallic, so if you prefer matte shadows this is not for you.</li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> So far, I have only used them dry and they have been perfect.</li>
            <li> One of the three box came damage outside but all the products inside are ok.</li>
            <li> I love everything in this package except the mascara, which is only passable.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty affordable for all that you get.</li>
            <li> and  it may my eyes more blue.</li>
            <li> Seems to last most of the day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I don&#x27;t know what the big wand/little wand is all about.</li>
            <li> I love the lighter eyeliner on my waterline to make the eyes look bigger.</li>
            <li> Sad, because I loved the light, but perfectly smooth coverage and miss that ease.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many especially eye liners and all the ones I&#x27;ve tried they make me feel</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m willing to continue to try this product b/c</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I need; some eyeshadow, eyeliner and mascara.</li>
            <li> This is the first Physicians Formula product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> It would probably look good on a pale ginger, though.</li>
            <li> I will be back to review how good it actually worked.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup addict, and I have tried a large selection of higher name brands and drug store items.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Liner will crease if not sealed pretty much</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow is great,  use a different brush other than the spongy thingy that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> this makeup is equally good in quality, if not better....</li>
            <li> While I prefer Stila liquid eyeliner, I really liked the Black eyeliner included in this kit.</li>
            <li> so you could easily get the colors mixed up.</li>
            <li> The brown part of the mascara does not show up much, but the black part is nice.</li>
            <li> Eyeshadow is very shimmery/sparkly.</li>
            <li> Before the real details I must also add that PF used to be my spurge a la drugstore makeup</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than in the drugstores</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use much</li>
            <li> The eyeliners work really well</li>
            <li> and it also runs out really fast.</li>
            <li> I tried it haha.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> is a very lite brown.</li>
            <li> Therefore, the shadows are very irridescent.</li>
            <li> I really like the colors in this makeup set.</li>
            <li> Also I don&#x27;t wear a whole lot of makeup</li>
            <li> But that is not all, there is other reasons to love this set.</li>
            <li> The shadows are beautiful once they are on, but the brush that comes with the shadow is useless.  </li>
            <li> I usually wear, plus I liked having that all in one eye make up in one box.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a lite gray and the brown isn&#x27;t a dark brown</li>
            <li> my new favorites!</li>
            <li> I love the black...</li>
            <li> The eyeliner dulled out the first time I used it and was not black when applied.</li>
            <li> i love this little kit  </li>
            <li> It works very well with my sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> So in my opinion it is worth the ten dollars but</li>
            <li> Each palette I&#x27;ve purchased seemed to have two colors I really liked, with the third being always too dark.</li>
            <li> It says hypoallergenic which is the reason I bought it because my skin is very sensitive to makeup.</li>
            <li> i have very, very sensitive skin....</li>
            <li> I personally love the mascara and have forsaken the ten other tubes in my bag.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever find an eyeliner and mascara that don&#x27;t cause a reaction unless I&#x27;m willing to spend an enormous amount of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need or use more than that Other than the occasional lip gloss</li>
            <li> Overall, a decent product, I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to put so much elbow grease into getting the product out.</li>
            <li> The natural colors in this set make it almost look like you are not wearing make-up.</li>
            <li> I completely agree with the reviewer that said the colors were a bit too shimmer-y.  </li>
            <li> First mascara in a long time that I can wear every day without irritation!!  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> but the eye shadow and liner are exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as rich as expected; it&#x27;s lighter, more difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I had to use an old brush from a different brand.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used the products yet, but its exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> The next day, I was back to normal, but I will never use this product again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The eyeshadows are all very pretty colors, however they are hard to put on using a brush.</li>
            <li> The shadows have decent application with little to no fallout during application and didn&#x27;t crease or cake, even by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> the brush)&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m not a super sensitive type and the mascara</li>
            <li> It was a grey.</li>
            <li> The eyeliners are the only decent items in this bundle &amp; even they are not great.</li>
            <li> The black eye liner stays on without smudging or otherwise disappearing throughout the day - big plus!</li>
            <li> (you basically have a whole tube of mascara in your hand while trying to apply, rather than just an applicator), doesn&#x27;t separate the lashes, and the wands are so short it&#x27;s terribly awkward to use, especially with the brown.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a decline in overall product value from a few items</li>
            <li> so they all get mixed and messy.</li>
            <li> It takes a few extra brush strokes to  get the desired depth of color.</li>
            <li> grey, brown, black, and other colors</li>
            <li> Both eyes were black and blue, and slightly swollen because of just a little mascara, and I&#x27;m not sensitive to make up at all!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering the other colors and what can I say about the price</li>
            <li> First of all, there is nothing wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used their eye liners or mascaras in the past (only blushes and shadows)</li>
            <li> As for the color, it&#x27;s richer if applied wet, and while it&#x27;s shimmery, it&#x27;s not super</li>
            <li> The mascara comes in black on one side, brown on the other.</li>
            <li> you get two eye liners in black and brown a mascara  one side is black and the other side is brown.</li>
            <li> Mascara, I find,  a little hard to use the brush on the smaller one.</li>
            <li> I like the black eyeliner and thats about it .</li>
            <li> I like the eye shadow colors on this palette but the eye liner isn&#x27;t black</li>
            <li> but I use the black eyeliner all the time.  </li>
            <li> I started with just a little mascara, and then was called away.</li>
            <li> The lighter (silver) eyeliner doesn&#x27;t go on easy, multiple layers until color appears and the mascara is terribly clumpy.  </li>
            <li> You can use the colors wet or dry depending on how dramatic of a color you want.</li>
            <li> it says for green eyes</li>
            <li> Waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I even tried to apply it to my hand and it is like it is dried up or something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Physician&#x27;s Formula brand for a few years now.</li>
            <li> that said, I&#x27;ve had some trouble finding an eye shadow palette in their brand.</li>
            <li> The mascara is weird only because the applicator does not coat well &amp; the other side (lighter colored glimmer side) does not even make sense.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the stem of the brush is SO short that you can&#x27;t apply the mascara to all your lashes without hitting yourself in the eye with the packaging.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why it doesnt work</li>
            <li> even though the eye shadow doesn&#x27;t cause any reaction, the eyeliner  and mascara still cause a small itching reaction..</li>
            <li> but I usually stick to chap stick.</li>
            <li> The quality of the eyeshadows was not very good though.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting this product to come out of the palette and onto my shadow brushes.  </li>
            <li> It is so hard to get into my brushes.</li>
            <li> Also sooo hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Arrived late</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint about this set is the mascara.</li>
            <li> I always take my make up off and with this one I at least don&#x27;t have to run to take it off after an hour of putting it on.</li>
            <li> forget it you&#x27;ll look ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I found the mascara to be a little awkward to put on because of the square shape but besides that small issue...</li>
            <li> I did not have any problems with the mascara irritating my eyes as some others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> like that all of the products in the kit are non irritating.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE design that someone clearly didn&#x27;t test with consumers before launching.</li>
            <li> Lame</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so expensive-</li>
            <li> The brush on the mascara is horrible very small</li>
            <li> Mascara was just as bad.  </li>
            <li> #34;how bad can it be!?!?&amp;#34; and found out when I opened it.  </li>
            <li> I have really bad allergies</li>
            <li> It just looks so ugly.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Eyeshadow is horrible!</li>
            <li> The Mascara is horrible it smears.</li>
            <li> The mascara wand is awful and the mascara itself is clumpy and irritates my eyes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use the mascara because the rest of it was so terrible.</li>
            <li> The applicator brushes are terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly as described and expected. Eyeshadow is very shimmery/sparkly.</li>
            <li> Love this set! Excellent essential kit for the price! I am a makeup addict, and I have tried a large selection of higher name brands and drug store items. The eye shadow is equivalent to beauty store brands, for sure. While I prefer Stila liquid eyeliner, I really liked the Black eyeliner included in this kit. I used it all up as an outline for my liquid liner. I love the mascara, and believe it is also the equivalent of a beauty store brand. The eyeshadow does come with an older style brush which I don&#x27;t typically utilize. I prefer specified shadow brushes, but this one is good for a quick-on-the-go application.</li>
            <li> So let me star this by stating that yes, I saw the reviews. Yes, I like shimmer. And yes I have used Physicans Formula on many occasions so I got this set. Before the real details I must also add that PF used to be my spurge a la drugstore makeup and I&#x27;ve noticed a decline in overall product value from a few items lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Shimmer city in a nude palette (works especially well for brown eyed ladies but enough of a mix that all peepers will be happy)&lt;br /&gt;-Brown eyeliner is very unique and both are acceptable for the more &amp;#34;day&amp;#34; or 15 minute get ready kind of days (when sealed with a shadow)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-I too didn&#x27;t like that the shadows aren&#x27;t separate considering the size of the palette (it&#x27;s 9 shades in varying sizes of okay to deal with too f*** do I have a brush that tiny?)&lt;br /&gt;-The pigment is truly okay at best (best being using a primer and wetting the brush)&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m not a super sensitive type and the mascara made my eyes go CRAZY.&lt;br /&gt;-Liner will crease if not sealed pretty much instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall beautiful colors but it was just ehhh. Will use until I can either suck up the $$$ for a better quality set or just as a top shimmer for current products.</li>
            <li> ** Doesn&#x27;t come with a brush - only a sponge applicator. It doesn&#x27;t claim to - I just didn&#x27;t realize it so I figured I&#x27;d share that just in case. :) I LOVE the bronze/ nude eye liner and mascara... my new favorites! The black eye liner stays on without smudging or otherwise disappearing throughout the day - big plus!</li>
            <li> It works very well with my sensitive eyes the colors work great togeather a must buy for anyone who wants a color on a great price</li>
            <li> Great kit, great price.  Love everything</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as rich as expected; it&#x27;s lighter, more difficult to apply. It would probably look good on a pale ginger, though. The brown eyeliner especially.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product is good - but the problem is the pack design. It&#x27;s a rectangle &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; with brushes that come out of both ends. Sadly, the stem of the brush is SO short that you can&#x27;t apply the mascara to all your lashes without hitting yourself in the eye with the packaging. HORRIBLE design that someone clearly didn&#x27;t test with consumers before launching. It went right in the bin.</li>
            <li> New product no package damage great deal</li>
            <li> This package was open when I received it and it said it came with a pencil sharpener, but it wasn&#x27;t in there!! On another note, love the product it&#x27;s my favorite...</li>
            <li> Loved this product. Physicians formula is my favorite line.</li>
            <li> Great packaging, nothing was broke.</li>
            <li> One of the three box came damage outside but all the products inside are ok. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Eyeshadow is horrible! Not pigmented at all</li>
            <li> Excellent, stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I love everything in this package except the mascara, which is only passable.  For the price, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> I love this Physicians Formula makeup and I love this package. Much cheaper than in the drugstores (IF you can find it) and cheaper than Urban Decay (I&#x27;m a drugstore makeup kinda gal) while offering the same colors. Even cheaper if you bought every item separately. Every time I wear it I get compliments on my eyes and my eye makeup...even from my boss who is a total witch. HIGHLY recommended! I am fair skinned gal with blue/green eyes but these shades will go with any complexion and eye color!  I like to layer the eyeliner by tight-lining my top with one color and the bottom with another. You can use the colors wet or dry depending on how dramatic of a color you want. So far, I have only used them dry and they have been perfect. Use this in combination with Physicians Formula DIY Lash Extensions for knockout eyes!!</li>
            <li> The shadows are lovely, buttery and easy to apply. They are nicely pigmented and have a high level of shimmer. The liners are very soft and apply nicely.  The lighter one is a unique light brown shade, very pretty and quite shimmery. The mascaras are okay, I experienced some transfer to my lid and browbone.  They all seem to stay in place for most of the day. I did not feel the need to reapply during my workday.</li>
            <li> Love physicians formula eye wear</li>
            <li> The shadows are. Lame but everything else is very cool and shimmery</li>
            <li> I really loved that this product came with pretty much everything needed to do my eye makeup. The colors were very shimmery and smooth and looked quite beautiful when the light catches it. I did not have any problems with the mascara irritating my eyes as some others have mentioned. I feel this was an excellent deal for the price. I saw it in stores for much more expensive. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this gift set very pretty colors great value for your money!</li>
            <li> The Mascara is horrible it smears. I like the black eyeliner and thats about it .</li>
            <li> I love this it&#x27;s pretty affordable for all that you get. I saw a pack like this in the stores for almost double the price and you didn&#x27;t get the mascaras</li>
            <li> i love this little kit  it goes with me everywhere</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used the products yet, but its exactly what I expected. The packaging came very nicely. And the eyeshadow colors look very pretty! I will be back to review how good it actually worked.</li>
            <li> you get two eye liners in black and brown a mascara  one side is black and the other side is brown. then you get the eye shadow in shimmer colors grey, brown, black, and other colors it says for green eyes but I tried it on as soon as I received it and I have blue eyes and  it may my eyes more blue. I will be ordering the other colors and what can I say about the price wow it was a great price.</li>
            <li> Nicely surprised how nice this was. Has good instructions on the package as well. Special price deal at the time. 10.00 I believe.</li>
            <li> The eyeliners are the only decent items in this bundle &amp; even they are not great. The shadows are not pigmented at all and don&#x27;t show up. They&#x27;re too shimmery and the colors are too close together so they all get mixed and messy. The mascara wand is awful and the mascara itself is clumpy and irritates my eyes. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> First mascara in a long time that I can wear every day without irritation!!  Love the eye shadows.</li>
            <li> Love this great eyeliner amazing mascara and great combo of eyeshadow perfect packaging as well</li>
            <li> I like the eye shadows, they do have shimmer but I don&#x27;t use much and it&#x27;s good for summer time.  Good color selection.  Seems to last most of the day.  The brush works great for filling in eyebrows (there are two darker non-shimmer colors). I haven&#x27;t use the mascara much but the eyeliner is ok but seems to smear easily.  Couldn&#x27;t pass it up for the price though.</li>
            <li> Eye shadow: I think it is okay, for me it is too light and not very pigmented and it is too close together so you could easily get the colors mixed up. I do like the outside of the packaging. Eyeliners: The eyeliners work really well but you could tell it is not the best of quality because mine broke on the first day and it also runs out really fast. Mascara: Its okay at best. It is super clumpy, I really would not use it all the time. So in my opinion it is worth the ten dollars but nothing else.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting this product to come out of the palette and onto my shadow brushes.  I love all the colors, and the mascaras and liners are great.  The shadows are beautiful once they are on, but the brush that comes with the shadow is useless.  I threw it out the second I tried it haha.  Overall, a decent product, I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to put so much elbow grease into getting the product out.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  great product</li>
            <li> Not impressed. But it&#x27;s only $10 so ehh..&lt;br /&gt;Eye Liner ended up way under my eyes making me look like I haven&#x27;t slept in a month.  Mascara was just as bad.  All shadows are shimmery as stated.  Waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Finally a mascara, liner and shadow that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes</li>
            <li> Wors makeup ever! It is so hard to get into my brushes. It also applies chalky and the colors do not go on the color they look like they&#x27;d be. The eyeliner dulled out the first time I used it and was not black when applied. It was a grey. Also sooo hard to remove. It just looks so ugly. I didn&#x27;t even use the mascara because the rest of it was so terrible. I wish I didn&#x27;t buy it. I would give it Zero stars if possible.</li>
            <li> Mascara was the only good part of this combo</li>
            <li> Loved everything except mascara has no liquid and is super dry. Wouldnot recommend buying this trio.</li>
            <li> First of all, there is nothing wrong with this product. My use of only 3 stars is about my personal preference rather than the quality of the product. When I ordered this, I did not realize how shimmery this eye shadow was. This would be great for a younger person. I have an incredible amount of allergies and sensitivities to chemicals and this product didn&#x27;t bother me in the least, it just wasn&#x27;t what I thought I was getting.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the mascara but the eye shadow and liner are exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> I am really happy with the eye shadow, mascara, and the black eyeliner! The Mascara and the Black are eyeliner are absolutely amazing! The black eyeliner goes on smooth and extremely easy but the gold eyeliner does not go on easy at all. Actually, I could not get it to go on any. I even tried to apply it to my hand and it is like it is dried up or something. I am not sure why it doesnt work but this was still worth it bc the other products are great!</li>
            <li> The brand makes a much better mascara so don&#x27;t buy this for the mascara.  The colors are nice and do not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I don&#x27;t know what the big wand/little wand is all about. No info given on package.</li>
            <li> Very Nice makeup bundle.</li>
            <li> Arrived late but I like ther set.....</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be a healthier alternative to the make up I usually wear, plus I liked having that all in one eye make up in one box. The colors were pretty, and I was excited to put it on. I started with just a little mascara, and then was called away. About an hour later, I went back to the mirror to put on some of the eye shadow, but my eyes looked like I had be punched! Both eyes were black and blue, and slightly swollen because of just a little mascara, and I&#x27;m not sensitive to make up at all! The next day, I was back to normal, but I will never use this product again.</li>
            <li> I actually like the color of the eye shadows. They would be better if divided though. My main issue is that the eyeliner and mascara wipe off so easy. If you touch your eye at all...you are likely to have smudged it. Raining.....forget it you&#x27;ll look ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I like the eye shadow colors on this palette but the eye liner isn&#x27;t black it&#x27;s more of a lite gray and the brown isn&#x27;t a dark brown is a very lite brown. The brush on the mascara is horrible very small I had to use an old brush from a different brand.</li>
            <li> The packaging for the eye shadow is darling! But that is not all, there is other reasons to love this set. The natural colors in this set make it almost look like you are not wearing make-up. It is perfect for those of us that like to enhance our beauty but still look natural doing it. The eye liner is the best eye liner that I have ever used. It goes on easily and although it looks as great as a liquid liner, it does not smudge like one. I found the mascara to be a little awkward to put on because of the square shape but besides that small issue...I love this set. You can not beat the price. The price alone is worth just the eye liner.</li>
            <li> This inexpensive makeup set is a great starter kit for anyone looking to experiment with makeup or the nude look. The shadows have decent application with little to no fallout during application and didn&#x27;t crease or cake, even by the end of the day. The eyeliners are smooth and easy to apply and leave a clean line that is easy to draw. I liked the mascara as well. It didn&#x27;t give lots of length but it did give a good color build to the lashes and didn&#x27;t clump or stick. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent! I&#x27;m happy with this Physicians Formula. It&#x27;s beautiful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Physician&#x27;s Formula brand for a few years now. In my opinion, its the best quality you can find at the drug store level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I&#x27;ve had some trouble finding an eye shadow palette in their brand. Each palette I&#x27;ve purchased seemed to have two colors I really liked, with the third being always too dark. With that said, I purchased another Shimmer Strip a while back, and only used three out of 9 colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This nude set, neatly packaged in a kit, seems to be a great fit for me. I love all the color combinations (two eye shadows and a coordinating, darker eye liner color).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that this shimmer kit is a SHIMMER kit. Therefore, the shadows are very irridescent. It&#x27;s not a matte finish, so if you are looking for a matte finish, you might look elsewhere. Personally, I only use shimmery eyeshadows. If you ever take the step to try one, I have faith you will like it. It&#x27;s not glittery, but it adds shimmer and light around your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The accompanying eye liners and mascara are great. I hadn&#x27;t used their eye liners or mascaras in the past (only blushes and shadows) so I was pleasantly surprised to find all of these items in one nicely priced kit. Amazon has competitive prices in comparison to drug stores, which I am happy to realize, as drug stores do not always keep a variety of shades stocked well.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow is great,  use a different brush other than the spongy thingy that comes with it.  Eyeliners are ok. Mascara, I find,  a little hard to use the brush on the smaller one. But it&#x27;s a good purchase, for me</li>
            <li> sooo happy.. great price..</li>
            <li> I like it and perfect</li>
            <li> Eyeshadows are super light &amp; you need to apply a lot to get a good color. Eyeliners are great, my favorite part of the package. The mascara is weird only because the applicator does not coat well &amp; the other side (lighter colored glimmer side) does not even make sense. I love the lighter eyeliner on my waterline to make the eyes look bigger.</li>
            <li> I completely agree with the reviewer that said the colors were a bit too shimmer-y.  I thought, &amp;#34;how bad can it be!?!?&amp;#34; and found out when I opened it.  the liners are nice, they go on smooth but the mascara is just meh.  If you like shimmer on the lids this is for you!!</li>
            <li> The color and quality of the product is comparable to the drug store brands, but unlike those, this doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, even when used on the waterline. As for the color, it&#x27;s richer if applied wet, and while it&#x27;s shimmery, it&#x27;s not super glitzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My biggest complaint about this set is the mascara. The applicator brushes are terrible. I&#x27;ve actually had to salvage a brush from another brand to use with this. It&#x27;s bulky and clunky (you basically have a whole tube of mascara in your hand while trying to apply, rather than just an applicator), doesn&#x27;t separate the lashes, and the wands are so short it&#x27;s terribly awkward to use, especially with the brown. The shadow, as well, comes with one tiny chintzy single-ended sponge applicator.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOOOOVE!!!!&lt;br /&gt;IT IS AN AMAZON PRODUCT</li>
            <li> PhysicaI and formula is wonderful and this combination is great!!</li>
            <li> I have really bad allergies but this product was so nice on my skin. My new favorite make-up.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy Physicians Formula products. I have quite a few but have found they are more cost effective on Amazon</li>
            <li> The lighter (silver) eyeliner doesn&#x27;t go on easy, multiple layers until color appears and the mascara is terribly clumpy.  Love the eye shadows though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of PF for over ten years. The mineral powder has plummeted in quality. Sad, because I loved the light, but perfectly smooth coverage and miss that ease.  This kit is useful and compact. I personally love the mascara and have forsaken the ten other tubes in my bag. The shadows are what I wanted and they do the job. It takes a few extra brush strokes to  get the desired depth of color. I bought an extra set for travel, and sent one to my sister. You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I love sephora but it&#x27;s so expensive- this makeup is equally good in quality, if not better....there&#x27;s no flaking when you put it on and you don&#x27;t end up with sparkles are over your face if you use the shimmery colors.</li>
            <li> I really like the colors in this makeup set. It says hypoallergenic which is the reason I bought it because my skin is very sensitive to makeup. I&#x27;ve tried many especially eye liners and all the ones I&#x27;ve tried they make me feel like I&#x27;m about to scratch my eyes out. I took one star off b/c even though the eye shadow doesn&#x27;t cause any reaction, the eyeliner  and mascara still cause a small itching reaction.. I always take my make up off and with this one I at least don&#x27;t have to run to take it off after an hour of putting it on. I can actually take it off at bedtime. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever find an eyeliner and mascara that don&#x27;t cause a reaction unless I&#x27;m willing to spend an enormous amount of money. So I&#x27;m willing to continue to try this product b/c it is a good price and I&#x27;m able to tolerate it better than others. Also I don&#x27;t wear a whole lot of makeup so this kit was just perfect. It&#x27;s exactly what I need; some eyeshadow, eyeliner and mascara. I don&#x27;t need or use more than that Other than the occasional lip gloss but I usually stick to chap stick. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I love the eyeliners that come in this kit. The mascara comes in black on one side, brown on the other. The formula is great! I love the black...the brown is too light so I am not a fan of the brown mascara.&lt;br /&gt;The eyeshadows are all very pretty colors, however they are hard to put on using a brush. I did get better results using a sponge eyeshadow applicator.&lt;br /&gt;I like that all of the products in the kit are non irritating. The quality of the eyeshadows was not very good though.</li>
            <li> Very good product, do me charm. thank you very much</li>
            <li> love this brand....i have very, very sensitive skin....never have any issue with this brand...</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty but they are also very metallic, so if you prefer matte shadows this is not for you. When the eye shadow is applied or swatched with the use of your fingers, it is nicely pigmented and smooth; however, the product can not be picked up by a makeup brush. The brown part of the mascara does not show up much, but the black part is nice. The eyeliners are very nice as well and the brown is a beautiful color.</li>
            <li> This is the first Physicians Formula product I have ever used.  I like it fine.  I use the eye shadow once in a while but I use the black eyeliner all the time.  It is highly pigmented and super smooth.  I will repurchase the eyeliner for sure.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!!!  Colors are beautiful, goes on smoothly.  Eye liners are awesome, stays on great!!  Mascara is good as well.....price was perfec,t, great buy</li>
            <li> I LOVED THIS PRODUCT I WILL ORDER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> A gift. She loved it.</li>
