            <li>i love the smell of spearmint and this works just fine for my uses.  </li>
            <li>Great have already bought several more times.</li>
            <li>, I feel a strong stinging effect.</li>

            <li>Holy cow, this smells good!  </li>
            <li>I love this minty oil&amp; it got here as fast as I wanted it to.</li>
            <li>mint oils (the spearmint is particularly potent) are a favorite, necessary treatment of mine to keep these unwelcome visitors away, and they do the job without harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>If you are not a fan of the mint odor, it dissipates quickly in the colder weather.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and it looked just like the picture.</li>
            <li>Regular laundry detergent irritates my skin but the fragrance free one is lacking any nice smell</li>
            <li>I love the natural alternatives to &amp;#34;critter control&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>as ususal any items I get arrives quickly and very well protected.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks so much!</li>
            <li>With cooler weather on the way, its time to be aware of pests trying to get into your home, namely mice &amp; spiders.  </li>
            <li>Be sure you wear vinyl or latex gloves to protect your hands before applying, then its simple</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>exactly as described</li>
            <li>I also appreciate that you get a real useable quantity of oil with this brand.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this oil.  </li>
            <li>I really like mint</li>
            <li>Even if you live near wooded areas where mice hide or have garden spiders (like I do), you can rest easy that they will have no interest in approaching your house.  </li>
            <li>I find burning oils to be very relaxing - especially if the fragrance is right.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t find a container that I like for the new oil.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the slight differences from brand to brand.</li>
            <li>I put a couple of drops of oil in my a/c vents which mentholated the whole house for days and the windows propped open.</li>
            <li>For a toothache I apply directly.</li>
            <li>I mix this with the Euctalyptus on a cotton ball and put it near a fan.</li>
            <li>I like that it is all natural and it has anitbacterial properties.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I combine with other oils for a fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Every time I open the bottle, my 3 year old asks me for some gum!  </li>
            <li>no other way to describe it.</li>
            <li>This is by far the cleanest spearmint essential oil scent I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Make sure it does not get into contact with any broken skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying other products with spearmint for gum health.</li>
            <li>I use a cotton Q-tip with a drop of spearmint (I use it full-strength: I am hard core that way) and I clean the infected area.  </li>
            <li>I place the sachets near possible entry points and in various corners of the room.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I always need spearmint oil.  I enjoy the slight differences from brand to brand.</li>
            <li> This is great for putting in homemade toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I make my own toothpaste and massage oil. this is the perfect addition!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Cant say enough about this product. Better than described at the right price. You only need a little it goes a long way A+</li>
            <li> Excellent product, high quality as all NOW Essential Oils are. Pleasant, cooling scent. Would work well in application where mint is needed; but the sharp qualities of Peppermint and not desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to state that there is NO CLASSIFICATION  by the FDA for &amp;#34;Therapeutic Grade&amp;#34; Essential Oils. Do your research and do not be duped into purchasing expensive &amp;#34;Therapeutic Grade&amp;#34; when such a thing doesn&#x27;t exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This review is solely based upon my independent review. I purchased this product. I was NOT given this product in exchange for a review.</li>
            <li> as ususal any items I get arrives quickly and very well protected.  &lt;br /&gt;Thanks, &lt;br /&gt;kim</li>
            <li> With cooler weather on the way, its time to be aware of pests trying to get into your home, namely mice &amp; spiders.  NOW mint oils (the spearmint is particularly potent) are a favorite, necessary treatment of mine to keep these unwelcome visitors away, and they do the job without harmful chemicals.  Be sure you wear vinyl or latex gloves to protect your hands before applying, then its simple: take a couple cotton balls or a paper towel, moisten thoroughly with the mint oil, then apply to the bottom baffle of your entrance door &amp; lower sides of the door frame, as well as any wood pieces below or around the door, and even rub on any ornamental items you have close to the door such as planter pots.  This mint \\&quot;shield\\&quot; will last until it rains, then repeat the application process.  Even if you live near wooded areas where mice hide or have garden spiders (like I do), you can rest easy that they will have no interest in approaching your house.  If you are not a fan of the mint odor, it dissipates quickly in the colder weather.</li>
            <li> I used it to make toothpaste for two of my daughters - they love it.</li>
            <li> Delightful scent with a good dispenser.  I also appreciate that you get a real useable quantity of oil with this brand.</li>
            <li> Great have already bought several more times.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Exactly as described. Smell Awesome.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product to use in aromatherapy as well I put a few drops  for a room refresher. It fills my space with a wonderful aroma of freshness.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the NOW oils. I purchased this to burn in my oil diffuser. I am a home fragrance oil junkie. I find burning oils to be very relaxing - especially if the fragrance is right. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Placed droplets on water pipes and floor openings to get rid of ants and prevent further infestation. Works!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this, I use in several blend and it smells so good. It works well too. Very impressed</li>
            <li> Not as effective as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I use this for my home made tooth paste with organic coconut oil, love it!</li>
            <li> Holy cow, this smells good!  Every time I open the bottle, my 3 year old asks me for some gum!  It smells just like Wrigley&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> i love the smell of spearmint and this works just fine for my uses.  I combine with other oils for a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> it aririved on time and it smells wonderful i use it  i use it all the time i need more now</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Packaged great&lt;br /&gt;Was exactly as described</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS THE BEST......A MUST HAVE.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do what I did. I put a couple of drops of oil in my a/c vents which mentholated the whole house for days and the windows propped open. Now I use the oil for making lotion, deodorant and flea repellant on my cat&#x27;s collar.</li>
            <li> This spearmint oil is devine ... no other way to describe it. Have used a single drop to enhance an entire pitcher of iced tea as well as a boost to scented candle. Refreshing !</li>
            <li> excellent for making salve</li>
            <li> A few drops of this on a half dozen sachets, together with a few drops of the Peppermint version of the same, have kept field mice out of my basement all winter.  I place the sachets near possible entry points and in various corners of the room.  And the basement smells great.  I love the natural alternatives to &amp;#34;critter control&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> With my new line of hair product, this oil is so good for your hair.</li>
            <li> Good product as described</li>
            <li> Love this! It smells wonderful.  I will be buying this again.  It came quickly and it looked just like the picture.</li>
            <li> It smells great! Used it in our diffuser and the room smelled wonderfully refreshing!</li>
            <li> I love this minty oil&amp; it got here as fast as I wanted it to. I use spearamint oil in my fragrance free laundry detergent. Regular laundry detergent irritates my skin but the fragrance free one is lacking any nice smell (I know that&#x27;s the point lol) The spearamint oil allows me to have smell without irritation.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this oil.  I use it with my cold diffuser and my granddaughters say it smells like you are chewing a piece of gum!  Very nice scent!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Much cheaper than buying other products with spearmint for gum health. Be sure to dilute. For a toothache I apply directly. It does burn,but tough it out and it will help the pain. I combine this with oil pulling. Gums are pink. Use in waterpik also.</li>
            <li> I mix this with the Euctalyptus on a cotton ball and put it near a fan. Best room deodorizer ever. The smell is very strong and can overwhelm a room so use sparringly. I Also use the cotton ball trick in the car.</li>
            <li> I really like mint so I use it on a lot of different things. I am by no means an oil snob so the quality of it I can&#x27;t vouch for but it works well in my body scrubs and soaps. I am thinking of mixing the spearmint and the peppermint oils together. I just can&#x27;t find a container that I like for the new oil.</li>
            <li> I use the spearmint with my toothpaste to brush my teeth. I like that it is all natural and it has anitbacterial properties.&lt;br /&gt;There is a caution to using this product.  On occasion, I have had a drop of spearmint fall  on my chin.  Ater a few seconds, I feel a strong stinging effect. The stinging sensation will stop as soon as the oil is wiped or rinsed off.  To use this product, it must be diluted if used orally or on the skin.  Make sure it does not get into contact with any broken skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this product to clean around a broken tooth.  It works well in cleaning my infection due to food particles getting trapped in the hole of my tooth. I use a cotton Q-tip with a drop of spearmint (I use it full-strength: I am hard core that way) and I clean the infected area.  The gum area that is inflamed later improves and the swelling/inflamtion goes down in a matter of a few hours.</li>
            <li> This is by far the cleanest spearmint essential oil scent I&#x27;ve found. It&#x27;s very refreshing and smells very much like a delicious gum. The scent lasts for several hours. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of NOW essential oils, and this is one of the best!</li>
            <li> Works great. Smells perfect.</li>
            <li> I dilute it and spread it on the top of my honeybee frames to deter pests in the hive. I mix it with other oils sometimes for a different types of mite deterrent.</li>
