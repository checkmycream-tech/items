    <ol>
            <li>My hair type might be perfect for this brush.</li>
            <li>Fits my hand perfectly and reminds me of the brushes my grandmas had.</li>
            <li>Delivery was prompt and I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, fair price and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really happy with this brush, which is a lot cheaper than the MP brushes.</li>
            <li>What a great brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that this brush does a great job of cleaning out whatever dirt or dust</li>
            <li>Perfect size; just a great hairbrush that I&#x27;ll love for years.</li>
            <li>She is thrilled to have a great quality hairbrush and takes a great amount of time to brush her own hair</li>
            <li>Feels so good.</li>
            <li>I like this brush because I feel like I&#x27;m being good to my hair-</li>
            <li>Every bit as good as the Mason Pearson, at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>- It feels nice and sturdy in your hand, the bristles are sturdy but don&#x27;t pull or cause pain, and it doesn&#x27;t seem as if it will break or come apart soon.</li>
            <li>Use it 4 out of 7 nights a week and find it does a nice job smoothing my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful hairbrush, with very strong natural bristles.  </li>
            <li>I do feel like it carries/distributes the oils nicely, as my hair seems more shiny.</li>
            <li>Still trying to find a more effective way to do this.</li>
            <li>If more products in this line were just a bit more affordable, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy more of them!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I exchanged it and got this one.</li>
            <li>and this isnt able to comb through all of it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Many might not like the scalp scratching feel, I do, and I am used to it.</li>
            <li>I can brush my hair into virtually any shape with this brush because of the static effect.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it didn&#x27;t cost more.</li>
            <li>This brush does a good job of getting out tangles and cleaning my hair, while being gentle.</li>
            <li>Price was good, shipping reasonable.</li>
            <li>Also, the natural bristles feel very nice on my scalp.</li>
            <li>This would not go through my fine dense curly Italian hair, but it works wonderfully for my granddaughters straight baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Works great, but the boars brush from Sally&#x27;s does the same thing, and for 5$!</li>
            <li>The 100% boar bristles are amazing for hair: they distribute the oils in your hair from the scalp to the very tips, so after brushing your hair feels even softer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The boar&#x27;s hair is stiff while still keeping the perfect amount of give to pamper your hair.</li>
            <li>It fluffs out my hair, which is pretty, but my guy wont be able to run his fingers through this puffed up mane.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m doubting if it&#x27;s original.</li>
            <li>I have very frizz-prone curly hair and this brush makes it silky and smooth without generating static.  </li>
            <li>Right on, Acca Kappa!</li>
            <li>I thought I wanted one of the English brushes with a plastic handle, but this wood handle feels so good in my hand.  </li>
            <li>I am quite satisfied and feel that I could have spent much more and not gotten one much better.</li>
            <li>I have pretty fine hair, but people say, a lot of it.</li>
            <li>This brush might seem a little pricy, you definately get your money&#x27;s worth in this finely crafted brush with great looks and balance.  </li>
            <li>The handle is pretty and even if the brush didn&#x27;t work as well as it does, I would be content to have it as a dresser ornament!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a reasonably priced boar bristle brush and this fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>It was well worth the money</li>
            <li>, boar bristle construction is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Also well made and just the right size.</li>
            <li>Suddenly my hair is glossy, smooth, and super fabulous.</li>
            <li>and I read up that Boar Hair brushes are best because they are less likely to cause damage or breakage.</li>
            <li>Still a good brush though but may not worth the price.</li>
            <li>I actually like it better than my $150 Mason Pearson brush.</li>
            <li>; melted The first time I used it with the hair dryer.</li>
            <li>If you have fine/thinner hair then this would work pretty well.</li>
            <li>but it is definitely more effort and a totally different look/style than I am used to.</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed a difference after using a regular (plastic type) brush for many years.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t need to use a different brush to detangle, this brush went through my hair fine.</li>
            <li>I have a collection of brushes in my &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; drawer, as I couldn&#x27;t find what I really was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched almost all my brushes out and it really has been better for my hair since I started using natural only.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go through much hair at a time, I have to section my hair to really untangle it, and my hair isn&#x27;t thick at all, but it feels so nice</li>
            <li>I purchased a boar&#x27;s hair brush because I read that it is supposed to make your hair less oily as it distributes the oil from your scalp to the length of your hair so you are able to go longer without having to wash your hair.  </li>
            <li>Just the right size, gentle on my fine, long hair, but firm enough to stimulate my scalp to promote healthy hair growth.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>Soft boar bristles really do make a difference.</li>
            <li>My old $100+ from Englang was getting beaten up, saw this, bookmarked it, and ordered it when ready.  </li>
            <li>Although I had previouslsy purchased the all-boar bristle Appa Kappa ROUND brush and love it, I do not like the OVAL</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s firm enough to get through my hair and massage my scalp, it&#x27;s very well made, comfortable in the hand, and just the right size.</li>
            <li>It was a new style for her</li>
            <li>This boar bristle brush is an entirely new style of brush for me.</li>
            <li>my have landed in my hair, but it is a real pain to clean these little fuzz balls from between the bristles.</li>
            <li>Then again, it darn well better NOT, because this was the most expensive brush in which I have ever indulged!</li>
            <li>, I just straighten my hair as usual with another brush, and then brush with this one to make my hair even more silky and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasnt about ready to shell out a couple hundred bucks for a Mason Pearson brush, and saw that this was a close second in rating and quality.</li>
            <li>/breaking like I would with my old brush.</li>
            <li>(she is nearly four).</li>
            <li>Cheaper than some of the 100% boar bristle brushes but far outperforms in my opinion.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really warrant a brush of this caliber (though I&#x27;ll admit my back hair is</li>
            <li>what you would expect from a professional quality hair brush.</li>
            <li>It gently de-tangles my long, curly hair and is neither too soft</li>
            <li>I have fairly long straight hair.</li>
            <li>It does not grip your hair to brush it smoothly, and I find it so clumsy and unmanageable that I will never use it again.  </li>
            <li>(Think of the motion of combing your fingers from the front of your forehead to the back, the way that action moves the hair?</li>

            <li> I have moderately thick, wavy hair and this brush will barely make its way to my scalp.</li>
            <li> That effect might sound like a bad thing, but once you understand what the brush can do you like its versatility.</li>
            <li> Because of how dense and short the bristles are, the brush just gets stuck in my thick mane.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help me with reducing the oil in my hair, I still have to wash my hair everyday.  </li>
            <li> The bristles came off and bend after few use.</li>

            <li> Or, at least, I&#x27;m trying to be.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m done buying throw-away junk made in factories of questionable environmental and labor practices.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that I have paid a lot of money for a worthless item.</li>

            <li> I have fairly long straight hair. This brush does a good job of getting out tangles and cleaning my hair, while being gentle. Soft boar bristles really do make a difference. I&#x27;ve switched almost all my brushes out and it really has been better for my hair since I started using natural only. I&#x27;ve been really happy with this brush, which is a lot cheaper than the MP brushes.</li>
            <li> Although I had previouslsy purchased the all-boar bristle Appa Kappa ROUND brush and love it, I do not like the OVAL all-boar bristle brush at all.  It does not grip your hair to brush it smoothly, and I find it so clumsy and unmanageable that I will never use it again.  I am very disappointed that I have paid a lot of money for a worthless item.</li>

            <li> My mother loves the brush! Price was good, shipping reasonable. It was a new style for her but she took the plunge. Cheers.</li>

If you have fine/thinner hair then this would work pretty well. For thicker longer hair, this may not be the product for you.</li>
            <li> Works great, but the boars brush from Sally&#x27;s does the same thing, and for 5$!</li>
            <li> Love it. My hair is very thick and long. Finally found a brush that gets to my scalp instead of just skimming the surface. Feels so good. Also well made and just the right size.</li>
            <li> My old $100+ from Englang was getting beaten up, saw this, bookmarked it, and ordered it when ready.  I knew about this brand from shopping the kiosk store in Las Vegas Venetian.  Other then the wooden material that may be less than the UK brand, I like the feel from this brush, could be the other is old.  Many might not like the scalp scratching feel, I do, and I am used to it.</li>

This wasn&#x27;t the case for me, it actually made my hair oilier.  My hair wouldn&#x27;t be oily at all and after I brushed my hair with this brush, it actually looked oily after.  It didn&#x27;t help me with reducing the oil in my hair, I still have to wash my hair everyday.  I have short hair and I didn&#x27;t need to use a different brush to detangle, this brush went through my hair fine.</li>
            <li> This boar bristle brush is an entirely new style of brush for me. I have moderately thick, wavy hair and this brush will barely make its way to my scalp. I have to brush in sections if I want to accomplish a thorough combing through. It fluffs out my hair, which is pretty, but my guy wont be able to run his fingers through this puffed up mane. I do feel like it carries/distributes the oils nicely, as my hair seems more shiny. As for how it treats my hair, I dont notice all of the broken pieces of hair falling/breaking like I would with my old brush. I wash my hair about every 4 days. I&#x27;ve noticed that this brush does a great job of cleaning out whatever dirt or dust my have landed in my hair, but it is a real pain to clean these little fuzz balls from between the bristles. Still trying to find a more effective way to do this. As for brushing the hair when wet- it does not work for me. I still hae to use a wide tooth comb and wait until my hair is completely dry before I can use this. I like this brush because I feel like I&#x27;m being good to my hair- but it is definitely more effort and a totally different look/style than I am used to.</li>
            <li> My hair type might be perfect for this brush. I have pretty fine hair, but people say, a lot of it. I can brush my hair into virtually any shape with this brush because of the static effect. That effect might sound like a bad thing, but once you understand what the brush can do you like its versatility. Also, the natural bristles feel very nice on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Overall I like this brush - It feels nice and sturdy in your hand, the bristles are sturdy but don&#x27;t pull or cause pain, and it doesn&#x27;t seem as if it will break or come apart soon. Then again, it darn well better NOT, because this was the most expensive brush in which I have ever indulged! The 100% boar bristles are amazing for hair: they distribute the oils in your hair from the scalp to the very tips, so after brushing your hair feels even softer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ONLY complaint is that the bristles are not long enough to use this brush to style my waist-length hair. (Think of the motion of combing your fingers from the front of your forehead to the back, the way that action moves the hair? Because of how dense and short the bristles are, the brush just gets stuck in my thick mane. That said, DO NOT try to use this brush to detangle!!! ) But that&#x27;s ok, I just straighten my hair as usual with another brush, and then brush with this one to make my hair even more silky and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan! If more products in this line were just a bit more affordable, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy more of them!</li>
            <li> This is the third one of these which I&#x27;ve ordered.  Every bit as good as the Mason Pearson, at a fraction of the price.  Highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush every morning for a month or so now and I adore it. It gently de-tangles my long, curly hair and is neither too soft (I was concerned it might be) nor too stiff. The handle is pretty and even if the brush didn&#x27;t work as well as it does, I would be content to have it as a dresser ornament! It was well worth the money and I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t cheap-out and get a lesser brush. A big part of my decision to go with this brush was that it&#x27;s made in Italy, not China. I&#x27;m done buying throw-away junk made in factories of questionable environmental and labor practices. Or, at least, I&#x27;m trying to be.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed a difference after using a regular (plastic type) brush for many years.  I have very frizz-prone curly hair and this brush makes it silky and smooth without generating static.  It doesn&#x27;t go through much hair at a time, I have to section my hair to really untangle it, and my hair isn&#x27;t thick at all, but it feels so nice I don&#x27;t even care.  I can&#x27;t believe it didn&#x27;t cost more.</li>
            <li> This brush might seem a little pricy, you definately get your money&#x27;s worth in this finely crafted brush with great looks and balance.  The boar&#x27;s hair is stiff while still keeping the perfect amount of give to pamper your hair.</li>
            <li> Use it 4 out of 7 nights a week and find it does a nice job smoothing my hair.  It does not scratch my scalp as I brush.  I was looking for a reasonably priced boar bristle brush and this fit the bill.  I am quite satisfied and feel that I could have spent much more and not gotten one much better.</li>
            <li> This would not go through my fine dense curly Italian hair, but it works wonderfully for my granddaughters straight baby fine hair.  She is thrilled to have a great quality hairbrush and takes a great amount of time to brush her own hair (she is nearly four).</li>
            <li> All I wanted and then some. Fits my hand perfectly and reminds me of the brushes my grandmas had. Like everything about it--- especially the length and depth of the bristles. Thank you Acca Kappa. Looking forward to years of &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; brushing.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than some of the 100% boar bristle brushes but far outperforms in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really only passing on my wife&#x27;s comments here, as my personal grooming needs don&#x27;t really warrant a brush of this caliber (though I&#x27;ll admit my back hair is *almost* to that point, but I digress).  She returned this for another item that had &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; bristles, but I&#x27;m not sure how that is defined in woman-speak.  I just know she&#x27;s kinda picky about these things and did not like this brush at all.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, fair price and what you would expect from a professional quality hair brush. The feel and all wood, boar bristle construction is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have a collection of brushes in my &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; drawer, as I couldn&#x27;t find what I really was looking for.  This is it!  Just the right size, gentle on my fine, long hair, but firm enough to stimulate my scalp to promote healthy hair growth.  LOVE IT!  Delivery was prompt and I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li> It looks entirely different from Acca Kappa official website. The bristles came off and bend after few use. I&#x27;m doubting if it&#x27;s original. Still a good brush though but may not worth the price.</li>
