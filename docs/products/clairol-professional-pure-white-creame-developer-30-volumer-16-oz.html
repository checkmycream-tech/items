            <li>thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I used the 40 first then this 30 one</li>
            <li>if darker hair higher volume.</li>
            <li>and used the thirty first  </li>
            <li>&quot;  Will be back for more soon.</li>
            <li>Very affordable</li>
            <li>Fast shipping to.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the products.</li>
            <li>use a intense repair conditioner with spray in if roughness, should help.</li>
            <li>I have really light blonde hair</li>
            <li>When I dyed it it just turned a really light blonde.</li>
            <li>very much.\\&quot;\\</li>
            <li>if your natural blonde this is great, from dark blonde to light.</li>
            <li>I have been using Pure White for the past 2 years and I cannot express how great it is.</li>
            <li>B000A409J8 L&#x27;Oreal Quick Blue Powder Bleach 1 Lb]] with [[ASIN:B005NISXHG</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product with two kinds of hair bleach: quick blue and splat (the pack of bleach that comes with a box of color).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product and the seller.</li>
            <li>I used this to go from black to a really light blonde and it worked really quick.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s lovely natural oils, only to find my hair course and dry and like straw.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the whole bottle yet, but I started out as blonde, and after 2 30 minute sessions, I look pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>The first time I used my 20 Vol (same product) in conjunction with Wella Hair toner</li>
            <li>My hair was matted to my head like I had been running and sleeping in the wild!</li>
            <li>Ion Sensitive Scalp 40 Volume Creme Developer 32 oz.]</li>
            <li>If you are toning I would start with only the 20 volume, it does the job in a gentle way.  </li>
            <li>it worked very well only being in for 25-30 min ..</li>
            <li>and her hair was near platnum blond,  </li>
            <li>and I thought at first it was the toner that caused my hair to dry out.</li>
            <li>if it doesnt stay moist it will dry, harden, and not bleach very well.</li>
            <li>I still have this bottle rolling around in the bathroom since I haven&#x27;t had to use it in a year, but wow, never going back to sally&#x27;s for a lot of my hair products.</li>
            <li>I needed to dye a natural hair mustache white</li>
            <li>Either way I have very long and soft white hair and Pure White</li>
            <li>I used with clairol quick blue powder bleach to turn my dark brown hair blonde.</li>
            <li>, so people don&#x27;t try and blame the fact that I&#x27;m bleaching my hair by saying: it&#x27;s normal that it will be dry, as the problem, let me tell you it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>several weeks later, my hair back to being normal and with all</li>
            <li>and I tend to get very even coverage and yellow blonde hair after once use on natural hair and two uses on dyed black hair.</li>
            <li>If you have dark hair I would really try the 40 volume.  </li>
            <li>anyway, i found this, bleaching was always hard to do, always brassy, i used this with quick blue, and i have the white hair,</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t sit here and say that I got a bad bottle, because I also own the 20 Vol bottle of this product and it caused the same effect.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li> I left it on for about an hour and ten minutes and the dark blond was a platinum blond when I washed it out.</li>
            <li> I had a dark purple in my hair that I couldn&#x27;t get out with products well enough or fade it out, so I ordered this and mixed it with my store bought stuff</li>
            <li> I expected to put this in my hair for 30 mins and get white hair.</li>
            <li> it gets the job done, it will make your hair extremely dry...</li>
            <li> Dry it out</li>
            <li> It never burns my scalp, but if its winter and your hands are dry I would use gloves.</li>
            <li> My goal was to go from my dark brunette to a platinum blonde.  </li>
            <li> Bleached my dark brown hair to blonde without burning it or turning it into overcooked spaghetti!  </li>
            <li> and the 40 on the roots later to balance the color ,,, she has dark hair and the 40 was used on the underside BACK&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful with leaving it on too long because it will turn your hair orange if you use bleach with it.</li>
            <li> I have never had my hair dry out like it did with this!</li>
            <li> I bought hair that was dark blond/auburn and wanted to dye the hair pink and blue</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t over due the damage.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair white blonde, which if done wrong, can only spell disaster.</li>
            <li> Just as expected!</li>
            <li> I have a light brown base hair color, so I only need the 30 volume for the beaching.  </li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s black to very very dark brown for those who don&#x27;t know)</li>
            <li> This is what I get for trying to get something little cheaper.</li>
            <li> This is what I get for trying to get something little cheaper.</li>

            <li> and my hair is rather thick</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t bad, didn&#x27;t drip everywhere, dry out my hair too badly or leave some parts brassy and others blonde.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s false advertising.</li>
            <li> wtf?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a terrible developer.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> always good . works great with all brands hair color</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t sit here and say that I got a bad bottle, because I also own the 20 Vol bottle of this product and it caused the same effect.&lt;br /&gt;While it gets the job done, it will make your hair extremely dry...while washing it out!! wtf? Thank god I got a hair cut before hand and my hair is rather thick so hair breaking off wasn&#x27;t a big issue with me, but this developer caused it! I have never had my hair dry out like it did with this! The first time I used my 20 Vol (same product) in conjunction with Wella Hair toner and I thought at first it was the toner that caused my hair to dry out. Now I know better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, so people don&#x27;t try and blame the fact that I&#x27;m bleaching my hair by saying: it&#x27;s normal that it will be dry, as the problem, let me tell you it&#x27;s not. I have had to do sessions as my hair was a level 1 to 2. (that&#x27;s black to very very dark brown for those who don&#x27;t know) Before I used this product I used my [[ASIN:B000A409J8 L&#x27;Oreal Quick Blue Powder Bleach 1 Lb]] with [[ASIN:B005NISXHG Ion Sensitive Scalp 40 Volume Creme Developer 32 oz.]] twice! That&#x27;s a 40 Volume developer people. It never once fried my hair like this did. Dry it out yes, but not to this extent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine my surprise when I go and use the this 30 Vol developer (as I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d need the lift a 40 Vol provided as it seemed like overkill) several weeks later, my hair back to being normal and with all it&#x27;s lovely natural oils, only to find my hair course and dry and like straw. (THIS WAS WHILE I WAS WASHING IT OUT! BEFORE EVEN TOWEL DRYING IT!) My hair was matted to my head like I had been running and sleeping in the wild! I&#x27;ve had to keep my deep conditioner in longer that I&#x27;ve ever had to and if I could I&#x27;d slap the makers of this shit. It&#x27;s a terrible developer. I don&#x27;t know how other reviewers can say it&#x27;s great and what not, because it wasn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This and the 20 Volume is going in the trash. I think I&#x27;ll stick to the Ion developer brand thank you very much. This is what I get for trying to get something little cheaper.This is what I get for trying to get something little cheaper.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find a difference between using this compared to the off brand that Sally&#x27;s sells.</li>
            <li> I used this with L&#x27;Oreal Clear Blue bleach and the hair come out awesome. I used it on weave. I bought hair that was dark blond/auburn and wanted to dye the hair pink and blue so I used this product. I left it on for about an hour and ten minutes and the dark blond was a platinum blond when I washed it out. It did not break off the hair and I loved the fact that it did not dry it out. Awesome product and I will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> Did amazing, my hair turned as white as it could with this. My goal was to go from my dark brunette to a platinum blonde.  This mixed with loreal blue powder bleach did an awesome job. just remember to keep it moist! if it doesnt stay moist it will dry, harden, and not bleach very well. keep a cap on your head to lock in the moisture :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product with two kinds of hair bleach: quick blue and splat (the pack of bleach that comes with a box of color). It works great with both and I tend to get very even coverage and yellow blonde hair after once use on natural hair and two uses on dyed black hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to make a homemade beauty paste. Very affordable and it will last sometime, best of all my beauty recipe worked.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY CAN NOT BE USED ALONG</li>
            <li> Works great. Not to strong. Fast shipping to. I used with clairol quick blue powder bleach to turn my dark brown hair blonde. I used the 40 first then this 30 one next so I didn&#x27;t over due the damage. Great product.</li>
            <li> Bleached my dark brown hair to blonde without burning it or turning it into overcooked spaghetti!  The smell wasn&#x27;t bad, didn&#x27;t drip everywhere, dry out my hair too badly or leave some parts brassy and others blonde.  Worked perfect in conjunction with L&#x27;Oreal Quick Blue Powder Bleach.</li>
            <li> I expected to put this in my hair for 30 mins and get white hair. This didn&#x27;t happen. It got like a couple shades lighter... I think it&#x27;s false advertising. I didn&#x27;t use the whole bottle yet, but I started out as blonde, and after 2 30 minute sessions, I look pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair white blonde, which if done wrong, can only spell disaster. I have been using Pure White for the past 2 years and I cannot express how great it is. It never burns my scalp, but if its winter and your hands are dry I would use gloves. I have a light brown base hair color, so I only need the 30 volume for the beaching.  If you are toning I would start with only the 20 volume, it does the job in a gentle way.  If you have dark hair I would really try the 40 volume.  Either way I have very long and soft white hair and Pure White helps me get it.</li>
            <li> its good in mixing with the Clairol pure white powder..i still have a bottle that I haven&#x27;t open yet,,i am glad I order it like I did..because all of it I good..i also rated this to..i have recommended it to my family..</li>
            <li> Awesome. Thanks for the products. Just as expected!</li>
            <li> The Clairol Pure White peroxide is a great product for lifting the results of hair color.  I highly recommend the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> i was amazed with this product, used clairol for years, runs in family, and we do our own hair n nails. anyway, i found this, bleaching was always hard to do, always brassy, i used this with quick blue, and i have the white hair, jean harlow look. my scalp is not sore, i do recommend so does clairol always test before use. if your natural blonde this is great, from dark blonde to light. if darker hair higher volume. please test. you will be amazed. dreamed of this look, all same color, not brassy, and my curls are still there. use a intense repair conditioner with spray in if roughness, should help. thanks, and wish anyone with hair like mine, good luck. a huge 10.for pics facebook norma emma. love you clairol. your products are the best</li>
            <li> I used this to go from black to a really light blonde and it worked really quick. Be careful with leaving it on too long because it will turn your hair orange if you use bleach with it.</li>
            <li> Works super fast with the kaleidocolors bleach. Super satisfied with this product. It worked wonderfully taking out my semi-permanent dye.</li>
            <li> I have really light blonde hair and I was wanting to get it to white so I bought this. I also bought lightening powder to go with it. When I dyed it it just turned a really light blonde. So hopefully when I dye it again it will work. And this came in the very next day that I ordered it but maybe that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m just the next state over lol</li>
            <li> Daughter loved it ,she tried other things against my wishes... so finaly i said do it right .got the 30 and the 40 vol. and used the thirty first  it worked very well only being in for 25-30 min .. and the 40 on the roots later to balance the color ,,, she has dark hair and the 40 was used on the underside BACK&lt;br /&gt; and was only in for 25 min and her hair was near platnum blond,  then dyed purple ,, i did most of his myself and im DAD /mechanic /technician/now jack of ALLLLL traids  ...she was verrrrry happy ...and now has her friends over ..and DADDY is doing hair color...  FUN TIMES ... im gona miss this stuff...</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely fashion, works great. I would order it again, therefore I recommend this product. I use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> ( For M.K., my wife )I really love this Clairol product and it was a pleasure buying from you! \\&quot;\\&quot;Thank you very much.\\&quot;\\&quot;  Will be back for more soon.</li>
            <li> I had a dark purple in my hair that I couldn&#x27;t get out with products well enough or fade it out, so I ordered this and mixed it with my store bought stuff and it was fantastic, in under 5 minutes, it was already changing, I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I still have this bottle rolling around in the bathroom since I haven&#x27;t had to use it in a year, but wow, never going back to sally&#x27;s for a lot of my hair products.</li>
            <li> WORTH THE PRICE IF YOU ARE A COSMETOLOGIST</li>
            <li> Buy this with same brand of color and does just as well if you went to a salon and get L&#x27;Oreal Paris Colorist Secrets Brass Banisher Hair Treatment to do after you dy it</li>
            <li> I was looking for white hair dye (that&#x27;s what I Googled and this product came up).  I saw &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; and that it was made by a hair care company so I bought it.  I needed to dye a natural hair mustache white and it didn&#x27;t work.  When I received the bottle the instructions were to add this product to the dye.  Ended up throwing it away.</li>
