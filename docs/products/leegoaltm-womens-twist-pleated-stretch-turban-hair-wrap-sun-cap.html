            <li>Another satisfied client</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll try to make use of it by sewing the bottom tighter or just giving it to charity and pray someone has a head-shape that this would work with.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>but sure do feel like one when wearing one of them.</li>
            <li>The picture looks like the style is fuller cut and provides more coverage.</li>
            <li>Good for my night treatments, material is soft and good quality.  </li>
            <li>and it needs more body.</li>
            <li>Great fit Great Product would highly recommend to anyone that needs a cap for their Head very soft nice color.</li>
            <li>THE PRICE WAS PRETTY GOOD</li>
            <li>A lovely turban--reasonable and comfortable.</li>
            <li>this turban is just what I expected, very happy with it  </li>
            <li>Got her this turban and she loved it - and she is very picky.</li>
            <li>its easy to wash..</li>
            <li>nice product came as expected great deal</li>
            <li>Comfortable and very nice for wet hair in winter, dries well while keeping head warm.</li>
            <li>cute and chic, fits nicely, the color is a rich chocolate brown color, the design and fit of the turban is very fashionable</li>
            <li>they are light weight and don&#x27;t hurt my ears</li>
            <li>Liked this hat so much I bought another.</li>
            <li>They fit my head with my problems and stay in place even when I sleep.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even fit on my dog&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>Stretchy as to fit any sized head.</li>
            <li>hopefully they will fit......</li>
            <li>very light and are not uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>Its super fashionable and can be accessorized easily.</li>
            <li>The material and the fit were just right!  </li>
            <li>The color is rich.  </li>
            <li>My mother is very comfortable with this style and it was a pleasure to find such a nice selection.</li>
            <li>Fit her well, nice soft fabric.</li>
            <li>bershire pantyhose are very much true to it&#x27;s size,  not these</li>
            <li>very comfortable to wear after shower - keeps my hair in place until I have time to blow-dry and style - couldn&#x27;t live without it -</li>
            <li>This one is just right.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, its just OK (fitting a little like a bathing cap).</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t have high expectations because it was cheap</li>
            <li>I bought it for someone who has a medical condition and they are pleased with it.</li>
            <li>First time I seen a head cover in this color</li>
            <li>so I was surprised by the fit.  </li>
            <li>so have been told the brown turban brings out my eyes, but I just love the blue one as well!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, to dry and wear again.</li>
            <li>I have them wrapped in paper towels to prevent them catching on something sharp.</li>
            <li>well made, but too large, although it says one size for all.</li>
            <li>It is very useful, although on upper 80 F or higher temperatures it does not breath well.</li>
            <li>If wearing as a hat it is fone, but as a turbin not so much.</li>
            <li>It is very comfy.</li>
            <li>I really like t.</li>
            <li>I really like my turban.</li>
            <li>wardrobe.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for having these.</li>
            <li>Though it looks nice the quality is , meh, harsh feeling.</li>
            <li>Husband says he likes this one better than the other ones I have, and he is the one who see it.</li>
            <li>I very likely will be getting more colors in future, since they have several colors available to choose from.</li>
            <li>Maybe the fabric should be like those froom Adidas Climacool or Nike Dry Fit.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mother and it is very soft!</li>
            <li>Tried it on and the stitched part, on the top of the turban, was too tightly pulled together (no give at all, no stretch).  </li>
            <li>I found this to be high quality head wear.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this turban.</li>
            <li>This turban is flexible enough that I can clip my long hair up &amp; pull the turban over it covering all my hair but still able to expose ears and skin up to the hair line.  </li>
            <li>Paying to ship it back isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>It is so right for such a chic accessory to one&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not good in styling hair so, on my days of emergency errands, these come in handy...</li>
            <li>The only reason it is somewhat large on me is because I have a smallish head.  </li>
            <li>It is larger than some turbans that I have purchased on-line, but not too large.  </li>
            <li>The item was nicer than I expected and there was very fast delivery on the item.</li>
            <li>I cannot imagine how small your head would have to be to fit as in the picture.</li>
            <li>This is great for bad hair days.  </li>
            <li>I got the piece fast but the quality isn&#x27;t at all what I  expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looks like a too short, limp along the bottom edge, too tight on top, monstrosity.  </li>
            <li>this is a teeny tiny double knit poly HOT little beanie.</li>
            <li>..as expected for the price but came in plastic bag and when I opened it, the odor was quite strong ..smells like a petroleum product...made in China so hard to guess what the smell is...will wash it in hopes of removing..</li>

            <li> I cannot imagine how small your head would have to be to fit as in the picture.</li>
            <li> This is great for bad hair days.  </li>
            <li> I got the piece fast but the quality isn&#x27;t at all what I  expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looks like a too short, limp along the bottom edge, too tight on top, monstrosity.  </li>
            <li> this is a teeny tiny double knit poly HOT little beanie.</li>
            <li> ..as expected for the price but came in plastic bag and when I opened it, the odor was quite strong ..smells like a petroleum product...made in China so hard to guess what the smell is...will wash it in hopes of removing..</li>
            <li> Was exactly as described but it is a little too tight for my liking.</li>
            <li> The single piece along the bottom of the turban was way too big for the stitched part and hung loosely, without any shape.  </li>
            <li> They come in handy for my bad hair days.  </li>
            <li> it is not clear on the size I feel asthough</li>
            <li> Some of the smaller ones not only feel tight, they also tend to slide up my head.  </li>
            <li> They also serve double duty for when I&#x27;m having a bad hair day and need to leave the house real quick for an errand and don&#x27;t want to jump in the show and try to redo my hair over again.</li>
            <li> but my head may be larger than average.</li>
            <li> The color is nice but, as I say, I was disappointed by this purchased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d only recommend for small heads and/or short hair.</li>
            <li> The disposable caps the tanning  center offered were rather small &amp; not tightly woven</li>
            <li> they are a little big</li>
            <li> I bought these so that I could put something on my head other than a heavy towel while I was doing a long deep conditioning of my hair</li>
            <li> I ordered a few in different colors</li>
            <li> Total waste</li>
            <li> This one arrived when I was going in for a sleep study and was heartbroken when the turban looked worse than my matted, gel head when I got ready to go home.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waste my money, but I can give them as a gift to someone instead of sending them back</li>
            <li> Because everything was as expected!</li>
            <li> I have a very small head and have difficulty finding a hat that&#x27;s not too big</li>
            <li> I think that this product should say that it will not fit someone with a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li> I have bought many items from Amazon and have not once been disappointed with value or quality or timely delivery!</li>
            <li> Item is as described, but too small to wear with hair tucked inside.</li>
            <li> BUT I FOUND THEM ALITTLE SMALL FOR MY HEAD..</li>
            <li> It seems too small</li>
            <li> Too small for my head</li>
            <li> My mother wears turbans all the time because she is not able to do a lot with her hair.  </li>

            <li> they are a little big but not so I can&#x27;t wear them they are light weight and don&#x27;t hurt my ears</li>
            <li> It is very useful, although on upper 80 F or higher temperatures it does not breath well. Maybe the fabric should be like those froom Adidas Climacool or Nike Dry Fit.</li>
            <li> Item is as described, but too small to wear with hair tucked inside. If wearing as a hat it is fone, but as a turbin not so much.</li>
            <li> The only reason it is somewhat large on me is because I have a smallish head.  I love the quality of the fabric and the style.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I think that this product should say that it will not fit someone with a lot of hair.  Otherwise, its just OK (fitting a little like a bathing cap). I&#x27;d only recommend for small heads and/or short hair.</li>
            <li> It is larger than some turbans that I have purchased on-line, but not too large.  Some of the smaller ones not only feel tight, they also tend to slide up my head.  This one is just right.</li>
            <li> Loved it and the color</li>
            <li> Was exactly as described but it is a little too tight for my liking.</li>
            <li> I use it feqently as I must keep my head away from the sun. It is very comfy.</li>
            <li> A lovely turban--reasonable and comfortable.</li>
            <li> This turban is amazing! I have found so many uses for it. Its super fashionable and can be accessorized easily. When i curl my hair and wear this it looks really cute. I&#x27;ve also used this when i put in my growth oil . its easy to wash.. i like this alot!!!!</li>
            <li> cute and chic, fits nicely, the color is a rich chocolate brown color, the design and fit of the turban is very fashionable</li>
            <li> My mom used to have these and as soon as she saw them she took them so I will be buying more soon</li>
            <li> The Radiant Pleated Turban/Hat fits perfectly.  I bought it for someone who has a medical condition and they are pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Husband says he likes this one better than the other ones I have, and he is the one who see it.</li>
            <li> Great Turban! Has held up nicely.  Fits great.  Sister-in-law loves it.</li>
            <li> This was very nice. I really didn&#x27;t have high expectations because it was cheap but it&#x27;s nice. The quality seems good and it fits on my head good.</li>
            <li> Liked this hat so much I bought another. Comfortable and very nice for wet hair in winter, dries well while keeping head warm.</li>
            <li> I am a very happy customer. The item was nicer than I expected and there was very fast delivery on the item.</li>
            <li> I found this to be high quality head wear.  The fit is great and the hat is made of quality material.  Perfect for chemo patients.  The color is rich.  It washes nicely.</li>
            <li> I use this turban to wear to bed at night after I have treated my hair.  It is great for that purpose.  It is a synthetic fabric and looks just as it is pictured.  It fits my needs perfectly.</li>
            <li> I bought this turban to use when getting a spray tan.  The disposable caps the tanning  center offered were rather small &amp; not tightly woven &amp; I did not want my very light hair tinted with the spray.  This turban is flexible enough that I can clip my long hair up &amp; pull the turban over it covering all my hair but still able to expose ears and skin up to the hair line.  I&#x27;m very glad I bought this!!</li>
            <li> I bought these so that I could put something on my head other than a heavy towel while I was doing a long deep conditioning of my hair and they work great.  They fit my head with my problems and stay in place even when I sleep.  They also serve double duty for when I&#x27;m having a bad hair day and need to leave the house real quick for an errand and don&#x27;t want to jump in the show and try to redo my hair over again.</li>
            <li> These are great fashionable head covers. very light and are not uncomfortable to wear. I ordered a few in different colors</li>
            <li> The material and the fit were just right!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> this is a teeny tiny double knit poly HOT little beanie. It didn&#x27;t even fit on my dog&#x27;s head. Nothing Diva or Luxury about it. Total waste and it took weeks to get here from China. Pass.</li>
            <li> In the description it says Nylon. The price and shape looks great  so I ordered. I got the piece fast but the quality isn&#x27;t at all what I  expected. Though it looks nice the quality is , meh, harsh feeling. I ordered it for my dying grandmother in the hospital but its not something I would put on her head.</li>
            <li> I cannot imagine how small your head would have to be to fit as in the picture.</li>
            <li> First time I seen a head cover in this color and I had to have it. It was beautiful</li>
            <li> I purchased two turbans because I&#x27;ve been having medical problems and been embarrassed by my &amp;#34;hospital hair&amp;#34;.  This one arrived when I was going in for a sleep study and was heartbroken when the turban looked worse than my matted, gel head when I got ready to go home.  I was disappointed because it doesn&#x27;t quite cover both ears and the back of my neck hairline.  I have a very small head and have difficulty finding a hat that&#x27;s not too big so I was surprised by the fit.  The color is nice but, as I say, I was disappointed by this purchased.</li>
            <li> nice fit, no problems</li>
            <li> I really like t. My husband makes silly jokes when I put it on.</li>
            <li> very comfortable to wear after shower - keeps my hair in place until I have time to blow-dry and style - couldn&#x27;t live without it -</li>
            <li> nice product came as expected great deal</li>
            <li> This is great for bad hair days.  And I have been having some serious bad hair days. Love, Loving it!</li>
            <li> Another satisfied client</li>
            <li> I really like my turban. I bought 2 others in different colors made just like it. Very good quality. Stretchy as to fit any sized head. Keeps my head warm in the Winter when I go out. Would highly recommend this turban.</li>
            <li> THE PRICE WAS PRETTY GOOD BUT I FOUND THEM ALITTLE SMALL FOR MY HEAD..THE MATERIAL IS SATINY SO IT IS SLIPPERY ALSO...</li>
            <li> Give this to my mother in the Protestant religious the sister wear these or something similar..</li>
            <li> Tried it on and the stitched part, on the top of the turban, was too tightly pulled together (no give at all, no stretch).  The single piece along the bottom of the turban was way too big for the stitched part and hung loosely, without any shape.  It looks nothing like the photo on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like a too short, limp along the bottom edge, too tight on top, monstrosity.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll try to make use of it by sewing the bottom tighter or just giving it to charity and pray someone has a head-shape that this would work with.  Paying to ship it back isn&#x27;t worth it.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> My 94 year old Mother wears a wig, but when she was in the hospital she hated messing up her wig lying in bed.  Got her this turban and she loved it - and she is very picky. Fit her well, nice soft fabric. very pleased</li>
            <li> it is not clear on the size I feel asthough I&#x27;ve waste my money, but I can give them as a gift to someone instead of sending them back I just order a larger size in the Cuban seam hopefully they will fit......bershire pantyhose are very much true to it&#x27;s size,  not these I am very very disappointed, My size is 3x-4x or 5x-6x</li>
            <li> well made, but too large, although it says one size for all.</li>
            <li> I bought two of different colors to go with different outfits. I have brown eyes so have been told the brown turban brings out my eyes, but I just love the blue one as well!&lt;br /&gt;I love it. It fits perfectly, both do, and I can wear them anywhere. I would recommend them to anyone. Even the \\&quot;celebrities\\&quot; wear the turbans now.  I&#x27;m no celebrity but sure do feel like one when wearing one of them. Both fit perfectly. I have them wrapped in paper towels to prevent them catching on something sharp. Easy to clean, to dry and wear again. I very likely will be getting more colors in future, since they have several colors available to choose from. And I was simply amazed at the price! It is so right for such a chic accessory to one&#x27;s wardrobe.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for having these. I feel like a Queen when I put one on to go someplace nice. You&#x27;re the tops. Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;  I have bought many items from Amazon and have not once been disappointed with value or quality or timely delivery!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed with this since it slips off my head due to the fabric.  It seems too small but my head may be larger than average. The picture looks like the style is fuller cut and provides more coverage.</li>
            <li> this turban is just what I expected, very happy with it  Fits great&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this turban to a friend</li>
            <li> Love this turban, made well, fits perfect, comfortable, comes in lots of colors, what more can I say?  &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Fits great feels nice on my head</li>
            <li> Good for my night treatments, material is soft and good quality.  During the night it doesn&#x27;t come off, well, all depends how you sleep.  Price was really good</li>
            <li> Great fit Great Product would highly recommend to anyone that needs a cap for their Head very soft nice color.</li>
            <li> mom loves it.  She just entered rehab facility and wanted this on her head since she could not get her hair done.  looks great.  great fabric.</li>
            <li> Too small for my head and it needs more body. I had a seamstress pit in a liner. I am a Sikh gentleman and want to use it for casual wear</li>
            <li> I love these!  They come in handy for my bad hair days.  I&#x27;m not good in styling hair so, on my days of emergency errands, these come in handy...beautiful.</li>
            <li> The adecuate turban for hair lost with chemotherapy. Another colors for future purchases will be needed. I recommend it this business</li>
            <li> I bought these turbans for my wife. They look great, are easy to wash and my wife loves them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good buy!</li>
            <li> ..as expected for the price but came in plastic bag and when I opened it, the odor was quite strong ..smells like a petroleum product...made in China so hard to guess what the smell is...will wash it in hopes of removing..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..looks nice but stinks</li>
            <li> Because everything was as expected!</li>
            <li> My mother wears turbans all the time because she is not able to do a lot with her hair.  This is a lightweight version that has a dressy look.  She was very happy.</li>
            <li> Fits very good and wash&#x27;s in washing MACHINE.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Delivered on time. I would refer a friend.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother and it is very soft! I would recommend this to anyone looking for comfort</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a head cover that can be used at all times. My mother is very comfortable with this style and it was a pleasure to find such a nice selection.</li>
