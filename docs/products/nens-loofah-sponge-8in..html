            <li>My loofah soap turned out great :)</li>
            <li>Going to order more while I still remember where they came from!</li>
            <li>Does a great job of exfoliating my skin in the shower, rinses easily, doesn&#x27;t stink, I&#x27;d buy this product again.</li>
            <li>If this happens to you then please let your voice be heard that this kind of deceptive selling is not acceptable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I soaked mine for about a hour in fairly warm water and softened it up.</li>
            <li>Does drop some loofah seeds in the shower, but you can maybe collect them and grow your own loofah plant?</li>
            <li>all kind of man</li>
            <li>Nice length and softens after continued use.  </li>

            <li>Honest seller.</li>
            <li>its great.. Super Love This Product!</li>
            <li>Wow, I &#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy real loofah&#x27;s, these are great!</li>
            <li>An outstanding product for nice and easy cleaning of the skin.  </li>
            <li>loofah itself is okay.</li>
            <li>In my opinion the more you use them the better they get.</li>
            <li>so I figure it&#x27;s more suited to the feminine persuasion.  </li>
            <li>be updating if I see any signs of improvement :-)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My chinchillas love these.</li>
            <li>Glad I didnt pay alot.</li>
            <li>I love loofah&#x27;s and this one does the job.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Order in bulk 12 or more they come in the size package as when you order 3.</li>
            <li>I love these loofah sponges.</li>
            <li>I tried it twice and the smoke smell was overwhelming in the shower and when I tried to use it in the bath, seeds floated out of it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t scrub, it was more like a scouring pad.</li>
            <li>so maybe a liquid soap will work better.</li>
            <li>But after having seen it mentioned so many times over the years I thought what the heck, I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>I love it and will buy again.</li>
            <li>keeps the skin very clean</li>
            <li>its a pretty good loofah.</li>
            <li>This works at getting all the grease, oil, dirt, and who knows what else off of his skin, so he&#x27;s squeeky clean!  </li>
            <li>All natural, not too scratchy, very effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an easy to hold and work with loofah too.  </li>
            <li>Falls apart easily</li>
            <li>And it got moldy VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>I loved this particular type of loofah.</li>
            <li>Works really good, can&#x27;t live without one.</li>
            <li>but this one has quite a fine grain to it</li>
            <li>Recommend if you want a cheap easy solution for loufas.</li>
            <li>Nice large size.</li>
            <li>They are plenty large, they feel and work great, and don&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li>thanks so much for a great product.  </li>
            <li>looks so smooth.    </li>
            <li>This loofah is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>so takes awhile to arrive--but ships free.</li>
            <li>Nens Loofah, is an invigorating exfoliating tool for body exfoliation during your bath or shower it lathers up to keep your skin radiant and blemish free</li>
            <li>AND THEY MAKE GREAT BACK SCRATCHERS.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked and felt so great until after utilizing the loofah during my daily shower.</li>
            <li>After they arrive, add some water and the loofah should expand to its original size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used a Loofa because I like to be clean...</li>
            <li>Mainly I think most people (men, anyway) will not be happy with anything smaller.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m surprised I liked them.</li>
            <li>--it is too cool.</li>
            <li>Make sure to soak it in warm water for 3-4 minutes before actual usage in order for it to have just the right amount of abrasiveness.</li>
            <li>this is not anything more than a soft sponge does not help in removing dead skin or anything helpful found a great loofah at a garage sale for fifty cents so much better</li>
            <li>was quick.</li>
            <li>So I can exfoliate from head to toe really quickly.  </li>
            <li>After a month or so of dishwashing use, this one, a two inch section of the original,  persists in its stiffness which is fine for pots and pans, but not required for much else.  </li>
            <li>Great size, I wish it was a little softer (flexible)</li>
            <li>You will really feel smooth after use.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the $ and works well</li>
            <li>love how fresh and soft</li>
            <li>In any case they are worth the additional cost compared to plastic foam sponges.</li>
            <li>in china which I&#x27;m not crazy about.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT&amp;#34; They did the right thing and kept a customer.</li>
            <li>In addition, it leaves my skin REALLY squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s amazed at how wonderful such a simple, and completely natural product works.  </li>
            <li>Great if you order small quantities.</li>
            <li>So far I love them; They wear out the bar of soap fast</li>
            <li>I found some of the some seeds and some of the loofah&#x27;s original skin, but this is normal.  </li>
            <li>Not that I consider myself more manly than the next guy, but I do prefer a rougher Loofah.  </li>
            <li>but the product is exactly as in the description.</li>
            <li>ok it is big</li>
            <li>Product exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>In their natural state (skinned and dried) they work great for dishwashing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s BIG, and could easily be cut into smaller sections, for extended use, travel, greater flexability, etc.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is that it is really easy to do my entire body with this.  </li>
            <li>If you are using it for the first time then soak it in for 8-10 minutes to get it all ready.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve had to barely touch myself with it to exfoliate with it, which I just don&#x27;t enjoy.</li>
            <li>Make sure to dry out as sponge will attract mold which will deteriorate the sponge.</li>
            <li>Large.</li>
            <li>This loofa is large and substantial.</li>
            <li>This one seems very natural and is nice and rough.</li>
            <li>The fibers are so fine that they&#x27;re starting to pull apart also.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many organic/natural loofahs before, and usually they break in quickly and become easier to use and lather pretty well after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think this can really be controlled.</li>
            <li>one is still &amp;#34;too&amp;#34; rigid and doesn&#x27;t really lather at all.</li>
            <li>&amp; I don&#x27;t have much room for it while sharing a bathroom</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I decided to use it on my feet instead of my whole body.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this sponge after deciding to try to eliminate plastics from my life as much as I could.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very scratchy</li>
            <li>Just rough enough for a good scrubbing, but doesn&#x27;t damage the skin.</li>
            <li>thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks</li>
            <li>It is effective in removing dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>You receive nice round loofahs.</li>
            <li>loofahs tend to accumulate soap with usage so you would like to keep it clean by rinsing it with cold water and then following up with a soaking in a 1:2 vinegar-water solution.&lt;br /&gt;Coming back to the product, it is pretty generous in size and does a great job in making your skin feel clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>I find the texture of this one just right, but it&#x27;s a natural product, so I expect they vary somewhat.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this twice from both the original seller and from another marketplace seller and they both only send 1 loofah.</li>
            <li>My 17 year old daughter has the same kind of mild eczema that I have; little bumps on the thighs and arms.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Not to rough but not too smooth either.</li>
            <li>Lastly, it has just the right amount of roughness.  </li>
            <li>I used to live in CA (now in MT) and grew loofahs in the garden.  </li>
            <li>This clearly shows this product as 8\\&quot; New England Naturals Loofah Sponge in Shrink Wrap Package (2 pcs/set) which implies that you will receive 2 Loofah&#x27;s</li>
            <li>But it came completely flattened in the mail, rounded back out to about 85% roundness after first use.</li>
            <li>The image shows a much rougher &#x27;grit&#x27; than what I actually received.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural product</li>
            <li>I have been using the natural ocean sponges (loofah) for years.</li>
            <li>It should become soft after using for a days.</li>
            <li>This year the sponges were mailed directly  from China.  </li>
            <li>Completely flattened out.</li>
            <li>They tell you that manufacturer says that they are natural and sizes vary.....</li>
            <li>but i can tell it wont last much longer.</li>
            <li>And the shape is such that it can&#x27;t really get between toes.</li>
            <li>We each have one and those little bumps are now pretty much gone.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many items from Amazon over the years and this was my only negative experience.</li>
            <li>decided to go to my locally grocery store and purchase a natural bristle wood brush to use instead, which I love.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I think I&#x27;m just a normal person, but this thing has started to tear (about 1/3 way though the middle) after maybe only 10 washes.  </li>
            <li>Works well to exfoliate old skin and is fairly soft when wet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little surprised that loofahs are marketed towards women given how rough they are; I find it&#x27;s just right for me.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new loofah because my old one was worn down and not exfoliating enough anymore.</li>
            <li>I like to cut mine in half (long way, aka hot dog style)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>However, they are very stiff and must be wet to become soft enough to be useful.</li>
            <li>This one is large enough that, for example, you can scrub your entire leg and bum with just a few motions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> So I can exfoliate from head to toe really quickly.  </li>
            <li> After a month or so of dishwashing use, this one, a two inch section of the original,  persists in its stiffness which is fine for pots and pans, but not required for much else.  </li>
            <li> Great size, I wish it was a little softer (flexible)</li>
            <li> You will really feel smooth after use.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the $ and works well</li>
            <li> love how fresh and soft</li>
            <li> In any case they are worth the additional cost compared to plastic foam sponges.</li>
            <li> in china which I&#x27;m not crazy about.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT&amp;#34; They did the right thing and kept a customer.</li>
            <li> In addition, it leaves my skin REALLY squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s amazed at how wonderful such a simple, and completely natural product works.  </li>
            <li> Great if you order small quantities.</li>
            <li> So far I love them; They wear out the bar of soap fast</li>
            <li> I found some of the some seeds and some of the loofah&#x27;s original skin, but this is normal.  </li>
            <li> Not that I consider myself more manly than the next guy, but I do prefer a rougher Loofah.  </li>
            <li> but the product is exactly as in the description.</li>
            <li> ok it is big</li>
            <li> Product exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> In their natural state (skinned and dried) they work great for dishwashing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s BIG, and could easily be cut into smaller sections, for extended use, travel, greater flexability, etc.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is that it is really easy to do my entire body with this.  </li>
            <li> If you are using it for the first time then soak it in for 8-10 minutes to get it all ready.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve had to barely touch myself with it to exfoliate with it, which I just don&#x27;t enjoy.</li>
            <li> Make sure to dry out as sponge will attract mold which will deteriorate the sponge.</li>
            <li> Large.</li>
            <li> This loofa is large and substantial.</li>
            <li> This one seems very natural and is nice and rough.</li>
            <li> The fibers are so fine that they&#x27;re starting to pull apart also.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many organic/natural loofahs before, and usually they break in quickly and become easier to use and lather pretty well after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think this can really be controlled.</li>
            <li> one is still &amp;#34;too&amp;#34; rigid and doesn&#x27;t really lather at all.</li>
            <li> &amp; I don&#x27;t have much room for it while sharing a bathroom</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I decided to use it on my feet instead of my whole body.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this sponge after deciding to try to eliminate plastics from my life as much as I could.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very scratchy</li>
            <li> Just rough enough for a good scrubbing, but doesn&#x27;t damage the skin.</li>
            <li> thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks</li>
            <li> It is effective in removing dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> You receive nice round loofahs.</li>
            <li> loofahs tend to accumulate soap with usage so you would like to keep it clean by rinsing it with cold water and then following up with a soaking in a 1:2 vinegar-water solution.&lt;br /&gt;Coming back to the product, it is pretty generous in size and does a great job in making your skin feel clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I find the texture of this one just right, but it&#x27;s a natural product, so I expect they vary somewhat.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this twice from both the original seller and from another marketplace seller and they both only send 1 loofah.</li>
            <li> My 17 year old daughter has the same kind of mild eczema that I have; little bumps on the thighs and arms.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Not to rough but not too smooth either.</li>
            <li> Lastly, it has just the right amount of roughness.  </li>
            <li> I used to live in CA (now in MT) and grew loofahs in the garden.  </li>
            <li> This clearly shows this product as 8\\&quot; New England Naturals Loofah Sponge in Shrink Wrap Package (2 pcs/set) which implies that you will receive 2 Loofah&#x27;s</li>
            <li> But it came completely flattened in the mail, rounded back out to about 85% roundness after first use.</li>
            <li> The image shows a much rougher &#x27;grit&#x27; than what I actually received.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural product</li>
            <li> I have been using the natural ocean sponges (loofah) for years.</li>
            <li> It should become soft after using for a days.</li>
            <li> This year the sponges were mailed directly  from China.  </li>
            <li> Completely flattened out.</li>
            <li> They tell you that manufacturer says that they are natural and sizes vary.....</li>
            <li> but i can tell it wont last much longer.</li>
            <li> And the shape is such that it can&#x27;t really get between toes.</li>
            <li> We each have one and those little bumps are now pretty much gone.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased many items from Amazon over the years and this was my only negative experience.</li>
            <li> decided to go to my locally grocery store and purchase a natural bristle wood brush to use instead, which I love.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I think I&#x27;m just a normal person, but this thing has started to tear (about 1/3 way though the middle) after maybe only 10 washes.  </li>
            <li> Works well to exfoliate old skin and is fairly soft when wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little surprised that loofahs are marketed towards women given how rough they are; I find it&#x27;s just right for me.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new loofah because my old one was worn down and not exfoliating enough anymore.</li>
            <li> I like to cut mine in half (long way, aka hot dog style)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> However, they are very stiff and must be wet to become soft enough to be useful.</li>
            <li> This one is large enough that, for example, you can scrub your entire leg and bum with just a few motions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m missing something about how to use this loofah sponge, but I&#x27;ve tried running it under hot water for a long time, wringing the life out of it several times, and just leaving it to soak, but nothing has made it even the slightest bit softer.</li>
            <li> Not much to it, it works very well, is rough enough  for exfoliation but not too rough, etc.</li>
            <li> A bit small for my &amp;#34;project&amp;#34; but absolutely as described.  </li>
            <li> Half of it is much more firm than the other half.  </li>
            <li> These large Loofah&#x27;s are hard to find.</li>
            <li> Not soft whatsoever.</li>
            <li> long they are gonna be in stock.</li>
            <li> However, don&#x27;t leave your loofah in the water too long or it will start to disintegrate.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This is natural way to help circulate fatty parts of your body - thighs and whatever, to keep from getting celluite.</li>
            <li> Not too stiff nor is it too soft.  </li>
            <li> And it is long and stiff enough that I can reach my back too.  </li>
            <li> I have always like the Loofahs to wash my face with to get rid of dry skin.</li>
            <li> The loofah is very generous in size, fat and thick when wet.</li>
            <li> This loofa is definitely as rough as other reviewers have stated, but after having used it for about 2 weeks, it softens up enough to be bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long but doesn&#x27;t hold up well when wet.</li>
            <li> Enough to cut in half and make 2.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used loofahs before, note that the seller compresses the loofahs tightly into the box prior to shipping.  </li>
            <li> after a few months, it is starting to fall apart..</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t minus a star just for that</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot to say about a sponge.</li>
            <li> it just sinks in and disappears basically.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> THEN USED THE OTHER END</li>
            <li> It works fantastic and I don&#x27;t feel bad about using a plastic loofah.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint was that the ad implies that you are receiving a 2 piece set for which you are not.</li>
            <li> So thick and heavy, I just thought it would take too long to dry and maybe get moldy.</li>
            <li> They were softer than the previous ones I had purchased&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> My previous loofah was of course a ball of plastic on a plastic stick, so I went on a search for an alternative.</li>
            <li> Each of my previous loofa&#x27;s have lasted at least 2 years if not considerably longer.  </li>
            <li> , so he gets pretty dirty and grimy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> This product won&#x27;t be grating off those dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> Oh yeah, it&#x27;s density is rather uneven too.  </li>
            <li> but I bought a few.</li>
            <li> Did not smooth the soles of my feet.</li>
            <li> I use them a couple of times per week for dead skin exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Also, since it&#x27;s so stiff I can&#x27;t get it to suds up at all when I pour my body wash on...</li>
            <li> and it was very hard and too rough.  </li>
            <li> Looked at Bed, Bath and Beyond and Walgreens where I have found them in the past.</li>
            <li> Too tough to soften a little.</li>
            <li> Its hard when I get it .</li>
            <li> These are hard to find unless you go to Amazon of course.</li>
            <li> I have had loofah&#x27;s before and don&#x27;t remember them being so hard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It sucks up my body wash but doesn&#x27;t foam up &#x3D;</li>
            <li> The loofa I received was dirty and much smaller than photo.</li>
            <li> I like loofahs but not this thick.</li>
            <li> Despite soaking for days, they are very hard.</li>
            <li> Downgraded from 3 starts to 1 start because of extremely poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I restrung the loofah with a thin plastic cord.</li>
            <li> Also has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> Useless product do not purchase</li>
            <li> but it is so difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I had always used the artificial loofahs before</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got one from a bad tree or something, but this is the worst quality loofa I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Save your money, this was a very disappointing product from china-- surprise !  </li>

            <li> This clearly shows this product as 8\\&quot; New England Naturals Loofah Sponge in Shrink Wrap Package (2 pcs/set) which implies that you will receive 2 Loofah&#x27;s but this is incorrect. I have ordered this twice from both the original seller and from another marketplace seller and they both only send 1 loofah. If this happens to you then please let your voice be heard that this kind of deceptive selling is not acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The loofah itself is okay. I soaked mine for about a hour in fairly warm water and softened it up. Then I twisted and squeezed on it so that it becomes more flexible. In my opinion the more you use them the better they get. The loofah is of good quality and I&#x27;d purchase it again. My only complaint was that the ad implies that you are receiving a 2 piece set for which you are not.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new loofah because my old one was worn down and not exfoliating enough anymore. This one seems very natural and is nice and rough.</li>
            <li> Update: So I think I&#x27;m just a normal person, but this thing has started to tear (about 1/3 way though the middle) after maybe only 10 washes.  The fibers are so fine that they&#x27;re starting to pull apart also.  I don&#x27;t know if I just got one from a bad tree or something, but this is the worst quality loofa I&#x27;ve ever used.  Each of my previous loofa&#x27;s have lasted at least 2 years if not considerably longer.  I&#x27;ve only had this one for about 2 weeks.  Downgraded from 3 starts to 1 start because of extremely poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve always used a Loofa because I like to be clean...but this one has quite a fine grain to it so I figure it&#x27;s more suited to the feminine persuasion.  Not that I consider myself more manly than the next guy, but I do prefer a rougher Loofah.  The image shows a much rougher &#x27;grit&#x27; than what I actually received.  I would relate the grain on this to those plastic foo foo shower sponge things with the purples and the reds and the blues.  This product won&#x27;t be grating off those dead skin cells.  Oh yeah, it&#x27;s density is rather uneven too.  Half of it is much more firm than the other half.  It&#x27;s a natural product so I don&#x27;t think this can really be controlled.</li>
            <li> like sand paper to your skin</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;New England&amp;#34; naturals is the brand name but dont be fooled THIS PRODUCT IS MADE IN CHINA. Dont support them, i wont buy ever again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a loofah. It does what you expect. Nice large size. Does drop some loofah seeds in the shower, but you can maybe collect them and grow your own loofah plant?</li>
            <li> Large. Enough to cut in half and make 2.</li>
            <li> My 17 year old daughter has the same kind of mild eczema that I have; little bumps on the thighs and arms.  I had been meaning to get us both a loofah and I finally ordered these through Amazon.  My daughter&#x27;s amazed at how wonderful such a simple, and completely natural product works.  We each have one and those little bumps are now pretty much gone.  I use it every time I shower or take a bath, on my feet, legs, arms and elbows.  It&#x27;s an easy to hold and work with loofah too.  I remember having one back in the 80&#x27;s and it was very hard and too rough.  These are perfect!</li>
            <li> These large Loofah&#x27;s are hard to find. Looked at Bed, Bath and Beyond and Walgreens where I have found them in the past. They didn&#x27;t have them. I thought of Amazon and that is where I found them. I have been using the natural ocean sponges (loofah) for years. I scrub my body (feet and face included) for years when I take a bath. It stimulates and massages the pressure points on my feet and is like a facial scrub daily. I have been told my skin including my face looks so smooth.    I recommend them to everyone.</li>
            <li> Despite soaking for days, they are very hard.</li>
            <li> Does what is suppose to do.  Wish it had a string attached for hanging instead of the plastic hook piece.  Other than that its a pretty good loofah.</li>
            <li> This loofah is fantastic.  I had always used the artificial loofahs before but I finally picked up one of these.  It works fantastic and I don&#x27;t feel bad about using a plastic loofah.  Great for exfoliating!</li>
            <li> Used to make soap project that has soap melted into loofahs.  Were uniform in size.  Worked great.  Will reorder when I do next batch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the same one daily that I bought over a year ago. They are plenty large, they feel and work great, and don&#x27;t cost much. Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Product comes from Africa! so takes awhile to arrive--but ships free. Works well to exfoliate old skin and is fairly soft when wet. Worth the $ and works well w/liquid soaps. Try one--only 4 bucks!</li>
            <li> Its hard when I get it . But I feel it will last forever.  It should become soft after using for a days. I like the product and the delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> I purchased multiples of this sponge.  It&#x27;s a great sponge and I will purchase again.  My fiances is a do-it-all kind of man, so he gets pretty dirty and grimy.  This works at getting all the grease, oil, dirt, and who knows what else off of his skin, so he&#x27;s squeeky clean!  Thank you loofah sponge!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many organic/natural loofahs before, and usually they break in quickly and become easier to use and lather pretty well after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is still &amp;#34;too&amp;#34; rigid and doesn&#x27;t really lather at all. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be updating if I see any signs of improvement :-)</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-It exfoliates well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-It sucks up my body wash but doesn&#x27;t foam up &#x3D;/&lt;br /&gt;-it doesn&#x27;t have a rope to hang it from &amp; I don&#x27;t have much room for it while sharing a bathroom</li>
            <li> These things were great and I&#x27;m surprised I liked them. They wore out in about two months but I bought a few. I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> A bit small for my &amp;#34;project&amp;#34; but absolutely as described.  Loofa on a stick for my husbands back scratcher.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> Love it. Just rough enough for a good scrubbing, but doesn&#x27;t damage the skin.</li>
            <li> Great size, I wish it was a little softer (flexible)</li>
            <li> My chinchillas love these. They chew them up in a hurry. I like that they don&#x27;t have any dye in them.</li>
            <li> A very good skin revitalizer that makes skin smooth and silky when used a fe times per week.  I will reorder when needed.</li>
            <li> Not soft whatsoever. Falls apart easily</li>
            <li> I opened the package today and found the loofahs to be quite good.  I found some of the some seeds and some of the loofah&#x27;s original skin, but this is normal.  If you&#x27;ve never used loofahs before, note that the seller compresses the loofahs tightly into the box prior to shipping.  After they arrive, add some water and the loofah should expand to its original size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the seller wrote me and indicated that the actual loofah is a darker yellow than what&#x27;s shown on the website.  I have no issue with the color, but others might.  Regardless, I appreciate the note.</li>
            <li> Did not smooth the soles of my feet. Glad I didnt pay alot.</li>
            <li> This loofa is definitely as rough as other reviewers have stated, but after having used it for about 2 weeks, it softens up enough to be bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how fresh and soft my skin feels after using this in the shower. This loofa is large and substantial. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering from the same company as last year....in the eastern part of the US.  This year the sponges were mailed directly  from China.  It is almost like they were soaked in something to stiffen them up.  I used to live in CA (now in MT) and grew loofahs in the garden.  In their natural state (skinned and dried) they work great for dishwashing.  After a month or so of dishwashing use, this one, a two inch section of the original,  persists in its stiffness which is fine for pots and pans, but not required for much else.  Perhaps they will soften after several months of use.  In any case they are worth the additional cost compared to plastic foam sponges.</li>
            <li> I love loofah&#x27;s and this one does the job.  Nice length and softens after continued use.  This is my 3rd one over the years and I keep buying them.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and very nice.  I cut it in slices to make soap with loofah in it.</li>
            <li> Excellent Loofa.  It&#x27;s BIG, and could easily be cut into smaller sections, for extended use, travel, greater flexability, etc.</li>
            <li> It took about a month to arrive but it finally arrived. I haven&#x27;t used it yet though but the product is exactly as in the description. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> thanks so much for a great product.  My loofah soap turned out great :)&lt;br /&gt;My customers are loving it.  Mint Lavender Loofah soap</li>
            <li> Wow, I &#x27;m very impressed. The loofah is very generous in size, fat and thick when wet. All natural, not too scratchy, very effective. You will really feel smooth after use. Going to order more while I still remember where they came from! I removed the fat rope that came on it. So thick and heavy, I just thought it would take too long to dry and maybe get moldy. I restrung the loofah with a thin plastic cord. Now I have a loop for hanging without a soppy rope.</li>
            <li> Nens Loofah, is an invigorating exfoliating tool for body exfoliation during your bath or shower it lathers up to keep your skin radiant and blemish free its great.. Super Love This Product!</li>
            <li> THIS IS AWESOME, I CUT IT UP AND USED PAINT STIRRERS AND GLUED THE PIECES TO THE END AND THEY MAKE GREAT BACK SCRATCHERS. AWESOME. THEN USED THE OTHER END I DIDN&#x27;T CUT FOR THE BATH. LOVE IT.</li>

            <li> I have always like the Loofahs to wash my face with to get rid of dry skin. It helps a lot. I would buy this product again, but when I purchased it I didn&#x27;t receive I purchased the eight inch one and not the four inch one.</li>
            <li> I like the abrasiveness of the loofah! It is effective in removing dead skin cells. My skin has never looked and felt so great until after utilizing the loofah during my daily shower.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of exfoliating my skin in the shower, rinses easily, doesn&#x27;t stink, I&#x27;d buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Great if you order small quantities. You receive nice round loofahs. Order in bulk 12 or more they come in the size package as when you order 3. Completely flattened out. They tell you that manufacturer says that they are natural and sizes vary.....but they only vary when ordering in bulk.</li>
            <li> I love these loofah sponges. I use them a couple of times per week for dead skin exfoliation. It helps to keep my skin supple and reduce blemishes. These are hard to find unless you go to Amazon of course. Amazon has everything at terrific prices. I never buy from Walmart anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long but doesn&#x27;t hold up well when wet. It gets kind of soggy and floppy. Also has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> Should have the option for zero star rating. The one I ordered came from Hong Kong. This was NOT mentioned in the product listing. It took several weeks to arrive and when it did it reeked of cigarette smoke. I tried it twice and the smoke smell was overwhelming in the shower and when I tried to use it in the bath, seeds floated out of it. It is now in the trash. DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> This company is excellent, they know how to take care of the customer. &amp;#34;THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT&amp;#34; They did the right thing and kept a customer.</li>
            <li> Useless product do not purchase</li>
            <li> I loved this particular type of loofah. They were softer than the previous ones I had purchased&lt;br /&gt;and because of that I intend to order additional ones since I dont know hw long they are gonna be in stock.</li>
            <li> looks like a loofah, walks like a loofah, sounds like a loofah</li>
            <li> This is the hardest loofah sponge I ever used... ok it is big but it is so difficult to use. I decided to use it on my feet instead of my whole body.</li>
            <li> It was nice..it did have seeds in it but that wasnt that much of a big deal ..I liked it</li>
            <li> this is not anything more than a soft sponge does not help in removing dead skin or anything helpful found a great loofah at a garage sale for fifty cents so much better</li>
            <li> I like to cut mine in half (long way, aka hot dog style)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but after a few months, it is starting to fall apart.. still works.. i still use it but i can tell it wont last much longer.</li>
            <li> I have had loofah&#x27;s before and don&#x27;t remember them being so hard. It didn&#x27;t scrub, it was more like a scouring pad.</li>
            <li> Works really good, can&#x27;t live without one.</li>
            <li> Too tough to soften a little. I like loofahs but not this thick.</li>
            <li> Honest seller. Product exactly as promised. Great eBayer</li>
            <li> So far I love them; They wear out the bar of soap fast so maybe a liquid soap will work better.</li>
            <li> Great for exfoliating your legs before shaving.  Feels good!  Not too stiff nor is it too soft.  Make sure to dry out as sponge will attract mold which will deteriorate the sponge.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why but the word loofah always seemed like a thing only girls use.  But after having seen it mentioned so many times over the years I thought what the heck, I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really glad I did.  The first thing I noticed is that it is really easy to do my entire body with this.  So I can exfoliate from head to toe really quickly.  And it is long and stiff enough that I can reach my back too.  In addition, it leaves my skin REALLY squeaky clean.  It is almost like polishing my skin with soap.  Lastly, it has just the right amount of roughness.  Not to rough but not too smooth either. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in china which I&#x27;m not crazy about.  But I can&#x27;t minus a star just for that--it is too cool.</li>
            <li> Sponge received as promised and works great!</li>
            <li> Works alright if you have good body wash or another product to go with it. But it came completely flattened in the mail, rounded back out to about 85% roundness after first use. And it got moldy VERY quickly. I think the mold likes the latticed framework of all the strands, because it got all in there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little surprised that loofahs are marketed towards women given how rough they are; I find it&#x27;s just right for me. This one is large enough that, for example, you can scrub your entire leg and bum with just a few motions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some caveats: it&#x27;s too abrasive for my face and ears and such, I still prefer a synthetic loofah for that. And the shape is such that it can&#x27;t really get between toes.</li>
            <li> Loofahs are not for everybody. They are (somewhat) abrasive, and if that&#x27;s not what you want, well, you don&#x27;t want a loofah. If that is what you want, I&#x27;d give this one a try. Mainly I think most people (men, anyway) will not be happy with anything smaller. I find the texture of this one just right, but it&#x27;s a natural product, so I expect they vary somewhat.</li>
            <li> Not much to it, it works very well, is rough enough  for exfoliation but not too rough, etc. Not a whole lot to say about a sponge.</li>
            <li> Save your money, this was a very disappointing product from china-- surprise !  The loofa I received was dirty and much smaller than photo. Actually threw it away as it was not enough $ to bother sending back.  I have purchased many items from Amazon over the years and this was my only negative experience.</li>
            <li> great product . keeps the skin very clean</li>
            <li> Looks like a &amp;#34;American brand&amp;#34;, but my package came from China Post. However, that being said, these things do work awesome! Recommend if you want a cheap easy solution for loufas.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliator and a nice alternative to the plastic sponges and bristled brushes. Make sure to soak it in warm water for 3-4 minutes before actual usage in order for it to have just the right amount of abrasiveness. If you are using it for the first time then soak it in for 8-10 minutes to get it all ready. However, don&#x27;t leave your loofah in the water too long or it will start to disintegrate.&lt;br /&gt;Also loofahs tend to accumulate soap with usage so you would like to keep it clean by rinsing it with cold water and then following up with a soaking in a 1:2 vinegar-water solution.&lt;br /&gt;Coming back to the product, it is pretty generous in size and does a great job in making your skin feel clean and smooth. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy real loofah&#x27;s, these are great! However, they are very stiff and must be wet to become soft enough to be useful.</li>
            <li> An outstanding product for nice and easy cleaning of the skin.  It only takes a couple of uses before the materials adjust to usage.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this sponge after deciding to try to eliminate plastics from my life as much as I could. My previous loofah was of course a ball of plastic on a plastic stick, so I went on a search for an alternative. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m missing something about how to use this loofah sponge, but I&#x27;ve tried running it under hot water for a long time, wringing the life out of it several times, and just leaving it to soak, but nothing has made it even the slightest bit softer. It&#x27;s very scratchy so I&#x27;ve had to barely touch myself with it to exfoliate with it, which I just don&#x27;t enjoy. Also, since it&#x27;s so stiff I can&#x27;t get it to suds up at all when I pour my body wash on...it just sinks in and disappears basically.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go to my locally grocery store and purchase a natural bristle wood brush to use instead, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m just to delicate to use this sponge, but I would see it better suited for heavy duty cleaning.</li>
            <li> This is natural way to help circulate fatty parts of your body - thighs and whatever, to keep from getting celluite. I love it and will buy again.</li>
