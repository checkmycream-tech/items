            <li>I love this color...</li>
            <li>I do think this color is more of a color for fall/winter...</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m more of a girly girl with a touch of edginess...</li>
            <li>This is umm ok, was not what I was expecting, I did the recommended 3 coats, but the color did not come out like the pic.</li>
            <li>It is more like just a purple, it didn&#x27;t seem like the 2 tone in the picture.</li>
            <li>Love this polish..</li>
            <li>KB Shimmer sends all their polish with tips on how to get the most out of your polish and each bottle is wrapped in bubble wrap.  </li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>I really love the color.</li>
            <li>Most polishes are chipping by two or three days.</li>

            <li>It changes so many colors &amp; goes with everything.  </li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and just am not as tickled about it as many others.</li>
            <li>Our clients love this option.</li>
            <li>We finish with a gel top coat to seal and give clients a 10 day user manicure</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Beautiful!!!!!. So why only 3 stars?</li>
            <li>Seller is top notch...</li>
            <li>Got this for my daughter as her favorite color is purple.</li>
            <li>I am ordering tons more as I write this review.</li>
            <li>all depending on what angle you&#x27;re looking at and in what kind of light.</li>
            <li>And this is easily my favorite polish.</li>
            <li>I love this polish</li>
            <li>Love the OPI Rollin&#x27; With The Chromies Linear Holographic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I gave this brand a chance.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>more can I say????</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I hoped for!!!</li>
            <li>The colors are long-lasting and very unique.</li>
            <li>Just hands down amazing, the formula, the shift and everything about this polish I love!!!!</li>
            <li>In darker lighting it looks blueish purple, but in the bright light it gets a rainbow shine and is very pretty.</li>
            <li>The colors are gorgeous and this is by far my favorite nail polish!</li>
            <li>It looks great and shimmers in the light and dries fast too.</li>
            <li>And then add on top of that a strong linear holographic effect.  </li>
            <li>So I tried 2 coats, nice but the color didn&#x27;t have a bold effect.</li>
            <li>This polish is very nice as far as the colors, but for sure it will chip, chip, chip, chip and fade on the ends of your nails</li>
            <li>My new favorite!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure 2 coats would&#x27;ve been fine</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, and looks great with only 2 coats (on it&#x27;s own, with no base color)</li>
            <li>Like color but polish comes off or cracks too easily.</li>
            <li>Strong chroma effect and holo</li>
            <li>and she also liked it very much.</li>
            <li>I have had  a bunch of people comment on how pretty it is and ask what kind of polish it is.</li>
            <li>Fantastic color &amp; very holographic in direct sun.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely attractive and well worth the money !!!</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it looks best over black.</li>
            <li>It is chrome without light, and a beautiful deep space holo in light.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this doesn&#x27;t need a top clear coat either.</li>
            <li>The polish went on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>The price is comparable to the competition &amp; even cheap if you think about it</li>
            <li>I used 2 coats and when in the sun or any light hit my nails</li>
            <li>Now that I know the difference between quality and cheap</li>
            <li>and it just looks pure awesome on top of a black coat.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite nail polish!  </li>
            <li>Also, it is creamy and easy to apply, and fun to watch as the light starts to reflect off of the built up coats.</li>
            <li>Very cool and fun.</li>
            <li>Love this - exactly how it is pictured.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this Polish</li>
            <li>My nails are short again, but I have grown to LOVE, LOVE this polish!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exactly as pictured without a top coat.</li>
            <li>The color variation isn&#x27;t as great as shown but it is very long wearing and durable.</li>
            <li>Great color if you want to try something fun and different!!!  </li>
            <li>Super unique and fun!</li>
            <li>I loved it with one coat because it&#x27;s a light grey rainbow.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it as sheer as some described, I could get away with 2 coats but did do 3 for good measure.  </li>
            <li>Another cool color, I am going to do my nails this color this week.</li>
            <li>Two coats was enough,  and it lasted fairly well.</li>
            <li>the holographic color is just like the photo in the right light...</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always looking for a unique, fun and cool polish.</li>
            <li>It is best over black or a color but doesn&#x27;t cover over all polishs, so it&#x27;s streaky and more blue.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also great in the dark...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a very very pretty color.</li>
            <li>I think this nail polish is very pretty, One of my favs.</li>
            <li>Looks very pretty on</li>
            <li>KB Shimmer has a new fan :)</li>
            <li>I,will,be back for more!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>It has the yummy halo sparkle that you can really pick up when its light out or in the sun.</li>
            <li>dont think it is worth the money</li>
            <li>Really fun nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>All part of the fun.</li>
            <li>But well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is a fun nail lacquer to wear.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re mesmerizing.</li>
            <li>Very unusual &amp; pretty!</li>
            <li>Put two coates on 4 it 2 look right</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t get it right.</li>
            <li>I love the nail polish it does exactly what it suppose to do even on natural nails.</li>
            <li>this helped anyone who is on the fence about this polish, it is so pretty and fun to do, takes me 30 minutes or so, while watching a program.  </li>
            <li>Gorgeous multi-chromes that shift several different colors depending on the light.  </li>
            <li>It looks really nice and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Nice color and stayed on very long without chipping no topcoat needed</li>
            <li>What can I say about this multi-chrome holographic polish of absolute gorgeousness!</li>
            <li>The only way this could possibly be better would be if it worked for nail stamping, but that&#x27;s me being greedy.</li>
            <li>I use it to on top of another color a week later to prolong my manicure.</li>
            <li>and I love watching the different shades that appear as you turn your hands.</li>
            <li>They are exactly as they are described.  </li>
            <li>I really only notice the holographic aspect if I look VERY close or in direct, bright sunlight.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipper!</li>
            <li>Rollin&#x27; With The Chromies was my first color</li>
            <li>I love how it looks blue at one angle, purple at another and a mix of both at another.</li>
            <li>Still pretty but needs about 4 coats.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the first coat fool you.</li>
            <li>Really doesn&#x27;t look like the picture!</li>
            <li>The color is so pretty</li>
            <li>I love the color and it will last almost a week.  </li>
            <li>and unfortunately I&#x27;m not a patient person.  </li>
            <li>I applied 4 super thin coats plus a top coat &amp; sealed it with a top coat it lasted almost 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I initially thought it would be a bit much for the workplace(I work with attorneys), but I&#x27;ve received so many complements.  </li>
            <li>Positively gorgeous&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>Love the color and it lasts long.</li>
            <li>Also, it lasts a REALLY long time without chipping, which I love.</li>
            <li>However I splurged on this one because I thought it really looked pretty, and I don&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to remove my nail polish and complete a full manicure.</li>
            <li>At first it looks like one color but a the light hits it at different angles, you see the ombre effect.</li>
            <li>Its so beautiful with the color shifts of purple, green, blue and orange.</li>
            <li>and you can get more than one polish without paying 3.99+ for shipping on every single item.</li>
            <li>This just might be my new FAVE!!  </li>
            <li>It is a new favorite in my massive nail polish collection.</li>
            <li>Fast Top Coat .5 oz PROFESSIONAL Clear High Gloss 83005]])  </li>
            <li>I think more than $4-5 for a single polish is too much.</li>
            <li>I only applied it to one nail last night as a test drive and already love it!</li>
            <li>but when I put it on I was really upset it doesn&#x27;t change color like it shows on the website .I</li>
            <li>Thanks, fast shipping too....</li>
            <li>Lasts really well.  </li>
            <li>I adore the holographic nail polishes from KBshimmer so much.</li>
            <li>not enough light play on my shorter fingernails, will try again when they get longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, I followed the 3 coat way, and have had my polish on for almost a week -- washing dishes, scrubbing tubs, Mod Podging and not babying them in any way.</li>
            <li>It appeared light lavender but still had the same effect.  </li>
            <li>Shifts between purple and light blue, with added rainbow effect under sunlight.</li>
            <li>It dries so fast so the 3 coats the polish needs takes no time at all.</li>
            <li>Cool colors, long lasting, what more could you want?</li>
            <li>Very sparkly/glittery</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I love the soft lavendar and blue in the photo, but it looks nothing like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s blue, it&#x27;s pink, it&#x27;s purple, it&#x27;s shimmery and gorgeous, and</li>
            <li>I would absolutely use it on top of a coat of black polish to really make the colors pop.</li>
            <li>No other holo has given me such a WOW affect after putting it on!! :)</li>
            <li>After they have dried completely, I put on a top coat and then Seche Vite!  </li>
            <li>Goes on metallic grey but changes to blue/purple &amp; even orange depending on the angle you look at it &amp; the way the light hits your hand.</li>
            <li>I managed to make my paint job last a full 2 weeks before any chipping started.</li>
            <li>So far I absolutely loveeee this!</li>
            <li>It came a lot earlier than I had expected and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li>When over top black it looks like the galaxy nails without having to do all the work.</li>
            <li>Very pretty color, especially in the sunlight.</li>
            <li>and I see why it&#x27;s highly rated</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend it if you want to try holos.</li>
            <li>This is high quality stuff.</li>
            <li>Beutiful Polish a little more purple</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not getting the chipping issue other customers have, but it peels so easily.</li>
            <li>fast, well packaged and professional.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an addict,  this is my new crack.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll find yourself constantly staring at it as it can look very different depending on the light.</li>
            <li>Long lasting, yet easy to remove with polish remover.</li>
            <li>First of all, I put it on in globs last August.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not showing the two tone color as shown on the nails advertised but it is a pretty purplish blue color.</li>
            <li>I did the first hand again as soon as I finished the second.</li>
            <li>Two coats over my clear gels and the &amp;#34;personality&amp;#34; of the polish comes through.</li>
            <li>I polished both my natural nails</li>
            <li>If done properly, your nails will look just like the picture, under a lamp or out in the sun, light blue chrome to a pinky violet, then darker purple, then back again.</li>
            <li>I fixed both nails.</li>
            <li>I fixed those nails.</li>
            <li>So far KBShimmer are not thoes kinds of polishes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ill stick with my professional discount on OPI,Essie, China Glaze, among others.</li>
            <li>If you put it on natural nails and sit in a hot bath for a long while, it peels off.    </li>
            <li>30 year old daughter that KNOWS Mama will buy her special little things.....</li>
            <li>Three coats usually works just fine on any polish I use.</li>
            <li>It has pink, lavender, blue, &amp; silver -cool tones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty high for nail polish in my opinion, and I believe it&#x27;s a bit cheaper from their website because shipping is less</li>
            <li>you can do the base coat, a coat of black nail polish and one coat of This Beautiful Light</li>
            <li>I used two coats of polish, then a basic clear overtop.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Well today I just tried it over black and it appears navy to dark purple in dim light but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty polish but from a distance just looks like a purple/blue metallic sheen, not holographic, even over black nail polish.</li>
            <li>B004B3YC9M OPI Natural Nail Base Coat &amp; Top Coat COMBO FULL SIZE .5]])&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s hard to go back to the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine on for almost a week now and not a single chip.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it seems to chip easily, despite following the recommended instruction.</li>
            <li>This is a really pretty color, but it is a little shear.</li>
            <li>My wife has long nails and will try nearly any color on them.</li>
            <li>Stayed on well with no chipping and it dried very well!</li>
            <li>It can shift to pink, orange, blue green and purple, plus the holo effect is fantastic.</li>
            <li>She applied this one over a dark blue base and it looked awesome!</li>

            <li> This is really a gorgeous shade of polish-</li>

            <li> Super impressed with these beautiful and unique polishes!  </li>
            <li> but I am most definitely happy with my purchase.</li>

            <li> Either way I am in love!  </li>
            <li> and I love the holo effect!</li>

            <li> Nice nail art and unique!  </li>

            <li> I love this color...</li>
            <li> I do think this color is more of a color for fall/winter...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m more of a girly girl with a touch of edginess...</li>
            <li> This is umm ok, was not what I was expecting, I did the recommended 3 coats, but the color did not come out like the pic.</li>
            <li> It is more like just a purple, it didn&#x27;t seem like the 2 tone in the picture.</li>
            <li> Love this polish..</li>
            <li> KB Shimmer sends all their polish with tips on how to get the most out of your polish and each bottle is wrapped in bubble wrap.  </li>
            <li> Love the color.</li>
            <li> I really love the color.</li>
            <li> Most polishes are chipping by two or three days.</li>
            <li> Chromies is my favorite shade from the holo collection.</li>
            <li> I love this polish.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so awesome how it changes colors and sparkles in different lights and when you move your fingers.</li>
            <li> ENJOY!  :-)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> love this polish.</li>
            <li> It changes so many colors &amp; goes with everything.  </li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and just am not as tickled about it as many others.</li>
            <li> Our clients love this option.</li>
            <li> We finish with a gel top coat to seal and give clients a 10 day user manicure</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful!!!!!. So why only 3 stars?</li>
            <li> Seller is top notch...</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter as her favorite color is purple.</li>
            <li> I am ordering tons more as I write this review.</li>
            <li> all depending on what angle you&#x27;re looking at and in what kind of light.</li>
            <li> And this is easily my favorite polish.</li>
            <li> I love this polish</li>
            <li> Love the OPI Rollin&#x27; With The Chromies Linear Holographic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I gave this brand a chance.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> more can I say????</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I hoped for!!!</li>
            <li> The colors are long-lasting and very unique.</li>
            <li> Just hands down amazing, the formula, the shift and everything about this polish I love!!!!</li>
            <li> In darker lighting it looks blueish purple, but in the bright light it gets a rainbow shine and is very pretty.</li>
            <li> The colors are gorgeous and this is by far my favorite nail polish!</li>
            <li> It looks great and shimmers in the light and dries fast too.</li>
            <li> And then add on top of that a strong linear holographic effect.  </li>
            <li> So I tried 2 coats, nice but the color didn&#x27;t have a bold effect.</li>
            <li> This polish is very nice as far as the colors, but for sure it will chip, chip, chip, chip and fade on the ends of your nails</li>
            <li> My new favorite!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure 2 coats would&#x27;ve been fine</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, and looks great with only 2 coats (on it&#x27;s own, with no base color)</li>
            <li> Like color but polish comes off or cracks too easily.</li>
            <li> Strong chroma effect and holo</li>
            <li> and she also liked it very much.</li>
            <li> I have had  a bunch of people comment on how pretty it is and ask what kind of polish it is.</li>
            <li> Fantastic color &amp; very holographic in direct sun.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely attractive and well worth the money !!!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it looks best over black.</li>
            <li> It is chrome without light, and a beautiful deep space holo in light.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this doesn&#x27;t need a top clear coat either.</li>
            <li> The polish went on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> The price is comparable to the competition &amp; even cheap if you think about it</li>
            <li> I used 2 coats and when in the sun or any light hit my nails</li>
            <li> Now that I know the difference between quality and cheap</li>
            <li> and it just looks pure awesome on top of a black coat.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite nail polish!  </li>
            <li> Also, it is creamy and easy to apply, and fun to watch as the light starts to reflect off of the built up coats.</li>
            <li> Very cool and fun.</li>
            <li> Love this - exactly how it is pictured.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this Polish</li>
            <li> My nails are short again, but I have grown to LOVE, LOVE this polish!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s exactly as pictured without a top coat.</li>
            <li> The color variation isn&#x27;t as great as shown but it is very long wearing and durable.</li>
            <li> Great color if you want to try something fun and different!!!  </li>
            <li> Super unique and fun!</li>
            <li> I loved it with one coat because it&#x27;s a light grey rainbow.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it as sheer as some described, I could get away with 2 coats but did do 3 for good measure.  </li>
            <li> Another cool color, I am going to do my nails this color this week.</li>
            <li> Two coats was enough,  and it lasted fairly well.</li>
            <li> the holographic color is just like the photo in the right light...</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always looking for a unique, fun and cool polish.</li>
            <li> It is best over black or a color but doesn&#x27;t cover over all polishs, so it&#x27;s streaky and more blue.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also great in the dark...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a very very pretty color.</li>
            <li> I think this nail polish is very pretty, One of my favs.</li>
            <li> Looks very pretty on</li>
            <li> KB Shimmer has a new fan :)</li>
            <li> I,will,be back for more!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> It has the yummy halo sparkle that you can really pick up when its light out or in the sun.</li>
            <li> dont think it is worth the money</li>
            <li> Really fun nail polish.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> All part of the fun.</li>
            <li> But well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is a fun nail lacquer to wear.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re mesmerizing.</li>
            <li> Very unusual &amp; pretty!</li>
            <li> Put two coates on 4 it 2 look right</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t get it right.</li>
            <li> I love the nail polish it does exactly what it suppose to do even on natural nails.</li>
            <li> this helped anyone who is on the fence about this polish, it is so pretty and fun to do, takes me 30 minutes or so, while watching a program.  </li>
            <li> Gorgeous multi-chromes that shift several different colors depending on the light.  </li>
            <li> It looks really nice and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Nice color and stayed on very long without chipping no topcoat needed</li>
            <li> What can I say about this multi-chrome holographic polish of absolute gorgeousness!</li>
            <li> The only way this could possibly be better would be if it worked for nail stamping, but that&#x27;s me being greedy.</li>
            <li> I use it to on top of another color a week later to prolong my manicure.</li>
            <li> and I love watching the different shades that appear as you turn your hands.</li>
            <li> They are exactly as they are described.  </li>
            <li> I really only notice the holographic aspect if I look VERY close or in direct, bright sunlight.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipper!</li>
            <li> Rollin&#x27; With The Chromies was my first color</li>
            <li> I love how it looks blue at one angle, purple at another and a mix of both at another.</li>
            <li> Still pretty but needs about 4 coats.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the first coat fool you.</li>
            <li> Really doesn&#x27;t look like the picture!</li>
            <li> The color is so pretty</li>
            <li> I love the color and it will last almost a week.  </li>
            <li> and unfortunately I&#x27;m not a patient person.  </li>
            <li> I applied 4 super thin coats plus a top coat &amp; sealed it with a top coat it lasted almost 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I initially thought it would be a bit much for the workplace(I work with attorneys), but I&#x27;ve received so many complements.  </li>
            <li> Positively gorgeous&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> Love the color and it lasts long.</li>
            <li> Also, it lasts a REALLY long time without chipping, which I love.</li>
            <li> However I splurged on this one because I thought it really looked pretty, and I don&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to remove my nail polish and complete a full manicure.</li>
            <li> At first it looks like one color but a the light hits it at different angles, you see the ombre effect.</li>
            <li> Its so beautiful with the color shifts of purple, green, blue and orange.</li>
            <li> and you can get more than one polish without paying 3.99+ for shipping on every single item.</li>
            <li> This just might be my new FAVE!!  </li>
            <li> It is a new favorite in my massive nail polish collection.</li>
            <li> Fast Top Coat .5 oz PROFESSIONAL Clear High Gloss 83005]])  </li>
            <li> I think more than $4-5 for a single polish is too much.</li>
            <li> I only applied it to one nail last night as a test drive and already love it!</li>
            <li> but when I put it on I was really upset it doesn&#x27;t change color like it shows on the website .I</li>
            <li> Thanks, fast shipping too....</li>
            <li> Lasts really well.  </li>
            <li> I adore the holographic nail polishes from KBshimmer so much.</li>
            <li> not enough light play on my shorter fingernails, will try again when they get longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, I followed the 3 coat way, and have had my polish on for almost a week -- washing dishes, scrubbing tubs, Mod Podging and not babying them in any way.</li>
            <li> It appeared light lavender but still had the same effect.  </li>
            <li> Shifts between purple and light blue, with added rainbow effect under sunlight.</li>
            <li> It dries so fast so the 3 coats the polish needs takes no time at all.</li>
            <li> Cool colors, long lasting, what more could you want?</li>
            <li> Very sparkly/glittery</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love the soft lavendar and blue in the photo, but it looks nothing like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s blue, it&#x27;s pink, it&#x27;s purple, it&#x27;s shimmery and gorgeous, and</li>
            <li> I would absolutely use it on top of a coat of black polish to really make the colors pop.</li>
            <li> No other holo has given me such a WOW affect after putting it on!! :)</li>
            <li> After they have dried completely, I put on a top coat and then Seche Vite!  </li>
            <li> Goes on metallic grey but changes to blue/purple &amp; even orange depending on the angle you look at it &amp; the way the light hits your hand.</li>
            <li> I managed to make my paint job last a full 2 weeks before any chipping started.</li>
            <li> So far I absolutely loveeee this!</li>
            <li> It came a lot earlier than I had expected and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li> When over top black it looks like the galaxy nails without having to do all the work.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color, especially in the sunlight.</li>
            <li> and I see why it&#x27;s highly rated</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend it if you want to try holos.</li>
            <li> This is high quality stuff.</li>
            <li> Beutiful Polish a little more purple</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not getting the chipping issue other customers have, but it peels so easily.</li>
            <li> fast, well packaged and professional.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an addict,  this is my new crack.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll find yourself constantly staring at it as it can look very different depending on the light.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, yet easy to remove with polish remover.</li>
            <li> First of all, I put it on in globs last August.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not showing the two tone color as shown on the nails advertised but it is a pretty purplish blue color.</li>
            <li> I did the first hand again as soon as I finished the second.</li>
            <li> Two coats over my clear gels and the &amp;#34;personality&amp;#34; of the polish comes through.</li>
            <li> I polished both my natural nails</li>
            <li> If done properly, your nails will look just like the picture, under a lamp or out in the sun, light blue chrome to a pinky violet, then darker purple, then back again.</li>
            <li> I fixed both nails.</li>
            <li> I fixed those nails.</li>
            <li> So far KBShimmer are not thoes kinds of polishes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ill stick with my professional discount on OPI,Essie, China Glaze, among others.</li>
            <li> If you put it on natural nails and sit in a hot bath for a long while, it peels off.    </li>
            <li> 30 year old daughter that KNOWS Mama will buy her special little things.....</li>
            <li> Three coats usually works just fine on any polish I use.</li>
            <li> It has pink, lavender, blue, &amp; silver -cool tones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty high for nail polish in my opinion, and I believe it&#x27;s a bit cheaper from their website because shipping is less</li>
            <li> you can do the base coat, a coat of black nail polish and one coat of This Beautiful Light</li>
            <li> I used two coats of polish, then a basic clear overtop.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Well today I just tried it over black and it appears navy to dark purple in dim light but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty polish but from a distance just looks like a purple/blue metallic sheen, not holographic, even over black nail polish.</li>
            <li> B004B3YC9M OPI Natural Nail Base Coat &amp; Top Coat COMBO FULL SIZE .5]])&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s hard to go back to the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine on for almost a week now and not a single chip.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it seems to chip easily, despite following the recommended instruction.</li>
            <li> This is a really pretty color, but it is a little shear.</li>
            <li> My wife has long nails and will try nearly any color on them.</li>
            <li> Stayed on well with no chipping and it dried very well!</li>
            <li> It can shift to pink, orange, blue green and purple, plus the holo effect is fantastic.</li>
            <li> She applied this one over a dark blue base and it looked awesome!</li>
            <li> I want all of my paint jobs to last as long as possible.</li>
            <li> I will update on how long it last on my nails...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it would be even less interesting without the black base.</li>
            <li> The color is not a rainbow turquoise, instead it was a dark deep blue color.</li>
            <li> I been getting my nails done for so long</li>
            <li> Also, it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Stains nails for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The polish went on greAt  with a dark grey base coat.</li>
            <li> took a long time to dry</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve actually seen other people wearing polish like this.  </li>
            <li> It is a great formula that goes on with max ease &amp; doesnt streak as other holos tend to (especially with me being new to diy mani pedis, in bad health &amp; shaky-I was hit by a drunk driver.)</li>
            <li> B007U90J5U 2 BOTTLES Seche Vite Dry</li>
            <li> It also takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> but it is a dark blue purple shifting color.</li>
            <li> sorry to say but true.</li>
            <li> Not really holographic, but glittery.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this was money well spent.</li>
            <li> I still use it  just not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I experimented just a bit and would not recommend using a base coat of white or putting a matte top coat on.</li>
            <li> However for just nail polish I felt it&#x27;s a little pricey, especially compared to the other brands I typically stick to.</li>
            <li> so i was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I bought some Essie, OPI &amp; other drug store brands</li>
            <li> Unlike any other polish in my collection.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need any other coats than that.</li>
            <li> I am going to experiment with other colors as well.</li>
            <li> Then it started chipping on other nails.</li>
            <li> but it looks like the other 2</li>
            <li> I do highly suggest doing the black undercoat due to the thin nature of the liquid.</li>
            <li> The bottle was dark</li>
            <li> I use Opi Base Coat and Opi Top Coat, maybe that is why, don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I used a base coat of black and put this color over top of it.</li>
            <li> I used a coat of black underneath it and then did one coat over it.</li>
            <li> Not true to color.</li>
            <li> Goes on just like the picture except maybe a little darker.</li>
            <li> i like it just a little bit</li>
            <li> I needed quite a few coats</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I put a good base coat on, then at least 3 THIN coats of polish.</li>
            <li> accidentally gave away all of my solid black polishes but was unable to wait until I had one, so I tried 3 coats solo.</li>
            <li> I get compliments everyday !</li>
            <li> I have small nails</li>
            <li> And I am very tough on my hands so polish doesn&#x27;t usually last, however this lasted over a day with no problem.</li>
            <li> To my delight, I found using a topcoat didn&#x27;t dull the holo effect.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this nail polish, and apparently it is hard to chip.</li>
            <li> The directions cold for so much work that I decided not to apply the enamel as I was afraid it might damage my nail.</li>
            <li> A little expensive would rather get OPI for that price</li>
            <li> Not Good, not at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with chipping unless the formula itself is not good.</li>
            <li> I applied 2 layers of base coat and 2 layers of polish and only wore it for about a week.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m addicted to KBshimmer.</li>
            <li> Needed 3 thin coats on my nails.</li>
            <li> Not happy with seller or product.</li>
            <li> You HAVE to do three thin coats if you want it to look like the picture in the description.</li>
            <li> I tried it with a white base , a blue base  a black base and a aqua base.</li>
            <li> looks like a dull ugly purple.</li>
            <li> I am now obsessed with KBShimmer polish!</li>
            <li> So very sad.</li>
            <li> am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate polishes that are work to out on.</li>
            <li> Miss leading advertising, I was very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome nail polish. It looks really nice and lasts a long time. I will be buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> Beutiful Polish a little more purple then I thought it would be but great !</li>
            <li> I love the nail polish it does exactly what it suppose to do even on natural nails. I polished both my natural nails And my acrylic  nails and only had to use 3 coats on them...</li>
            <li> Awesome holographic polish!</li>
            <li> Love this - exactly how it is pictured. :)  I get compliments on it all the time. :)</li>
            <li> The nail polish was close to the picture.  I just didn&#x27;t quite like it.  It worked well.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite nail polish!  It looks great and shimmers in the light and dries fast too. Very different from all the ones I have.</li>
            <li> I been getting my nails done for so long so I&#x27;m always looking for a unique, fun and cool polish. I seen this, it had great ratings and reviews so I decided tried it and I see why it&#x27;s highly rated, it&#x27;s beautiful and I had it for a week - still no chipping. I get compliments on it, even my nail technician is ordering it for their shop as well. TRY IT!! :) It&#x27;s so pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- I used two coats of polish, then a basic clear overtop.&lt;br /&gt; (Pics one with &amp; without flash)</li>
            <li> cute and love the name</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this Polish but when I put it on I was really upset it doesn&#x27;t change color like it shows on the website .I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not really holographic, but glittery.</li>
            <li> Great product! Stayed on well with no chipping and it dried very well!</li>
            <li> What can I say about this multi-chrome holographic polish of absolute gorgeousness! Its so beautiful with the color shifts of purple, green, blue and orange. I would absolutely use it on top of a coat of black polish to really make the colors pop. It has the yummy halo sparkle that you can really pick up when its light out or in the sun. Just hands down amazing, the formula, the shift and everything about this polish I love!!!!</li>
            <li> I only applied it to one nail last night as a test drive and already love it! I can&#x27;t wait to remove my nail polish and complete a full manicure. It probably looks best on longer nails as shown in the picture but either way its gorgeous and holds true to the holographic description. The bottle was dark so i was skeptical at first but I am most definitely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this polish... It&#x27;s gorgeous!! I,will,be back for more! Thanks, fast shipping too....</li>
            <li> Very unusual &amp; pretty!</li>
            <li> Goes on just like the picture except maybe a little darker. Beautiful.</li>
            <li> Got this for the girlfriend.  She loves it.  It photographs well and doesn&#x27;t seem to clot like some others do.</li>
            <li> Like color but polish comes off or cracks too easily. I find that I am always doing touch ups.</li>
            <li> Loved this polish ! It&#x27;s not as chrome as in the pic. It lasted well &amp; looked good.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> IMPRESSIVE HOLO!  This just might be my new FAVE!!  No other holo has given me such a WOW affect after putting it on!! :)</li>
            <li> My new favorite!! Gorgeous polish! Strong chroma effect and holo effect- best I&#x27;ve seen yet!  Goes on smoothly, and looks great with only 2 coats (on it&#x27;s own, with no base color) Have ordered another shade now... :o) Love it!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop staring at my nails in the sun!  The polish went on smoothly.  I&#x27;m sure 2 coats would&#x27;ve been fine but I did 3 and was very happy.  And the name of this polish is my favorite part!</li>
            <li> This is a great color</li>
            <li> The colors are really gorgeous. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments and hey, I even get distracted by my nails. I&#x27;m not getting the chipping issue other customers have, but it peels so easily. I&#x27;ve had to redo it several times in 1 day.</li>
            <li> The color variation isn&#x27;t as great as shown but it is very long wearing and durable.</li>
            <li> This nail polish was wonderful..... until I took it off.  I have NEVER had a nail polish stain my fingernails before until I used this polish!  I applied 2 layers of base coat and 2 layers of polish and only wore it for about a week.  Removed the polish and my fingernails are stained yellow!  So very sad.</li>
            <li> I sent this to my daughter who asked for it......yeah.....30 year old daughter that KNOWS Mama will buy her special little things.....haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway; she says the nail polish is GREAt and color is fabulous.  Good buy on my part.  Go me!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have gotten a lot of compliments with this polish!! Love the color and it lasts long. I would buy more!!</li>
            <li> Love this color,  it&#x27;s beautiful...</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t as advertised.  Applied and color is streaky and un-even.  Will try again.</li>
            <li> This is a really pretty color, but it is a little shear. I wanted more color so I put on a coat of purple polish and put this over it and it looks great.</li>
            <li> favorite nail polish now!! dont think it is worth the money but i do love the color!!</li>
            <li> I love this color...the holographic color is just like the photo in the right light...but it&#x27;s also great in the dark...you have to use two to three coats to get good coverage...I do think this color is more of a color for fall/winter...but you can get away with it in the summer for the jean and t-shirts girls...but I&#x27;m more of a girly girl with a touch of edginess...I will update on how long it last on my nails...</li>
            <li> Very cool and fun. Looks just like the picture.</li>
            <li> This is an gorgeous polish! In my opinion, it looks best over black. It can shift to pink, orange, blue green and purple, plus the holo effect is fantastic. To my delight, I found using a topcoat didn&#x27;t dull the holo effect. You&#x27;ll find yourself constantly staring at it as it can look very different depending on the light. I was happy with the durability of this polish too. The only way this could possibly be better would be if it worked for nail stamping, but that&#x27;s me being greedy. The bottom line is, everyone needs a bottle of this polish.</li>
            <li> My wife has long nails and will try nearly any color on them. She applied this one over a dark blue base and it looked awesome!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be anymore happier with this polish. I get compliments about this product all of the time! I give them the sellers name and the name of the product. I love it!</li>
            <li> Hey, if you are different in any way and would like to make a statement, put this on your nails! This color is beautiful! Nothing like it around that I have ever seen. Trust your instinct on this, buy it.</li>
            <li> This is umm ok, was not what I was expecting, I did the recommended 3 coats, but the color did not come out like the pic. It is more like just a purple, it didn&#x27;t seem like the 2 tone in the picture.</li>
            <li> I bought this polish awhile back when I started doing my nails myself. At the time I was unfamiliar with the company so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. It is the most amazing holo polish I have! I bought some Essie, OPI &amp; other drug store brands but none can hold a candle to this! It is a great formula that goes on with max ease &amp; doesnt streak as other holos tend to (especially with me being new to diy mani pedis, in bad health &amp; shaky-I was hit by a drunk driver.) I love the kind of chameleon way it tends to flatter what ever color are wearing clothing wise. It has pink, lavender, blue, &amp; silver -cool tones. I  HIGHLY recommend it if you want to try holos. or simply want a polish that will go with several colors. The price is comparable to the competition &amp; even cheap if you think about it bc you get 4 colors in one. I applied 4 super thin coats plus a top coat &amp; sealed it with a top coat it lasted almost 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Really fun nail polish.  Lasts really well.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this polish..I used 2 coats and when in the sun or any light hit my nails I can see the different colors. .Worth buying</li>
            <li> If you are connoisseur of nail polish, then you definitely have KB Shimmer colors(specifically this one) in your collection.  If not, what are you waiting for??  This color is awesome!!! I initially thought it would be a bit much for the workplace(I work with attorneys), but I&#x27;ve received so many complements.  Great color if you want to try something fun and different!!!  KB Shimmer sends all their polish with tips on how to get the most out of your polish and each bottle is wrapped in bubble wrap.  In my opinion, this was money well spent.</li>
            <li> Just beautiful!!!! Any direction you move, the colors change and shine with you.</li>
            <li> Love the color. Long lasting, yet easy to remove with polish remover. Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> I really love the color. I needed quite a few coats so I wouldn&#x27;t see my nail line (3-4) but it&#x27;s a very very pretty color. The way it reflects in the light is gorgeous. In darker lighting it looks blueish purple, but in the bright light it gets a rainbow shine and is very pretty. Also, it lasts a REALLY long time without chipping, which I love. I&#x27;ve had mine on for almost a week now and not a single chip. Most polishes are chipping by two or three days. The only reason I knocked off a star is the price. It&#x27;s pretty high for nail polish in my opinion, and I believe it&#x27;s a bit cheaper from their website because shipping is less and you can get more than one polish without paying 3.99+ for shipping on every single item. However for just nail polish I felt it&#x27;s a little pricey, especially compared to the other brands I typically stick to. I think more than $4-5 for a single polish is too much. However I splurged on this one because I thought it really looked pretty, and I don&#x27;t regret it. I&#x27;d buy more colors like this if they weren&#x27;t so darn expensive.</li>
            <li> I adore the holographic nail polishes from KBshimmer so much. This is high quality stuff. I managed to make my paint job last a full 2 weeks before any chipping started. Chromies is my favorite shade from the holo collection. I think I&#x27;m addicted to KBshimmer. Now that I know the difference between quality and cheap, It&#x27;s hard to go back to the cheap stuff. I want all of my paint jobs to last as long as possible.</li>
            <li> Unlike any other polish in my collection. Super unique and fun! Needed 3 thin coats on my nails. took a long time to dry but the result is amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this polish. I use it to on top of another color a week later to prolong my manicure. Finished color changes with the different color choice underneath.</li>
            <li> Nice color and stayed on very long without chipping no topcoat needed</li>
            <li> I bought this nail polish for my Doctor Who outfit as the TARDIS. It&#x27;s even better looking than in the pictures! I love it. It&#x27;s so awesome how it changes colors and sparkles in different lights and when you move your fingers. Definitely worth the price. Also, it lasts a long time. A must buy.</li>
            <li> Love the color! Seems to stay on well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely am in love with this color ! I get compliments everyday !</li>
            <li> not enough light play on my shorter fingernails, will try again when they get longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED NOTE!! Jan. 12, 2015.. My nails are short again, but I have grown to LOVE, LOVE this polish! First of all, I put it on in globs last August. Not Good, not at all. Here is what I do now:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I put a good base coat on, then at least 3 THIN coats of polish. After they have dried completely, I put on a top coat and then Seche Vite!  ([[ASIN:B007U90J5U 2 BOTTLES Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat .5 oz PROFESSIONAL Clear High Gloss 83005]])  Amazing results will be seen on your nails if you do this too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or you can do the base coat, a coat of black nail polish and one coat of This Beautiful Light Playing Nail Polish... K B Shimmer, Rollin With The Chromes. If done properly, your nails will look just like the picture, under a lamp or out in the sun, light blue chrome to a pinky violet, then darker purple, then back again. They are always changing. So, you have a wardrobe of colors on your finger tips. Almost no need to change the color, ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I followed the 3 coat way, and have had my polish on for almost a week -- washing dishes, scrubbing tubs, Mod Podging and not babying them in any way. I had one tiny spot flake off, and I just touched it up. When I take it off, there has never been any staining. I use Opi Base Coat and Opi Top Coat, maybe that is why, don&#x27;t know. ([[ASIN:B004B3YC9M OPI Natural Nail Base Coat &amp; Top Coat COMBO FULL SIZE .5]])&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helped anyone who is on the fence about this polish, it is so pretty and fun to do, takes me 30 minutes or so, while watching a program.  Also, it is creamy and easy to apply, and fun to watch as the light starts to reflect off of the built up coats. ENJOY!  :-)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I hoped for!!!</li>
            <li> This polish is so awesome. I love it. At first it looks like one color but a the light hits it at different angles, you see the ombre effect. More colors please!</li>
            <li> I love these polish.  They are eye catching and I love watching the different shades that appear as you turn your hands.</li>
            <li> The seller misleads you as to what your getting.  It is best over black or a color but doesn&#x27;t cover over all polishs, so it&#x27;s streaky and more blue.  For that money you can buy blue polish.  Not happy with seller or product.</li>
            <li> Put two coates on 4 it 2 look right</li>
            <li> Absolutely stunning. I used a coat of black underneath it and then did one coat over it. I have small nails so I don&#x27;t need any other coats than that. Honestly, this doesn&#x27;t need a top clear coat either. it&#x27;s exactly as pictured without a top coat. I do highly suggest doing the black undercoat due to the thin nature of the liquid. That, and it just looks pure awesome on top of a black coat. I will buy more when I run out. Totally amazing nail polish.</li>
            <li> Super impressed with these beautiful and unique polishes!  They are exactly as they are described.  Gorgeous multi-chromes that shift several different colors depending on the light.  And then add on top of that a strong linear holographic effect.  What you get is an incredible and unique polish that applies like a dream.  I didn&#x27;t find it as sheer as some described, I could get away with 2 coats but did do 3 for good measure.  But each layer was smooth and perfect.  I LOVE this polish!!!</li>
            <li> I think I got duped. I painted my nails with this, and my nails do not look holographic at all looks like a dull ugly purple. I will NEVER order this again.</li>
            <li> amazing! Very beautiful color Great Item!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is beautiful! I used a base coat of black and put this color over top of it. I have had  a bunch of people comment on how pretty it is and ask what kind of polish it is. I experimented just a bit and would not recommend using a base coat of white or putting a matte top coat on. I am going to experiment with other colors as well. All part of the fun. When over top black it looks like the galaxy nails without having to do all the work. I would definitely recommend buying this polish.</li>
            <li> Not true to color. The polish only lasted 1 day. I still use it  just not what I expected.  People did liked it when I wore it</li>
            <li> Wonderful color spectrum. The polish went on greAt  with a dark grey base coat.</li>
            <li> love this polish. running out time to order more!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is a blast. The picture shows how it looks two different colors, but it&#x27;s holographic too! Looks wonderful in the sun.    If you put it on natural nails and sit in a hot bath for a long while, it peels off.    But well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Coolest nail polish ever!  It changes so many colors &amp; goes with everything.  I get tons of compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> I have tried several undercoat colors, trying to achieve this look. It is nothing like the photo. It also takes forever to dry. I read all the reviews and just am not as tickled about it as many others. I love the soft lavendar and blue in the photo, but it looks nothing like it. Was expecting an ombre look but it is a dark blue purple shifting color. A little expensive would rather get OPI for that price</li>
            <li> Nice nail art and unique!  Our clients love this option. We finish with a gel top coat to seal and give clients a 10 day user manicure</li>
            <li> Nice on toes for winter. Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty polish but from a distance just looks like a purple/blue metallic sheen, not holographic, even over black nail polish. I really only notice the holographic aspect if I look VERY close or in direct, bright sunlight. I haven&#x27;t tried it by itself but I&#x27;m sure it would be even less interesting without the black base. I won&#x27;t buy it again but I&#x27;m not displeased. Meh.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in Dec 2014 and used it Jan 2015. I tried it with a white base , a blue base  a black base and a aqua base. I did not like the results with any of them. So I tried 2 coats, nice but the color didn&#x27;t have a bold effect. So I did what I do with just about every polish. I used 3 coats and that did it. Beautiful!!!!!. So why only 3 stars? Because the color started chipping the next day on 2 nails. I fixed both nails. Then it started chipping on other nails. I fixed those nails. And by the 5th day I just couldn&#x27;t keep fixing the polish. Three coats usually works just fine on any polish I use. I don&#x27;t have a problem with chipping unless the formula itself is not good. My OPI, sinful colors and Orly etc... I can wear for almost 2 weeks without any issues. This polish is very nice as far as the colors, but for sure it will chip, chip, chip, chip and fade on the ends of your nails even if you put the polish on the underside of your nails. sorry to say but true.</li>
            <li> My most favorite polish ever! This is as durable as it is beautiful! I get millions of complements when wearing it and find myself staring at it a lot more than I probably should! Excellent, everyone needs it in their collection.</li>
            <li> Great my wife loves it</li>
            <li> Item As Described! Fast Shipper! Thank You!</li>
            <li> This was the 1st time I used this polish. Great coverage, it&#x27;s been on for 2 weeks...NO Chipping. Fantastic color &amp; very holographic in direct sun.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely attractive and well worth the money !!! Received lots of compliments. Seller is top notch...fast, well packaged and professional. I give this entire transaction 5 Stars.</li>
            <li> The directions cold for so much work that I decided not to apply the enamel as I was afraid it might damage my nail.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this nail polish, and apparently it is hard to chip.</li>
            <li> Nice color. Just got this and tried it on nail. It&#x27;s not showing the two tone color as shown on the nails advertised but it is a pretty purplish blue color. Got this for my daughter as her favorite color is purple. She loves it.</li>
            <li> I am now obsessed with KBShimmer polish! Rollin&#x27; With The Chromies was my first color and I&#x27;m hooked. The formula is amazing! 2 coats is all you need. The formula is nice and easy.....I hate polishes that are work to out on. So far KBShimmer are not thoes kinds of polishes. I love how it looks blue at one angle, purple at another and a mix of both at another. It is a new favorite in my massive nail polish collection. I am ordering tons more as I write this review. Definitely pick this up! You can see a picture of the polish on my nails on Instagram @lindsaysperfectthing. I review beauty products, nail polish and subcription boxes with the occasional picture of my fur babies, Sherman &amp; Bubba.</li>
            <li> Very cute but peeled after 2 days.</li>
            <li> This is a great color but it takes more coats than the others.  Still pretty but needs about 4 coats.</li>
            <li> Another cool color, I am going to do my nails this color this week.</li>
            <li> This color is just insanely awesome. It&#x27;s blue, it&#x27;s pink, it&#x27;s purple, it&#x27;s shimmery and gorgeous, and all depending on what angle you&#x27;re looking at and in what kind of light. My only complaint is that it seems to chip easily, despite following the recommended instruction.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color, especially in the sunlight. Two coats was enough,  and it lasted fairly well.</li>
            <li> So far I absolutely loveeee this! It came a lot earlier than I had expected and it looks amazing. The colors are gorgeous and this is by far my favorite nail polish!</li>
            <li> I just received this on Thursday after ordering it on Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally gave away all of my solid black polishes but was unable to wait until I had one, so I tried 3 coats solo. It appeared light lavender but still had the same effect.  Well today I just tried it over black and it appears navy to dark purple in dim light but in the slightest bright light you see it all.  Either way I am in love!  And I am very tough on my hands so polish doesn&#x27;t usually last, however this lasted over a day with no problem.</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift... And this is easily my favorite polish. It went I so easily and beautifully; I was astounded. It is chrome without light, and a beautiful deep space holo in light. I love this polish so so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the pictures: I accidentally peeled off a bit on my middle finger. The pictures aren&#x27;t the best, just taken with my iPhone, but I think it still conveys it&#x27;s beauty.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous and durable nail polish. Definitely one of my favorites. Shifts between purple and light blue, with added rainbow effect under sunlight.</li>
            <li> Stains nails for a long time.  But I liked the color.</li>
            <li> Love the OPI Rollin&#x27; With The Chromies Linear Holographic.  It is a fun nail lacquer to wear.  Sent my daughter a bottle and she also liked it very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I gave this brand a chance. This is really a gorgeous shade of polish-I purchased three shades from KB Shimmer and my expectations were exceeded. The colors are long-lasting and very unique. Don&#x27;t let the first coat fool you. You HAVE to do three thin coats if you want it to look like the picture in the description. KB Shimmer has a new fan :)</li>
            <li> My boo bought me this polish and I LOVE IT I FREAKING LOVE IT. It dries so fast so the 3 coats the polish needs takes no time at all. I did the first hand again as soon as I finished the second. It goes on smooth and the color is amaaaazing and bright. Even if it doesn&#x27;t last days I work retail and groom pets so NONE OF my polish stays perfect more than a day. It&#x27;s amazing amazing amazing no girl or woman or queen or tgirl should be without this nail polish it&#x27;s a DREAM!!!</li>
            <li> the color is so different. i like it just a little bit</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like the nail color in the picture</li>
            <li> Really doesn&#x27;t look like the picture! Seems to have some purple in it, but not like the photo! I do like the blue that it is though.</li>
            <li> Cool colors, long lasting, what more could you want?</li>
            <li> I think this nail polish is very pretty, One of my favs. Very sparkly/glittery and I love the holo effect! Thank you</li>
            <li> It was great every thing you said it was everyone loved it</li>
            <li> Positively gorgeous&lt;br /&gt;What more can I say????</li>
            <li> OMG this polish is freaking amazing!  I&#x27;m an addict,  this is my new crack.</li>
            <li> The color is not a rainbow turquoise, instead it was a dark deep blue color. Miss leading advertising, I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Did not come out to color</li>
            <li> Awesome polish! Goes on metallic grey but changes to blue/purple &amp; even orange depending on the angle you look at it &amp; the way the light hits your hand. I get so many compliments every time I wear it. Even the technicians at my nail shop ask where they can get it from!</li>
            <li> The color is so pretty I loved it with one coat because it&#x27;s a light grey rainbow. Then a second coat and it&#x27;s even prettier. I adore the rainbow shimmer of this polish. In fact I can&#x27;t stop looking at my nails. They&#x27;re mesmerizing. It&#x27;s as distracting as a mirror is to vain people. Highly recommended! Enjoy!</li>
            <li> nice color,but it looks like the other 2 I bought,(they look like OPI designer series holographic polishes) but as a nail tech dont like paying almost 9 dollars for a bottle of polish. (rollin w/the chromies)&lt;br /&gt;Ill stick with my professional discount on OPI,Essie, China Glaze, among others.</li>
            <li> Two coats over my clear gels and the &amp;#34;personality&amp;#34; of the polish comes through. Very attractive.</li>
            <li> I love the color and it will last almost a week.  Looks very pretty on</li>
            <li> Love this color it is beautiful!!!</li>
            <li> there is a trick to applying this and unfortunately I&#x27;m not a patient person.  This may be great for some people and I&#x27;ve actually seen other people wearing polish like this.  I just can&#x27;t get it right.</li>
            <li> The color shift is beautiful and is great for Galaxy nail art (background).</li>
