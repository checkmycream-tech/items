    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for a student-athlete who is a friend of mine and will need locking containers to take with her when she moves to school.  She loved the design and I did as well.</li>
            <li> Within a week of ordering I received it. Came fast love this product just cuz I can fit about 60 nail polishes and the other smaller box I have about 30 lipsticks while I wait for my lipstick organizer. The box is big. Worth it</li>
            <li> At first when i got it i thought it was small for what I got it for. My acrylic nail brush wouldnt fit on the top, neither did my monomer bottles they were to big.&lt;br /&gt;Had no idea what to put in there that could fit. Then i put all my gel nail polish, and design polish, fit perfect. I fell inlove with the box, then my LED curing light arrived and i wanted a case to protect it and carry it around with my uv protection gloves. This box was the perfect size for it, so i got a second one and moved the detachable thing put more nail polish in it and put it in my polish case.&lt;br /&gt;Love that the box locks that way my toddler cant open it.&lt;br /&gt;The little box that comes with it doesnt have a lock, so i havent put anything in there, i might just fill it with nail cotton, and stuff that are harmless</li>
            <li> We bought this for our Daughters beauty pageant crown and banner.  Perfect sz.  Really makes a statement</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my daughter&#x27;s tiara.  The extra smaller box was a great extra gift as well!!!!!</li>
            <li> please dont put stickers on the outside as my stars came off with the sticker.</li>
            <li> Excellent case and we have purchased this case for our club Princesses for about 8 yrs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I needed the large case to replace my old broken case and was pleased with the price because of the bonus case, but I received it and the the large case was broken on the top right corner. Either way I would  have to return it to get a new one or a refund...unfortunately I don&#x27;t have the time to do that, so I&#x27;m keeping it broken.</li>
            <li> Small box fit my daughter&#x27;s NintendoDs cases for travel &amp; large case was fitted out for her pagaent crown</li>
            <li> Today is May 8. 2015.  I bought this particular box because I was looking for a clear LOCKING box to showcase some items I didn&#x27;t want any one to touch.  It serves that purpose perfectly except one important issue, for the past few weeks it&#x27;s been very challenging to get the lock to unlock/open.  Locking is easy and simple, unlocking, you have to do a bit of maneuvering which is why I&#x27;m giving it 2 rather than 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people rated it 5 stars.  If you are buying this box because you don&#x27;t/won&#x27;t need the locking feature, then I agree, it is a 5 star product.  If you are buying it specifically for the locking feature, this may not be the item for you because you may wind up having to spend money shortly after to get something else.  The new box I ordered earlier in the week arrived today.</li>
            <li> they are great  couldn&#x27;t find anywhere  will reoder</li>
            <li> Cases are great.  Nice sizes for girl&#x27;s things.</li>
            <li> works great as a crown case.</li>
            <li> its such a gorg case for storing your makeup, and its not as small as I read in some reviews and I love the fact that its transparent to I can reach for what I want easily.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Granddaughter for Graduation. Filled it with all kinds of things she&#x27;ll need for her nails when she goes to college. She luuuuuuved it. I did too so much that I&#x27;m ordering one for myself.</li>
            <li> Love these clear cases. Love all Caboodles products!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and not only did it come with a little &amp;#34;shelf box&amp;#34; it also comes with a 2nd smaller case for those other little things you&#x27;re not sure what to do with. Perfect for cotton swabs/cotton balls, bobby pins, etc. All those little things that can get lost.</li>
            <li> these are great for crowns and work perfect what we were needed them for.</li>
            <li> Love these cases!! My daughter uses the smaller one for her makeup and we converted the larger one into a custom crown case (for pageants). Enough room to fit a large size crown and sash. The picture shown is an example that is similar to what we did with our caboodle.</li>
            <li> Just got this in the mail and it was exactly what I wanted. Held all my polish with room for more and the little one that came with it held all 30 of my nail art pens perfectly.</li>
