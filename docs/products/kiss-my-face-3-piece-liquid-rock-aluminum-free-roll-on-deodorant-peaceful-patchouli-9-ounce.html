            <li>The smell is nice and it does a great job of preventing odor.</li>
            <li>I loved it but the scent often clashed with my perfume, so I decided to try the Lavender.</li>
            <li>Much superior to Weleda and rock crystal deodorants.</li>

            <li>It smells good</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I tried the patchouli scent roll on first and it worked excellent.</li>
            <li>Absolutely great product works great for myself and is all natural!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Liquid Rock is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as effective as before</li>
            <li>I was pleased to get so many (6) at a great price.</li>
            <li>My husband and I have used for years and it is 100% effective for odor without the aluminum and</li>
            <li>This smells so nice and is easier than a stone to take with you when traveling.  </li>
            <li>Deodomom makes an awesome natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>The best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is the best of the more natural types of underarm deodorants I&#x27;ve ever used--bar none!  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a more natural deodorant and this is the best, most effective one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have used this great product for many years now and happily recommend it to anyone, especially those who care about what chemicals they put on their skin.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>, this might actually be the perfect deodorant.</li>
            <li>My favorite deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I love that this product has no aluminum chlorohydrate, is paraben-free, does not contain propylene glycol, and is alcohol-free.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also a fan of the fact that its aluminum chlorohydrate free(which has been known in some cases to cause cancer and links to Alzheimers) and that its not tested on animals, so my cat is safe, whew.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a better choice then an antiperspirant with aluminum in it&#x27;s ingredients.</li>
            <li>Love the lavender smell too.</li>
            <li>The Thai Crystal Stick did seem to help me for the most part, except for days in which I was active.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that I knew something that worked mostly</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>It even seems to work better than the unscented.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>Smell is light and nice.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a couple of years and have not found any better.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>i put it on before Baseball practice, and need to put more on before practice is over.</li>
            <li>I ordered this one hoping the deodorant would work just as well with a better scent.</li>
            <li>Im going to order more of the patchouli and give the lavender away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and love it.</li>
            <li>After trying so many deodorants after developing a allergy I stumbled on this in a health food store out of town.  </li>
            <li>or you are able to apply it 2-3x per day.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I love it and have used it exclusively since.  </li>
            <li>Really love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>No nasty ingredients.</li>
            <li>Your body can safely sweat to release toxins, without the odor.</li>
            <li>Love this deoderant.  </li>
            <li>The lavendar scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming and is unnoticable once the deoderant dries.  </li>
            <li>The Lavender smells more like sweat</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Thai deodorant stone for many years.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for a couple of years, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Try it - you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed that the Liquid Rock had been working better, so ordered more on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works great under normal circumstances.</li>
            <li>Also seems to have a pretty good anti-perspirant effect.  </li>
            <li>I love this brand, but this is really not the greatest deodorant.</li>
            <li>A lot of natural deodorants dont work for me, but this was is great, thru workouts, stress, everything.</li>
            <li>nice deodorant, keeps me fresh all day</li>
            <li>Washes off easily.</li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them).</li>
            <li>If you think you need a strong deodorant/anti-antiperspirant, I would suggest something else.</li>
            <li>Decent price for a good product.</li>
            <li>NOT a bad product but for my body chemistry I have found better.</li>
            <li>It works fine if you work in A/C and don&#x27;t have a chance to sweat</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m fine with that.  </li>
            <li>It dries clean and clear, doesn&#x27;t mark clothes and is very effective.</li>
            <li>A great product, keeps you dry and fresh!!</li>
            <li>Our family has been aluminum free since then.</li>
            <li>This is not antiperspirant, so you will still sweat while wearing it - but it does effectively combat odor for much of the day.</li>
            <li>Organic and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>Rash free skin.</li>
            <li>The scent is extremely light</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and I never smell like a cave dweller.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the lavender smell.  </li>
            <li>My Face is a fantastic brand</li>
            <li>one million times superior to tom&#x27;s natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>More importantly, it really works!</li>
            <li>It also seems to be the most effective I&#x27;ve tried in actually eliminating odors.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is lavender, but not a perfume-y floral, but instead has a clean, herbal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many brands of natural deodorant, and none of them worked.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t always smell as good as I think it should (but not bad), and on rare occasion I do need more later in the day, but 99% of the time it is adequate.</li>
            <li>I am finding this harder to find and it is great that you have it.</li>
            <li>Sure it is free of animal cruelty, so that should make it win at least three stars, however, the dispenser is a plastic ball that rolls around on your armpit.</li>
            <li>This seems to work OK, the smell is kind of strange, not like lavender at all.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is mild and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>and it came quickly.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Patchouli scent before this one and the deodorant worked really well, but the patchouli smell was too strong for me.</li>
            <li>Depending on how much I&#x27;ve sweated on any given day, this pleasant lavender scent doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a pretty smell that I like, but It is much more natural/clean than my other deodorants which is nice, and it keeps me from smelling and getting stinky arm pits.</li>
            <li>This does a fairly good job at keeping your stink at bay, but this lavender scent smells just like your clothes when you leave them in the washer too long and then put them in the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of funny actually, because every time I would put it on, and then get dressed, I thought it was my shirt</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s a more natural alternative.</li>
            <li>It does seem to provide more dryness than Arm and Hammer natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is the only &amp;#34;eco friendly&amp;#34; brand that can effectively keep the stink off of me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and am happy I can get it for less on Amazon!</li>
            <li>where as now no one would know that I have been sweating unless they stuck their nose right into my armpit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Generally works for 24 hours or more for me.  </li>
            <li>The lavender scent is very mild, and the addition did not irritate my (sensitive) nose or skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, non-irritating for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Obviously, I bought at the low price, so I&#x27;m happy, but check on these often</li>
            <li>I wanted a safer deodorant than the main commercial brands, but I wanted them to work effectively.  </li>
            <li>First of all, all 6 bottles I received looked to be expired from what I could read on the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a terribly smelly individual</li>
            <li>I like the smell, and it works pretty well, but you have to keep applying it throughout the day if you sweat a lot like I do.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and lasting capabilities of this!</li>
            <li>But for me, this has been an outstanding product which I&#x27;ve used now for several years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be willing to bet that you&#x27;ll like this, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glen</li>
            <li>it get&#x27;s terribly hot.</li>
            <li>Hubby thinks it&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li>I like simple and healthy in my life.</li>
            <li>I love that this deodorant is all-natural with no aluminum, and it actually WORKS!  </li>
            <li>It does neutralize odors without the potential harm and side-affects of most women&#x27;s antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using this brand.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well for masking odor, but needs to be reapplied throughout the day.</li>
            <li>and the lavender smell is too musky for me when I first apply it</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t leave anything on clothes and has a pleasant subtle scent (not overpowering at all), which was a real positive change from the chemical deodorant I used to</li>
            <li>I can smell myself a little after I&#x27;ve finished exercising - but the deodorant does a good job of significantly reducing odors so even though I might be able to smell myself a little</li>
            <li>chemical free natural deodorant keeps me smelling fresh without clogging my natural sweat glands.</li>
            <li>this is amazing yet the smell is harsh at first</li>
            <li>I thought the only answer was strong antiperspirant/deodorant with aluminum in it, but that did not help at all.</li>
            <li>but Kiss My Face is the only one that keeps me good smelling all day long.</li>
            <li>and it seems to last her a good long time.  </li>
            <li>It certainly DOES NOT smell like lavender, at all.</li>
            <li>The price was pretty decent too.</li>
            <li>Just as effective as a more expensive version.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered</li>
            <li>I need to really slather it on.  </li>
            <li>Prices by the case make this a reasonable bargain</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice the lavender all that much.</li>
            <li>The plus it is much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It helps, and I know that my body isn&#x27;t absorbing all kinds of toxic.  </li>
            <li>When I use it, no matter how much I sweat, there is never an odor.  </li>
            <li>My whole family uses it and has been for years.</li>
            <li>but maybe because it made me realize I really don&#x27;t care for the smell of lavender.</li>
            <li>This deodorant has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and it does the trick, but only for a short period of time IMO.</li>
            <li>Overall, the by far my favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li>The liquid roll-on isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it&#x27;s easy enough to flap my arms like a chicken to encourage quick drying.  :)</li>
            <li>The product works better for me than any other deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I have tried so many aluminum free deodorants only to have them not work and waste a ton of money.</li>
            <li>One of few effective, high-quality natural deodorants!  </li>
            <li>The magic of salt as an assistant instead of having a waxy cover up as with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; deodorant is an extreme difference!</li>
            <li>It actually works as well as any regular deodorant I&#x27;ve used, which is to say most of the time.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really think there would be a difference between brands, but KMF is far and away the winner!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that one.</li>
            <li>I  highly recommend.</li>
            <li>if you think the price is too high.</li>
            <li>The lavender scent comes from essential oils and smells like fresh</li>
            <li>I had no problems with the new formula.  </li>
            <li>Washes off easily in the shower and doesn&#x27;t feel like like I&#x27;m coated in waterproof paint like typical products.</li>
            <li>My Face brand on a whim and was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>and I feel fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>My wife uses this pretty regularly (when she uses any deodorant at all).  </li>
            <li>I am surprised at how well!</li>
            <li>that I gave one to my pregnant daughter with the hope she will at least try to get away from chemicals while pregnant.</li>
            <li>This deodorant keeps me fresh smelling all day long!  </li>
            <li>It goes on wet and dries fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.</li>
            <li>Goes on wet but dries quickly.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this deodorant to anyone looking to get away from most commercial deodorants, or if you are a heavy sweating person like I am, and need something to stop odor, then please give Liquid Rock a shot.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but to my surprise the more natural less chemical stuff works better.</li>
            <li>This one is his favorite and it&#x27;s hard to find at all grocery stores or Target.</li>
            <li>Most of the other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; underarm products don&#x27;t keep me dry and sweet-smelling all day.</li>
            <li>All natural - no chemicals and it works well.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t completely eliminate odor</li>
            <li>and I was concerned about the chemicals, so I decided to go the natural route.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for natural deodorant for over a year.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried mainstream stuff, natural things</li>
            <li>You do still sweat but it completely cancelled out any smell.</li>
            <li>Works reasonably well the only problem is it smells like an armpit.</li>
            <li>I could be because my natural smell does not combine well with lavender or that it does not work as well as the unscented.</li>
            <li>Wonderfully natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>: Amazon changes the price on this product frequently...</li>
            <li>Even on my most active of days play sports, working out, or doing any other strenuous activity, it helps to combat the bacteria that would normally have me stinking,</li>
            <li>Right now I am back to using an aluminum-based deodorant because I&#x27;ve yet to find a decent-smelling aluminum-free one that actually lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This is a huge change from other brands, both natural and regular.</li>
            <li>, I wanted to find something similar that was strong enough to combat odor from me being active.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorants available locally, this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that actually works.</li>
            <li>I have also had more active days where I was packing to move and lifting and moving heavy boxes</li>
            <li>and generally I can&#x27;t even tell that I&#x27;m wearing it but by the end of the day I still don&#x27;t stink.  </li>
            <li>Natural deodorant that actually works.</li>
            <li>Keeps me smelling clean even after a hard day&#x27;s work.  </li>
            <li>This is the ONLY natural deodorant that actually works for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only all natural deodorant that actually works well for me.</li>
            <li>I tried several different &amp;#34;natural deodorants&amp;#34; with little success in combating odor or the bacteria that produces odor until I discovered Thai Crystal Stick.</li>
            <li>I had tried several other natural deodorant brands and while they would allow me to smell ok for a little while (ranging anywhere from say, half hour to several hours), at the end of the day I would still come home stinking.  </li>
            <li>This keeps me dry and fresh all day without skin-irritating aluminum or heavy scents.</li>
            <li>I give off scent if I laugh too hard</li>
            <li>I do live in Florida, but my other deodorants never left me feeling this way.  </li>

            <li> and I have been very pleased with the results!  </li>
            <li> used to have a scent called \\&quot;summer\\&quot; that smelled great, and worked well but don&#x27;t get this lavender scent.</li>
            <li> Does its job which is why i use this, i need to switch my deodorants and the lavender works great for me.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Great deodorant at a great price.</li>
            <li> but hey, who cares, this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li> The lavender works great for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found this product &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> The smell is great</li>
            <li> Happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and works great, but it irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Feel great using this.</li>
            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great alternative to all the chemical laden deodorants out there.  </li>
            <li> and I asked him to be honest!).</li>
            <li> Has a pleasant scent and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> Perfectly good &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; roll-on.</li>
            <li> Good protection.</li>
            <li> smells nice &amp; works great.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and it does a great job of preventing odor.</li>
            <li> I loved it but the scent often clashed with my perfume, so I decided to try the Lavender.</li>
            <li> Much superior to Weleda and rock crystal deodorants.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, and no aluminum.  </li>
            <li> It smells good</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I tried the patchouli scent roll on first and it worked excellent.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great product works great for myself and is all natural!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Liquid Rock is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as effective as before</li>
            <li> I was pleased to get so many (6) at a great price.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have used for years and it is 100% effective for odor without the aluminum and</li>
            <li> This smells so nice and is easier than a stone to take with you when traveling.  </li>
            <li> Deodomom makes an awesome natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> The best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is the best of the more natural types of underarm deodorants I&#x27;ve ever used--bar none!  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a more natural deodorant and this is the best, most effective one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have used this great product for many years now and happily recommend it to anyone, especially those who care about what chemicals they put on their skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> , this might actually be the perfect deodorant.</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I love that this product has no aluminum chlorohydrate, is paraben-free, does not contain propylene glycol, and is alcohol-free.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a fan of the fact that its aluminum chlorohydrate free(which has been known in some cases to cause cancer and links to Alzheimers) and that its not tested on animals, so my cat is safe, whew.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a better choice then an antiperspirant with aluminum in it&#x27;s ingredients.</li>
            <li> Love the lavender smell too.</li>
            <li> The Thai Crystal Stick did seem to help me for the most part, except for days in which I was active.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that I knew something that worked mostly</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> It even seems to work better than the unscented.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> Smell is light and nice.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a couple of years and have not found any better.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> i put it on before Baseball practice, and need to put more on before practice is over.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one hoping the deodorant would work just as well with a better scent.</li>
            <li> Im going to order more of the patchouli and give the lavender away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and love it.</li>
            <li> After trying so many deodorants after developing a allergy I stumbled on this in a health food store out of town.  </li>
            <li> or you are able to apply it 2-3x per day.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I love it and have used it exclusively since.  </li>
            <li> Really love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> No nasty ingredients.</li>
            <li> Your body can safely sweat to release toxins, without the odor.</li>
            <li> Love this deoderant.  </li>
            <li> The lavendar scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming and is unnoticable once the deoderant dries.  </li>
            <li> The Lavender smells more like sweat</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Thai deodorant stone for many years.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of years, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Try it - you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed that the Liquid Rock had been working better, so ordered more on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works great under normal circumstances.</li>
            <li> Also seems to have a pretty good anti-perspirant effect.  </li>
            <li> I love this brand, but this is really not the greatest deodorant.</li>
            <li> A lot of natural deodorants dont work for me, but this was is great, thru workouts, stress, everything.</li>
            <li> nice deodorant, keeps me fresh all day</li>
            <li> Washes off easily.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them).</li>
            <li> If you think you need a strong deodorant/anti-antiperspirant, I would suggest something else.</li>
            <li> Decent price for a good product.</li>
            <li> NOT a bad product but for my body chemistry I have found better.</li>
            <li> It works fine if you work in A/C and don&#x27;t have a chance to sweat</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m fine with that.  </li>
            <li> It dries clean and clear, doesn&#x27;t mark clothes and is very effective.</li>
            <li> A great product, keeps you dry and fresh!!</li>
            <li> Our family has been aluminum free since then.</li>
            <li> This is not antiperspirant, so you will still sweat while wearing it - but it does effectively combat odor for much of the day.</li>
            <li> Organic and cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Rash free skin.</li>
            <li> The scent is extremely light</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and I never smell like a cave dweller.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the lavender smell.  </li>
            <li> My Face is a fantastic brand</li>
            <li> one million times superior to tom&#x27;s natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> More importantly, it really works!</li>
            <li> It also seems to be the most effective I&#x27;ve tried in actually eliminating odors.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is lavender, but not a perfume-y floral, but instead has a clean, herbal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many brands of natural deodorant, and none of them worked.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t always smell as good as I think it should (but not bad), and on rare occasion I do need more later in the day, but 99% of the time it is adequate.</li>
            <li> I am finding this harder to find and it is great that you have it.</li>
            <li> Sure it is free of animal cruelty, so that should make it win at least three stars, however, the dispenser is a plastic ball that rolls around on your armpit.</li>
            <li> This seems to work OK, the smell is kind of strange, not like lavender at all.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is mild and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> and it came quickly.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Patchouli scent before this one and the deodorant worked really well, but the patchouli smell was too strong for me.</li>
            <li> Depending on how much I&#x27;ve sweated on any given day, this pleasant lavender scent doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a pretty smell that I like, but It is much more natural/clean than my other deodorants which is nice, and it keeps me from smelling and getting stinky arm pits.</li>
            <li> This does a fairly good job at keeping your stink at bay, but this lavender scent smells just like your clothes when you leave them in the washer too long and then put them in the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of funny actually, because every time I would put it on, and then get dressed, I thought it was my shirt</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s a more natural alternative.</li>
            <li> It does seem to provide more dryness than Arm and Hammer natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is the only &amp;#34;eco friendly&amp;#34; brand that can effectively keep the stink off of me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and am happy I can get it for less on Amazon!</li>
            <li> where as now no one would know that I have been sweating unless they stuck their nose right into my armpit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Generally works for 24 hours or more for me.  </li>
            <li> The lavender scent is very mild, and the addition did not irritate my (sensitive) nose or skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, non-irritating for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Obviously, I bought at the low price, so I&#x27;m happy, but check on these often</li>
            <li> I wanted a safer deodorant than the main commercial brands, but I wanted them to work effectively.  </li>
            <li> First of all, all 6 bottles I received looked to be expired from what I could read on the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a terribly smelly individual</li>
            <li> I like the smell, and it works pretty well, but you have to keep applying it throughout the day if you sweat a lot like I do.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and lasting capabilities of this!</li>
            <li> But for me, this has been an outstanding product which I&#x27;ve used now for several years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be willing to bet that you&#x27;ll like this, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glen</li>
            <li> it get&#x27;s terribly hot.</li>
            <li> Hubby thinks it&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li> I like simple and healthy in my life.</li>
            <li> I love that this deodorant is all-natural with no aluminum, and it actually WORKS!  </li>
            <li> It does neutralize odors without the potential harm and side-affects of most women&#x27;s antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using this brand.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well for masking odor, but needs to be reapplied throughout the day.</li>
            <li> and the lavender smell is too musky for me when I first apply it</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t leave anything on clothes and has a pleasant subtle scent (not overpowering at all), which was a real positive change from the chemical deodorant I used to</li>
            <li> I can smell myself a little after I&#x27;ve finished exercising - but the deodorant does a good job of significantly reducing odors so even though I might be able to smell myself a little</li>
            <li> chemical free natural deodorant keeps me smelling fresh without clogging my natural sweat glands.</li>
            <li> this is amazing yet the smell is harsh at first</li>
            <li> I thought the only answer was strong antiperspirant/deodorant with aluminum in it, but that did not help at all.</li>
            <li> but Kiss My Face is the only one that keeps me good smelling all day long.</li>
            <li> and it seems to last her a good long time.  </li>
            <li> It certainly DOES NOT smell like lavender, at all.</li>
            <li> The price was pretty decent too.</li>
            <li> Just as effective as a more expensive version.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered</li>
            <li> I need to really slather it on.  </li>
            <li> Prices by the case make this a reasonable bargain</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice the lavender all that much.</li>
            <li> The plus it is much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It helps, and I know that my body isn&#x27;t absorbing all kinds of toxic.  </li>
            <li> When I use it, no matter how much I sweat, there is never an odor.  </li>
            <li> My whole family uses it and has been for years.</li>
            <li> but maybe because it made me realize I really don&#x27;t care for the smell of lavender.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and it does the trick, but only for a short period of time IMO.</li>
            <li> Overall, the by far my favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li> The liquid roll-on isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it&#x27;s easy enough to flap my arms like a chicken to encourage quick drying.  :)</li>
            <li> The product works better for me than any other deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I have tried so many aluminum free deodorants only to have them not work and waste a ton of money.</li>
            <li> One of few effective, high-quality natural deodorants!  </li>
            <li> The magic of salt as an assistant instead of having a waxy cover up as with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; deodorant is an extreme difference!</li>
            <li> It actually works as well as any regular deodorant I&#x27;ve used, which is to say most of the time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really think there would be a difference between brands, but KMF is far and away the winner!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that one.</li>
            <li> I  highly recommend.</li>
            <li> if you think the price is too high.</li>
            <li> The lavender scent comes from essential oils and smells like fresh</li>
            <li> I had no problems with the new formula.  </li>
            <li> Washes off easily in the shower and doesn&#x27;t feel like like I&#x27;m coated in waterproof paint like typical products.</li>
            <li> My Face brand on a whim and was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> and I feel fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this pretty regularly (when she uses any deodorant at all).  </li>
            <li> I am surprised at how well!</li>
            <li> that I gave one to my pregnant daughter with the hope she will at least try to get away from chemicals while pregnant.</li>
            <li> This deodorant keeps me fresh smelling all day long!  </li>
            <li> It goes on wet and dries fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.</li>
            <li> Goes on wet but dries quickly.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this deodorant to anyone looking to get away from most commercial deodorants, or if you are a heavy sweating person like I am, and need something to stop odor, then please give Liquid Rock a shot.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but to my surprise the more natural less chemical stuff works better.</li>
            <li> This one is his favorite and it&#x27;s hard to find at all grocery stores or Target.</li>
            <li> Most of the other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; underarm products don&#x27;t keep me dry and sweet-smelling all day.</li>
            <li> All natural - no chemicals and it works well.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t completely eliminate odor</li>
            <li> and I was concerned about the chemicals, so I decided to go the natural route.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for natural deodorant for over a year.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried mainstream stuff, natural things</li>
            <li> You do still sweat but it completely cancelled out any smell.</li>
            <li> Works reasonably well the only problem is it smells like an armpit.</li>
            <li> I could be because my natural smell does not combine well with lavender or that it does not work as well as the unscented.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> : Amazon changes the price on this product frequently...</li>
            <li> Even on my most active of days play sports, working out, or doing any other strenuous activity, it helps to combat the bacteria that would normally have me stinking,</li>
            <li> Right now I am back to using an aluminum-based deodorant because I&#x27;ve yet to find a decent-smelling aluminum-free one that actually lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This is a huge change from other brands, both natural and regular.</li>
            <li> , I wanted to find something similar that was strong enough to combat odor from me being active.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorants available locally, this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that actually works.</li>
            <li> I have also had more active days where I was packing to move and lifting and moving heavy boxes</li>
            <li> and generally I can&#x27;t even tell that I&#x27;m wearing it but by the end of the day I still don&#x27;t stink.  </li>
            <li> Natural deodorant that actually works.</li>
            <li> Keeps me smelling clean even after a hard day&#x27;s work.  </li>
            <li> This is the ONLY natural deodorant that actually works for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only all natural deodorant that actually works well for me.</li>
            <li> I tried several different &amp;#34;natural deodorants&amp;#34; with little success in combating odor or the bacteria that produces odor until I discovered Thai Crystal Stick.</li>
            <li> I had tried several other natural deodorant brands and while they would allow me to smell ok for a little while (ranging anywhere from say, half hour to several hours), at the end of the day I would still come home stinking.  </li>
            <li> This keeps me dry and fresh all day without skin-irritating aluminum or heavy scents.</li>
            <li> I give off scent if I laugh too hard</li>
            <li> I do live in Florida, but my other deodorants never left me feeling this way.  </li>
            <li> For a long time I used an extra strength deodorant that had extra chemicals.</li>
            <li> so I temporarily switched back to the old Dove deodorant I used previously.  </li>
            <li> I have had absolutely no problem with sores or rashes and have been using this for several months.  </li>
            <li> My local health food store closed that carried it</li>
            <li> Keeps me protected all day long.  </li>
            <li> Other deoderants didn&#x27;t work for me when I wanted to switch from a traditional anti-perspirant.  </li>
            <li> Liquid Rock keeps me dry and odor-free for 8-10 hours.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like the roll-on application (waiting for it to dry, or blow-drying my armpits -ha</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this product, but hated the cost at local stores.</li>
            <li> It does help to cut down on stinky feet smell though does not eliminate it entirely.</li>
            <li> Only half our shop is air conditioned so in the summer</li>
            <li> I checked in early September and a case of six was going for around $35, comparable to local health stores; by late September, they were down to $18.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is a little different; your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> Also, the smell of the deodorant is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I started to develop a rash under my arms due to using commercial deodorants.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a serious sweat or BO problem, so this deodorant is sufficient for my daily regular use.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> After doing some research on other options, I found this</li>
            <li> I usually have purchased this at my local organic coop but couldn&#x27;t pass up this case price savings of almost 50%&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I got this product based on other people&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li> It is not an overpowering scent either as with some other deodorants.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was pretty skeptical as to whether this would work or not.</li>
            <li> This does take a little while to dry, but again, not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, because it&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, other deodorants I&#x27;ve tried typically give me a rash after using them for a while.</li>
            <li> One word of caution - if you take this on a plane, and have it upside down, the pressure change can cause it to leak everywhere.</li>
            <li> so I tried a few other brands that didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Half the cost of the health food store price.</li>
            <li> But I had the same experience with regular deodorants too, so, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, this stuff is just as good as the regular stuff, minus the awful chemicals and the crazy artificial scents.</li>
            <li> The scent was a little off putting</li>
            <li> shattering into a 1000 pieces on the floor like I have had a few times with the Thai Crystal Stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I originally started buying this because I had trouble with the aluminum in other deodorants causing very painful sores and rashes.  </li>
            <li> This flavor doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well and actually stinks less than halfway through the day.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help much after you&#x27;re already smelling bad.  </li>
            <li> I am never sure it is working like the unscented.  </li>
            <li> They mainly just did a bad job of mixing my body odor with a powder or floral scent.  </li>
            <li> The lavender is very subtle, and really is not noticeable after application.</li>
            <li> This deodorant actually smells quite disgusting - and doesn&#x27;t really do anything to keep you from perspiring or neutralizing the odor.</li>
            <li> I definitely get smelly when I sweat, but I hate the thought of using regular deodorant with all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> By that I mean, by the end of most days I don&#x27;t stink horribly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain.</li>
            <li> if you are someone like me who sweats like a pig, you will need to re apply at least once.</li>
            <li> I hate to rely on the brands with all the tumor-inducing ingredients, so I&#x27;m very grateful for Kiss My Face.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that this works at all!</li>
            <li> I used to get bad B.O. especially in the summer.</li>
            <li> after a few hours I was sweating like crazy, regardless of the season (I&#x27;ve used it for almost a year now on and off).</li>
            <li> The bad thing is there is a sharp point on the roller that hurts every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this works about as poorly as Tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but have not experienced any odor using this.  </li>
            <li> , only the ink is cold, runny perfume that smells awful.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad bottle.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and have never been disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just disappointed the pack of 6 went up by $10.</li>
            <li> But keep in mind that it isn&#x27;t a cover-up scent, and you&#x27;ll be disappointed if you use it that way.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this product since 1997 in order to stay away from Aluminum.  Aluminum is linked to Alzheimers and when my father in law died we decided to look for a product that will protect us from BO without the aluminum. Our family has been aluminum free since then.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this product. First of all, all 6 bottles I received looked to be expired from what I could read on the bottom of the bottle. Tried it anyway and (perhaps its because it was expired?) after a few hours I was sweating like crazy, regardless of the season (I&#x27;ve used it for almost a year now on and off). It has a nice smell and it does the trick, but only for a short period of time IMO. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This does a fairly good job at keeping your stink at bay, but this lavender scent smells just like your clothes when you leave them in the washer too long and then put them in the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of funny actually, because every time I would put it on, and then get dressed, I thought it was my shirt that smelled bad.&lt;br /&gt;They used to have a scent called \\&quot;summer\\&quot; that smelled great, and worked well but don&#x27;t get this lavender scent.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. This is the ONLY natural deodorant that actually works for me. The others didn&#x27;t work at all, or only worked for an hour or two. Liquid Rock keeps me dry and odor-free for 8-10 hours. The fragrance is mild and not overpowering. I&#x27;ve found that I have to use a lot of it, though. If I put on just one coat of it, it doesn&#x27;t work. I need to really slather it on.  Other than that, this might actually be the perfect deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and am happy I can get it for less on Amazon! This keeps me dry and fresh all day without skin-irritating aluminum or heavy scents.</li>
            <li> All natural - no chemicals and it works well.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered a batch of Kiss My Face deodorant. It&#x27;s the only deodorant that doesn&#x27;t give my husband a rash. Obviously, we&#x27;ll continue to purchase this item!</li>
            <li> For a long time I used an extra strength deodorant that had extra chemicals. It didn&#x27;t completely eliminate odor and I was concerned about the chemicals, so I decided to go the natural route. I tried a couple different brands (rock, spray, etc...) and they didn&#x27;t work that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Kiss My Face brand on a whim and was pleasantly surprised! I didn&#x27;t really think there would be a difference between brands, but KMF is far and away the winner! Even after a sweaty day of hiking there was no odor! This is a huge change from other brands, both natural and regular. It also doesn&#x27;t leave anything on clothes and has a pleasant subtle scent (not overpowering at all), which was a real positive change from the chemical deodorant I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it does not control wetness. But I figure, aren&#x27;t we made to sweat for a reason?</li>
            <li> Perfectly good &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; roll-on. It goes on wet and dries fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes. There are times though when I need an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant.  It does not leave a mark on clothing.  This is not antiperspirant, so you will still sweat while wearing it - but it does effectively combat odor for much of the day. I can smell myself a little after I&#x27;ve finished exercising - but the deodorant does a good job of significantly reducing odors so even though I might be able to smell myself a little, I don&#x27;t think that others can.  I&#x27;m not a terribly smelly individual but I can definitely tell a difference if I forget to put it on.  I love that this product has no aluminum chlorohydrate, is paraben-free, does not contain propylene glycol, and is alcohol-free.  The lavender scent comes from essential oils and smells like fresh lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also use it on smelly shoe soles.  It does help to cut down on stinky feet smell though does not eliminate it entirely.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for natural deodorant for over a year.  This is the third one I tried.  Eh.  I had to reapply in the middle of the day.  Deodomom makes an awesome natural deodorant.  I highly recommend that one.</li>
            <li> Does its job which is why i use this, i need to switch my deodorants and the lavender works great for me.</li>
            <li> I am finding this harder to find and it is great that you have it. We have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I have used this great product for many years now and happily recommend it to anyone, especially those who care about what chemicals they put on their skin.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works well. Good protection. Organic and cruelty free. Rash free skin. Would definitely buy it again. The price was pretty decent too.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, other deodorants I&#x27;ve tried typically give me a rash after using them for a while. This one does not. It also seems to be the most effective I&#x27;ve tried in actually eliminating odors. The lavender is very subtle, and really is not noticeable after application. One word of caution - if you take this on a plane, and have it upside down, the pressure change can cause it to leak everywhere. Overall, the by far my favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li> I used to get bad B.O. especially in the summer. It smelled like a skunk got ran over or a burning tire. I thought the only answer was strong antiperspirant/deodorant with aluminum in it, but that did not help at all. I decided to try Kiss My Face lavender deodorant,  because a friend who had a similar skunk smell problem recommended it. I was skeptical at first, but to my surprise the more natural less chemical stuff works better. I have been using for about a year now and skunk smell has never come back.</li>
            <li> I originally started buying this because I had trouble with the aluminum in other deodorants causing very painful sores and rashes.  I had tried several other natural deodorant brands and while they would allow me to smell ok for a little while (ranging anywhere from say, half hour to several hours), at the end of the day I would still come home stinking.  This bothered me because I was not doing anything overly strenuous or even sweating a lot, but I could still smell myself.  After doing some research on other options, I found this and I have been very pleased with the results!  The scent is extremely light and generally I can&#x27;t even tell that I&#x27;m wearing it but by the end of the day I still don&#x27;t stink.  The greatest part is- I have had absolutely no problem with sores or rashes and have been using this for several months.  I can even put this on after shaving and there is no irritation or stinging.  I have also had more active days where I was packing to move and lifting and moving heavy boxes and I still don&#x27;t stink.  I love this stuff and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Only thing I will buy for my family to use.  A great product, keeps you dry and fresh!!</li>
            <li> Great deodorant at a great price.I have been using this product in lavender and patchouli for years.I usually have purchased this at my local organic coop but couldn&#x27;t pass up this case price savings of almost 50%&lt;br /&gt;This chemical free natural deodorant keeps me smelling fresh without clogging my natural sweat glands.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, and it works pretty well, but you have to keep applying it throughout the day if you sweat a lot like I do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love it.  At 6&#x27;1 and 180 lbs. I endure some ridicule about using a lavender scented roll on but hey, who cares, this stuff is great.  No smells, no worries, and I work a physically demanding job inside and am subjected to all kinds of heat...but this product does its&#x27; job.  I&#x27;m also a fan of the fact that its aluminum chlorohydrate free(which has been known in some cases to cause cancer and links to Alzheimers) and that its not tested on animals, so my cat is safe, whew.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that this works at all! I&#x27;ve given it several months, and still feel a little...clammy and stinky mid-afternoon. I do live in Florida, but my other deodorants never left me feeling this way.  Will be trying something else next time.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I&#x27;ll ever use again. It smells fantastic and I never smell like a cave dweller. The magic of salt as an assistant instead of having a waxy cover up as with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; deodorant is an extreme difference!</li>
            <li> I sweat and I smell.  I wanted a safer deodorant than the main commercial brands, but I wanted them to work effectively.  I have a bunch in the bathroom drawer that just didn&#x27;t work.  I would use them and smell a short time later.  This deodorant keeps me fresh smelling all day long!  It&#x27;s a miracle product and I will never need anything else.  This is my 2nd time buying the big 6-pack and I was concerned because some people mentioned the formula had changed.  I had no problems with the new formula.  It&#x27;s just as effective as before and I&#x27;ve had no side effects from using it.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely great product works great for myself and is all natural!!!! I love the smell and lasting capabilities of this!</li>
            <li> The Best - My son told me about this and I would never use anything else now that I have tried it.</li>
            <li> nice deodorant, keeps me fresh all day</li>
            <li> This deodorant is the best of the more natural types of underarm deodorants I&#x27;ve ever used--bar none!  Of course, everyone&#x27;s skin surface bacteria level may be different so different results are possible.  But for me, this has been an outstanding product which I&#x27;ve used now for several years.  Prices by the case make this a reasonable bargain so grab some while you can and give them a try.  I&#x27;d be willing to bet that you&#x27;ll like this, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glen</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I was looking for a better choice then an antiperspirant with aluminum in it&#x27;s ingredients. This is a liquid rock, or salt based roll on. The fragrance is lavender, but not a perfume-y floral, but instead has a clean, herbal. More importantly, it really works! It dries clean and clear, doesn&#x27;t mark clothes and is very effective. I have been using this product for years and have never been disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Let me tell you, my pH is aggressively masculine--virile even. I give off scent if I laugh too hard but this stuff lasts me ALL day. I&#x27;ve tried mainstream stuff, natural things but Kiss My Face is the only one that keeps me good smelling all day long. My partner uses the non-scented one. Show-off. The lavender works great for me.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a more natural deodorant and this is the best, most effective one I&#x27;ve used. Love the lavender smell too. It&#x27;s a bonus.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I started to develop a rash under my arms due to using commercial deodorants. After doing several different tests, I found that no matter which brand of deodorant that I used, I would get a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sent me on a path to discover alternative means and methods for fighting odor from sweating. I tried several different &amp;#34;natural deodorants&amp;#34; with little success in combating odor or the bacteria that produces odor until I discovered Thai Crystal Stick. The Thai Crystal Stick did seem to help me for the most part, except for days in which I was active.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I knew something that worked mostly, I wanted to find something similar that was strong enough to combat odor from me being active. This led me to try Kiss My Face Liquid Rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liquid Rock is the roll-on version of the Thai Crystal Stick. It is easier to apply, and if I drop it, i don&#x27;t have to worry about it shattering into a 1000 pieces on the floor like I have had a few times with the Thai Crystal Stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liquid Rock is simply amazing. Even on my most active of days play sports, working out, or doing any other strenuous activity, it helps to combat the bacteria that would normally have me stinking, where as now no one would know that I have been sweating unless they stuck their nose right into my armpit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this deodorant to anyone looking to get away from most commercial deodorants, or if you are a heavy sweating person like I am, and need something to stop odor, then please give Liquid Rock a shot. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I work in a factory. Only half our shop is air conditioned so in the summer it get&#x27;s terribly hot. I have tried so many aluminum free deodorants only to have them not work and waste a ton of money. This one finally works!!! Hubby thinks it&#x27;s funny cause I&#x27;m always sticking my nose in my shirt and saying \\&quot;it works! I don&#x27;t stink!\\&quot;  I&#x27;m so happy to have found this product &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> Sure it is free of animal cruelty, so that should make it win at least three stars, however, the dispenser is a plastic ball that rolls around on your armpit. This ball acts like a giant liquid ball point pen, only the ink is cold, runny perfume that smells awful.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did. The lavender scent is very mild, and the addition did not irritate my (sensitive) nose or skin. It even seems to work better than the unscented.&lt;br /&gt;Does not stain clothes.</li>
            <li> if you are someone like me who sweats like a pig, you will need to re apply at least once. smells nice &amp; works great.</li>
            <li> Searched forever for a deodorant that works and never found one. I&#x27;ve probably tried anything you could buy, or maybe out just feels like it. This stuff works! Smell is light and nice. Dries and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. Washes off easily. I&#x27;ll never buy anything else again!</li>
            <li> I care about my health. I read about this product, but couldn&#x27;t find it in a brick and mortar store...but did here. I like simple and healthy in my life.</li>
            <li> This is the best non aluminum deodorant I have found. The smell is nice and it does a great job of preventing odor. I have been using it for a couple of years and have not found any better.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My local health food store closed that carried it so I tried a few other brands that didn&#x27;t work as well. I was pleased to get so many (6) at a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorants available locally, this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that actually works. It doesn&#x27;t always smell as good as I think it should (but not bad), and on rare occasion I do need more later in the day, but 99% of the time it is adequate. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year.</li>
            <li> i put it on before Baseball practice, and need to put more on before practice is over.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great under normal circumstances. I don&#x27;t find it working well when I get stress sweat or it&#x27;s over 80 degrees outside. The smell is great and I like that it&#x27;s a more natural alternative. It does seem to provide more dryness than Arm and Hammer natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Patchouli scent before this one and the deodorant worked really well, but the patchouli smell was too strong for me. I ordered this one hoping the deodorant would work just as well with a better scent. Unfortunately, this works about as poorly as Tom&#x27;s. Bummer. Right now I am back to using an aluminum-based deodorant because I&#x27;ve yet to find a decent-smelling aluminum-free one that actually lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a pretty smell that I like, but It is much more natural/clean than my other deodorants which is nice, and it keeps me from smelling and getting stinky arm pits.</li>
            <li> Happy with this product.  Just disappointed the pack of 6 went up by $10. May switch brands</li>
            <li> I tried the patchouli scent roll on first and it worked excellent. You do still sweat but it completely cancelled out any smell. I loved it but the scent often clashed with my perfume, so I decided to try the Lavender. This does not have a scent at all and it doesnt cover up any possible body smell. So, I am now stuck with six bottles of this. Im going to order more of the patchouli and give the lavender away.</li>
            <li> For me, this is the best deodorant product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Keeps me smelling clean even after a hard day&#x27;s work.  But keep in mind that it isn&#x27;t a cover-up scent, and you&#x27;ll be disappointed if you use it that way.  Apply liberally immediately after toweling off from a shower for all day stink protection.  Generally works for 24 hours or more for me.  Doesn&#x27;t help much after you&#x27;re already smelling bad.  Also seems to have a pretty good anti-perspirant effect.  Washes off easily in the shower and doesn&#x27;t feel like like I&#x27;m coated in waterproof paint like typical products.</li>
            <li> The best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. Much superior to Weleda and rock crystal deodorants. I&#x27;m on my second box of six bottles.</li>
            <li> this is amazing yet the smell is harsh at first but it eliminates odor. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and love it. Has no reaction to my skin.</li>
            <li> Works reasonably well the only problem is it smells like an armpit. I don&#x27;t notice the lavender all that much.</li>
            <li> I love this brand, but this is really not the greatest deodorant. I picked it up because of the ingredients. I don&#x27;t have a serious sweat or BO problem, so this deodorant is sufficient for my daily regular use. By that I mean, by the end of most days I don&#x27;t stink horribly. Everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is a little different; your mileage may vary. If you think you need a strong deodorant/anti-antiperspirant, I would suggest something else. Also, the smell of the deodorant is not what I expected. I was hoping for lots of lavender smell, but as someone else mentioned in a review, there is a bit of an underlying armpit/melted plastic funk already present in the deodorant... It&#x27;s hard to explain. I&#x27;m on the fence about whether I will buy it again. Looks like I&#x27;ve got a while to decide now that I have six bottles...</li>
            <li> After trying so many deodorants after developing a allergy I stumbled on this in a health food store out of town.  Has a pleasant scent and lasts all day.  The best part no rash.  The plus it is much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> for some reason, my husband has a topical reaction to everything from Toms of Maine, but this Kiss My Face product provides him with the odor protection he requires, without the aluminum-ingredients in anti-persperant.  This one is his favorite and it&#x27;s hard to find at all grocery stores or Target.</li>
            <li> This product does not work for me. I also do not like the smell &amp; it drips out of the roller as it is being applied. Maybe I just got a bad bottle.</li>
            <li> It works fine if you work in A/C and don&#x27;t have a chance to sweat or you are able to apply it 2-3x per day. NOT a bad product but for my body chemistry I have found better.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works great, but it irritated my skin. I was very disappointed, because it&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li> Decent price for a good product.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant.  I&#x27;ve tried many, many brands of natural deodorant, and none of them worked.  They mainly just did a bad job of mixing my body odor with a powder or floral scent.  Then my mom recommended this brand.  I love it and have used it exclusively since.  Keeps me protected all day long.  I  highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This seems to work OK, the smell is kind of strange, not like lavender at all.  The bad thing is there is a sharp point on the roller that hurts every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff.  My husband and I have used for years and it is 100% effective for odor without the aluminum and whatever else is in commercial deodorants.  Feel great using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 3oz, carry on compliant. Doesn&#x27;t stain clothes. No nasty ingredients. Unisex scent (if you feel like sharing with your spouse). Half the cost of the health food store price.</li>
            <li> I prefer the unscented.  I like no-scent coming out from under my arms, so to me the lavender notes that I smell when I raise my arm confuse me.  I am never sure it is working like the unscented.  I could be because my natural smell does not combine well with lavender or that it does not work as well as the unscented.</li>
            <li> one million times superior to tom&#x27;s natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Its great! Goes on wet but dries quickly. Works well, no smell! LOL</li>
            <li> I am trying to get away from the use of chemicals.  I like this enough that I gave one to my pregnant daughter with the hope she will at least try to get away from chemicals while pregnant.</li>
            <li> One of few effective, high-quality natural deodorants!  Easy to use, non-irritating for my sensitive skin.  I enjoy the lavender smell.  Depending on how much I&#x27;ve sweated on any given day, this pleasant lavender scent doesn&#x27;t last.  But I&#x27;m fine with that.  It helps, and I know that my body isn&#x27;t absorbing all kinds of toxic.  This does take a little while to dry, but again, not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> I love that this deodorant is all-natural with no aluminum, and it actually WORKS!  It does neutralize odors without the potential harm and side-affects of most women&#x27;s antiperspirants.  It will not keep all wetness away, but you won&#x27;t have the odors from it.  Your body can safely sweat to release toxins, without the odor.</li>
            <li> Love this deoderant.  Other deoderants didn&#x27;t work for me when I wanted to switch from a traditional anti-perspirant.  This does though.  The lavendar scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming and is unnoticable once the deoderant dries.  The liquid roll-on isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it&#x27;s easy enough to flap my arms like a chicken to encourage quick drying.  :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only all natural deodorant that actually works well for me.</li>
            <li> I got this product based on other people&#x27;s reviews. This deodorant actually smells quite disgusting - and doesn&#x27;t really do anything to keep you from perspiring or neutralizing the odor. The Lavender smells more like sweat so I wouldn&#x27;t bother ordering this.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve used Thai deodorant stone for many years.  This smells so nice and is easier than a stone to take with you when traveling.  If you have never used this type of deodorant you should try it. When I use it, no matter how much I sweat, there is never an odor.  It is not an overpowering scent either as with some other deodorants. The product works to control body odor, not the scent. That is just for you.</li>
            <li> Natural deodorant that actually works. My whole family uses it and has been for years.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this brand. Just as effective as a more expensive version.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered the six-pack and it came quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of years, and I love it. I definitely get smelly when I sweat, but I hate the thought of using regular deodorant with all the chemicals. This stuff is absolutely the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them). It actually works as well as any regular deodorant I&#x27;ve used, which is to say most of the time. Not always; there are times when, for whatever reason, I find myself smelling like BO even when I wear this. But I had the same experience with regular deodorants too, so, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, this stuff is just as good as the regular stuff, minus the awful chemicals and the crazy artificial scents.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well for masking odor, but needs to be reapplied throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is the only &amp;#34;eco friendly&amp;#34; brand that can effectively keep the stink off of me. I hate to rely on the brands with all the tumor-inducing ingredients, so I&#x27;m very grateful for Kiss My Face.</li>
            <li> This was a a great value, and this deodorant lasts all day!  A lot of natural deodorants dont work for me, but this was is great, thru workouts, stress, everything.</li>
            <li> It took several months for my husband and I to transition to using Kiss My Face Liquid Rock Deodorant, but we would never go back.  We did have some body odor for about 3-6 months, but I like to blame that on toxins from our prior deodorant/anti-perspirant needing time to leach out of our bodies.  We are both now odor-free and do not suffer froam any of the underarm rashes we would get before.  Try it - you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I recommend the patchouli variety of this brand&#x27;s line of roll-ons.  This flavor doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well and actually stinks less than halfway through the day.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant.  I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I used this deodorant for a year or so and then the store where I was purchasing it stopped carrying it...so I temporarily switched back to the old Dove deodorant I used previously.  I immediately noticed that the Liquid Rock had been working better, so ordered more on Amazon.  Works great!  I would give it 5 stars but I don&#x27;t like the roll-on application (waiting for it to dry, or blow-drying my armpits -ha ha), and the lavender smell is too musky for me when I first apply it (though when it dries, you can&#x27;t smell it at all). Good stuff, and no aluminum.  The Kiss My Face stick doesn&#x27;t ward off odor as well.</li>
            <li> Most of the other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; underarm products don&#x27;t keep me dry and sweet-smelling all day. This one does!</li>
            <li> Wonderfully natural deodorant. It smells good and I feel fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this product, but hated the cost at local stores. The product works better for me than any other deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Amazon changes the price on this product frequently... I checked in early September and a case of six was going for around $35, comparable to local health stores; by late September, they were down to $18. Obviously, I bought at the low price, so I&#x27;m happy, but check on these often if you think the price is too high.</li>
            <li> What an improvement compared to Tom of Maines!!!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this pretty regularly (when she uses any deodorant at all).  It&#x27;s a great alternative to all the chemical laden deodorants out there.  She always likes me to get the Kiss My Face brand, and it seems to last her a good long time.  Kiss My Face is a fantastic brand and I have been using their toothpaste as well for close to a decade now.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was pretty skeptical as to whether this would work or not. It does! I am surprised at how well! It certainly DOES NOT smell like lavender, at all. However, the smell does go away after a couple of minutes and it ends up almost scentless throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It was alright. The scent was a little off putting but maybe because it made me realize I really don&#x27;t care for the smell of lavender.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has worked very well for me. My goal was to discontinue using traditional antiperspirants because of the aluminum.  I was skeptical but have not experienced any odor using this.  It is not an antiperspirant and so you may experience dampness but I have not found the dampness associated with any odor (nor has my husband - and I asked him to be honest!).</li>
