            <li>and it&#x27;s great aromatherapy.</li>
            <li>works great with the oils...</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I combine lemon and peppermint for a delicious refreshing scent all day.</li>
            <li>ahhh nice!</li>
            <li>I used grapefruit to control my appetite and it honestly worked!</li>
            <li>I loved the design of the necklace and it worked great as an eos defuser.  </li>
            <li>and she loved them.  </li>
            <li>GOOD</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good quality heavy/sturdy necklace.</li>
            <li>This necklace is absolutely gorgeous .</li>
            <li>Gave one to a friend &amp; my daughter both loved them too.</li>
            <li>I also bought one as a bridal shower gift for a friend, and she had good things to say, although I think she sort of started to forget to use it after a while.</li>
            <li>It is really beautiful, and it is easy to change the inserts!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute and it does what it should!</li>
            <li>Absolutely  love this necklace amazing quality !</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>a pewter like finish, so it is a bit clunky looking to wear with nice clothes; one&#x27;s own taste...</li>
            <li>I like  oils; so it seems a nice way to \\&quot;carry it with me\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I wish that it had opened from the bottom, but over all it is an nice piece of jewelry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get nice whiffs throughout the morning</li>
            <li>It holds the pad nicely and provides nice scent</li>
            <li>and the chain is so nice....</li>
            <li>I hear she never takes it off, and is thrilled to have her own diffuser necklace.</li>
            <li>I would have liked it in gold more as I don&#x27;t wear silver .</li>
            <li>Cute and effective.</li>
            <li>Having a beautiful smell around your neck all day is so pleasant, especially in our toxic world.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lock into place, but it feels very secure.</li>
            <li>This is my FAVORITE of all of Nature&#x27;s Alchemy diffuser pendants, specifically for the hinged design.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I love the locket part.</li>
            <li>I love this necklace.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pendant itself seems OK.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this necklace...</li>
            <li>But, oh well. :)</li>
            <li>I use my oils on it and the aroma lasts for many hours.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, I put the diffuser on a different chain and it worked great!</li>
            <li>The chain could be of better quality and one or two inches longer.</li>
            <li>and I am sure it will be worn often.</li>
            <li>There are better versions out there.</li>
            <li>Wonderful idea to  be able to inhale your favorite essential oil whenever and as often as you like.</li>
            <li>I was able to wear the locket for one day before the pin fell out.</li>
            <li>But for what it&#x27;s made for, it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I make and repair my own jewelry, so I won&#x27;t bother to return</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful, well-made necklace that comes with tiny absorbant pads to hold the oil inside the pendant.  </li>
            <li>Pendant works fine as a diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I can just reach for the heart and take a quick whiff to rejuvenate me!</li>
            <li>The pads for oil work great to hold the scent for several days.</li>
            <li>Works great but the chain and locket are slightly different colors.</li>
            <li>Overall this is great.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy wearing this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique and who doesn&#x27;t like aromatherapy???</li>
            <li>Peppermint, jasmine or sweet orange..</li>
            <li>It is a little more \\&quot;rustic\\&quot; than it appears in the picture but still a good value</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally wear silver jewelry, but I love this necklace.</li>
            <li>This locket allows for a good amount of scent, but it keeps the oils from turning for a long time.</li>
            <li>Necklace is well made, very durable, and easy to put the eo on the pads.  </li>
            <li>I use Doterra EO&#x27;s with this and the scent pads can last up to one week or more!</li>
            <li>so the smell would waft up to me and keep me calm throughout the test.</li>
            <li>Worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>just the right size..</li>
            <li>This is a great gift idea, especially with the oils as well--great for that female that you never know what to get for her!  </li>
            <li>It goes great with casual t-shirts or slightly more dressy &amp;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, cheap as expected</li>
            <li>Recipient enjoys it very much.</li>
            <li>I am using my necklace for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for my daughters and they love using the essential oils to wear around their necks.  </li>
            <li>This diffuser necklace works pretty well.</li>
            <li>This has a nice quality metal heart and the locket stays closed</li>
            <li>I love that you can just open the locket while still on the chain to refill or change the scent pad.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty and just the right size for my 12 year old to wear.  </li>
            <li>It helps keep me positive and focused.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not particularly aesthetically appealing or my style of necklace.</li>
            <li>Nice quality, easy to open, heavy quality of chain.</li>
            <li>It comes just as it looks, and it ships fast.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it doesn&#x27;t really go with a lot of outfits her</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s prettier, holds just as much scent, and you can fill the locket up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really needed it for vacation and now don&#x27;t have time to return it or order pads.</li>
            <li>Feels a little bit light (cheap) but seems to be decent.</li>
            <li>In fact, this works better than any other scent wearable</li>
            <li>I replaced the chain and as long as a layer with some other spookier necklaces more in line with my aesthetic, it looks fine.</li>
            <li>Inside I use nice scraps of fabric, usually in a contrasting color.</li>
            <li>each kind of oil that I have used on the little tabs inside, seem to last very well as I wear this..  </li>
            <li>I got this as a gift for my 9 year old niece, and she absolutely adored it.</li>
            <li>I used my first one so much that I finally wore the plating off of it -</li>
            <li>I have to stick my nose right up against the locket for the metal smell to be noticeable; it&#x27;s not enough to change the scent of the oil you put inside it.</li>
            <li>The locket itself has surprising heft--I was afraid it would be flimsy, but it&#x27;s actually rather heavy for the size, pleasantly so.</li>
            <li>it is over 6 years old - and I am still using it!    </li>
            <li>Pendant was pretty but my chain broke only after about a month.</li>
            <li>This was my 2nd choice pendant after my 1st choice was backordered and cancelled by original seller-this is alternate seller.</li>
            <li>It stays closed well, but is still easy to open so you can change out the pads.</li>
            <li>It has a hinge that makes it a little easier to use than the others that have to be fit together.</li>
            <li>But this is very lightweight and I actually forgot I had it on.</li>
            <li>I am really bummed that the chain broke after only wearing it for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>and I wear it nearly every day.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the easiest of the Nature&#x27;s Alchemy necklaces to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried in this price range so far.</li>
            <li>Gave it to my 5 year old to wear since it can&#x27;t be used as a diffuser anymore.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this necklace to anyone who used essential oils.  </li>
            <li>It is a great idea in theory, but the design of the heart pendant is very flawed.</li>
            <li>Cheap, clumsy construction.  </li>
            <li>By the afternoon, I don&#x27;t notice it so much, but I feel it definitely lasts longer than if I were to simply put essential oils on as a perfume.</li>
            <li>The only problem I had was the chain had a 2 small defects (more like kinks, looks like it wasn&#x27;t put together properly), but I can always put it on a different one.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it, as it&#x27;s affordable and definitely helpful and useful if you&#x27;re a big fan of using essential oils in your everyday life.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried that it would be too large for her</li>

            <li> I would recommend it, as it&#x27;s affordable and definitely helpful and useful if you&#x27;re a big fan of using essential oils in your everyday life.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that it would be too large for her</li>
            <li> it comes w/a starter set of scent pads that you put 1 or 2 drops of essential oil and as long as you have this next to your skin your body heat activates the essential oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty hard on my things, so I appreciate that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pads last for a really long time and they give you plenty to start out with.</li>
            <li> You can re-use the scent pad (as long as it is the same scent) for a long time before having to replace it.    </li>
            <li> I have ordered these other designs and sent them all back.    </li>
            <li> I put 5 drops of essential oil on the pad and it seems to last for a few days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear it every single day, so I haven&#x27;t had to re-order any pads yet.</li>
            <li> When I put just 6 drops of essential oil on the pad, then wore the necklace, the EO dripped and ran down the inside of the pendant, then dripped off the hinge onto my shirt.</li>
            <li> It also has a black stain (as if someone spilled oil on it a while ago) at the back.</li>
            <li> It left several small spots of oil that would not wash out.</li>
            <li> I find that the scent lasts for a few hours, but I definitely have to re-oil the pad during the day.</li>
            <li> There is no secure closure (closes using the necklace strand only) therefore the oil soaked pad falls out and stains everything.</li>
            <li> All right, yes: the chain is nearly useless and the locket is more &amp;#34;rustic&amp;#34; than you think from the picture--it&#x27;s a heart with little hearts stamped into it--and there is a very faint metallic smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All the other designs are not hinged, but are two separate pieces that seat together with a pin on the bottom or side.</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of necklaces, I usually take them off before the work day is over because I don&#x27;t like things aon my neck.</li>
            <li> She is hard to buy for each year, but last year I got her a zen garden and fen shuy kit</li>
            <li> Comes open easily,  hard to close.</li>
            <li> The metal is dark and not as shiny as pictured.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this one, it&#x27;s not worth the aggravation.</li>
            <li> and I found that sniffing lavender calmed me down a bit.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this necklace for young kids ~ it is too difficult to fill with oil.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was too heavy on the grapefruit oil and used 2 drops.</li>
            <li> It did break out my neck and turn colors after wearing for a few weeks though.</li>
            <li> I usually put some eucalyptus oil in it in the mornings to help me wake-up and stimulate my mood.</li>
            <li> Horrible, cheap quality.  </li>
            <li> chain is thick and not well made.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package, the chain was already broken at the clasp.</li>
            <li> my skin is useless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was going to dock one star for the chain being so useless and breaking immediately, but I decided not to because who cares?</li>
            <li> The chain has shine to it but the diffuser pendant is dull, looks awful on the shiny chain.</li>
            <li> The six starter pads were not included. :(</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that it did not come with the pads as stated in the description.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear this for therapeutic EOs, but for fancy blended fragrances that turn nasty on my skin chemistry, so a diffuser that lets the oil touch</li>
            <li> Terrible design flaw requires the user to remove the pendant from the chain before the locket can be opened.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s cute and it does what it should! I like the design. It stays closed well, but is still easy to open so you can change out the pads.</li>
            <li> Gift.  Recipient enjoys it very much.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful, well-made necklace that comes with tiny absorbant pads to hold the oil inside the pendant.  It comes just as it looks, and it ships fast.  I would reccomand it to everyone who uses aromatherapy oils.</li>
            <li> This is the 4th of this specific necklace (heart) that I am purchasing for myself (I like to keep different scents in the different necklaces so I can just grab the scent that suits me for the moment).    I used my first one so much that I finally wore the plating off of it - it is over 6 years old - and I am still using it!    This is my FAVORITE of all of Nature&#x27;s Alchemy diffuser pendants, specifically for the hinged design. You can leave this pendant on the chain to refill the oil. All you have to do is slacken the chain, open the heart, drip the oil onto the pad inside, tighten the slack on the chain, and away you go.    All the other designs are not hinged, but are two separate pieces that seat together with a pin on the bottom or side. This means you must remove it from the chain and fiddle around with the pendant to take the two separate pieces apart to get to the pad inside to refill it, then to align them properly and re-thread the chain through it. I have ordered these other designs and sent them all back.    Except for this design - it ROCKS!    I use mine each and every day.     You can re-use the scent pad (as long as it is the same scent) for a long time before having to replace it.    I have even given these as gifts to my friends, specifically when one of my friend&#x27;s husband died. She thanked me over and over again for this necklace (I also gave her YLEO&#x27;s \\&quot;Peace and Calming\\&quot; oil to use in it).</li>
            <li> Love this necklace!!!</li>
            <li> a pewter like finish, so it is a bit clunky looking to wear with nice clothes; one&#x27;s own taste...each kind of oil that I have used on the little tabs inside, seem to last very well as I wear this..  I like  oils; so it seems a nice way to \\&quot;carry it with me\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I am using my necklace for the first time today.  I love it.  And have had several compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Feels a little bit light (cheap) but seems to be decent. Will do the job.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband&#x27;s secretary at work.  She is hard to buy for each year, but last year I got her a zen garden and fen shuy kit and she loved them.  So I thought she might like this.  I also bought a sampler set of aromatherapy essential oils to go with it---she went ga ga over them both!  This is a great gift idea, especially with the oils as well--great for that female that you never know what to get for her!  It&#x27;s unique and who doesn&#x27;t like aromatherapy???</li>
            <li> Pendant was pretty but my chain broke only after about a month.</li>
            <li> Our art teacher got me started on this. I combine lemon and peppermint for a delicious refreshing scent all day. It helps keep me positive and focused. I can just reach for the heart and take a quick whiff to rejuvenate me!</li>
            <li> GOOD AT ALL  FATA  FATI</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughters and they love using the essential oils to wear around their necks.  It&#x27;s a good quality heavy/sturdy necklace.</li>
            <li> Love this.  It goes great with casual t-shirts or slightly more dressy &amp;#34;Sunday clothes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The pendant I received doesn&#x27;t look like the one shown in the picture; the heart isn&#x27;t shiny at all. It also has a black stain (as if someone spilled oil on it a while ago) at the back.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was taking the GRE, which is like a 4 hour+ exam and I found that sniffing lavender calmed me down a bit. Obviously, I can&#x27;t dab lavender under my nose regularly during the test so I bought this so the smell would waft up to me and keep me calm throughout the test. It definitely kept the lavender smell wafting up to me. I like this because now I can have a continuous stream of lavender to inhale.</li>
            <li> I love the locket part. THAT part is sturdy and functional.  The chain broke within two weeks, i&#x27;ve replaced it with a different chain.</li>
            <li> This jewelry is very good quality.  The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like about it is that you have to take the pendant off the chain in order to put the wick/pad in it.  I wish that it had opened from the bottom, but over all it is an nice piece of jewelry.</li>
            <li> Delivery was earlier than expected...thank you.  This necklace is absolutely gorgeous . Necklace is well made, very durable, and easy to put the eo on the pads.  Received lots of compliments. I love this necklace.  About a week age, I put some lavender eo on the pad, and I can still smell it. Great idea, now I can carry my lavender eo or any eo with me without anyone else knowing  I would highly recommend this necklace to anyone who used essential oils.  Great product.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package, the chain was already broken at the clasp. Luckily, I make and repair my own jewelry, so I won&#x27;t bother to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chain is thick and not well made. I&#x27;ll probably put the pendant on another chain or on a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pendant itself seems OK. The metal is dark and not as shiny as pictured.</li>
            <li> Absolutely  love this necklace amazing quality ! Gave one to a friend &amp; my daughter both loved them too. Having a beautiful smell around your neck all day is so pleasant, especially in our toxic world. I have no doubt this necklace will hold up. I would have liked it in gold more as I don&#x27;t wear silver .</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of necklaces, I usually take them off before the work day is over because I don&#x27;t like things aon my neck. But this is very lightweight and I actually forgot I had it on. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The chain is well made, I was impressed with the durability. However, I just received the necklace. The six starter pads were not included. :(</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this necklace...it is great!  Would purchase as a gift.</li>
            <li> This diffuser necklace works pretty well. The pads last for a really long time and they give you plenty to start out with. I don&#x27;t wear it every single day, so I haven&#x27;t had to re-order any pads yet. I find that the scent lasts for a few hours, but I definitely have to re-oil the pad during the day. I usually put some eucalyptus oil in it in the mornings to help me wake-up and stimulate my mood. This helps a lot. I&#x27;ll get nice whiffs throughout the morning or I&#x27;ll put it close to my nose every so often and breathe in. By the afternoon, I don&#x27;t notice it so much, but I feel it definitely lasts longer than if I were to simply put essential oils on as a perfume. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the actual design and it&#x27;s not particularly aesthetically appealing or my style of necklace. But for what it&#x27;s made for, it works pretty good. I would recommend it, as it&#x27;s affordable and definitely helpful and useful if you&#x27;re a big fan of using essential oils in your everyday life. I also bought one as a bridal shower gift for a friend, and she had good things to say, although I think she sort of started to forget to use it after a while. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t really go with a lot of outfits her and I like to wear! But, oh well. :)</li>
            <li> Love it! I use my oils on it and the aroma lasts for many hours.</li>
            <li> Works well...just the right size..</li>
            <li> The chain has shine to it but the diffuser pendant is dull, looks awful on the shiny chain. Will just wear around the house for the diffusing effect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, cheap as expected</li>
            <li> It is really beautiful, and it is easy to change the inserts!  So glad I bought it!&lt;br /&gt;I think I may buy another to hang in my car and use as an air freshener</li>
            <li> I am really bummed that the chain broke after only wearing it for 5 minutes. However, I put the diffuser on a different chain and it worked great!</li>
            <li> Lasted a month before breaking.</li>
            <li> Comes open easily,  hard to close. Lost scent pads constantly.  Had to tape shut so my daughter could wear it without losing her essential oil pads.</li>
            <li> Cute and effective. The back of the pendant doesn&#x27;t have holes so it does not leak on clothing.</li>
            <li> This is a great locket and I wear it nearly every day.  One thing I would prefer, however, is if it would open easier while still on the chain.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear silver jewelry, but I love this necklace. I put essential oil on the pad and insert inside necklace and it&#x27;s great aromatherapy. I put 5 drops of essential oil on the pad and it seems to last for a few days.</li>
            <li> This has a nice quality metal heart and the locket stays closed so you won&#x27;t lose the cotton pad that holds the oils.  Nice quality, easy to open, heavy quality of chain.</li>
            <li> This is by far the easiest of the Nature&#x27;s Alchemy necklaces to use. It has a hinge that makes it a little easier to use than the others that have to be fit together. It holds the pad nicely and provides nice scent but it could be designed with a side hinge for easier access. I would not recommend this necklace for young kids ~ it is too difficult to fill with oil.</li>
            <li> The locket has a wonderful antique look.  The chain could be of better quality and one or two inches longer. The pads for oil work great to hold the scent for several days.</li>
            <li> works great with the oils...I forget I have it on and all of a sudden I smell the oils....and the chain is so nice....I am thinking about another just for a change.....and have had people ask and comment about them.....</li>
            <li> Works great but the chain and locket are slightly different colors.</li>
            <li> I love this! It is a perfect size, and diffuses the oil well. The only problem I had was the chain had a 2 small defects (more like kinks, looks like it wasn&#x27;t put together properly), but I can always put it on a different one. Overall this is great. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This pendant arrived on time and packaged well.  It is very pretty and just the right size for my 12 year old to wear.  I was a little worried that it would be too large for her but it isn&#x27;t. It is a little more \\&quot;rustic\\&quot; than it appears in the picture but still a good value and I am sure it will be worn often.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to wear at night for aromatherapy. It is a great idea in theory, but the design of the heart pendant is very flawed. There is no secure closure (closes using the necklace strand only) therefore the oil soaked pad falls out and stains everything. There are better versions out there.</li>
            <li> All right, yes: the chain is nearly useless and the locket is more &amp;#34;rustic&amp;#34; than you think from the picture--it&#x27;s a heart with little hearts stamped into it--and there is a very faint metallic smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is a banging good deal! I have to stick my nose right up against the locket for the metal smell to be noticeable; it&#x27;s not enough to change the scent of the oil you put inside it. I replaced the chain and as long as a layer with some other spookier necklaces more in line with my aesthetic, it looks fine. In fact, this works better than any other scent wearable I&#x27;ve tried in this price range so far. The back of the locket doesn&#x27;t have holes, so the oil never touches your skin. I don&#x27;t wear this for therapeutic EOs, but for fancy blended fragrances that turn nasty on my skin chemistry, so a diffuser that lets the oil touch my skin is useless. This locket allows for a good amount of scent, but it keeps the oils from turning for a long time. So for my purposes, it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hinge to open and close is sturdy. It doesn&#x27;t lock into place, but it feels very secure. The locket itself has surprising heft--I was afraid it would be flimsy, but it&#x27;s actually rather heavy for the size, pleasantly so. Overall I feel like this thing could take a beating and keep on coming. I&#x27;m pretty hard on my things, so I appreciate that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat--I don&#x27;t use the scent pads. Inside I use nice scraps of fabric, usually in a contrasting color. It&#x27;s prettier, holds just as much scent, and you can fill the locket up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to dock one star for the chain being so useless and breaking immediately, but I decided not to because who cares? You could string this on cord and it would still work. It&#x27;s a scent locket $15! Come on! That&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> The heart pendant was broke when I got it. Didn&#x27;t want to have to pay money to send it back. Gave it to my 5 year old to wear since it can&#x27;t be used as a diffuser anymore.</li>
            <li> Cheap, clumsy construction.  Unsightly chain.  Terrible design flaw requires the user to remove the pendant from the chain before the locket can be opened.  Don&#x27;t bother with this one, it&#x27;s not worth the aggravation.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my 9 year old niece, and she absolutely adored it. I hear she never takes it off, and is thrilled to have her own diffuser necklace.</li>
            <li> Wonderful idea to  be able to inhale your favorite essential oil whenever and as often as you like. Peppermint, jasmine or sweet orange..ahhh nice! I really enjoy wearing this.</li>
            <li> I received the pendant today and there were no pads with it. The description says that 6 pads come with it and there were none. Ugh. I really needed it for vacation and now don&#x27;t have time to return it or order pads. Very disappointed that it did not come with the pads as stated in the description.</li>
            <li> The pin holding the locket together was already out of the locket when I opened the package.  I slipped it back in.  I was able to wear the locket for one day before the pin fell out. I can not find the pin and can no longer wear the locket after one day of use.  Horrible, cheap quality.  Very unhappy with product.</li>
            <li> When I put just 6 drops of essential oil on the pad, then wore the necklace, the EO dripped and ran down the inside of the pendant, then dripped off the hinge onto my shirt. It left several small spots of oil that would not wash out.</li>
            <li> This was my 2nd choice pendant after my 1st choice was backordered and cancelled by original seller-this is alternate seller. it comes w/a starter set of scent pads that you put 1 or 2 drops of essential oil and as long as you have this next to your skin your body heat activates the essential oil and it drifts up to your nose and lasts all day. I used grapefruit to control my appetite and it honestly worked! I have to admit I was too heavy on the grapefruit oil and used 2 drops. Next time I will try 1 drop.</li>
            <li> Pendant works fine as a diffuser.  Worth what I paid for it. The chain kept snagging my clothing, so I replaced it with another chain.  Happier with it, now.</li>
            <li> I loved the design of the necklace and it worked great as an eos defuser.  It did break out my neck and turn colors after wearing for a few weeks though.</li>
            <li> The length is perfect. It&#x27;s lightweight and diffuses well. I love that you can just open the locket while still on the chain to refill or change the scent pad. I use Doterra EO&#x27;s with this and the scent pads can last up to one week or more!</li>
