            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m \\&quot;only\\&quot; 27, so the wrinkles aren&#x27;t greatly defined, but still, there are some fine lines that I was hoping this would attack.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have it on hand all the time through their \\&quot;Subscribe &amp; Save\\&quot; program.</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled with them.</li>
            <li>so I was delighted to find it available from Amazon!</li>
            <li>The eye gel is refreshing and feels amazing.  </li>
            <li>Very good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this gel for so many years</li>
            <li>I guess the gel was doing more than I realized.  </li>
            <li>Have used this product for many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 15 years and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have used it for many years.</li>
            <li>I love the way the gel absorbs around the eye area.</li>
            <li>so my eyes feel better</li>
            <li>Suggestion: order more than one at a time to make the shipping count for you.  :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 15 years, since I found it years ago when I was stilling living in my hometown.  </li>
            <li>I love this one and have to use it every day.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this Oil of Olay eye cream.</li>
            <li>I began using this eye gel by Olay many years ago.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t do anything magical like erase crow&#x27;s feet, but it plumps and hydrates under the eye without doing any harm.</li>
            <li>and I love the cooling feel of the gel.</li>
            <li>I do not know that it improves the appearance of my eye area, but it sure provides comfort.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for years and feel it is the best, especially if you have allergies.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time, and it works great!  </li>
            <li>This is the absolutely perfect solution for the dry skin issues I was having.</li>
            <li>Was even better that I was able to get it through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program-good price and convenient delivery right to my door!</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve found that somehow the additional moisture on my skin seems to make my eyes feel more comfortable (maybe it&#x27;s an evaporation effect).    </li>
            <li>This is a  great product for sensitive skin around the eye area.</li>
            <li>Defying Revitalizing Eye Gel has a lightweight, somewhat slippery texture that feels light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Refreshing, light, and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>And since it is not always on the shelf of my local drugstore, I&#x27;m happy to be able to get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s for use all around the eye and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>And the 2-Pack is more economical than buying one at a time at a retail store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank goodness this product is relatively cheap because it didn&#x27;t do anything.  </li>
            <li>I have had great results from Olays facial serum</li>
            <li>I purchased this gel originally because it was made for the tender eye skin - and it was Olay.</li>
            <li>I love this product as I feel safe applying it near my eyes and it stops the itch!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film or a feeling of heaviness.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find it around here and it works great for an old ladies eyes,  Thanks</li>
            <li>The good news is that this eye gel contains some reliable anti-irritants to counteract any potential problems from the witch hazel.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I think it makes your eyes look good temporarily, but does not actually reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li>My under eyes really need hydration, yet I am either allergic to most eye creams and get itchy welts, or they give me milia.  </li>
            <li>So I guess that makes this worthy of five stars.  </li>
            <li>I love this eye gel, it is so much better than anything else similar I have tried.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and actually look forward to putting it on each day.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to tell if there are results, but I love how refreshing the gel is, and how nice it feels in the morning when my eyes are still swollen from sleep.  </li>
            <li>It feels instantly cool and refreshing the moment you put it on, and my wrinkles are barely visible now.    </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way of knowing if the wrinkles would be worse without it, but I think it&#x27;s helping, and it feels so wonderful when I apply it before getting into bed at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe I am addicted to this wonderful product!</li>
            <li>When I wash my face in the mornings I can feel it wash right off, where it sat on the skin all night rather than penetrate.</li>
            <li>The cool feel and moisture a very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I am almost 35 now and think I may have to go stronger soon, but it is/was really good for coping with the slight signs of lines.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even remember when I first tried it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Deep Wrinkle eye cream does an infinitely better job helping puffiness, but I can&#x27;t wear it during the day because it looks streaky under eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>Been using this eye cream for years now and it is very refreshing and helps with my dark circles.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I started getting &amp;#34;sticky, itchy&amp;#34; feeling around my eyes after an hour or so.  </li>
            <li>I just keep it on the counter in my bathroom but the gel keeps it cool enough that it feels cool and soothing whenever I put it</li>
            <li>I came to my senses and I looked on Amazon where a person can find pretty much everything.  </li>
            <li>Nice cooling gel for your dark circles.  </li>
            <li>I had used Olay eye creams for many years (I&#x27;m 49), but they didn&#x27;t do much to diminish wrinkles, and the skin under my eyes was uncomfortably dry.</li>
            <li>It keeps your eye area looking young and fresh.</li>
            <li>However, what you really want is a skin-care product whose ingredients exert all their effort toward helping your skin rather than protecting it from problematic ingredients.</li>
            <li>Would Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to use too much at one time and for me I wouldn&#x27;t use it during the day under my eye shadow.</li>
            <li>This eye gel really works</li>
            <li>The witch hazel really stops the itch and keeps me from rubbing my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t noticed any difference while using this product.</li>
            <li>and he really likes this product..</li>
            <li>I can honestly say after a few months of using this stuff I really don&#x27;t see any difference around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Use to get it at Wal-Mart, but like so many other items nowadays, you can&#x27;t find it in their inventory anymore.  </li>
            <li>You can get this eye gel&#x27;s chief benefit by simply applying a cool compress to your eye area (which can be helpful if you wake up with puffy eyes that are unrelated to aging).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, it IS a classic Eye Gel.</li>
            <li>Classic, cooling gel.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have used this for a few years now to get rid of/prevent the start of the eye lines I was beginning to get :)  </li>
            <li>I need a new body too.</li>
            <li>I still look as old as I am, maybe even older.  </li>
            <li>It feels so good on my old tired eyes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, and I really liked that the little container would last a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this before and it always amazes how well it relieves my tired, strained eyes w/o even touching the eyeballs!</li>
            <li>it is hard to tell if they are getting better.  </li>
            <li>Then I noticed a completely unexpected side effect.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that Amazon had it in stock.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to all young and elder ladies for the care of skin around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way!! :)</li>
            <li>I have severe chronic dry eyes (lack of natural tears), and no brand of eyedrops provides much relief.</li>
            <li>This stuff turned my eyes back to normal.  </li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve used this product and I&#x27;m just not certain how I feel about it yet.  </li>
            <li>After a little over a week I happened to notice a distinct difference in the lines under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a basic, clear, gel with no noticeable improvement.  </li>
            <li>They arrived much sooner than I expected</li>
            <li>Since I have dry eye due to allergies from time to time, I find the gel helps with dryness tremendously.</li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s totally hypoallergenic, non-irritating and always refreshing when I&#x27;m tired.  </li>

            <li> I just keep it on the counter in my bathroom but the gel keeps it cool enough that it feels cool and soothing whenever I put it</li>
            <li> I came to my senses and I looked on Amazon where a person can find pretty much everything.  </li>
            <li> Nice cooling gel for your dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I had used Olay eye creams for many years (I&#x27;m 49), but they didn&#x27;t do much to diminish wrinkles, and the skin under my eyes was uncomfortably dry.</li>
            <li> It keeps your eye area looking young and fresh.</li>
            <li> However, what you really want is a skin-care product whose ingredients exert all their effort toward helping your skin rather than protecting it from problematic ingredients.</li>
            <li> Would Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to use too much at one time and for me I wouldn&#x27;t use it during the day under my eye shadow.</li>
            <li> This eye gel really works</li>
            <li> The witch hazel really stops the itch and keeps me from rubbing my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t noticed any difference while using this product.</li>
            <li> and he really likes this product..</li>
            <li> I can honestly say after a few months of using this stuff I really don&#x27;t see any difference around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Use to get it at Wal-Mart, but like so many other items nowadays, you can&#x27;t find it in their inventory anymore.  </li>
            <li> You can get this eye gel&#x27;s chief benefit by simply applying a cool compress to your eye area (which can be helpful if you wake up with puffy eyes that are unrelated to aging).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, it IS a classic Eye Gel.</li>
            <li> Classic, cooling gel.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few years now to get rid of/prevent the start of the eye lines I was beginning to get :)  </li>
            <li> I need a new body too.</li>
            <li> I still look as old as I am, maybe even older.  </li>
            <li> It feels so good on my old tired eyes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much, and I really liked that the little container would last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and it always amazes how well it relieves my tired, strained eyes w/o even touching the eyeballs!</li>
            <li> it is hard to tell if they are getting better.  </li>
            <li> Then I noticed a completely unexpected side effect.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that Amazon had it in stock.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to all young and elder ladies for the care of skin around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!! :)</li>
            <li> I have severe chronic dry eyes (lack of natural tears), and no brand of eyedrops provides much relief.</li>
            <li> This stuff turned my eyes back to normal.  </li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve used this product and I&#x27;m just not certain how I feel about it yet.  </li>
            <li> After a little over a week I happened to notice a distinct difference in the lines under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a basic, clear, gel with no noticeable improvement.  </li>
            <li> They arrived much sooner than I expected</li>
            <li> Since I have dry eye due to allergies from time to time, I find the gel helps with dryness tremendously.</li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s totally hypoallergenic, non-irritating and always refreshing when I&#x27;m tired.  </li>
            <li> I was having major dry skin issues under my eyes.</li>
            <li> AND as a side affect, my eyes do seem a little more firm and less saggy.</li>
            <li> jar doesn&#x27;t hold too much, but you use very little with each application.  </li>
            <li> but it is getting increasingly harder to find this simple, soothing eye gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this eye cream or a long time.</li>
            <li> The gel itself is so thick and sticky, it really feels like you&#x27;re smearing jelly on your eyelids.</li>
            <li> and I am allergic to metal, so after a few months the skin around my eyes were red, sensitive, with a slight rash.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so one package last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 75 years old, and I&#x27;ve been applying this gel every night for the past five or six years.  </li>
            <li> I think it is working, but I have such dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this gel doesn&#x27;t do anything for the puffiness, but does help eyes feel cool and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it and see if it makes a difference, but for now, it&#x27;s the same as putting a slightly sticky water around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It has worked for me in keeping the skin under my eyes firm and younger looking.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay products for a long time and although some of their products are a little expensive for me, it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product along with other Oil of Olay products, has been a staple in my make-up collection for years now.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I could no longer find my favorite eye gel in stores anymore.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like other eye creams/gels.</li>
            <li> You use very little so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Sorry I purchased so much of this product...</li>
            <li> Other products have burned my eye tissue but not this one!</li>
            <li> was a lot less compared to the drug stores.</li>
            <li> One less thing to have to run to the store for.</li>
            <li> Everyday I put this on before I put my makeup on.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t noticed any improvement in wrinkles until a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this gel for a few years.</li>
            <li> I suffer from puffiness under my eyes and was hoping for something to alleviate that, as well as to firm the undereye area.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for the past few weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any change/improvement.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find elsewhere....</li>
            <li> but he&#x27;s usually hard to please</li>
            <li> so I had high hopes for this product, but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched every where for this fanatic product.  </li>
            <li> but my eyes felt uncomfortable after I applied it to my skin.  </li>
            <li> My eyes looked horrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  i put all around my eyes, twice a day. it helps revive my skin and makes wrinkles disappear, It seeps into your skin flawlessly. helping you to look your best, each and every day!!</li>
            <li> Great product. I Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for so many years I don&#x27;t even remember when I first tried it.  Everyday I put this on before I put my makeup on.  The cool feel and moisture a very noticeable.  I hadn&#x27;t noticed any improvement in wrinkles until a few months ago.  I ran out of the gel and kept forgetting to pick some up.  After a little over a week I happened to notice a distinct difference in the lines under my eyes.  I guess the gel was doing more than I realized.  So from now on I order on amazon.  It&#x27;s a definite advantage when you can order any time of the day.</li>
            <li> Very good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I had used Olay eye creams for many years (I&#x27;m 49), but they didn&#x27;t do much to diminish wrinkles, and the skin under my eyes was uncomfortably dry. About a month ago I noticed this eye gel at Walmart and decided to give it a try. What a difference! It feels instantly cool and refreshing the moment you put it on, and my wrinkles are barely visible now.    Then I noticed a completely unexpected side effect. I have severe chronic dry eyes (lack of natural tears), and no brand of eyedrops provides much relief. Obviously, this Olay eye gel is applied on the outside of the eye, not the inside. But I&#x27;ve found that somehow the additional moisture on my skin seems to make my eyes feel more comfortable (maybe it&#x27;s an evaporation effect).    I am very pleased with this product and actually look forward to putting it on each day.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product for years, very satisfied - The multi pack and the discounts are what satisfied me - very happy with transaction</li>
            <li> This is a  great product for sensitive skin around the eye area. Good price compared to buying at the store.</li>
            <li> Sorry I purchased so much of this product... when you apply it ...it looks shiny on...so you can&#x27;t use it during the day when you need for the puffiness to be reduced.  I will use it at night... and never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time, and it works great!  A little goes a long way, so one package last a long time.  It&#x27;s for use all around the eye and goes on smoothly.  I&#x27;ve only been ordering it through Amazon for a short time.  It&#x27;s nice to have it on hand all the time through their \\&quot;Subscribe &amp; Save\\&quot; program.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years. It is soothing as soon I put it on.  The crows feet do diminish when using it.      I used to do some welding and I am allergic to metal, so after a few months the skin around my eyes were red, sensitive, with a slight rash.  My eyes looked horrible.  This stuff turned my eyes back to normal.  I thought the skin around my eyes was permanently ruined.    Recommend using it just before bed and in the morning under eye makeup.      Amazon is awesome with great deals! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 15 years and LOVE it. It keeps your eye area looking young and fresh.</li>
            <li> Will not buy it after I read Paula&#x27;s review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Age Defying Revitalizing Eye Gel has a lightweight, somewhat slippery texture that feels light and refreshing. The amount and type of witch hazel have been changed, and the changes are to your skin&#x27;s benefit. Still, witch hazel in any form isn&#x27;t the best for use around the eyes. The good news is that this eye gel contains some reliable anti-irritants to counteract any potential problems from the witch hazel. However, what you really want is a skin-care product whose ingredients exert all their effort toward helping your skin rather than protecting it from problematic ingredients. All told, this isn&#x27;t a must-have item. You can get this eye gel&#x27;s chief benefit by simply applying a cool compress to your eye area (which can be helpful if you wake up with puffy eyes that are unrelated to aging).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Water, Propylene Glycol, Panthenol, Glycerin, Hexylene Glycol, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Peg/Ppg-17/6 Copolymer, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxide, Glyceryl Polymethacrylate, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycyrrhizic Acid, Tetrasodium Edta, Propylparaben, Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Citric Acid, Alcohol, Pvm/Ma Copolymer</li>
            <li> I love this product. I like the consistency of the gel. It goes on smoothly, soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film or a feeling of heaviness. I have used it for years and see no need to ever change.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to tell if there are results, but I love how refreshing the gel is, and how nice it feels in the morning when my eyes are still swollen from sleep.  I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have used it for many years. I love the way the gel absorbs around the eye area. Would Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few years now to get rid of/prevent the start of the eye lines I was beginning to get :)  I am almost 35 now and think I may have to go stronger soon, but it is/was really good for coping with the slight signs of lines.  It doesn&#x27;t take much, and I really liked that the little container would last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years- I just keep it on the counter in my bathroom but the gel keeps it cool enough that it feels cool and soothing whenever I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my eyes-both on lids and under eyes every morning before I wash my face-&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the middle of the night if I wake up and can&#x27;t sleep&lt;br /&gt;I even use it if I catnap before a big night out so my eyes feel better</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve used this product and I&#x27;m just not certain how I feel about it yet.  You don&#x27;t want to use too much at one time and for me I wouldn&#x27;t use it during the day under my eye shadow.</li>
            <li> This product along with other Oil of Olay products, has been a staple in my make-up collection for years now.  I have used it for years and am thrilled that it is still on the market because it is inexpensive and WORKS! Use to get it at Wal-Mart, but like so many other items nowadays, you can&#x27;t find it in their inventory anymore.  However, our friends at Amazon offer it at a very fair price even with the shipping.  Suggestion: order more than one at a time to make the shipping count for you.  :)</li>
            <li> Great price.... Hard to find elsewhere....</li>
            <li> Excellent product as is all of Oil of Olay products. Would order again.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the past few weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any change/improvement.  It&#x27;s just a basic, clear, gel with no noticeable improvement.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it and see if it makes a difference, but for now, it&#x27;s the same as putting a slightly sticky water around my eyes.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if it is doing any good, but I like the way it feels... and it doesn&#x27;t appear to be doing any harm!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 20 years and I&#x27;ve never had bags under my eyes. Could be genetics but it is getting increasingly harder to find this simple, soothing eye gel. Get it while you can.</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel for a few years. I suffer from puffiness under my eyes and was hoping for something to alleviate that, as well as to firm the undereye area.  Unfortunately this gel doesn&#x27;t do anything for the puffiness, but does help eyes feel cool and refreshed.  I&#x27;ve found that Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Deep Wrinkle eye cream does an infinitely better job helping puffiness, but I can&#x27;t wear it during the day because it looks streaky under eye makeup.  So I still use this gel in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay products for over 45 years. I was disappointed when I could no longer find my favorite eye gel in stores anymore.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that Amazon had it in stock. I immediately ordered four jars.  They arrived much sooner than I expected and I am thrilled with them. Now I can continue to age gracefully without unsightly puffiness and sagging skin around eyes. Added bonus:  not at all greasy or oily.  I&#x27;m just hoping that Olay will continue to make the product. The price is very reasonable and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product. I buy two bottles at a time. I use it every night before going to bed.  It has worked for me in keeping the skin under my eyes firm and younger looking. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this eye gel to anyone. I even apply it over my makeup for added moisture and shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years, I like this product &amp; the price here was a lot less compared to the drug stores. I had to pay for shipping but, no sales tax, still a great deal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 75 years old, and I&#x27;ve been applying this gel every night for the past five or six years.  There&#x27;s no way of knowing if the wrinkles would be worse without it, but I think it&#x27;s helping, and it feels so wonderful when I apply it before getting into bed at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar doesn&#x27;t hold too much, but you use very little with each application.  And the 2-Pack is more economical than buying one at a time at a retail store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 15 years, since I found it years ago when I was stilling living in my hometown.  It provide very good moisture to the skin around my eyes.  I tried more expensive brands like Neutrogena but my eyes felt uncomfortable after I applied it to my skin.  I love this one and have to use it every day.  I used to get it from Target and recently couldn&#x27;t find it there.  Great that I could get it through Amazon.com.  I recommend this to all young and elder ladies for the care of skin around the eyes.  Yes, it IS a classic Eye Gel.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is very refreshing. It feels so good on my old tired eyes. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I think it makes your eyes look good temporarily, but does not actually reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Nice cooling gel for your dark circles.  This product works as advertised and the non greasy gel soothes your eyes.  Since I have dry eye due to allergies from time to time, I find the gel helps with dryness tremendously.</li>
            <li> Been using this eye cream for years now and it is very refreshing and helps with my dark circles. Was even better that I was able to get it through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program-good price and convenient delivery right to my door! One less thing to have to run to the store for. I am never without this eye cream!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like other eye creams/gels.</li>
            <li> Leaves a cooling sensation after applied. I use it morning and night and no issues with contacts either. You use very little so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I was having major dry skin issues under my eyes. Nothing seemed to work. Although I wasn&#x27;t specifically looking for an age defying serum or one that reduced lines or wrinkles - I purchased this gel originally because it was made for the tender eye skin - and it was Olay. I am so happy I did! This is the absolutely perfect solution for the dry skin issues I was having. AND as a side affect, my eyes do seem a little more firm and less saggy. I&#x27;m hooked on this product now. I sure hope they don&#x27;t stop making it or change the formula!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t decrease wrinkles, just moisturizes. It is not as good as advertized. I still look as old as I am, maybe even older.  I need a new body too.</li>
            <li> Great product. My wife loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this Oil of Olay eye cream. I couldn&#x27;t find it at the store and presto Amazon had it. I also use as a foundation before putting on my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> The gel feels good going on.  I think it is working, but I have such dark circles under my eyes it is hard to tell if they are getting better.  I think the bags under my eyes are smaller.  I am very happy with the product even if it does not produce miracles overnight!</li>
            <li> I began using this eye gel by Olay many years ago.  This is the first time I started getting &amp;#34;sticky, itchy&amp;#34; feeling around my eyes after an hour or so.  That tells me that the product ingredients have changed in some way, to cause me to develop this sort of allergic reaction. Gotta tell ya...this product just doesn&#x27;t feel the same as it used to.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years to prevent wrinkles around my eyes. That should be enough to satisfy you</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!  I will purchase again..... A little goes a long way!! :)</li>
            <li> My under eyes really need hydration, yet I am either allergic to most eye creams and get itchy welts, or they give me milia.  This eye gel solves that problem for me.  It won&#x27;t do anything magical like erase crow&#x27;s feet, but it plumps and hydrates under the eye without doing any harm.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this and has bought it on several occasions.  She&#x27;s beautiful.  So I guess that makes this worthy of five stars.  Enough said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and it always amazes how well it relieves my tired, strained eyes w/o even touching the eyeballs!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it around here and it works great for an old ladies eyes,  Thanks</li>
            <li> I have used Olay products for a long time and although some of their products are a little expensive for me, it is worth the money. This eye gel really works</li>
            <li> I purchased mine at Wal-Mart, not through Amazon, but the product is the same.  Thank goodness this product is relatively cheap because it didn&#x27;t do anything.  I have been using this product EVERY night and EVERY morning for the last 2.5 months, and I have not seen ANY difference at all.  I&#x27;m \\&quot;only\\&quot; 27, so the wrinkles aren&#x27;t greatly defined, but still, there are some fine lines that I was hoping this would attack.  No such luck.  I do not see any improvement in these lines.</li>
            <li> Been using for years and I love the cooling feel of the gel. Other products have burned my eye tissue but not this one!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. Am in my 70&#x27;s and have NO crow&#x27;s feet.  Can&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> I can honestly say after a few months of using this stuff I really don&#x27;t see any difference around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched every where for this fanatic product.  I came to my senses and I looked on Amazon where a person can find pretty much everything.  I use this product daily under my eyes and then use moisturizer on my face and neck.  The eye gel is refreshing and feels amazing.  I believe I am addicted to this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I have used this product on and off for years. I find it soothing and nonirritating. I do not know that it improves the appearance of my eye area, but it sure provides comfort.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this product for the purpose it was meant for.  It is a necessity if you get itchy eyes with your allergies.  The witch hazel really stops the itch and keeps me from rubbing my eyes.  I find that sometimes eye drops just aren&#x27;t enough as I get itchy around my eyes as well.  I love this product as I feel safe applying it near my eyes and it stops the itch!</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t noticed any difference while using this product. The gel itself is so thick and sticky, it really feels like you&#x27;re smearing jelly on your eyelids. It doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb into skin. When I wash my face in the mornings I can feel it wash right off, where it sat on the skin all night rather than penetrate. I have had great results from Olays facial serum so I had high hopes for this product, but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Got it for my husband since he was always heading out the door sporting white eye cream.  He says he looks younger already.  Don&#x27;t know about that, but he&#x27;s usually hard to please and he really likes this product..</li>
            <li> I have used this gel for removing eye makeup and for moisturizing the area around my eyes for years.  For me it&#x27;s totally hypoallergenic, non-irritating and always refreshing when I&#x27;m tired.  And since it is not always on the shelf of my local drugstore, I&#x27;m happy to be able to get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and timely delivery from supplier</li>
            <li> Classic, cooling gel.  Good for summer</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years and feel it is the best, especially if you have allergies.  Lightweight and good for day or night.</li>
            <li> I get puffy under eyes. I&#x27;ve tried every product under the sun and this is the only one that has worked. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this eye cream or a long time. It&#x27;s the best! It is not greasy or oily. Hope Olay never quits making it.</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel, it is so much better than anything else similar I have tried. Refreshing, light, and moisturizing. I could no longer find it locally so I was delighted to find it available from Amazon!</li>
