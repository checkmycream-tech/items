            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and when I&#x27;m low, I go online to find it. I will continue to use it while it&#x27;s still available online.</li>
            <li> It seemed  rancid, which I denied to myself until I couldn&#x27;t any longer, and had to throw it out. I&#x27;d used this product for two year, and never before had it smelled like this.</li>
            <li> i got it and i love it , thanks</li>
            <li> The tube that I received was bad. The product smelled and was runny. I had used this product before and loved it because it worked. what I got sent this time must have been an expired batch.</li>

            <li> Although I have tried multiple products, this is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that has a visible affect on reducing my wrinkles.  Not only that, but it softens my skin and prepares it for smooth make up application. I love it :)</li>
            <li> I found this product to do what it says.  I add it after my makeup, too.  It does not show at all, but works all day.</li>
