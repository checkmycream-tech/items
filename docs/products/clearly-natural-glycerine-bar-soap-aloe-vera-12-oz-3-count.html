            <li>Very light and pleasant scent</li>
            <li>Wonderful product at a very affordable price!</li>
            <li>Glycerine soap is nice to use because it doesn&#x27;t leave any soap film.  </li>
            <li>smell nice but don&#x27;t have foam at all when use it.</li>
            <li>I use this soap to make my own bath cubes and cloth wipe cubes.</li>
            <li>Nice on the Skin Too.</li>
            <li>Kind of..soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance</li>
            <li>Soap smells good as it is a very light aroma, not too strong.</li>
            <li>These Clearlty Natural bars are excellent - I&#x27;ve used them for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li>Cleans OK, smells OK, leaves skin feeling nice.</li>
            <li>It grates and melts easily, washes smoothe when used on it&#x27;s own, and has no appreciable smell or odor.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I love the feel.  </li>
            <li>Our family members love this soap.</li>
            <li>Love this soap.  </li>
            <li>The soap didn&#x27;t irritate my face like most soaps do..</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>all, this is a very nice, gentle soap. :)</li>
            <li>As I thought it would be, nice clean scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a mild soap and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Lovely light fragrance from the aloe.</li>
            <li>Good soap but very slippery</li>
            <li>Aroma is fine.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is merely a light &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; smell, something like cut grass.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;+ smooth texture</li>
            <li>My guests enjoy using it though.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent (different, but nice; almost a bit like watermelons or something), and my skin feels so moisturized after I use it.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling clean and refresh.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;+ clean well</li>
            <li>To me, no other face soap feels as good and fresh.</li>
            <li>Have only used a couple of times, but skin felt good after use.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, but doesn&#x27;t lather much</li>
            <li>Really nice for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Received Quickly.</li>
            <li>Love this soap, natural ingredients leave my skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>This is the only soap I use, smells great , has a nice lather (works perfect for shaving my legs and armpits ) and is the only soap I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or  leave a film on my skin like other non glycerin soaps..</li>
            <li>Very light scent and no harsh chemicals</li>
            <li>But I do like the fact that most of the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li>I feel like if I needed a strong soap to do a more serious cleaning, this may not be the best choice, but for an average everyday shower it works great.</li>
            <li>then I use the bar for soft, clean, fresh skin!</li>
            <li>This is a great soap for people with dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This product does not dry our skin like most of the body wash products today.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried this soap.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap!</li>
            <li>I love this soap and will use it as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li>This is pretty much all I use now.</li>
            <li>It smells nice too, slightly like watermelon.</li>
            <li>This is the only soap I use on my face, primarily to shave with.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really foam much but still helps the razor glide over legs.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really lather all that well.</li>
            <li>Gentle soap with nothing to irritate the skin.  </li>
            <li>Also, no, it doesn&#x27;t lather at all on skin, but I don&#x27;t really mind that.</li>
            <li>Oh, one last thing, it kind of has a different texture.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough for sensitive skin, yet effective enough for the males in the house.</li>
            <li>The soap is very gentle with a natural aloe vera scent.  </li>
            <li>As some other reviewers have noted, it does not lather very much, but it leaves my skin feeling clean without stripping it; no &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li>That is the main reason I purchased.</li>
            <li>This natural bar soap does not lather as much as I would like.  </li>
            <li>I have always had very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Clearly Natural is not the least expensive, but it is the best.</li>
            <li>All these clearly natural soaps (so far I&#x27;ve tried this and Unscented) have left my skin soft, not dry or itchy.  </li>
            <li>soft, clean (duh)</li>
