            <li>...and this is my favorite, favorite red!  </li>
            <li>The most beautiful color red I have seen in a long time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also OPI, so it goes on easily with that nice big brush and lasts pretty well.</li>
            <li>I wanted something the was a nice bold shade of red</li>
            <li>There is a very subtle shimmer to this polish that gives it a wonderful depth.</li>

            <li>This is my absolute fav color of nail polish.</li>
            <li>It probably looks good on other skin tones, but I was impressed by it because it is so hard to find a color to wear with my shade of pale skin -- they keep trying to put pink on us!</li>
            <li>Goes on super smooth, lasts a full week with base and top coat.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>

            <li> The quality of Opi doesn&#x27;t need further testimony - it&#x27;s the best.  The only problem is that the brush insert came off the top screw and I can&#x27;t get it back in there so I have to handle it by it&#x27;s little plastic tip.  Not good.  The color, \\&quot;An Affair in Red Square\\&quot; is a rich, deep, warm red with a slight gold shimmer.  The red color is very similar to \\&quot;Vodka and Caviar\\&quot; but opaque and shimmery.</li>
            <li> Only reason for the three stars is because it isn&#x27;t the color for me. It&#x27;s too orangey red for my tastes, but probably would be great on someone else who likes that color. It has a metallic sheen to it, which was nice. Opi is a great polish; this one just wasn&#x27;t for me. I wound up buying Vodka and Caviar, which is a stunning red that I fell in love with.</li>
            <li> Covers well in one coat and is the perfect shade of classic red.  This color would work with nearly every skin tone.  It is a must-have addition to your home mani/pedi collection.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect bright color to bring out pale skin that does not need any pink getting in the way. It probably looks good on other skin tones, but I was impressed by it because it is so hard to find a color to wear with my shade of pale skin -- they keep trying to put pink on us!</li>

            <li> OPI&#x27;s An Affair in Red Square is a stunning, true red. It works beautifully on warm skin tones. There is a very subtle shimmer to this polish that gives it a wonderful depth.

            <li> Just a perfect fall color for the toes. It goes with most fall clothes.  My friend was wearing it so I ordered a bottle for me.</li>
            <li> Perfect metallic red.  Love the formula and color.  Goes on super smooth, lasts a full week with base and top coat.</li>
            <li> Saw this color on a woman and I could not find it in our local stores.  I was so thrilled when Amazon came thru for me once again.  This color just seems to be the perfect red for me with just the right amount of shimmer but not too blingy!!! It stays and does not chip or fade, I am very happy with the quality of this product and the quick delivery I received.  Thank you Amazon and Amazon seller.</li>
            <li> The most beautiful color red I have seen in a long time.  I am very pale, and this red makes me shine!</li>
            <li> stunning color, beautiful finish</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is the perfect red! I love the gold shine in it! I use this red whenever I have a special event or something important to go to.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice red that wasn&#x27;t too over the top. I wanted something the was a nice bold shade of red but that wouldn&#x27;t over power my fair skin. This did the trick!</li>
            <li> This is my absolute fav color of nail polish. SEVERAL years ago I asked my nail girl to paint my nails the color of my cell phone, HA! This was the color. I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Buy this product. You will love it! My mother wears it for Christmas and has done so for many years!</li>
            <li> this is the best color red ever!!! its great for any time of the year and perfect for special events. I bought from amazon,and had very good service!</li>
            <li> I receive countless compliments every time I wear the polish.  The times I have taken it with me to the nail salon, the nail tech always checks out the name and shows it to the salon owner/operator.  Perfect for the holidays as well as other times of the year.</li>
            <li> my all time favorite deep red - it goes with most anything!</li>
            <li> Nice bright red shimmer polish</li>
