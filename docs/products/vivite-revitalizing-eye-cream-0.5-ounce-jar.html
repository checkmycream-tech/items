            <li>It does a great job with the rest of the Vivite system and Amazon Prime</li>

            <li>Great cream and great price</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Love ,love this stuff!!!!</li>
            <li>I do not know how this would work on deeper wrinkles but for my fine lines it is excellent.</li>
            <li>It has proved to be good.</li>
            <li>I have used this product from my dermatalogist before and it was a good product.  </li>
            <li>I bought it here because it was a good price.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found it here!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I love all Vivite&#x27; products!</li>
            <li>I had great results before when purchased from my doctor so it is not the true product.</li>
            <li>Vivite is a good product... helps the fine lines around your eyes..</li>
            <li>But ok I give this is a fine replacement , no rash, good on wrinkles.</li>
            <li>well so this is very important to me.  </li>
            <li>awesome if you want to look younger</li>
            <li>I LOVE Vivite products but the eye cream is so-so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve swapped this cream out for something more hydrating for my 27-year-old eyes.</li>
            <li>I have no idea why they stopped making my FAVORITE product.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eye cream.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I just love the results, I couldn&#x27;t use anything else anymore.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Such a great price too!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this line of products, I also bought the serum, exfoliating cream and night cream.  </li>
            <li>If I forget to use it or run out before I order more; you can tell.</li>
            <li>With the Vivite product line I have been able to stave off the test of time on my face.</li>
            <li>Have used it for many years.</li>
            <li>Love it.i also love the serum.</li>
            <li>I have purchased MD Forte&#x27; and Vivite&#x27; products for many years so am very familiar with the quality of the products and the packaging.  </li>
            <li>wife has sworn by the old MD Forte for many many years and her face is beautiful from using it.  </li>
            <li>Now I see the Vivite has gycolic acid which is not as strong.</li>
            <li>product has helped diminish my fine lines around my eyes and also what I call \\&quot;my</li>
            <li>I believe it has made a difference with fine lines and wrinkles around my eye area.</li>
            <li>and I can diffinitely see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>We were very happy to find this as the suitable replacement, and being a little cheaper than the old one is nicer on the wallet as well.</li>
            <li>I truely believe this product is not the Vivite&#x27; eye cream I ordered and has been tampered with.</li>
            <li>After two days of in-depth research and two phone calls, we found that this is the true replacement for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When i first bought it i paid $65 in my dermatologists office!</li>
            <li>I use the entire Vivite line and love it !  </li>
            <li>I have had many people assume I am not as old as I really am, I am guessing it&#x27;s the cream which has been helping with my fine lines.</li>
            <li>Great ingredients and keeps my 50 yr old eyes looking firmer and younger.</li>
            <li>I first found this product at a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office when I went to get a tricky mole removed.</li>
            <li>Although, I enjoyed the product, I didn&#x27;t want to spend the same amount of money again.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this product from my dermatologists office at twice the cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 64, and so far, so smooth.</li>
            <li>and i swear i have barely gained any fine lines under my eyes at all.</li>
            <li>Use it nightly, in the am it is too greasy under makeup but spectacular at fighting those little lines under the eyes.</li>
            <li>I put it in the freezer until ready for use.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast and does not irritate my eyes...</li>
            <li>then what I really am.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for about 6 months and it really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>Something that has DMAE and is reasonable I am over 55 years old!</li>
            <li>This cream was not sealed properly as an authentic Vivite&#x27; cream, did not have a plastic barrier under lid to help maintain an air tight seal before opening.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and others in the line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the cream often burns when I apply it and leaves dried skin in the creases under my eyes making my under-eye wrinkles more noticeable.</li>
            <li>Really good for moisturizing around the eyes without irritating.  </li>
            <li>Let me know about new products.</li>
            <li>A little goes a very long way, feels and looks nice.</li>
            <li>The cream was discolored, should be pure white, not beige.  </li>
            <li>The product was old.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is so soft and even the color seems to have improved over time.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t make the milia under my eyes go away completely, but it does help to shrink them.  </li>
            <li>If you used the old MD Forte eye cream before, they have discontinued it.  </li>
            <li>Have liked it in the past but bottle that was shipped was dried out - top wasn&#x27;t on tight - used product???</li>
            <li>Both of us are wondering if these are even the same product or if they are so old,</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and dry eyes as</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and my skin is a bit dry.</li>
            <li> Compared to a jar I had purchased at a spa, it was dry and clumpy.</li>
            <li> I mix it with eye moisturizer so that the skin doesn&#x27;t look too dry....</li>
            <li> but if you need exfoliation (get rid of dead skin cells), you need to slightly burn the surface of your skin in order for it to peel and bring new skin to the surface.</li>
            <li> The eye cream was very dry and appeared dehydrated.  </li>
            <li> I have minimal wrinkles around my eyes and this fills them in and reduces their appearance before I apply my fountation.  </li>
            <li> I decided to go through Amazon and paid less than half of my initial purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and I don&#x27;t think I will ever switch products, no matter my age.</li>
            <li> A little stingy around my eyes, but only for a few seconds.   </li>
            <li> I am a 29 year old male who used to use MD Forte eye cream until it was difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> I have that ingredient in other products to add to my previous Vitamins A and E.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not jumping up and down.</li>
            <li> Well, it was money thrown down the drain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Vivite skincare system for a year and a half now.</li>
            <li> The color is darker and the cream has an odd scent.</li>
            <li> This time, I thought I would try to save a little money and use Amazon.</li>
            <li> May be a little heavy for some people.</li>
            <li> This gets this rating because it was either old or fake.  </li>
            <li> Also, cream was dried out and had oozed out around the side of the jar, all around the threads under the lid.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and like it.</li>
            <li> A small dab does the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands but they seem to make my milia problems worse.  </li>
            <li> I always shop but its hard to beat this deal anywhere .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least 5 years and don&#x27;teven want to try anything else.</li>
            <li> Even though the jar looks small, it lasts about a year and at that price you can use it without generously having to stretch it out!</li>
            <li> but so far I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have not seen a dramatic improvement in my eye area but feel like it is making this area smoother.</li>
            <li> When the two products were placed side-by-side, there is no doubt something was wrong with my Amazon product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had lost the receipt and could not exchange it.</li>
            <li> That tells me something is wrong with this product.  </li>
            <li> I rated this product to be very poor for me because after I applied it on under my eyes it started to burn</li>
            <li> Very expensive - but two people who were waiting for their appointments praised the product.</li>
            <li> am appalled!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I first found this product at a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office when I went to get a tricky mole removed. Very expensive - but two people who were waiting for their appointments praised the product. I have had many people assume I am not as old as I really am, I am guessing it&#x27;s the cream which has been helping with my fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have not seen a dramatic improvement in my eye area but feel like it is making this area smoother.</li>
            <li> awesome if you want to look younger</li>
            <li> I LOVE Vivite products but the eye cream is so-so. It is now winter and my skin is a bit dry. I was hopeful that this cream would provide the needed moisture that the skin around my eyes needs but so far I am disappointed. I am still in search of the holy grail of eye creams....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Vivite skincare system for a year and a half now. Of all the products, the eye cream is the only one I would not recommend. Like the rest of the skincare system, the eye cream has glycolic acid in it to promote exfoliation. I&#x27;ve found that the cream often burns when I apply it and leaves dried skin in the creases under my eyes making my under-eye wrinkles more noticeable. I&#x27;ve swapped this cream out for something more hydrating for my 27-year-old eyes.</li>
            <li> Best &#x27;night&#x27; eye cream I have found. Use it nightly, in the am it is too greasy under makeup but spectacular at fighting those little lines under the eyes.</li>
            <li> This replaces MD Forte which I have used for 15 years so I&#x27;m not jumping up and down. I have no idea why they stopped making my FAVORITE product. But ok I give this is a fine replacement , no rash, good on wrinkles. Thats the idea ???</li>
            <li> great product. have been using for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Obagi skin line for years until the Botox rep told me they are now making this cream, so I tried it.</li>
            <li> I rated this product to be very poor for me because after I applied it on under my eyes it started to burn and i haven&#x27;t used it since!!! I am looking for another product that is an anti aging cream to apply under my eyes! Any suggestions!!! Something that has DMAE and is reasonable I am over 55 years old!</li>
            <li> I paid $65 dollars for this cream from my spa, and $23 for this through amazon. This is my favorite eye cream. Great ingredients and keeps my 50 yr old eyes looking firmer and younger. I love it. Even though the jar looks small, it lasts about a year and at that price you can use it without generously having to stretch it out! You&#x27;ll be very happy  with it.</li>
            <li> I was wondering why MD Forte was replaced by Vivite.  I found the eye cream and face cream to be wonderful products.  They both contained Retina A and vitamin E.  Now I see the Vivite has gycolic acid which is not as strong. I have that ingredient in other products to add to my previous Vitamins A and E.  Now there is no A or E at all.  Maybe because it is cheaper.  Anyone know?</li>
            <li> Goes well under makeup. It does a great job with the rest of the Vivite system and Amazon Prime is the way to go for all my skincare needs.</li>
            <li> The product was old.  Compared to a jar I had purchased at a spa, it was dry and clumpy.</li>
            <li> Really good for moisturizing around the eyes without irritating.  Goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  Makes makeup stay longer without smearing.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I initially purchased it through my physician and paid $70 for it!  Although, I enjoyed the product, I didn&#x27;t want to spend the same amount of money again.  I decided to go through Amazon and paid less than half of my initial purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has helped diminish my fine lines around my eyes and also what I call \\&quot;my sleep lines\\&quot; on the left side of my face.  I&#x27;m 46 with oily skin and this product did not break my out my face.  A little goes a long way, and I don&#x27;t think I will ever switch products, no matter my age.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year, along with the rest of the vivite products. I just love the results, I couldn&#x27;t use anything else anymore.</li>
            <li> I am a 29 year old male who used to use MD Forte eye cream until it was difficult to find.  If you are not used to glycolic acid, this eye cream may burn in the beginning.  However, I am happy with it now and use it every day.</li>
            <li> Vivite is a good product... helps the fine lines around your eyes.. keeps moisture and brightness in eye area..</li>
            <li> I was looking for an eye cream that would exfoliate the area to soften the lines around my eyes. Yes, this product will irritate your skin but if you need exfoliation (get rid of dead skin cells), you need to slightly burn the surface of your skin in order for it to peel and bring new skin to the surface. I mix it with eye moisturizer so that the skin doesn&#x27;t look too dry....</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. It really works and i have been using it for a few years and i swear i have barely gained any fine lines under my eyes at all. I use it day and night. It is one of my must have&#x27;s and my skin is so soft and even the color seems to have improved over time. Such a great price too! When i first bought it i paid $65 in my dermatologists office!</li>
            <li> It has proved to be good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for years.  It was recommended to me by an aesthetician.  I believe it has made a difference with fine lines and wrinkles around my eye area.</li>
            <li> Product is as stated. Best lotion for my skin type. Not a miracle product but keeps everything hydrated - none greasy &amp; have no issues with make up. Will order and use again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for over 3 years and have always purchased it from my dermatologist&#x27;s office. This time, I thought I would try to save a little money and use Amazon. Well, it was money thrown down the drain. I ordered two jars, one for myself and one for my husband. Both of us are wondering if these are even the same product or if they are so old, that they &amp;#34;spoiled&amp;#34;.  The color is darker and the cream has an odd scent. Since I had to go to my dermatologist&#x27;s office to replace my recently purchased cream, I brought them with me. When the two products were placed side-by-side, there is no doubt something was wrong with my Amazon product. So much for trying so save a few dollars.</li>
            <li> I ordered a number of Viviitae products.  All the others were great.  The eye cream was very dry and appeared dehydrated.  It may have just been a defective bottle.  Unfortunately, I had lost the receipt and could not exchange it.</li>
            <li> Best eye cream ever!  Won&#x27;t ever use anything else!</li>
            <li> I truely believe this product is not the Vivite&#x27; eye cream I ordered and has been tampered with. It has a different smell and consistancy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this line of products, I also bought the serum, exfoliating cream and night cream.  In 2 weeks I can already see a difference and others do too.</li>
            <li> I use the entire Vivite line and love it !  I would highly recommend this product and others in the line.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way, feels and looks nice. May be a little heavy for some people. So far so good</li>
            <li> Have liked it in the past but bottle that was shipped was dried out - top wasn&#x27;t on tight - used product???</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year . Truly a wonderful product . I always shop but its hard to beat this deal anywhere .</li>
            <li> Havne not yet used.  I put it in the freezer until ready for use.</li>
            <li> I have minimal wrinkles around my eyes and this fills them in and reduces their appearance before I apply my fountation.  I use a lttle bit of mineral mackup under my eyes and this does not cause the foundation to cake up.  It absorbs fast and does not irritate my eyes...I have sensitive eyes and dry eyes as well so this is very important to me.  I do not know how this would work on deeper wrinkles but for my fine lines it is excellent.</li>
            <li> Love ,love this stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> The lines around my eyes have lessened and my dermatologist recommended it. Now  I tell my all friends about it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now. I am told I look alot younger then what I really am. I first bought this product from my dermatologists office at twice the cost. Glad I found it here!</li>
            <li> This gets this rating because it was either old or fake.  I have used this product from my dermatalogist before and it was a good product.  I bought it here because it was a good price.  It does not dissolve into the skin it just lays on it and flakes up when you try to blend it.  That tells me something is wrong with this product.  I had great results before when purchased from my doctor so it is not the true product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about 6 months and it really makes a difference.  No puffy wrinkled eyes when I get up in the morning.  If I forget to use it or run out before I order more; you can tell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for years and it&#x27;s the only one that has worked for me.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands but they seem to make my milia problems worse.  This doesn&#x27;t make the milia under my eyes go away completely, but it does help to shrink them.  The eye cream doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and the formula is non-greasy.</li>
            <li> This cream was not sealed properly as an authentic Vivite&#x27; cream, did not have a plastic barrier under lid to help maintain an air tight seal before opening.  The cream was discolored, should be pure white, not beige.  Also, cream was dried out and had oozed out around the side of the jar, all around the threads under the lid.  I have purchased MD Forte&#x27; and Vivite&#x27; products for many years so am very familiar with the quality of the products and the packaging.  I feel that I&#x27;ve been misled out of $45.00 and will not purchase from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least 5 years and don&#x27;teven want to try anything else. I&#x27;m 64, and so far, so smooth.</li>
            <li> Been using for several years and helps reduce lines. Under my eyes are not puffy or sagging like some of my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  A little stingy around my eyes, but only for a few seconds.   I love all Vivite&#x27; products!</li>
            <li> With the Vivite product line I have been able to stave off the test of time on my face.</li>
            <li> I swear this cream isn&#x27;t the same product.  I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 3 years now so I should know. It doesn&#x27;t smell the same, no tingling or tightening affect&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ve been scammed!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am appalled!</li>
            <li> Great cream and great price</li>
            <li> If you used the old MD Forte eye cream before, they have discontinued it.  After two days of in-depth research and two phone calls, we found that this is the true replacement for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has sworn by the old MD Forte for many many years and her face is beautiful from using it.  We were very happy to find this as the suitable replacement, and being a little cheaper than the old one is nicer on the wallet as well.</li>
            <li> I am a nurse and one of our plastic surgeons recommended this product line. I have been using this for a year and I can diffinitely see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Have used it for many years.</li>
            <li> Love it.i also love the serum.I will keep using all the vivite productsthe best on the Let me know about new products.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my dermatologist. I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and like it. A small dab does the trick.</li>
