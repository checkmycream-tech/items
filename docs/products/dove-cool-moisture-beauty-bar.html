            <li>I really enjoy Dove soap because it lathers real nicely.  </li>

            <li>Love Dove.</li>
            <li>I LOVE  Dove products.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pay 37% more than you have to.</li>
            <li>I was drawn to this product because I love the cucumber/green tea scent.</li>
            <li>I, like most men, thought, \\&quot;Dove?</li>
            <li>My skin got better in just two days of using this soap.</li>
            <li>The smell is so awesome that I left an unwrapped bar of Dove in my lingere drawer as a sachet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this soap.  </li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>It dissolves so easily</li>
            <li>Dove is so easy on me</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a strong smell, or any smell afterwards, so don&#x27;t get it if you wanna smell like cucumbers.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Dove Cool Moisture Beauty Bar.</li>
            <li>I previously purchased Dove products and was very happy about those including soap bars (I purchased it from Malaysia).</li>
            <li>It gives me a very fresh, clean feeling, with no lingering scents once I&#x27;m rinsed off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Final Thoughts - PASS, unless that is, you get a smoking hot deal comparable or even better to mine.  </li>
            <li>After I started to live on my own</li>
            <li>And I have to say the scent is just right, not too strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Better and safer to use than the Axe products (which contain carcinogens that stimulate the mutation of healthy skin cells into cancerous lesions) the Dove Essentials Body Mist, Bar Soap, and Body Wash are all fresh and safe to use directly on your skin.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the Cool Moisture bar</li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh and smooth ever since I started using this bar.  </li>
            <li>Dove is infused with moisturizer and is so mild that it will not strip away your own natural skin protection.</li>
            <li>The fresh odor and cool feeling of applying the deodorant, the body soap (in liquid or bar form) and the body spray makes me feel and smell</li>
            <li>I keep my head cropped pretty short, and it lathers so good that I use this on my stubble as a shampoo.</li>
            <li>If your skin is dry, but you still love to lather up with soap to get that really clean feeling, Dove Cool Moisture Beauty Bar is something you should give a</li>
            <li>Lets get right to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros------------------------&lt;br /&gt;-Value - I picked up 14 bars for $8.92 cents.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this soap it leaves your skin so soft and gentle</li>
            <li>The bodywash version on the other hand has way too much scent and irritates my skin surprisingly.</li>
            <li>I have used this soap since it first came out.  </li>
            <li>Even most of the \\&quot;Men&#x27;s\\&quot; series recently placed on the market by Dove are a bit musky and unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you will not find a better price or quality in product such as this one anywhere else.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel more refined than I actually am.</li>
            <li>If I smell my skin afterwards, it just smells clean and natural.</li>
            <li>Only downside is, you&#x27;ll go through these bars real fast as they tend to dissolve quickly.</li>
            <li>The Green Tea and Cucumber odor of all of Dove&#x27;s soaps and body mists with this odor is amazing.</li>
            <li>i am a huge fan of dove, especially when i can get it cheaper!</li>
            <li>I have always used Dove hypoallergenic scent free soap, ever since a dermatologist recommended it to me as a teen.</li>
            <li>I reccommmend to everybody to please purchase all your needs and wants here</li>
            <li>This was too much money.  </li>
            <li>and I would have come out much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Only problem is most of their scents had that \\&quot;Old Lady\\</li>
            <li>It is subtle, but pleasant and not overpowering, whereas about 75% of the fragrances on the market truly stink and make me wince.</li>
            <li>since I had hope it would still keep the same moisturizing effect the original dove bar had, but add in a fragrance I preferred.     </li>
            <li>This soap is soft and non drying but the smell is really overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much the only thing I use in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I found that the green tea scent enhanced the cucumber and gave it a more of a herbal effect.</li>
            <li>I live on my own and probably use up a bar every few months, so this is going to last years.</li>
            <li>DOVE relieves my eczema and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation (I&#x27;m very sensitive).  </li>
            <li>Been using Dove for 8 years now and it never gets old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised someone would use the term pungent to describe the scent.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and Dove was recommended by my doctor.</li>
            <li>Growing up my family always used Dove bar soap and while it always left my skin smooth I always preferred the smell of Irish Spring over the white dove bar.  </li>
            <li>This much soap in one container can smell up an entire linen closet.</li>
            <li>Because it lathers really well and left my skin feeling cool,soft,refreshed and moisturized.</li>
            <li>- The scent was pleasant, it wasn&#x27;t BAD, but wasn&#x27;t really anything</li>
            <li>but it is pure quality in my opinion and having tried other brands and types of soaps</li>
            <li>We use this soap all the time and this is the first time we have bought it on amazon and it was 4.00 less then where we used to buy it.</li>
            <li>Dove is the only soap that does not dry my skin out or gives me a rash.  </li>
            <li>Self - The actual soap bar, is quite weak, I found that it broke very easily.&lt;br /&gt;-Longevity -  The bar burns through its size quite fast.  </li>

            <li> try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is so clean, and after your shower you will not have that tight, dry feeling that ordinary soap can cause.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using dove products for a very long time now.</li>
            <li> The weight of the bar is 4.25 OZ/120 g (which lasts for a very long time).If you have dry skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Notes:  I have skin that doesn&#x27;t dry out or get to oily.  </li>
            <li> and I kept seeing my skin would always be dry.  </li>
            <li> These bars are sold in our local NJ stores for $1 a piece on average.</li>
            <li> and sometimes I have to add a moisturizing body wash to my routine as I feel this dove soap can dry my skin out a little (either that or not moisturize it enough).</li>
            <li> As the years went by, my skin started to become very dry.</li>
            <li> I think the fact that the bar would constantly break and little pieces would fall off contributed to this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not have the expected quality at all.</li>
            <li> Not much to review here.</li>
            <li> I know Dove may be a bit pricier than other bar soaps</li>
            <li> My skin does tend to get a little dry in the winter</li>
            <li> Literally, I had 7 bars ( the other 7 were given to my parents) and they lasted me a little less than 3 months.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not into heavily scented soaps, but I decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> For less than a $1 per bar (using subscribe &amp; save), this is a bargain!</li>
            <li> Usually buy these at Costco, but Amazon has them cheaper from time to time.    </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> I think you can get this soap less expensive at Walmart.  </li>
            <li> But this soap bar is useless.</li>
            <li> , you wont go wrong.</li>
            <li> &quot; I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I hate it and will never recommend it to anyone.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Been using Dove for 8 years now and it never gets old. Skin feels amazing afterwards.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a strong smell, or any smell afterwards, so don&#x27;t get it if you wanna smell like cucumbers.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap since it first came out.  Dove is great but this scent makes it better.  Dove is the only soap that does not dry my skin out or gives me a rash.  Only problem is most of their scents had that \\&quot;Old Lady\\&quot; smell.  This one is quite refreshing.  I like the shampoo version also.  The bodywash version on the other hand has way too much scent and irritates my skin surprisingly.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased Dove products and was very happy about those including soap bars (I purchased it from Malaysia). But this soap bar is useless. It does not have the expected quality at all. It dissolves so easily and I found it coats all place I kept it. I hate it and will never recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. Scent is not overpowering. My skin does tend to get a little dry in the winter and sometimes I have to add a moisturizing body wash to my routine as I feel this dove soap can dry my skin out a little (either that or not moisturize it enough).</li>
            <li> Usually buy these at Costco, but Amazon has them cheaper from time to time.    Its soap.  Not much to review here.</li>
            <li> I have always used Dove hypoallergenic scent free soap, ever since a dermatologist recommended it to me as a teen. So I&#x27;m not into heavily scented soaps, but I decided to give this one a try. And I have to say the scent is just right, not too strong. I&#x27;m surprised someone would use the term pungent to describe the scent. It gives me a very fresh, clean feeling, with no lingering scents once I&#x27;m rinsed off. If I smell my skin afterwards, it just smells clean and natural. And it lathers up real nice. I keep my head cropped pretty short, and it lathers so good that I use this on my stubble as a shampoo. Pretty much the only thing I use in the shower.  Makes a great lather for shaving as well, haven&#x27;t bought shaving cream in years. Only downside is, you&#x27;ll go through these bars real fast as they tend to dissolve quickly.</li>
            <li> The Green Tea and Cucumber odor of all of Dove&#x27;s soaps and body mists with this odor is amazing. It is subtle, but pleasant and not overpowering, whereas about 75% of the fragrances on the market truly stink and make me wince. The fresh odor and cool feeling of applying the deodorant, the body soap (in liquid or bar form) and the body spray makes me feel and smell great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like musk or the perfumey or rubbing alcohol odors of most of the fragrances on the market. Even most of the \\&quot;Men&#x27;s\\&quot; series recently placed on the market by Dove are a bit musky and unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better and safer to use than the Axe products (which contain carcinogens that stimulate the mutation of healthy skin cells into cancerous lesions) the Dove Essentials Body Mist, Bar Soap, and Body Wash are all fresh and safe to use directly on your skin.</li>
            <li> These bars are sold in our local NJ stores for $1 a piece on average. Why should anyone pay $1.5-2 for a mail order?</li>
            <li> Lets get right to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros------------------------&lt;br /&gt;-Value - I picked up 14 bars for $8.92 cents.  That make its $0.67/per bar.  I got it on sale, thus for me, the cost value -was good.&lt;br /&gt;-Scent - The scent was pleasant, it wasn&#x27;t BAD, but wasn&#x27;t really anything amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons---------------------&lt;br /&gt;-The Bar It Self - The actual soap bar, is quite weak, I found that it broke very easily.&lt;br /&gt;-Longevity -  The bar burns through its size quite fast.  Literally, I had 7 bars ( the other 7 were given to my parents) and they lasted me a little less than 3 months.  We&#x27;ll say 80 days to be liberal.  80 days / 7 &#x3D; 11.42 days (again 80 is liberal).  I think the fact that the bar would constantly break and little pieces would fall off contributed to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:  I have skin that doesn&#x27;t dry out or get to oily.  I bought this soap strictly because it was on sale.  So I can&#x27;t comment on whether or not it works in moisturizing and what not.  To my skin, soaps seem to all do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Thoughts - PASS, unless that is, you get a smoking hot deal comparable or even better to mine.  There are better cost effective products out there.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and Dove was recommended by my doctor. I am glad he recommended it because it is the best soap! And Amazon has a great price!</li>
            <li> very good quality and affordable price. this product is outstanding and the price is amazing. you will not find a better price or quality in product such as this one anywhere else. I reccommmend to everybody to please purchase all your needs and wants here, you wont go wrong.</li>
            <li> Growing up my family always used Dove bar soap and while it always left my skin smooth I always preferred the smell of Irish Spring over the white dove bar.  After I started to live on my own I got Irish Spring a lot or used body wash instead and I kept seeing my skin would always be dry.  I decided to try the Cool Moisture bar since I had hope it would still keep the same moisturizing effect the original dove bar had, but add in a fragrance I preferred.     I am happy to say its probably the soap I will buy from now on.  So glad Amazon has a subscribe and save option for this product.  My skin feels fresh and smooth ever since I started using this bar.  The smell is also very refreshing.  I know Dove may be a bit pricier than other bar soaps but it is pure quality in my opinion and having tried other brands and types of soaps I am going to stick with Dove.</li>
            <li> This soap is soft and non drying but the smell is really overpowering.  This much soap in one container can smell up an entire linen closet.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy Dove soap because it lathers real nicely.  Plus, this one does have a very nice scent.  It makes me feel more refined than I actually am.</li>
            <li> We use this soap all the time and this is the first time we have bought it on amazon and it was 4.00 less then where we used to buy it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap it leaves your skin so soft and gentle you come out the shower smelling great</li>
            <li> No complaints about the soap, but keep in mind 14 is a LOT of bars of soap! I live on my own and probably use up a bar every few months, so this is going to last years. Thankfully, it appears that this soap doesn&#x27;t noticeably degrade over time.</li>
            <li> Love Dove. Leaves skin feeling nice. This was a very great buy. After reading some of the reviews I couldn&#x27;t pass it up</li>
            <li> I LOVE  Dove products. This is great to have this delivered to my door without having to go out or have a Costco membership</li>
            <li> i am a huge fan of dove, especially when i can get it cheaper! This product was amazing, i recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good soaps. Overpriced on Amazon. Locally these sell for $0.92 per bar in a 6 pack. This 14 pack is priced at $1.26 each bar. Same 4.25 oz bars. Don&#x27;t pay 37% more than you have to.</li>
            <li> I think you can get this soap less expensive at Walmart.  This was too much money.  I priced it at Walmart and I would have come out much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using dove products for a very long time now.I absolutely love the Dove Cool Moisture Beauty Bar.Why? Because it lathers really well and left my skin feeling cool,soft,refreshed and moisturized.I was drawn to this product because I love the cucumber/green tea scent. I found that the green tea scent enhanced the cucumber and gave it a more of a herbal effect.The weight of the bar is 4.25 OZ/120 g (which lasts for a very long time).If you have dry skin this is an excellent beauty bar to use...I recommend 100% !!!</li>
            <li> Ever since i started using this soap, i can&#x27;t think of using anything else! This will always be my favorite soap!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I felt a need to share my experience with using Dove soap. I&#x27;ve used Zest and Dial all my life and never had a problem with it. As the years went by, my skin started to become very dry. I, like most men, thought, \\&quot;Dove? Oh it must be for women. I&#x27;m too manly to use Dove.\\&quot; I was wrong. This is the best soap ever. My skin got better in just two days of using this soap. For less than a $1 per bar (using subscribe &amp; save), this is a bargain!</li>
            <li> If your skin is dry, but you still love to lather up with soap to get that really clean feeling, Dove Cool Moisture Beauty Bar is something you should give a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is so clean, and after your shower you will not have that tight, dry feeling that ordinary soap can cause. Dove is infused with moisturizer and is so mild that it will not strip away your own natural skin protection. The smell is so awesome that I left an unwrapped bar of Dove in my lingere drawer as a sachet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  DOVE relieves my eczema and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation (I&#x27;m very sensitive).  Dove is so easy on me and I love the smell.</li>
