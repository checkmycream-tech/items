            <li>I am now able to grow it out for longer periods of time before I get split ends and need a hair cut.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love that it comes with a pump, and the price couldn&#x27;t be better.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased by the sale and quick response.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and breaks easily.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and this stuff really tames the frizzes and also gives my hair a wonderful shine.  </li>
            <li>This was carefully packaged and arrived at my home in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and fairly priced from this seller.</li>
            <li>It also has a very soft, pleasant fragrance that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>My stylist first introduced me to this product and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Best hair product hands down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried countless argan oil treatments to try to find a more affordable alternative and have never been successful in finding anything that works as well for me as this product.</li>
            <li>This product was delivered quickly and were unused!</li>
            <li>The best part is that it makes my hair look even better the next day, so I&#x27;m not forced to wash it.  </li>
            <li>This product has been a huge help in preventing damage.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic pricingon Amzon for this oversized bottle.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair is colored and this really smooths the hair and gives it a nice shiny look.</li>
            <li>No flyaways, smooth and shiny hair, and it smells like a dream.  </li>
            <li>but when it finally arrived and i tried it ,great product no complaints here.</li>
            <li>I use primarily on the ends away from the scalp.</li>
            <li>Keep my hair smooth and shine.</li>
            <li>I constantly receive compliments on how good it smells and many of my friends use it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My beautiful long locks just broke off in my hands mid-way up the length.  </li>
            <li>And largesize of bottle is very useful.</li>
            <li>When dry, it isn&#x27;t oily at all, but your hair looks smooth and shiny and feels great.</li>
            <li>Worth every cent!  </li>
            <li>is a great purchase price in the long run.  </li>
            <li>I dunno if that&#x27;s accurate or a good thing, but just throwing that in there in case anyone else can back that up.)</li>
            <li>Always love this product, liked the big bottle for the discounted price.</li>
            <li>It is the ONLY hair product I need because it&#x27;s so good.</li>
            <li>It also helps to hold my style better without as much hair spray.  </li>
            <li>makes frizzy hair smoother, just a tiny amount is all you need (size of a dime)&lt;br /&gt;supposed to be good for your hair but who knows right?</li>
            <li>Love buying the larger size - more economical.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and silky, yet strong!</li>
            <li>It&#x27; very good, I&#x27; m not sure though if it&#x27;s worth having it sent here to Brazil</li>
            <li>It really works well at giving me the fullness that I need for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Adds Sheen and subtle moisture with an amazing scent !!</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>This product, however, is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Well worth the expense.  </li>
            <li>(Also, I was introduced to this by my hair stylist who said that it&#x27;s better than some of the other comparable hair treatments, but that it&#x27;s better because it doesn&#x27;t use alcohol.</li>
            <li>They were right.</li>
            <li>Unbelievable great product and the price was twice cheaper than in hair salons.</li>
            <li>The bottle was not properly packed and it had leaked all over the box because the pump wasn&#x27;t locked and even if locked will not have fit in the box (is this product in that condition original and worth the $70.00?).</li>
            <li>Seller shipped super fast.</li>
            <li>It gives a light scent and soft feel to freshly washed hair.</li>
            <li>I use the intense hydrating treatment as well and these two products together make your hair more alive.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my hair shine - without being too heavy...  Love the fragrance</li>
            <li>Cant live without it!!!</li>
            <li>I like this oil very much.</li>
            <li>I have hair that is fine and curls softly.  </li>
            <li>In the future we are going to buy on Amazon, its so quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First of all, the picture does not represent what you get.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
            <li>This product is great for middle-aged hair that loses its luster and weight.</li>
            <li>it is NOT a fake.</li>
            <li>Having hair that frizzes at the first sign of humidity, this has been a blessing.</li>
            <li>First my hairstylist recommended me.</li>
            <li>I used to use this and looooooove it, and it&#x27;s first time from this vendor.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product if you can afford it and the moroccanoil line as it does wonder for even the most damaged hair</li>
            <li>and I say this as a woman who was platinum blonde and had well water damage for years:)</li>
            <li>looks pretty always.</li>
            <li>Since I order from Korea it took time as it showed as estimation but much faster than original estimation, and even the shipping was free for international shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A tiny bit leaves your hair shiny, a bit more manageable and it certainly feels healthier.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it smells amazing, and I can rub whatever&#x27;s left on my hands directly on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It has a great smell, is not greasy or heavy and my frequently colored hair stays supple, shiny and manageable.  </li>
            <li>mmmmmmm, not so sure about that (or you as the seller be responsible and ethical enough to list those details on the description).</li>
            <li>On the rare day that I straighten it, I only need 2 pumps of oil and round brush; and I come out with better results than most salons.  </li>
            <li>If you use more than one pump or apply it on dry hair, you risk your hair looking greasy.</li>
            <li>Love this for moisturizing my brittle, dry, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>this is a great product works well on my type of hair, having very thick and wavy&lt;</li>
            <li>This really helps.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>Really does wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels REAL now.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It used to leave my hair absolutely silky, now it&#x27;s not happening anymore.</li>
            <li>This enables me to weat smooth styles without worrying about having my hair frizz up three sizes bigger by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>It is really work.</li>
            <li>In conjuction with medication and over the last 3-4 years, my hair is now silky and soft with more strength against breakage.  </li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last long but is nice when you first put in, all in all</li>
            <li>My hair is dry and broke easily when combing or brushing.  </li>
            <li>Oil works nicely for curly hair, short or long.</li>
            <li>I had heard so much about this product and the high price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African american and love it , a friend who is blond uses the light version and loves it and another friend who is Asian uses it and loves it.</li>
            <li>Just be aware that if you&#x27;re trying to avoid silicone in your hair, you should steer clear of this product; that&#x27;s what makes it hold and stay so well.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li>Cannot live without this Moroccan oil!</li>
            <li>I dye my hair regularly, and this oil keeps it soft, shiny, and relatively free of split ends.  </li>
            <li>Definitely ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years, makes my hair shiny and soft and smell quite nice - doesn&#x27;t have an oily feeling after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sticking with the original because why mess with success.  </li>
            <li>You will more than likely receive a bottle reserved for salon use with large letters on the label reading: FOR PROFESSIONAL USE ONLY.</li>
            <li>highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The price is high but the product works for us.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>after I put on my hair, my hands felt so soft.... tried it on my face!!</li>
            <li>So sad, this is a great product, however they do not ship or protect it with packaging at all.  </li>
            <li>It was packaged perfectly, double boxed/wrapped in the original packaging with the cap on tight, bottle was brand new &amp; unopened, full to the rim and</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>it really is a fabulous product and worth the extra expense versus the competitve grocery store products that seem to be less concentrated.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally thick, wavy hair that frizzes very easily.  </li>
            <li>Another thing to note is this is an oil based product which means people with very sensitive or oily skin may break out</li>
            <li>Love the smell &amp; the way my hair shines with just a small amount, plus doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel oily.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived sooner than expected; packaging was adequate.</li>
            <li>However, a hairdresser friend of mine advises that it&#x27;s not for everyone; if your hair is fine, the oil may be too heavy for it.</li>
            <li>A large bottle, inspite of its expense will last over a year.</li>
            <li>Hard to believe when you apply this product that your hair won&#x27;t be greasy but not the case I have been using this product line forever a year and love it.</li>
            <li>I have loads of naturally curly hair, and it takes away the frizz without leaving my hair looking oily.  </li>
            <li>I had a perm that caused considerable hair damage.</li>
            <li>I still had the pump from my old package</li>
            <li>so i didn&#x27;t need to do any follow up, but if I didn&#x27;t have the old package, i would have had the hassle of trying to get a replacement.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair silky and soft, without a greasy look.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my curls soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>Helps my thick hair try faster and more shiny</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended to use it on wet hair, right out of the shower, and I agree.  </li>
            <li>The truth is you need very little to make a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I have used other oils in the past (L&#x27;Oreal EverSleek, Kerastasse&#x27;s Elixir Ultime (my 2nd favorite and certainly not as expensive); but this one is a 10 for me.</li>
            <li>I use the Moroccan Oil first on my hair when it&#x27;s wet - then apply the volumizing mousse, then the root boost.  </li>
            <li>I also smooth a little on after flat ironing.  </li>
            <li>Spend the extra $10 and buy it at your local salon - hey, you&#x27;ll be supporting local businesses while you&#x27;re at it!</li>
            <li>Be careful not to use too much.  </li>
            <li>It only takes a few drops and your hair will be smooth and shiney until the next shampoo.</li>
            <li>My stylist put the change down to aging (thanks a lot!), and recommended Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for anyone with damaged or dry hair from overcoloring or heat.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other oil and serums when the price of MoroccanOil got to be too much for me</li>
            <li>The product comes inside a blue box, I opened one end of the blue box to find the glass bottle had completely shattered.  </li>
            <li>(there&#x27;s a lot of silicone in it) and will absolutely weigh finer hair down.</li>
            <li>This product really needs to be used in dry hair, if your hair is wet it doesn&#x27;t absorb as well.</li>

            <li> I am now able to grow it out for longer periods of time before I get split ends and need a hair cut.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love that it comes with a pump, and the price couldn&#x27;t be better.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased by the sale and quick response.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and breaks easily.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and this stuff really tames the frizzes and also gives my hair a wonderful shine.  </li>
            <li> This was carefully packaged and arrived at my home in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and fairly priced from this seller.</li>
            <li> It also has a very soft, pleasant fragrance that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> My stylist first introduced me to this product and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Best hair product hands down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless argan oil treatments to try to find a more affordable alternative and have never been successful in finding anything that works as well for me as this product.</li>
            <li> This product was delivered quickly and were unused!</li>
            <li> The best part is that it makes my hair look even better the next day, so I&#x27;m not forced to wash it.  </li>
            <li> This product has been a huge help in preventing damage.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic pricingon Amzon for this oversized bottle.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair is colored and this really smooths the hair and gives it a nice shiny look.</li>
            <li> No flyaways, smooth and shiny hair, and it smells like a dream.  </li>
            <li> but when it finally arrived and i tried it ,great product no complaints here.</li>
            <li> I use primarily on the ends away from the scalp.</li>
            <li> Keep my hair smooth and shine.</li>
            <li> I constantly receive compliments on how good it smells and many of my friends use it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My beautiful long locks just broke off in my hands mid-way up the length.  </li>
            <li> And largesize of bottle is very useful.</li>
            <li> When dry, it isn&#x27;t oily at all, but your hair looks smooth and shiny and feels great.</li>
            <li> Worth every cent!  </li>
            <li> is a great purchase price in the long run.  </li>
            <li> I dunno if that&#x27;s accurate or a good thing, but just throwing that in there in case anyone else can back that up.)</li>
            <li> Always love this product, liked the big bottle for the discounted price.</li>
            <li> It is the ONLY hair product I need because it&#x27;s so good.</li>
            <li> It also helps to hold my style better without as much hair spray.  </li>
            <li> makes frizzy hair smoother, just a tiny amount is all you need (size of a dime)&lt;br /&gt;supposed to be good for your hair but who knows right?</li>
            <li> Love buying the larger size - more economical.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and silky, yet strong!</li>
            <li> It&#x27; very good, I&#x27; m not sure though if it&#x27;s worth having it sent here to Brazil</li>
            <li> It really works well at giving me the fullness that I need for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Adds Sheen and subtle moisture with an amazing scent !!</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> This product, however, is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Well worth the expense.  </li>
            <li> (Also, I was introduced to this by my hair stylist who said that it&#x27;s better than some of the other comparable hair treatments, but that it&#x27;s better because it doesn&#x27;t use alcohol.</li>
            <li> They were right.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable great product and the price was twice cheaper than in hair salons.</li>
            <li> The bottle was not properly packed and it had leaked all over the box because the pump wasn&#x27;t locked and even if locked will not have fit in the box (is this product in that condition original and worth the $70.00?).</li>
            <li> Seller shipped super fast.</li>
            <li> It gives a light scent and soft feel to freshly washed hair.</li>
            <li> I use the intense hydrating treatment as well and these two products together make your hair more alive.  </li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair shine - without being too heavy...  Love the fragrance</li>
            <li> Cant live without it!!!</li>
            <li> I like this oil very much.</li>
            <li> I have hair that is fine and curls softly.  </li>
            <li> In the future we are going to buy on Amazon, its so quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First of all, the picture does not represent what you get.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
            <li> This product is great for middle-aged hair that loses its luster and weight.</li>
            <li> it is NOT a fake.</li>
            <li> Having hair that frizzes at the first sign of humidity, this has been a blessing.</li>
            <li> First my hairstylist recommended me.</li>
            <li> I used to use this and looooooove it, and it&#x27;s first time from this vendor.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product if you can afford it and the moroccanoil line as it does wonder for even the most damaged hair</li>
            <li> and I say this as a woman who was platinum blonde and had well water damage for years:)</li>
            <li> looks pretty always.</li>
            <li> Since I order from Korea it took time as it showed as estimation but much faster than original estimation, and even the shipping was free for international shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A tiny bit leaves your hair shiny, a bit more manageable and it certainly feels healthier.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it smells amazing, and I can rub whatever&#x27;s left on my hands directly on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It has a great smell, is not greasy or heavy and my frequently colored hair stays supple, shiny and manageable.  </li>
            <li> mmmmmmm, not so sure about that (or you as the seller be responsible and ethical enough to list those details on the description).</li>
            <li> On the rare day that I straighten it, I only need 2 pumps of oil and round brush; and I come out with better results than most salons.  </li>
            <li> If you use more than one pump or apply it on dry hair, you risk your hair looking greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this for moisturizing my brittle, dry, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> this is a great product works well on my type of hair, having very thick and wavy&lt;</li>
            <li> This really helps.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> Really does wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels REAL now.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It used to leave my hair absolutely silky, now it&#x27;s not happening anymore.</li>
            <li> This enables me to weat smooth styles without worrying about having my hair frizz up three sizes bigger by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> It is really work.</li>
            <li> In conjuction with medication and over the last 3-4 years, my hair is now silky and soft with more strength against breakage.  </li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last long but is nice when you first put in, all in all</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and broke easily when combing or brushing.  </li>
            <li> Oil works nicely for curly hair, short or long.</li>
            <li> I had heard so much about this product and the high price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African american and love it , a friend who is blond uses the light version and loves it and another friend who is Asian uses it and loves it.</li>
            <li> Just be aware that if you&#x27;re trying to avoid silicone in your hair, you should steer clear of this product; that&#x27;s what makes it hold and stay so well.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> Cannot live without this Moroccan oil!</li>
            <li> I dye my hair regularly, and this oil keeps it soft, shiny, and relatively free of split ends.  </li>
            <li> Definitely ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, makes my hair shiny and soft and smell quite nice - doesn&#x27;t have an oily feeling after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sticking with the original because why mess with success.  </li>
            <li> You will more than likely receive a bottle reserved for salon use with large letters on the label reading: FOR PROFESSIONAL USE ONLY.</li>
            <li> highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The price is high but the product works for us.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> after I put on my hair, my hands felt so soft.... tried it on my face!!</li>
            <li> So sad, this is a great product, however they do not ship or protect it with packaging at all.  </li>
            <li> It was packaged perfectly, double boxed/wrapped in the original packaging with the cap on tight, bottle was brand new &amp; unopened, full to the rim and</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> it really is a fabulous product and worth the extra expense versus the competitve grocery store products that seem to be less concentrated.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally thick, wavy hair that frizzes very easily.  </li>
            <li> Another thing to note is this is an oil based product which means people with very sensitive or oily skin may break out</li>
            <li> Love the smell &amp; the way my hair shines with just a small amount, plus doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel oily.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived sooner than expected; packaging was adequate.</li>
            <li> However, a hairdresser friend of mine advises that it&#x27;s not for everyone; if your hair is fine, the oil may be too heavy for it.</li>
            <li> A large bottle, inspite of its expense will last over a year.</li>
            <li> Hard to believe when you apply this product that your hair won&#x27;t be greasy but not the case I have been using this product line forever a year and love it.</li>
            <li> I have loads of naturally curly hair, and it takes away the frizz without leaving my hair looking oily.  </li>
            <li> I had a perm that caused considerable hair damage.</li>
            <li> I still had the pump from my old package</li>
            <li> so i didn&#x27;t need to do any follow up, but if I didn&#x27;t have the old package, i would have had the hassle of trying to get a replacement.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair silky and soft, without a greasy look.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my curls soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> Helps my thick hair try faster and more shiny</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended to use it on wet hair, right out of the shower, and I agree.  </li>
            <li> The truth is you need very little to make a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I have used other oils in the past (L&#x27;Oreal EverSleek, Kerastasse&#x27;s Elixir Ultime (my 2nd favorite and certainly not as expensive); but this one is a 10 for me.</li>
            <li> I use the Moroccan Oil first on my hair when it&#x27;s wet - then apply the volumizing mousse, then the root boost.  </li>
            <li> I also smooth a little on after flat ironing.  </li>
            <li> Spend the extra $10 and buy it at your local salon - hey, you&#x27;ll be supporting local businesses while you&#x27;re at it!</li>
            <li> Be careful not to use too much.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a few drops and your hair will be smooth and shiney until the next shampoo.</li>
            <li> My stylist put the change down to aging (thanks a lot!), and recommended Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for anyone with damaged or dry hair from overcoloring or heat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other oil and serums when the price of MoroccanOil got to be too much for me</li>
            <li> The product comes inside a blue box, I opened one end of the blue box to find the glass bottle had completely shattered.  </li>
            <li> (there&#x27;s a lot of silicone in it) and will absolutely weigh finer hair down.</li>
            <li> This product really needs to be used in dry hair, if your hair is wet it doesn&#x27;t absorb as well.</li>
            <li> A tiny drop will do, so it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Although this product is pricey it does last a long time b/c</li>
            <li> so it will last long so you do not have to buy it all the time.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty thick, wavy to curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It will last a very long time so</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and only need one or two pumps to do the job...</li>
            <li> This stuff has totally revitalized my dry, brittle, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> With this treatment a little goes a long way, I have made a considerable dent in my bottle</li>
            <li> I need more than the recommended amount, but I can&#x27;t go crazy or it does make my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> I will be using this finishing product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The deep conditioning is a capful on wet hair, and then cap your head and wrap a towel or apply heat.  </li>
            <li> but I have extremely long hair</li>
            <li> Ok I just heard back from them,I will get my money back... still :(</li>
            <li> We have tried other products to same money..</li>
            <li> I have purchased other Moroccan oil products that leave your hair totally greasy.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive but well worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the older side now and my hair looked so dull (like doll hair)</li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s very long, and I have to use conditioner on my \\&quot;pony</li>
            <li> We use it every day and it goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> About a year ago, I noticed that it was getting really dry, even though I hadn&#x27;t changed anything in my hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> I have really dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this oil and all the other items from this miraculous brand!</li>
            <li> It seems pricey but this oil goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> Recommend this to anyone with dry hair!  </li>
            <li> I have very dry, curly hair and am convinced of the benefits--conditioning, control and shine.  </li>
            <li> No more frizz &amp; extra shine that last all day long!!!  </li>
            <li> you only need a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful who you order this from on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily on wet hair and as your hair dries, is thickens and moisturizes.</li>
            <li> it takes all friz away and looks fluid without being heavy.</li>
            <li> however it seems that if you use the product minimally this problem can be avoided.</li>
            <li> When you apply a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years despite the price because it WORKS on my half black, half jewish curls.</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews complaining that it did not come with a cap.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Typically I have ordered the same product from sellers in the past, where they put the pump on before shipping so the product ends up leaking all over during shipment.  </li>
            <li> I know there are other brands now,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried it on wet hair--but it has never made my hair feel the least bit greasy.</li>
            <li> I have noticed reduced breakage and less split ends.  </li>
            <li> I aid a little of MoroccanOil</li>
            <li> I also use the Moroccan Oil Spray - just a little hold a few unruly strands in place.  </li>
            <li> But use sparingly--hair can feel dirty if a dab too much.</li>
            <li> otherwise you will waste a lot of the product.</li>
            <li> It gives hair a sheen that doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy.  </li>
            <li> I Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have gotten a few people hooked on it.</li>
            <li> 90% less split ends!</li>
            <li> My hair looks shiny and heavy and it always smells for the next 3 days as if I wore an expensive perfume.</li>
            <li> With all the bad reviews I&#x27;ve seen, I wanted to see something positive for once about this product.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount in the palm which of my hand, rub hands together, then apply to the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> Just need a small amount on your ends.</li>
            <li> The smell is divine and the hold it gives me is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy if you don&#x27;t go overboard.</li>
            <li> inside the USPS box was one small sheet of bubble wrap, which did nothing to stop the product from moving around in the box.  </li>
            <li> ( cause it&#x27;s very expensive to biy here), or if other local products would do the trick.</li>
            <li> it is very heavy</li>
            <li> I have very heavy and thick hair</li>
            <li> I have always had thick, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I only wish it weren&#x27;t so ungodly expensive!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the other reviews before purchasing and I am sorry I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s too expensive to waste.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Thin hair requires 1 pump, while longer, thicker hair needs 2.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for the faint of hair</li>
            <li> I am so sad, this product was an expensive treat for myself and now I am stuck with glass shards of what could have been.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the pumper was broke when opened the package.  </li>
            <li> It was so bad USPS had to put 2 plastic bags around the box.  </li>
            <li> Hate to run out of this before I reorder</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!  </li>
            <li> What a terrible experience, I am not buying a $10.00 product, this is $70!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe in spending outrageous amounts of money on hair products.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this STUFF!!! It smells so good &amp; works really good too. When you apply a little goes a long way. I just apply to the ends of my hair which are the dryest (split ends, damaged, colored, environmental damage). This really helps. I put a small amount in the palm which of my hand, rub hands together, then apply to the ends of my hair. Everyone is always asking me what do you use in your hair, it smells so good. Compliments all the time. You can use it once a day or twice a day (morning or bedtime or both). Seller shipped super fast. Highly Recommended! Thanks!</li>
            <li> LOVE MoroccanOil Hair treatment. Fabulous product &amp; good price. Really does wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  I have loads of naturally curly hair, and it takes away the frizz without leaving my hair looking oily.  Plus, it smells amazing, and I can rub whatever&#x27;s left on my hands directly on my skin.  I only wish it weren&#x27;t so ungodly expensive!</li>
            <li> First of all, the picture does not represent what you get. I got the size advertised but it was not sealed, it already had the pump and it said \\&quot;for stylist use, not for sale\\&quot;. The bottle was not properly packed and it had leaked all over the box because the pump wasn&#x27;t locked and even if locked will not have fit in the box (is this product in that condition original and worth the $70.00?). Tried to contact the seller through Amazon, no response. I called the phone number on the invoice, someone just said \\&quot;hello\\&quot;? Isn&#x27;t a Company supposed to identify themselves and answer with some manners? Anyway, she said Amazon does not allow them to post their own pictures... mmmmmmm, not so sure about that (or you as the seller be responsible and ethical enough to list those details on the description). She also said she  was going to contact me the same day and let me know if I would get a refund or another bottle, still haven&#x27;t heard from her. Called the number, no reply, no voicemail identifying themselves. Let&#x27;s see what&#x27;s gonna happen. What a terrible experience, I am not buying a $10.00 product, this is $70! Ok I just heard back from them,I will get my money back... still :(</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and this stuff really tames the frizzes and also gives my hair a wonderful shine.  Smells great too!!</li>
            <li> The product did not come with the pump to apply.</li>
            <li> Moroccan oil is the super good !!&lt;br /&gt;I do not need to make my hair in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I just apply this product in the morning  ....and my hair looks good !!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li> I have wiry, coarse hair that frizzes in humidity. I use one pump of this stuff when my hair is still damp, and it smooths out the frizz WITHOUT making my hair greasy. If you use more than one pump or apply it on dry hair, you risk your hair looking greasy. It also has a very soft, pleasant fragrance that isn&#x27;t overpowering. (Also, I was introduced to this by my hair stylist who said that it&#x27;s better than some of the other comparable hair treatments, but that it&#x27;s better because it doesn&#x27;t use alcohol. I dunno if that&#x27;s accurate or a good thing, but just throwing that in there in case anyone else can back that up.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and I LOVE IT! It is so good for your hair and leaves it smelling and feeling lovely. It is the ONLY hair product I need because it&#x27;s so good. I highly recommend this product. It seems pricey but this oil goes a very long way! Fantastic pricingon Amzon for this oversized bottle.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff. Apply after I get out of the shower. It gives shine and controls frizz without any heaviness or greasiness.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I was introduced to Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment by my salon hairdresser.  The condition of my colored hair is no longer like straw.  It leaves my hair manageable with lots of shine.  Drying and styling my hair has never been easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the older side now and my hair looked so dull (like doll hair) and I found this product and it is amazing. My hair looks and feels REAL now. I could never go without it.</li>
            <li> This has been a hair staple of mine since 2010. My hair thrives with this oil; it is so versatile. I use it for protective styles, flex-rod sets, and when I straighten my hair. I absolutely love this product and am continually buying it!</li>
            <li> using it for two years now. keeps my hair from drying out.</li>
            <li> Packaging &amp; Shipping on this product were great! Product itself was in perfect condition! Thanks!</li>
            <li> The reason why I refund this product is....no pump in the box! This is 6.8oz bottle and the pump is very important to use. I saw the pump in that photo but I dont know why the item which i recieved has no pump</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful and sold at a great price! This was carefully packaged and arrived at my home in perfect condition. Thank you. I will definitely do business with you again!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased by the sale and quick response.  I love this product. It does everything they say it does</li>
            <li> I use this on my sister locs. It gives a light scent and soft feel to freshly washed hair. Wonderful.</li>
            <li> This works great and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Hard to believe when you apply this product that your hair won&#x27;t be greasy but not the case I have been using this product line forever a year and love it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff! i wish they sold them in five gallon buckets! this stuff makes your hair smell fantastic and makes it feel even better!</li>
            <li> I like this oil very much.This is 4th one already.Smell is very good too!!&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair. About a year ago, I noticed that it was getting really dry, even though I hadn&#x27;t changed anything in my hair care regimen. My stylist put the change down to aging (thanks a lot!), and recommended Moroccan Oil. The difference it has made is nothing short of miraculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day after I shower. I&#x27;ve only tried it on wet hair--but it has never made my hair feel the least bit greasy. Truly excellent product.</li>
            <li> I call this my hair crack!! Love it</li>
            <li> I love this product and have ordered many times on Amazon over the course of time.  I use it to straighten my hair and to insure that the ends do not become split or burnt from dryer or straighener.  I constantly receive compliments on how good it smells and many of my friends use it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note I have had amazon suppliers send me either the product from Israel with no English language and or like this last time the company actually sold me a sales sample that is not for retail sale.  Just be careful who you order this from on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Hate to run out of this before I reorder cause I cannot stand my fly away hair.  This gives my hair great texture and shine.</li>
            <li> Worth every cent!  I had heard so much about this product and the high price.  The truth is you need very little to make a huge difference.  It will last a very long time so is a great purchase price in the long run.  Be careful not to use too much.  I have very long hair and only need one or two pumps to do the job...BUY THE ONE WITH THE PUMP otherwise you will waste a lot of the product.</li>
            <li> I have really dry frizzy hair. I bought this product because my sisters said it was the best thing ever. They were right. I put a leave in conditioner and the Moroccan oil. It leaves my hair, with no frizz at all!</li>
            <li> Great for nourishing hair.</li>
            <li> This oil is the best. Keeps hair silky and smooth. Just need a small amount on your ends. Does not make my already greasy hair, greasy either.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff always us it</li>
            <li> Very good! It makes really smooth and bright hair. I want to buy next time again. And largesize of bottle is very useful.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Packaging was great!</li>
            <li> MoroccanOil has a cult following for a reason. This is the best stuff for frizzy/crazy/curly hair. It&#x27;s not for the faint of hair though - it is very heavy (there&#x27;s a lot of silicone in it) and will absolutely weigh finer hair down. Even I have to avoid my roots to make sure my curls stay bouncy. The smell is divine and the hold it gives me is unbelievable. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years despite the price because it WORKS on my half black, half jewish curls. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other oil and serums when the price of MoroccanOil got to be too much for me but nothing comes close. Just be aware that if you&#x27;re trying to avoid silicone in your hair, you should steer clear of this product; that&#x27;s what makes it hold and stay so well.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair regularly, and this oil keeps it soft, shiny, and relatively free of split ends.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I give moroccan oil hair treatment 5 stars this is a great product works well on my type of hair, having very thick and wavy&lt;br /&gt;hair moroccan oil does the trick. Great great product.</li>
            <li> You will more than likely receive a bottle reserved for salon use with large letters on the label reading: FOR PROFESSIONAL USE ONLY. NOT FOR RESALE. Spend the extra $10 and buy it at your local salon - hey, you&#x27;ll be supporting local businesses while you&#x27;re at it!</li>
            <li> The Moroccan Oil meets &amp; exceeds my expectations. I had a perm that caused considerable hair damage. This has totally improved my hair condition. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year and will continue to do so as the perm grows out.</li>
            <li> This is a staple in my hair care regimen.  I use the product to moisturize my hair.  After I wash my hair I aid a little of MoroccanOil and I am good to go.  I use the intense hydrating treatment as well and these two products together make your hair more alive.  I have noticed reduced breakage and less split ends.  I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a quality product to add to their hair care regimen.  It is pricey but I would recommend it still.  I little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Helps my thick hair try faster and more shiny</li>
            <li> Very good product!  Very light and makes my hair very smooth.  I have been using for over a year now and totally love it!</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever for silky hair. Not oily at all!</li>
            <li> I would walk to the edge of the earth for this product; it is amazing and received it very quickly. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
            <li> Great Price for quality hair product!</li>
            <li> speedy service, great product, great price!</li>
            <li> I have always had thick, frizzy hair.  Moroccan oil tames it and last in between shampoos as well.  It is a bit pricey but well worth it.  It only takes a few drops and your hair will be smooth and shiney until the next shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and couldnt have found a better hair care product !!! I will always use this product it&#x27;s Amazing stuff...</li>
            <li> Wife uses this and loves this. she loves all Moroccan oil products. our bathroom looks like a Moroccan oil store display :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is like heaven in a bottle. I love it. It makes my hair so soft and beautiful. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I like this  so i bought twice .and I will continue use .. thank you</li>
            <li> Always love this product, liked the big bottle for the discounted price.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!!  Totally does what product says!!!  This is definitely a lifetime purchase!!!  No more frizz &amp; extra shine that last all day long!!!  A lil pricey but well worth it!!!</li>
            <li> the best product for hair, cannot live without it. fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This product is great for middle-aged hair that loses its luster and weight. Adds Sheen and subtle moisture with an amazing scent !!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Using it along with the Moroccan Oil Shampoo and Curl Control will make your hair sing! A bottle this size will last a couple of years, if you use it sparingly, and it should be used sparingly. It goes on easily on wet hair and as your hair dries, is thickens and moisturizes. When dry, it isn&#x27;t oily at all, but your hair looks smooth and shiny and feels great.</li>
            <li> I have very heavy and thick hair and this is a great product. My hair is colored and this really smooths the hair and gives it a nice shiny look. It&#x27;s not greasy if you don&#x27;t go overboard. I need more than the recommended amount, but I can&#x27;t go crazy or it does make my hair look greasy. The best part is that it makes my hair look even better the next day, so I&#x27;m not forced to wash it.  I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Best hair product on the market .... And this was such a great price as well! Definitely ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> So sad, this is a great product, however they do not ship or protect it with packaging at all.  I didn&#x27;t read the other reviews before purchasing and I am sorry I didn&#x27;t.  I received the item on time, but oil was saturating the cardboard outer box.  It was so bad USPS had to put 2 plastic bags around the box.  There was no shipping statement so I had no way to contact the seller.  inside the USPS box was one small sheet of bubble wrap, which did nothing to stop the product from moving around in the box.  There was oil all over inside, I think I stained a shirt just trying to photo document the situation.  The product comes inside a blue box, I opened one end of the blue box to find the glass bottle had completely shattered.  I am so sad, this product was an expensive treat for myself and now I am stuck with glass shards of what could have been.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and it is NOT a fake.</li>
            <li> It used to leave my hair absolutely silky, now it&#x27;s not happening anymore. It&#x27; very good, I&#x27; m not sure though if it&#x27;s worth having it sent here to Brazil ( cause it&#x27;s very expensive to biy here), or if other local products would do the trick. (The glimmer version of Marocconoil I don&#x27;t think did anything to my hair)</li>
            <li> Having hair that frizzes at the first sign of humidity, this has been a blessing.</li>
            <li> MoroccanOil is a miracle in a bottle! I definitely recommend this oil and all the other items from this miraculous brand!</li>
            <li> This stuff has totally revitalized my dry, brittle, color-treated hair. It is worth every penny.  I&#x27;ve tried countless argan oil treatments to try to find a more affordable alternative and have never been successful in finding anything that works as well for me as this product.</li>
            <li> We have tried other products to same money..We always come back to Moroccan Oil. Its the best and really worth the money. In the future we are going to buy on Amazon, its so quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I always love Moroccan oil. Nourishing but not greasy</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.  I have been using it for over a year.  My hair is very fine and breaks easily.  This product has been a huge help in preventing damage.</li>
            <li> My scalp is quite oily and I wash my hair every day. However it&#x27;s very long, and I have to use conditioner on my \\&quot;pony tail\\&quot; to keep it shiny and sleek. I don&#x27;t believe in spending outrageous amounts of money on hair products.  I wash my hair with Suave clarifying shampoo and I use Pantene conditioner.  This product, however, is totally worth it. No flyaways, smooth and shiny hair, and it smells like a dream.  A tiny drop will do, so it will last a long time.  I have used other oils in the past (L&#x27;Oreal EverSleek, Kerastasse&#x27;s Elixir Ultime (my 2nd favorite and certainly not as expensive); but this one is a 10 for me. I have read other reviews complaining that it did not come with a cap.  This must have been corrected because I got mine with a cap and a pump and in perfect condition. If you are going to travel, I don&#x27;t recommend you take it with you.  By the time you take the pump out and cap it...you will lose all the product that is in the pump.  And it&#x27;s too expensive to waste.</li>
            <li> I will be using this finishing product for a long time.  It is great for curls and has a delightful smell.</li>
            <li> I have used this oil for two years now on my hair and as an eye makeup removal product.  It&#x27;s great and does not leave hair looking oily but shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I order this product,with caution just to see how it was on my hair but when it finally arrived and i tried it ,great product no complaints here.</li>
            <li> It was as advertised and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, makes my hair shiny and soft and smell quite nice - doesn&#x27;t have an oily feeling after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Oil works nicely for curly hair, short or long. I use it for myself and my child.  Our hair is racially mixed with two different textures but it works for us both.  Product smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave build up. The price is high but the product works for us.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this oil! It makes my hair soft and silky, yet strong! 90% less split ends! I truly enjoy this oil!</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair shine - without being too heavy...  Love the fragrance</li>
            <li> My stylist first introduced me to this product and it is amazing.  I use it everytime I wash my hair, and also a deep conditioning mask every month.  It has a great smell, is not greasy or heavy and my frequently colored hair stays supple, shiny and manageable.  I highly recommend for anyone with damaged or dry hair from overcoloring or heat.  It makes your cuticle smoother and the oils keep your scalp heathly.  My stylist recommended to use it on wet hair, right out of the shower, and I agree.  I also smooth a little on after flat ironing.  The deep conditioning is a capful on wet hair, and then cap your head and wrap a towel or apply heat.  it really is a fabulous product and worth the extra expense versus the competitve grocery store products that seem to be less concentrated.  (based on my opinion - not fact, as I am not a bio-chemist)</li>
            <li> This oil has saved my hair.  Several years ago I was diagnosed with thyroiditis.  My beautiful long locks just broke off in my hands mid-way up the length.  Obviously, I cut all my hair off.  In conjuction with medication and over the last 3-4 years, my hair is now silky and soft with more strength against breakage.  You will not be disappointed!  Thin hair requires 1 pump, while longer, thicker hair needs 2.  A large bottle, inspite of its expense will last over a year.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest hair product I have ever used! It protects your hair from heat and keeps it nice and smooth without making your hair feel oily. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Ordered as gift. Product arrived sooner than expected; packaging was adequate. Recipient &#x3D; very happy with larger 6.8 oz size! I  myself was happy with the price!!!! Will order again!</li>
            <li> Been using this for about 5-6 years.  I have naturally thick, wavy hair that frizzes very easily.  This enables me to weat smooth styles without worrying about having my hair frizz up three sizes bigger by the end of the day.  Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the product!!!  I&#x27;ve used it before and will continue to buy this oil.  Unfortunately the pumper was broke when opened the package.  I still had the pump from my old package so i didn&#x27;t need to do any follow up, but if I didn&#x27;t have the old package, i would have had the hassle of trying to get a replacement.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years (10+) and love it. I use primarily on the ends away from the scalp. It adds luster and smoothes the hair for a sleek look.</li>
            <li> This has worked wonders on my hair and scalp! I no longer feel the need to wear my wig when I go out.</li>
            <li> This works wonders besides it smelling so good :)</li>
            <li> With all the bad reviews I&#x27;ve seen, I wanted to see something positive for once about this product. I ordered the Moroccan Oil treatment on a Friday and received it the following Wednesday.  It was packaged perfectly, double boxed/wrapped in the original packaging with the cap on tight, bottle was brand new &amp; unopened, full to the rim and the pump packaged separately in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically I have ordered the same product from sellers in the past, where they put the pump on before shipping so the product ends up leaking all over during shipment.  I am extremely happy to report that was not the case with this seller!  Will definitely buy from again!! Thank-you!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter got me a trail size a couple of years ago for my hair.... after I put on my hair, my hands felt so soft.... tried it on my face!! .... I love it .... I&#x27;m on my second bottle now....</li>
            <li> This product was delivered quickly and were unused! I love Moroccan Oil with curly/wavy/fruzzy hair...it takes all friz away and looks fluid without being heavy. On top of all of that the price is a great deal! This product comes with a pump too!</li>
            <li> Outstanding Product!  I have purchased this product before after having used it from a salon and it is just great for your hair.  A tiny bit leaves your hair shiny, a bit more manageable and it certainly feels healthier.  Although this product is pricey it does last a long time b/c you only need a little bit.  I have purchased other Moroccan oil products that leave your hair totally greasy. My hair seems to just suck this product in leaving it shiny and feeling great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 years. First my hairstylist recommended me. Compares to my hairs 3 years ago, it&#x27;s shiny and healthy now. Great scent too.</li>
            <li> I used to use this and looooooove it, and it&#x27;s first time from this vendor.  Since I order from Korea it took time as it showed as estimation but much faster than original estimation, and even the shipping was free for international shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed one star since this product is labeled salon only, anyway I like this.</li>
            <li> The product is so good on your hair.  Getting this big bottle so it will last long so you do not have to buy it all the time.  I use this product on my hair for day and night.  I wrap my hair every night with this oil.  It smells so good as well.</li>
            <li> What a great product and so glad we can buy it on Amazon rather than a Salon.  It keeps your hair healthy, smooth and has a wonderful smell. We use it every day and it goes a very long way.  Recommend this to anyone with dry hair!  We certainly love it in Colorado!</li>
            <li> makes frizzy hair smoother, just a tiny amount is all you need (size of a dime)&lt;br /&gt;supposed to be good for your hair but who knows right?</li>
            <li> There is nothing better.  Stop buying the cheaper alternatives, and just spring for this one.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Love the smell &amp; the way my hair shines with just a small amount, plus doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel oily.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick, wavy to curly hair.  On the rare day that I straighten it, I only need 2 pumps of oil and round brush; and I come out with better results than most salons.  When leaving it curly, I add some Boing Cream (by United), and I&#x27;m out the door with manageable curls, that don&#x27;t frizz.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product.  I have hair that is fine and curls softly.  This product gives is bounce and protects it from the elements.  It also smells amazing!!  A must have for any type of hair!!</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and broke easily when combing or brushing.  It has provided strength and shine/gloss to my hair and smells yummy, too!!</li>
            <li> Great item!!  Works better than you will ever think and at a great price!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite product for hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  It gives hair a sheen that doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy.  However, a hairdresser friend of mine advises that it&#x27;s not for everyone; if your hair is fine, the oil may be too heavy for it.</li>
            <li> I use the Moroccan Oil first on my hair when it&#x27;s wet - then apply the volumizing mousse, then the root boost.  It really works well at giving me the fullness that I need for my fine hair.  It also helps to hold my style better without as much hair spray.  I also use the Moroccan Oil Spray - just a little hold a few unruly strands in place.  It&#x27;s the best that I have found for my fine hair.  Also like it because I can still run my brush thru my hair without  breaking my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this for moisturizing my brittle, dry, curly hair.  But use sparingly--hair can feel dirty if a dab too much.</li>
            <li> Always likes it. !!!! I use it for more than a year. Hair is so smooch , shiny</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, great service!</li>
            <li> Great product.. just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Great purchase I love this stuff it&#x27;s the exact product I&#x27;ve use In the past and did I mention the price is a steal.</li>
            <li> Helps my hair stay healthy from the coloring, highlighting and blow drying. Love buying the larger size - more economical.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this by my hair dresser almost three years ago.  I won&#x27;t wash my hair without it.  I have very dry, curly hair and am convinced of the benefits--conditioning, control and shine.  I know there are other brands now, but I&#x27;m sticking with the original because why mess with success.  The shipping was fast and fairly priced from this seller.</li>
            <li> Best hair product hands down. Leaves your hair silky and soft, without a greasy look.  Well worth the expense.  Little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is my second time to order this product.Good for my hair.It is really work.Keep my hair smooth and shine.</li>
            <li> Okay so the product works great to not only restore moisture and help heal damage but is the best detangler I have found. This product really needs to be used in dry hair, if your hair is wet it doesn&#x27;t absorb as well. Another thing to note is this is an oil based product which means people with very sensitive or oily skin may break out however it seems that if you use the product minimally this problem can be avoided. With this treatment a little goes a long way, I have made a considerable dent in my bottle but I have extremely long hair and I was not the only one using it. The smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last long but is nice when you first put in, all in all I would definitely recommend this product if you can afford it and the moroccanoil line as it does wonder for even the most damaged hair and I say this as a woman who was platinum blonde and had well water damage for years:)</li>
            <li> Cannot live without this Moroccan oil! Keeps hair smooth &amp; silky!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable great product and the price was twice cheaper than in hair salons. My hair looks shiny and heavy and it always smells for the next 3 days as if I wore an expensive perfume. Thank you! Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Cant live without it!!! I have tried others and nothing compares to this product. I Use it everyday. I have  curly hair and it make the curl so nice and hair looks pretty always.</li>
            <li> Great product certainly one of the best in the market from my perspective. I have gotten a few people hooked on it. Your hair comes out looking illustrious. Bottle size great advantage for price comparison.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years now and my hair has never been healthier. I am now able to grow it out for longer periods of time before I get split ends and need a hair cut. This size bottle also lasts months since you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
            <li> Love it. Leaves my curls soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> Great for all types of hair. I&#x27;m African american and love it , a friend who is blond uses the light version and loves it and another friend who is Asian uses it and loves it. Great for shine, great for health of the hair</li>
            <li> Love that it comes with a pump, and the price couldn&#x27;t be better.  I have been using MoroccanOil for years, my fiancé loves the way it makes my hair smell and I love that it makes my hair look healthier! Some reviewers stated they received a leaky product, but mine came with the cap on and pump separate with no issues.</li>
            <li> Moroccan oil is a basic I used daily. Have recommended it to others. A bit expensive but well worth it!</li>
