            <li>/&gt;Despite the lack of incredible shine, this product could be a win because I think that</li>
            <li>I have hennaed my hair once before and got a beautiful coppery auburn out of it.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful henna&#x27;d hair.</li>
            <li>color came out to be a beautiful cherry cola color</li>
            <li>My hair is beautifully coloured to a shade darker than its orginal brown with a &amp;#34;slight hint&amp;#34; of red/burgundy  </li>
            <li>in overnight it came out beautiful.</li>
            <li>However, with the price this is a good product and you can&#x27;t ask it to be perfect.</li>
            <li>Granted, it was a beautiful reddish-brown.</li>

            <li>It is just great all around.</li>
            <li>Henna is a great conditioner, dye, and strengthener for your hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to wait 4-6 weeks which is great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>was a great experience</li>
            <li>sister used it and experienced frizzyness after rinsing it out.</li>
            <li>Over all, great product.</li>
            <li>My sister and I used this, and we are both happy with the result.  </li>
            <li>I apply it with shikakai and amla and works great.</li>

            <li>bless and have a great henna time....</li>
            <li>Street Fighter\\&quot; LOL..  </li>
            <li>I had a great deal of breakage after using this.</li>
            <li>Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li>So great had to write a review.</li>
            <li>This stuff was great.</li>
            <li>I was happy that my gray hairs turned out this reddish coppery color that blended in my hair</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>But i eventually took the plunge &amp; I&#x27;m so happy i did.</li>
            <li>My hair feels/looks great.</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how much I love it!!)</li>
            <li>It turned out very nice without having to add lemon juice or apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is just amazing!</li>
            <li>I used coconut oil in my mix and water and just this bag, and the results were amazing!</li>
            <li>let&#x27;s say I was successful.</li>
            <li>For me, it is just as easy to use a heaping 1/3 cup measure with 2/3 cups of water and some of the Africa&#x27;s best oil.</li>
            <li>Seldom leave reviews, but something like bright orange hair needs a cautionary note.</li>
            <li>So after I&#x27;m done with my henna application, I follow up with the indigo just on my roots to cover the gray (which after the henna application is bright orange), leave it on for 1 hour, rinse, co-wash, rinse and</li>
            <li>It is an unwanted bright red/orange metallic color.  </li>
            <li>Things like people&#x27;s hair turning bright orange</li>
            <li>bright orange like 100% henna.</li>
            <li>looked like bright copper highlights.  </li>
            <li>(greys still bright copper highlights)-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always heard that Henna is good as a strengthner for you hair, but never knew which one to buy.  </li>
            <li>This is a good item</li>
            <li>The color deposit is really good.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this one after reading the reviews and it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>Really good hair color.</li>
            <li>Loved it.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have and all will be good after that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as good as the others say even with all of the downsides.</li>
            <li>It practically feeds my hair with good stuff.  </li>
            <li>because I have what my stylists have called \\&quot;good hair.\\</li>
            <li>I tried explain to seller that it is expired but seller said it still good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving this Henna the 5 stars it deserves because my hair feels soooo good,</li>
            <li>Not to mention, having gorgeous hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not to mention, having gorgeous hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, just felt it would be good to give you a time reference.</li>
            <li>I also followed up with a good dose of [[ASIN:B003XGYTQE</li>
            <li>It is so good.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>so I had purchased indigo which will now be returned because the henna color I achieved is so jaw-droppingly gorgeous</li>
            <li>Between that time (salon color &amp; henna), I&#x27;ve again been researching and with good reason</li>
            <li>it stays looking good roots and all.  </li>
            <li>Condition, rinse again, and you&#x27;re good to go.     </li>
            <li>The result is too good to deny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good result.</li>
            <li>it had good dye release.</li>
            <li>but I have to say I loved the results.</li>
            <li>The product was good.</li>
            <li>would do this again just as a really good treatment but not as a hair dye.</li>
            <li>What is so good about Nupur?</li>
            <li>Then shampoo and give yourself a coconut oil treatment just for good measure, using [[ASIN:B006BA3BAY Dabur Vatika Coconut Hair Oil 150ml, 2 Count]].</li>
            <li>Keep up the good work</li>
            <li>At that time, I will give myself a coconut oil treatment just for good measure, using [[ASIN:B006BA3BAY Dabur Vatika Coconut Hair Oil 150ml, 2 Count]]</li>
            <li>Keep up the good work</li>
            <li>so i went for it, and lots of good reviews too.</li>
            <li>When I wash my hair and comb it out there is a good bit of halr coming out.  </li>
            <li>but they are suppose to be all good for your hair</li>
            <li>I have been using henna for years and this is a superior product.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product based on the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair felt so good after using this herb blend.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I love this Henna!</li>
            <li>I have abused and died my hair for many years, until it started falling out!</li>
            <li>my hair right now after this henna feels amazing!!</li>
            <li>It rinsed out of my locks very nicely and easily</li>
            <li>The free ebook at [...] is a great resource for directions.</li>
            <li>and I use this henna for its amazing nourishing properties.</li>
            <li>The way it sparkles in the sun is amazing, and my boyfriend compliments me almost every day on my hair now.</li>
            <li>hair is amazingly shiny, manageable, healthy-looking and I can redo whenever I see gray</li>
            <li>The conditioning benefits are amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is some amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>I use this to strengthen my hair/ retain length/ grow hair and it has been amazing.</li>
            <li>and it does amazing things for my curls.</li>
            <li>They look amazing for the week after I use this blend.</li>
            <li>and I have to say my have still feels and looks amazing still,</li>
            <li>the result is amazing, I did apply conditioner when I was washing it out, but</li>
            <li>The henna arrived fast, the day after ordering, and that was the best part of the purchase.  </li>
            <li>the 17hrs under the cap makes it effective.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for nice henna with quality, you would want to try Nupur.</li>
            <li>In the morning I removed the sheet and bubble wrap and looked at the paper-it was kind of orangish</li>
            <li>Or i may just buy everything piece by piece as I liked the effect and just have to bite the bullet.</li>
            <li>so much that would be wonderful!</li>
            <li>Also, my hair follicles are smoother and my hair has a nice sheen to it.</li>
            <li>It was actually kind of fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>mix a 60g pack with warm tea and leave it overnight.</li>
            <li>but once you figure out the best way to do it, it gets much easier.</li>
            <li>I add the coconut oil after the henna and coconut milk have sat in a warm place for about 6 hours.</li>
            <li>After about 5 minutes I rinsed it off and my my skin was nicely orange where the henna had sat.</li>
            <li>The best part of henna is its conditioning quality and this product really delivers.</li>
            <li>so I kinda liked it.</li>
            <li>Which of course kind a freaks me out.</li>
            <li>To each his/her own I suppose.</li>
            <li>I let it sit on my hair for about 5-6 hours while I did homework and cleaned my apartment, going over my covered head with a hairdryer every now and then to keep it nice and warm.</li>
            <li>that some of the photos were brighter than we would have liked.  </li>
            <li>I use this to make my own ayervedic hair oil.</li>
            <li>it has grown my customers hair as well as my own.</li>
            <li>Cover it with plastic wrap and allow to sit overnight in a warm place (which is supposed to help with dye release).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mom liked it as well, will buy again.</li>
            <li>after 2 hrs were up I rinsed out my hair, applied Aubrey organics honeysuckle rose conditioner to my hair 1st</li>
            <li>Very buttery and awesome..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a henna expert,but I liked this product.</li>

            <li>This product is nice.  </li>
            <li>and they blend nicely.  </li>

            <li>I saw many good review about it, so I tried.  </li>
            <li>I just heard so many good things about the Bragg ACV</li>
            <li>I liked this product</li>
            <li>my homemade hair oil.&lt;br /&gt;-Color: The Godrej Mix gives my hair a nice \\&quot;cherry\\&quot; chocolate color, whereas Karishma henna makes my hair a lot</li>
            <li>Gives a nice tingly sensation on scalp.</li>
            <li>a plastic grocery store bag handy</li>
            <li>but my daughter didn&#x27;t, it smelled like herbs or plants, which i liked, but you know how kids can be.</li>
            <li>Set in a warm place for about 4 hours or overnight until the color releases.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thicker, stronger and is striving nicely.</li>
            <li>(lmao)</li>
            <li>but Boy, were the results worth the work!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cheap for a great quality product!    </li>
            <li>To me, the best part about this product was it was cheap and mild to my hair.</li>
            <li>Wish I had a camera handy: You&#x27;d all have a great laugh at my expense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product was easy to use and delivered good results.</li>
            <li>My hair use to be brittle and would brake off very easy.</li>
            <li>This product was also very easily washed out.  </li>
            <li>Split ends show very easily</li>
            <li>One of the best henna I have tried by far!</li>
            <li>Yields quality results, easy to mix, great saturated deposit on hair with easy rinse out.</li>
            <li>this product is the greatest henna ive used so far.</li>
            <li>This is the best by far.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>rinsed my hair and was very happy that the water ran clear in about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>I rinsed my hair and was very happy that the water ran clear in about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this Henna the 5 stars it deserves because my hair feels soooo good, and it looks just a fabulous.</li>
            <li>That being said, I liked it better than the Jamila henna I used before.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best henna for hair.</li>
            <li>love it hair nice and shiny</li>
            <li>I rinse with warm water until most of dirt out and use hair conditioner to help rinse the rest out.  </li>
            <li>However, this brand is by far superior to any brand I have ever used!!!  </li>
            <li>I honestly believe the seller is writing most of these reviews.</li>
            <li>Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder is by far the BEST henna product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>What makes hair smooth is to use some good hair mask or conditioner (avacado etc) after washing off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to do!</li>
            <li>So easy!</li>
            <li>what i also like is that it&#x27;s very fine, not grainy at all,</li>
            <li>That one&#x27;s powder is very fine.</li>
            <li>I did the treatment about a month ago and have washed my hair many times and the color is still very strong.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to this beautiful, vibrant color in the summer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m blown away by how great this product is, and even more amazed that it comes at such a great price.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a cheap and fun way to get gorgeous hair!</li>
            <li>Great color and with the addition of oil super easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li>2 1/2 hours worked just fine!</li>
            <li>2 1/2 hours worked just fine!</li>
            <li>This is very important,do not use hot water for rinsing hair, warm water is best.</li>
            <li>[...] easy to mix also so 5 stars so far &#x3D;D</li>
            <li>One thing I love about this is that my hair is now very smooth without a lot of hair product.  </li>
            <li>It is a very good product, not a chemical dye to harm the hair, but natural herbs that I like.</li>
            <li>LOVE LUCY.\\</li>
            <li>It mostly washed off, mostly.</li>
            <li>with lots of shine, so 5 stars for the conditioning.. :)</li>
            <li>sure you use gloves because it will stain your hands for about a week or so</li>
            <li>so enjoy the experience and make your own spa day at home.</li>
            <li>I received many compliments on the color</li>
            <li>Okay, I figured that might happen.</li>
            <li>But, I saw this brand and decided to try it because of all the great reviews and also because it&#x27;s real henna, and no chemicals added.  </li>
            <li>I also like the fact that there are added herbs that contribute to healthy, shiny hair.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did because I love the color.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>For me I use either orange juice or lemon juice, soak for more than 5 hours, apply the paste to hair and let it stay over night.</li>
            <li>not use any metal when mixing or dyeing, and be sure to remove jewelry.    </li>
            <li>But I do know that I am beyond satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Now, it&#x27;s all better.</li>
            <li>i give this henna five stars for price, quality and best results overall.</li>
            <li>I ordered two more which should be on their way.</li>
            <li>, it was just lying on the top of my head like a globule</li>
            <li>Love the price, but do I love it after finding out I&#x27;ve paid for filler?</li>
            <li>To cut the sandiness and to relieve my hair more of the brittle feeling I may get after usisng</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker as well, and the curls have more body.  </li>
            <li>After 2 weeks or so, the burgundy highlights turned more brown.  </li>
            <li>I love this blend of herbs and henna.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the results from putting this henna in my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love that I can use this like, every month to condition my hair (goodbye to chemical relaxers).</li>
            <li>Even still I used more DPR+11 to condition my hair afterwards.</li>
            <li>My hair is more like a 4b/4c</li>
            <li>it is okay</li>
            <li>day I just became overwhelmingly fed up with my hair.  </li>
            <li>Even the damaged ends appeared to look healthy and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this henna since I started using it.</li>
            <li>Next day after I shampoo and condition, and my hair feels like the best thing in the world!!</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure what would happen...</li>
            <li>I was content in just getting the benefits of a healthy henna treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>washed it 2 times, added more conditioner and let it sit for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>My mission now is to do more research on how I can get the knots out a bit better and easier.</li>

            <li>I washed it 2 times, added more conditioner and let it sit for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>My mission now is to do more research on how I can get the knots out a bit better and easier.</li>
            <li>but Im sure that will go away within a week  </li>
            <li>I let it sit for 2 hours more, and then rinsed out the henna.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t magical hair dye, people.</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>I receive a monthly newsletter which provides tips on how to grow healthy hair.  </li>
            <li>I must say that I am pleasantly pleased with the look of my hair and the softness that this product added.  </li>
            <li>I receive so many compliments on my hair</li>
            <li>:-)\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>So I dyed in a brown to make it look better, but of course I still  have this &amp;#34; over processed problem&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>you leave henna on for the better and deeper</li>
            <li>Be SURE to condition you hair afterwards.</li>
            <li>henna can be drying to the hair, and even more so when you use protein(eggs) or lemon juice.</li>
            <li>So make sure you do a conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I also add a healthy squirt each of the coconut oil and the Burt&#x27;s Bees pre-shampoo treatment and mix it all up.</li>
            <li>(Some people do the henna, then the indigo after the henna is washed out - that seems even more time consuming</li>
            <li>Pile your hair on top of your head and put on a shower cap or tie a plastic grocery bag over your hair.</li>
            <li>I am trying to color correct with more henna .</li>
            <li>I am trying to color correct with more henna .</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>well i love this</li>
            <li>it just felt so much better</li>
            <li>I found it to be more moisturizing and the color redder than it is orange.  </li>
            <li>Love this oil and how it keeps my hair moisturized without greasiness.  </li>
            <li>Since then, Nupur has added wonderful herbs to the product such as Amla and Brahmi among others.  </li>
            <li>I love the results</li>
            <li>and I love the price.  </li>
            <li>It has so many beneficial herbs for hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still touching my hair.</li>
            <li>Using my hands (wearing gloves, of course) I applied the mixture all over and made sure to massage it through all of my hair.</li>
            <li>Those things caused the bottom part of my hair to be lighter than the part that just grew on the top.</li>
            <li>I love how it covers my gray hair.</li>
            <li>(I read that this helps to have more dye release.)  </li>
            <li>but my hair looked shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>, works better for me and allows me to add whatever I choose (eggs, yogurt, amla, oil, etc.)</li>
            <li>Henna was the next best thing...</li>
            <li>My hands were a hilarious orange color for two days...</li>
            <li>which was okay because it&#x27;s summer</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m home most of the time anyway,</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>To save money and to break away from more chemical dyes, I decided to use henna.</li>
            <li>work it into your scalp and roots to make sure the hair is covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dickies Men&#x27;s 14 Inch Cuffed Knit Beanie Hat]] to put on top of the shower cap or Saran Wrap.</li>
            <li>It helps keep the plastic in place and creates more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I wheeze more than a bit when using henna.  </li>
            <li>It is healthy for the hair and no damage</li>
            <li>I liked it, gave my hair shine and made it smooth.</li>
            <li>Make sure consistency is not runny)</li>
            <li>I love love love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and i have been using it for the last 5 years, it helps reduce greyness of hair and excellent conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many brands of henna on my hair.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments, I am amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems to make my hair more manageable too.  </li>
            <li>There are many recipes on you tube henna is a wonder conditioner for kinky curly hair.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I just wish it would&#x27;ve warned about redness, since the labeling leads you to believe that henna is not the prominent ingredient.</li>
            <li>then about 3 months ago I was given a sample of the Hesh Amla powder (which I love)</li>
            <li>perhaps i&#x27;ll henna again in 10 days time :)</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of this product because i suffer from Psorasis of the scalp and its herbs containing neem with help with my Psorasis.</li>
            <li>and I like it MUCH better than the ones I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>It came out just as lovely &amp; my hair is a dream!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I am satisfied with the turn out of the color and condition of hair.</li>
            <li>My hair looked real good for about a year then starting breaking off in the front till I had to cut my hair..</li>
            <li>I then put oils and yogurt or beet juice for more color or chamomile tea</li>
            <li>I recommend this quality henna for all you will love it try it,,&lt;br /&gt;God</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.     </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Miracles/Magic does exist :)</li>
            <li>I personally love this brand.</li>
            <li>I know many complain about the difficulties of applying henna.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not so sure I do.</li>
            <li>much better then chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Love, Love Love this product.</li>
            <li>Note that, once you start applying, you won&#x27;t be able to comb through your hair anymore.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I love this blend.</li>
            <li>It nourishes your roots to have a healthy scalp.</li>
            <li>I applied it making sure it coated all my hair.</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to rinse grit out of my hair forever when I use this henna mix.</li>
            <li>I used shampoo-conditioner more shampoo</li>
            <li>then more conditioner repeat 7times.  </li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>and i think my hair is shedding a lot more ever since i used it.</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li>I have been using this henna for more than 4 months</li>
            <li>this product is just okay,</li>
            <li>I do realize there are already many reviews for this item</li>
            <li>i wasnt sure which brand to use.</li>
            <li>I mixed Godrej Nupur with indigo powder, and the results were great!</li>
            <li>I also love the reddish shine it gets in the sun.</li>
            <li>and I love the results I have.</li>
            <li>but this product sure made that easier to do.  </li>
            <li>So I finally do it and the results are wonderful.</li>
            <li>but after the mixture sat for 4 hours most of the lumps were gone.&lt;br /&gt;Mix</li>
            <li>I think with my hands pulled all the hair to the top of my head and started massaging the color.</li>
            <li>I placed on shower cap on my head and then another on top of that.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought three bags and will be ordering more soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>ground cloves (to add a lovely clove scent)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>but that part is okay.</li>
            <li>Better than the one I used before.</li>
            <li>well, and needed more rinsing because I still have grits coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>write more after I use the indigo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was sure detangling would be hell on earth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The result - lovely chocolatey brown hair with some coppery/auburn-ish highlights.</li>

            <li>Your henna is just incredible, thanks to its purity and quality plus the nine special herbs.</li>
            <li>It gave my hair a nice color and what is more important for me, my hair feels strong and silky.</li>
            <li>I got my beautiful nice and shiny hair back.</li>
            <li>My gray streaks are a beautiful warm, copper red.</li>
            <li>For one, it is very fine, so that the paste you make is very smooth, easy to apply, and easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I am super pleased with the results!  </li>
            <li>Excellent coverage, easy enough to use.</li>
            <li>Now at first, it will look hideous, like a bright orangey color-</li>
            <li>Followed directions exactly and had Bright orange hair.</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s already fading pretty good.  </li>
            <li>So if I mix the two I will haave about 4 uses for a pretty good price.</li>
            <li>BUT, over the grey it is a brilliant, day-glo orange!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend likes to keep the apartment somewhat cool, so I needed to create a warm environment to store my Henna.</li>
            <li>I went into the wash room which is not as cool as the rest of the apartment, buried my container in the clothes basket, and turned on the dryer for about 1/2 and hour to warm up the room.</li>
            <li>Great for first time Henna users like myself, the shade is a beautiful red.</li>
            <li>the color is beautiful and natural looking.</li>
            <li>In fact, this is the first Amazon review I&#x27;ve ever written; that&#x27;s how impressed I am with this product, and I highly recommend it--with</li>
            <li>but most henna powders I have used just didn&#x27;t seemed to do a very good job of covering my white hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soooo worth it!!</li>
            <li>Give it a day or two and it will oxidize and your hair will become a beautiful shade of red (not to bright either, but very very pretty).</li>
            <li>Make sure you have everything you&#x27;ll need within easy reach -- hair color brushes, clips, shower cap, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love how easy this was to mix and apply.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel this strong and healthy even when I do protein treatments.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel this strong and healthy even when I do protein treatments.</li>
            <li>real nice only if it was more even that was my fault rushed through it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing to have a natural dye that is good for the hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>This was my first henna treatment and I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>The color turned out lighter than I expected, but it&#x27;s very beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Okay let me say it was the first time using any kind of henna</li>
            <li>My hair is silky smooth and looks extremely healthy.</li>
            <li>is a more detailed video of my experience, Hope this helps someone out</li>
            <li>I was happy because I could cover the gray with a natural product.</li>
            <li>Love this,the uptake is fabulous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good idea to test the color on some hair from your hair brush before coloring your whole head, as it is permanent.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying this product again for myself and for a friend who loved the color so much she requested I henna her</li>
            <li>The best part is, it doesn&#x27;t smell like other power products.</li>
            <li>NOW FOR MY ORIGINAL REVIEW: This was my first time using Henna, and for the most part, I love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to mix and apply.</li>
            <li>It mixes easily and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to rinse out.  </li>
            <li>It also washed out really easily.     </li>
            <li>It was easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply, didn&#x27;t have a strong odor at all</li>
            <li>(it smelled like chamomile or anise tea to me), and was really easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>Doing the skin &amp; strand test (wish I used hair from my denman brush) made this part easy</li>
            <li>it is so easy to apply and wash and leaves hair shiny and strong.</li>
            <li>Now my hair can manage easily.</li>
            <li>Great henna and even better when mixed with indigo and coconut milk!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was easy to mix and apply.</li>
            <li>My hair is softer, shinier, and I can easily see the color after just two applications.</li>
            <li>It helps to bring out more color and easier to clean.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy in and easy out.</li>
            <li>but the rest looked great, next time I used it had better results.  </li>
            <li>and I wanted my hair strong to stand up to the stress of braiding.</li>
            <li>and I wanted my hair strong to stand up to the stress of braiding.</li>
            <li>They were *ok*, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, I am ordering more of this stuff right away!    </li>
            <li>It made my hair feel so soft and it looked amazingly shiny!  </li>
            <li>and in this way it lasted me for 3 uses so pretty much a full year&#x27;s worth of Henna for a great price.  </li>
            <li>(Just to let you know what it will do to light colored hair... and for the first time I am glad my hair has gotten darker over the years!)    </li>
            <li>It gave my hair beautiful red highlights in the sun/light.</li>
            <li>Hair was beautiful and also red...</li>
            <li>I deleted most of the original post as it was panic filled and is no longer applicable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keep it out of the sun in a cool place if you are leaving it for more than a day so it won&#x27;t mold.  </li>
            <li>Regular use and leaving it on for 4-5 hrs gives a beautiful color to the hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, be advised: Henna is wonderful stuff, but if your hair is light or grey, give this product the full patch test.</li>
            <li>The consistency is really good to work with after mixing, because it&#x27;s a very fine powder, and it also leaves my hair in better condition than most other hennas I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Ultra fine powder</li>
            <li>It is a fine, khaki-green powder.</li>
            <li>You can add just water and mix it to a yogurt consistency and that is fine.     </li>
            <li>I doubt you would have to sift it the consistency is so fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But - if you can get used to the \\&quot;green\\&quot; odor, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>i did a strand test it turned fine</li>
            <li>- these conditioners make your hair softer and (almost as important) cut the strong horse poop smell of the henna/indigo mixture.</li>
            <li>when i used it on my hair, i loved the result, made my hair very soft too.</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work, I love the idea of all the herbs in it, but that sand was just a pain in the you-know-what!</li>
            <li>A little color wouldve been nice though lol.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I am about to order my second package.</li>
            <li>Important things to know -     </li>
            <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting too much.</li>
            <li>AND it&#x27;s insanely cheap, but it&#x27;s FASTER.</li>
            <li>I have used the Light Mountain brand and this one.  </li>
            <li>I used a glass bowl, which came clean easily with water when I was done.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with the purchase &amp; the result.</li>
            <li>Best of all was that the color of my hair looked very natural--I got compliments the next day in the office about how great it looked all around and no one recoiled at it looking radically different.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really want it for the color, but for the benefits of making my hair look amazing.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s filled with newbie flaws.</li>
            <li>and it looks just a fabulous.</li>
            <li>now becomes brown under light or sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is important that there are no lumps</li>
            <li>Then I use a bunch of cheap Suave conditioner to get the rest out; it takes about 15 minutes of rinsing for the water to run</li>

            <li>one get one free hair product</li>
            <li>I dried my face &amp; neck real good, put on the un-petroleum, dried my hands real good &amp; put on the gloves.  </li>
            <li>For those who want to be chemical free this is it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Rainbow, Light Mountain, Surya, henna from henna for hair, and jamila</li>
            <li>Glad I did, because this product made me think how fun chemistry would have been had</li>
            <li>and I love how my natural hair is shiny, defined, and more importantly MANAGEABLE!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light ashy brown.</li>
            <li>I actually slept with this mixture on my hair and the results were great in the morning.</li>
            <li>This has definitely been a weekly/bi weekly process that has yielded great results.</li>
            <li>I rinsed and conditioned again with Gud conditioner and Giovanni Smooth as Silk.</li>
            <li>It was so smooth when I applied the henna to my hair.</li>
            <li>yet it doesnt feel smooth</li>
            <li>Mix Godrej Nupur Mehendi (let sit for three hours) apply paste to freshly cleaned damp hair; Cover head with saran wrap and let sit for one hour or more, rinse and then apply step two.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>I used a combo of cheapie VO5, followed by not so cheap Wen cleansing conditioner to get the stuff out of my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaply priced.</li>
            <li>After 8 hours, I separately combined my indigo with salt and water until also smooth.</li>
            <li>They are now a copper red ( I am happy with the results) and will use this product again.</li>
            <li>Coconut Oil (also available on Amazon for a</li>
            <li>Of course I use sulfate free shampoo</li>
            <li>I will update in case of any surprising or better results than expected :)</li>
            <li>Some \\&quot;henna\\&quot; products that are parading around the internet don&#x27;t have much really in the way of actual henna and may not be best for your hair.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I loved how my hair turned out, but the Lush hennas are so sandy/gritty</li>
            <li>I am going to use this product continuously, because its 100% natural .price also fair.</li>
            <li>People who haven&#x27;t seen me recently have really complimented it and assure me that it looks wonderful in sunlight as well as indoor</li>
            <li>Well it did, it gave my dark brown hair the most beautiful copper high lights, the women who do box braids in my town were impressed and knew only Henna could give my hair this rich beautiful deep copper highlights.</li>
            <li>-Nupur mehandi 150 mg/one pack  -Hair accessories kit (very very useful and cost-effective, available on amazon</li>
            <li>For another, it is very powerful...</li>
            <li>I originally have light brown hair with bloodiest highlights; this product changed my color to a coppery/fiery reddish color...</li>
            <li>, this is permanent you want to make sure you do it right the first time without too many hiccups.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is super easy to wash out,</li>
            <li>then is super easy to clean up -- no bowls, no spoons,</li>
            <li>This is the stuff which I collected first to prepare for my battle :)  </li>
            <li>IT WAS FUN!</li>

            <li>It took a couple of days for the \\&quot;results\\&quot; to show, but it was worth the wait!</li>
            <li>50 years worth!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the time!</li>
            <li>Godrej Nupur Henna is the best henna i&#x27;ve purchased in the past 18 years of dying my hair with henna.</li>
            <li>This stuff is SO worth it!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s been over 3 weeks with great color and grey coverage.  </li>
            <li>(search for \\&quot;Henna Caca Lush\\&quot;), which worked great; you basically create little buns on the top of your head as you work, and the hennaholds it all in place.  </li>
            <li>and i used too much of the powder since my hair if very fine in body.  </li>

            <li>It rinses SO MUCH easier than the fiasco I experienced in my review below, and once the water runs clear,</li>

            <li>The baking soda will help to neutralize the henna smell, and leave you feeling clean without using shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li>ive always bought my henna from mehandi and this henna is super for the price and it leaves my hair shiny and smelling great with super red colors.</li>
            <li>After all the henna/amla is worked into your hair, sculpt your hair away from your hairline so you can  make sure you have good coverage around your hairline, and use a wet paper towel to remove any drips that are where you don&#x27;t want them.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t, don&#x27;t, don&#x27;t assume the color will be OK because of all these positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I missed that beautiful, vibrant, strong red was used to getting.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t as pungent, it left my hair soooo soft, and I love the beautiful reddish color results I received</li>

            <li>I kept this in my hair for about 4 hours and my hair came out with a beautiful rich color and felt thick and healthy.  </li>

            <li>My hair actually felt very strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to henna because I heard stories about it making your hair bright red or loosening your curl pattern.  </li>
            <li>I somehow got away from it and used the more usual chemical products for years until I stumbled upon this product and all its great reviews.</li>
            <li>Gives my natural hair an amazing shine.</li>
            <li>Whatever, it has made my hair smell like sweet hay(?)</li>
            <li>I mixed it up really, really good and then sectioned my hair off, then proceeded to apply.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>Love this product so much.</li>
            <li>Even though it may do nothing, I figure its a nice clarifying shampoo and the henna having time to cure even more will at least be a nice treatment for my scalp.</li>
            <li>The henna paste kept dripping, so keep a paper towel handy, and wear old clothes.  </li>
            <li>A dream come true for my hair.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>After reading some of the reviews and finding that the overall consensus was that everyone loved it, I ordered 2 packages.  </li>
            <li>For me, I can&#x27;t use a full henna, so I mix about 50g of henna with conditioner and oil for a henna gloss.</li>
            <li>During the next application I plan to use a good creamy hair conditioner to help remove the henna from my hair (we&#x27;ll see if that works).  </li>
            <li>and it is full of sand.</li>
            <li>Her hair is actually more medium brown and much longer than mine.  </li>
            <li>hair is healthy in appearance and much stronger (no shedding) after use..</li>
            <li>, then I have to wash it more often because the coconut oil makes my hair greasy if I get too much on it.  </li>
            <li>I used it the second time with avocado oil and loved the results...  </li>
            <li>I loved the results of this, I did a lot of research, read a lot of reviews and then did a strand and skin test, I do recommend everyone read properly.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this Henna (last night) because I saw and heard good reviews.  </li>
            <li>my hair is now a beautiful dark brown with copper/red tones to it.</li>
            <li>My hair really look healthy and I got a lot of compliments on how prety my hair was.</li>
            <li>Came out really good and my greys are red not</li>
            <li>the claims made about this helping with dandruff/dry scalp maybe true.</li>
            <li>the claims made about this helping with dandruff/dry scalp maybe true.</li>
            <li>This one needs rinsing a couple of more times but dyes gray hair very well.</li>
            <li>The smell was not bad at all-sorta like hay&lt;</li>
            <li>I have chosen this particular product due to the fact it contains very good beneficial herbs!</li>
            <li>My natural, fine 4a/b pen spring coils love protein.</li>
            <li>It sat in my beauty product closet for quite sometime mostly because I was going through a period of significant shedding and terrified of putting some new fangled product in my hair that would exacerbate the problem.</li>
            <li>but after i applied some conditioner to my hair it felt like pure silk!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can be sensitive to strong smells, but the smell of this didn&#x27;t really bother me; I liked the herbal scent of it.&lt;br</li>

            <li>(is this a sign of obsessive-compulsive disorder) just to make sure that I am not missing any relevant detail.</li>
            <li>Being slightly impatient and impulsive, I took a chance and didn&#x27;t test the color, but fortunately it came out great</li>
            <li>Also, it dyes your hands unless you use gloves or rinse it off quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered Nupur from  Amazon a couple of times and the package came quickly and as advertised.</li>
            <li>With one pack, there was enough to cover all of my hair (of which I have A LOT) and most of my sister&#x27;s (she mostly did the ends of her</li>
            <li>I left on my hair for 1hr and 35 min then rinsed well with warm water, applied cheap vo5 moisture conditioner to wash/rinse the rest out hair, then reapplied</li>
            <li>I had a bit of a red tint and fabulous curls to my hair which I really liked a lot.</li>
            <li>My hair felt more conditioned but even more the gray hair was now a red color.  </li>
            <li>However, my hair quickly changes color</li>
            <li>I love the conditioning effect, not quite sure if I need to use it again nor whether or not I like the brassy red hair instead of my gray hairs.</li>
            <li>I had to update my Review now that I have used it multiple times with different mixes and must say this is the best henna mix/ blend that I have found.</li>
            <li>This product made my hair a wonderful deep red while conditioning it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a whole bunch, but the ones I do have are prominent and right in the place I like to part my hair.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.  </li>
            <li>Place the bag into a 2 cup Pyrex filled with water, and nuke it until hot but not boiling.</li>
            <li>My hair is beautiful and the color is darker in a few days.</li>
            <li>Only warm water is good enough for</li>
            <li>I just did it a few days ago and it is so beautiful.</li>
            <li>This henna made my curls soooooo soft and strong!</li>
            <li>But this one, I can&#x27;t really smell any strong scent.</li>
            <li>Those who are familiar with those other herbs will know how good they are for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pretty good for the price, I dyed my entire head twice with just one package.</li>
            <li>, I was so excited that I gave my first review of life for that too).The kit</li>
            <li>and it looks really pretty in the sunlight!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!    </li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>it was my first time to use henna and also i have coloured my hair 7 months ago with highlights!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this natural henna!</li>
            <li>The drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t look good- almost like poop, and doesn&#x27;t apply easily and messy.</li>
            <li>like it better than pure Henna because pure Henna has a tendency to make the hair feel like straw.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You can only see the new color of my hair in the sun or a bright light.</li>
            <li>I have very wavy, fine hair, and a lot of it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember if I put in a little Jojoba oil lol.</li>
            <li>But, the second time I did it and added more moisturizer, it was fine and it lasted 5-6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>My major selling point is that it&#x27;s easy to rinse out and doesn&#x27;t clog up your locs at all!</li>
            <li>I gently combed through the length of my hair and it went so smoothly.</li>
            <li>I also put a couple of streaks in my daughter&#x27;s light blond hair and it came out REALLY orange.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s calm, silky and auburn now.</li>
            <li>it gave it an amazing red tint!)</li>
            <li>the more I knew my natural hair journey would benefit from trying it.</li>
            <li>As the henna oxidized, it began to look more natural.</li>
            <li>but I was able to comb straight through my hair without detangling really.   </li>
            <li>The mixture actually smelled really nice and helped to make it soothing to have the it on my head for two hours, wrapped under saran wrap and a plastic bag.</li>
            <li>I am a complete dunce when it comes to being able to style my hair.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you are wearing an old t-shirt as it can stain your clothes, skin, even jewelry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re going Old School, so be prepared :)</li>
            <li>The exchange is totally worth</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look so much more natural with highlights where my grays were.</li>
            <li>and i do have a nice red color to my hair</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural</li>
            <li>My hair is shinier and has a really nice red tint in the sunlight.  </li>
            <li>This henna produces a really nice auburn shade on my blonde highlights.  </li>
            <li>Those who are more familar with herbs and their appearance would know, but I&#x27;m a newbie to natural coloring.</li>
            <li>but when you buy something most people wouldn&#x27;t want it to be 4 years old.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with the out come of my natural hair.</li>
            <li>For $3.99 it is worth trying out.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how much powder to use or how much oil/water.  </li>
            <li>Also the product is safe, it&#x27;s contains just natural ingredients</li>
            <li>there are no harsh chemicals in it and makes your hair looks healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now, and it is so far my favorite henna product.</li>
            <li>My hair feel soft only when I used the conditioner, but if I use my own conditioner I have to use more to soften my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, actually.</li>
            <li>Place a roll of cling wrap and a second grocery story bag handy for wrapping up your head after you finish applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about that</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not some over the top color, it&#x27;s just natural looking.  </li>
            <li>Liked this product, it does cover the gray in your hair, last for months.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I liked the results.</li>
            <li>and I loved the brownish tint and my hair felt so good after a few deep conditions.</li>
            <li>It is a mild hair cleanser conditioner and it is very gentle with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You just have to refrain from wild motions or flinging and make sure and rinse away any of the product that gets on the tub or walls right away.  </li>
            <li>Thus, henna is even more affordable than other home hair treatments as well as better for hair health.</li>
            <li>Seemed to work better for shine without coffee, but i like the darker due to coffee color better.</li>
            <li>The only issue I had was that the sift isn&#x27;t as fine as I&#x27;m used to (Jamilia BAQ henna has a super fine sift).  </li>
            <li>I was super scared using this product for the first time.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but would recommend &amp;#34;Hannah Natural 100% Pure Henna Powder, 100 Gram&amp;#34; for more money.</li>
            <li>a point of reference, I have fine, wavy 2C curls that, when stretched, reach to the top of my waist.  </li>
            <li>so flat ironing or warm blow drying helps even though I am minimizing heat.</li>
            <li>Good quality and has other herbal ingredients</li>
            <li>It does not change the color of the dark hair but it colors the grays a wonderful golden red color that looks like hi lights.</li>
            <li>After the right consistency, Jojoba oil is also added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I knew I was on the right track.</li>
            <li>Teatree Oil shampoo and conditioner has taken the itch right away.  </li>
            <li>(I know that&#x27;s not the right spelling)</li>
            <li>I wash it off right away, it will come off&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and this is right up my alley.air.</li>
            <li>and this is right up my alley.</li>
            <li>So no you don&#x27;t have to apply indigo powder to your hair right after you do henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mix it before my shower, then use it right after I shampoo.</li>
            <li>right now I think I will just do it once in between relaxers.ner out of my hair</li>
            <li>right now I think I will just do it once in between relaxers.</li>
            <li>I am ready to apply the henna to clean hair, I snip one corner of the ziploc bag off and apply to hair like icing a cake.  </li>
            <li>This henna was easy to rinse out and made my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>2 hours in henna turned it completely auburn: a very nice color, but not very natural looking on me.</li>
            <li>Ok, so my hair isn&#x27;t my normal blonde, but it is the most gorgeous natural looking red you have ever seen.</li>
            <li>When pouring the water just remember: you can easily add some more water, but it&#x27;s much harder to take it out</li>
            <li>I like this product better than regular henna because the dye release is so quick</li>

            <li>Based on the positive reviews for this Nupur powder, I decided to try it instead of using my Lush henna, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I smeared all the remaining henna on full length and rubbed some on my whole head again with gloved fingers.</li>
            <li>I have been bleaching/coloring my hair blond for years as my answer to the grey and the kinky kind of curl that comes with menopause....  </li>
            <li>Good colour and over time becomes dark brown.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply with no mess!</li>
            <li>Then I covered the container with plastic sheet and bubble wrap securely and kept it in a cardboard box (just to keep henna little warm).</li>
            <li>Fantastic results - total coverage of gray and beautiful black color.</li>
            <li>I have used many different brands of henna in the past and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I like the smell- much better than other chemical-based dyes, and the fact that it washes off clothing etc easily.</li>
            <li>You get a large amount of Henna for your buck!</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy this henna again!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that I tried it!air, I did do a second application with this product mixed with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Now, the auburn in my hair is a bit more noticeable, but it looks completely natural (haha, probably</li>
            <li>I had hoped for less hair breakage,but all in all it was good.</li>
            <li>Henna does well in the freezer, and it will be all ready to thaw and use the next time, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I blame the snafoo on me, but they really should have made it more clear on the package that it was henna.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t over-powering &amp; it rinses quite easily leaving hair soft, shiny, &amp; manageable.  </li>
            <li>If your looking for a fast quick fix, henna can color and treat your hair but you will work for it.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong but I already got used to it, and really it&#x27;s not much worse than the strong chemical smell of regular hair</li>
            <li>This is such a great deep conditioning treatment!</li>
            <li>Application was quite easy and not really messy at all.</li>
            <li>I put it in the fridge, and let it cool down to luke warm.</li>
            <li>Henna is the most natural way to give some nice shine and highlights to your hair if you have dark hair.  </li>
            <li>First time Henna use recently was in February 2013, purchased the Jamila henna (hair quality, not BAQ), and was pleasantly surprised, loved the color - it turned out a coppery color and greys</li>
            <li>My hair was pretty light brown before using this product, so the color came out an very lush vivid light auburn.</li>
            <li>hair has never felt this wonderful and thecolor has stayed extremely shiny and vibrant even 3 weeks later.</li>
            <li>I brew very strong tea, say 6 tea bags boiled in one cup of water, boiled down to 1/2 cup of water, let it sit over night to really get strong.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle and smells earthy.  </li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s not grainy it washes out very fast too.</li>
            <li>My original review works very well, but is very time consuming, and as you can tell...</li>
            <li>It DOES look far more vibrant while on, so no need to freak out.</li>
            <li>first time I used just the Nupur powder and loved the shine and softness, but I had wanted my hair a little darker brown, not as coppery.</li>
            <li>First time trying this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, my hair feel instantly stronger after each application.  </li>
            <li>After the first use I immediately noticed THICKNESS, SHINE, and STRENGTH and practically no shedding.</li>
            <li>will tweak my process going forward, as I noticed there are things I can do to make the next treatment even better.</li>
            <li>MOST IMPORTANTLY - After rinsing out the henna, I WILL USE A DEEP CONDITIONING TREATMENT MIX WITH OILS (Olive, Avocado, Sweet Almond, and essential oils of Rosemary and Lavender work wonders for my hair).</li>
            <li>product gave me exactly what I was seeking in using a henna tratment: CONDITIONING, THICKNESS and STRENGTH.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I wash out the mixture, I add more powders to my hair as that is not necessary but</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have ever used henna.  </li>
            <li>I actually wanted to start out doing a henna gloss to see how it would look on my brunette hair before doing anything more drastic.  </li>
            <li>And I love the red highlights that it brought out in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I could see more red in my hair and it&#x27;s a deeper color.  </li>
            <li>It dried out my hair pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I mix it with equal part of indigo and a tbsp of Amla and my hair has never looked as healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>I was a first time user and this stuff was dummy proof.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>First I rapidly flipped through the you tube videos again</li>
            <li>-actually don&#x27;t know how it helped :).</li>
            <li>I plan to order more, and incorporate this into my regular hair care regimen.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Godrej!</li>
            <li>I had to use more coconut oil later during the week to silken the hair.</li>
            <li>Besides throwing my hair into a bun or ponytail, I&#x27;m pretty clueless.  </li>
            <li>I do a hot oil treatment (combination of coconut, olive, almond and castor oil) and leave the oil overnight.</li>
            <li>I put a dab of henna on my palm (I read on many henna websites that this was recommended to check to see if the dye released correctly), re-covered the henna, and placed it back in the clothes basket.</li>
            <li>It was my first time applying it</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>will use this again, as it did exactly what everyone said it should do.</li>
            <li>I willuse this again, as it did exactly what everyone said it should do.</li>
            <li>Pretty, but if you don&#x27;t want this, you might scream.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results and will definitely continue to apply this henna to my hair.</li>
            <li>and it was so smooth not messy not runny at all</li>
            <li>I finally used the henna and I cannot express how much I LOVE my hair now.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be ordering this product again and again!</li>
            <li>I get about five uses out of one 150g package - whole head!</li>
            <li>Also my grays first took on an orange hue</li>
            <li>It was my first time trying henna in my hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Every time you wash your hair for some reason some of the Henna seeps out so for your first 6 showers</li>
            <li>/&gt;Every time you wash your hair for some reason some of the Henna seeps out so for your first 6 showers</li>
            <li>, I can do this fast and my hands won&#x27;t stain.\\&quot; NOPE!  </li>
            <li>Gray streaks actually came out a lighter shade, but I&#x27;m told they look interesting.  </li>
            <li>my mix was the consistently of brownie batter...</li>
            <li>Next time I would add indigo for a more Burnett hair color</li>
            <li>I was able to buy this at a local Punjab grocery.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you do a deep condition on your hair afterwards</li>
            <li>so I added a 1/2 cup hot water to about 2 tsp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time to use henna.</li>
            <li>I am a first time user of Henna and Nupur</li>
            <li>My hair turned out pretty</li>
            <li>it really hit home - this stuff lasts!  </li>
            <li>I use this powder to help it stay healthy and give it an extra boost of color.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you rinse a lot to get all of it out, use moisturizing shampoo then rinse again several times.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t even used all of the first, my hair is medium length.</li>
            <li>Thanks Godrej and Amazon.....!</li>
            <li>So I stopped using the dryer of course and started looking for some natural ( risk free) help for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Read</li>
            <li>This was the first henna treatment I&#x27;ve done.</li>
            <li>I am a first time henna user</li>
            <li>This was my first time using this Nupur Mehendi.</li>
            <li>I purchased four packs at once and will be back for more.</li>
            <li>(you&#x27;ll use a ton of conditioner, so get a cheap one for this purpose) until the water runs clear.</li>
            <li>I first started using this after I started loosing my hair.</li>
            <li>It does stain the skin, I learned that through my first application.</li>
            <li>Next just plan on being home for most of the day because it has to set on your hair for 4-6hrs.</li>
            <li>I used to work in a hospital, and asked many middle eastern co-workers about tips about Mehendi which is the ancient art of henna.  </li>
            <li>I really hope Amazon never stops selling it!  </li>
            <li>I tried henna for the first time this weekend.</li>
            <li>Love the color, and thinking about doing it again weekly for the next month.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my second time purchasing this henna, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>absolutely love this product and will never go back to chemical dyes.</li>
            <li>cup of hot coffee and hot water&lt;br /&gt;Hemp</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with henna.</li>
            <li>make a whole batch with lemon juice and keep it in a glass jar in the fridge until I run out!</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I was willing to give this henna a shot, since some said it left their hair shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased with the transition.</li>
            <li>I love the color (especially in the light), and it made my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this and reccomend it to everyone!</li>
            <li>When the powder was mixed and let sit overnight, I was more worried because of the grassy smell and the mudlike texture.  </li>
            <li>Once in the shower I let the water run on my head briefly and then added more Suave conditioner to loosen up the hair and color.</li>
            <li>After doing more research on how I could could get my hair darker without using regular hair dye, I realized people were using indigo powder in addition to henna.</li>
            <li>I tried Nupur for the first time</li>
            <li>This was the first time I ever use henna and I was a Lil nerve</li>
            <li>And finally, the nine additional herbs have left my hair incredibly shiny and soft without the addition of any oils to</li>
            <li>I am starting to love the color.  </li>
            <li>Applied almost entire amt to hair in sections, making sure</li>
            <li>I love throwing in a bunch of food ingredients such as Coconut milk (as my liquid), oils and molasses or honey.</li>
            <li>Ordered this one when first choice item was out of stock.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t measure, so put in any additions first and then add some water.  </li>
            <li>then I wrapped a plastic bag around my hair, and the towel on top of it and left for 4 hours.</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time 2 weeks ago &amp; was horrified at first looking at the goop in my bowl.</li>
            <li>The color is a better, deeper, red and stays longer.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technique: Mixed it with hot water plus coconut and lavender oils to form paste, waited 3 hours, applied to hair, waited 4 hours, rinsed.</li>
            <li>I was aware that it was a possibility but based on the research I did, I thought the color would mellow out.  </li>
            <li>After the second use, the shedding increased and my hair was more crunchy/hard to the touch.  </li>
            <li>As this was my first experience with henna and thus this product, I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to (i.e. product quality)</li>
            <li>(though I never saw henna listed on the ingredients, and it had me very nervous!)</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, made the gray almost a copper color</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, I used this</li>
            <li>Product turned my hair a funny orange/red color</li>
            <li>so I applied more coconut oil and a conditioning cap and left it on overnight.</li>
            <li>I wanted something with more pizazz and up until the last 3 years had always dyed my hair a reddish brown.  </li>
            <li>so much darker than the Jamila and my scalp was psychedelic!  </li>
            <li>used to put pure henna in my hair all the time, and that was great, but having the other 8 herbs in this mix makes it even better.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone who likes to henna their hair, but wants a darker tone and more overall conditioning.</li>
            <li>I used to lighten my hair back to blonde which looked great except roots showing up a little sooner than I would have liked, my hair grows very fast.</li>
            <li>I dampen my hair, towel dry and apply with a tint brush, leave on four hours, rinse, lightly shampoos, rinse with cheap conditioner again then shampoo and condition and rinse again.  </li>
            <li>The process of application can be messy, but you get better each time, and it cleans easy from surfaces (not from clothes).</li>
            <li>Lastly, it turned my naturally black/brown hair a niiiiice reddish tinted brown, which at first I was against but after wearing a blown out fro I&#x27;m just in love with the color!</li>
            <li>This took my permed, fried, dried out hair and turned it into glossy, full, swinging, moist hair-of-a-lifetime in ONE USE!!!  </li>
            <li>My hair is so shiny, soft, pretty, rich looking and feeling now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also worried that this would leave my fine, 2C waves too limp, but they have retained their curl and I&#x27;m so happy with how my two inches of grey regrowth blended into the rest of my hair.</li>

            <li>I used to buy henna from bulk henna sellers or some other popular brands...</li>
            <li>Ordered some and followed directions, especially being sure to cover the parts of my hair that are now grey, mostly at top and sides surrounding my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(my hair is dark brown) but each day blends in a bit more!  </li>
            <li>but u can add other things to it for ur own peferrence</li>
            <li>This makes your hair so glossy and healthy that I can see finally achieving the long, healthy hair I have dreamed of.</li>
            <li>I am already planning on getting more, it came right on time which was great because I hate waiting and too cheap to pay for the one-business day:</li>
            <li>The only thing about henna is that it is very messy to use and the process takes forever, but the results are wonderful and my hair looks so much healthier with each use.</li>
            <li>This was my first time and my dreadlocks, which were shedding, breaking and all around unhappy, came out beautifully tinted and EXTREMELY strong.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft, clean, and shiny after using it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE ON 3-7-14:  While I love how much easier this is to use than the Lush hennas, now that the color has had more time to settle, I think I&#x27;m going to go back to Lush.  </li>

            <li>and i purchase them at that time for $5 a bottle, regular price for a big bottle of a good shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My hair is totally soft, full of body and very shiny!</li>
            <li>Next I tied an old grocery bag around my head, you need to keep your head warm and moist, a shower cap will also work.</li>
            <li>The color and texture of the actual paste was very similar to feces, but it smelled really, really good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fun to henna, it&#x27;s fun to experiment with different mixes.</li>
            <li>It DOES settle down to its own unique color and doesn&#x27;t look store-dyed, just natural.</li>
            <li>I used about half a package which was way more than I needed!</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft and so shiny!  </li>
            <li>After one henna/indigo application, my hair looks totally dandruff free right now.</li>

            <li>If you&#x27;re on the hunt for good henna to strengthen you hair (amongst other things) Maybe you can give this a go!!!</li>
            <li>gave a beautiful red tone to my black hair.</li>
            <li>The FULL FAT yogurt is the key here, as it helps tremendously in the process of rinsing the henna out of the hair.</li>
            <li>Would positively recommend it.</li>
            <li>Based on this information, one positive for using henna would be a softening of my hair.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to leave it for that long, but I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it until I got home from work Friday</li>
            <li>I always start with my roots first, and use a hairdye brush to really work it into my roots, esp.</li>
            <li>and I apply the coconut oil to the hair that is sticking up, pretty much just the ends.  </li>
            <li>I used Rainbow brand first, I really did like it</li>
            <li>At first I though it is just a marketing effort to make people buy, but I still believe that some review should come from the real people.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have light hair check out how other reviews with light hair worked with henna to find something that works for you.</li>

            <li>When i am ready to apply it I mix a tablespoon of indigo with a pinch of salt in hot water and let it sit for 10 minutes, then combine the two.  </li>
            <li>I pretty much followed the directions with the exception of substituting some of the water for coffee because again, my fear of looking like a flaming red-haired crazed possessed terror doll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if my hair grew really fast, if I did not apply it well the first time or if the color started to fade at the roots because after 5 weeks, I had quite a bit of gray hairs.  </li>
            <li>When my grays started to show again, I tried the Nupur due to the low price and great reviews.  </li>
            <li>This is not one of those squeeze out of a bottle chemical treatments, but part of the fun of henna is customizing your own mix, which will result in some different results overall.     </li>
            <li>In my younger years I used henna frequently and with good results on my naturally brown/auburn hair.</li>
            <li>My roots, edges and the rest of my hair is a nice dark brown/burgundy color.</li>

            <li>My hair is full, soft with lots of shine.  </li>
            <li>I will be using this particular of  henna more regularly, probably every three-four months.</li>

            <li>natural texture is fine, curly, dry and breaks easily.  </li>
            <li>Finally something that wont kill me or my hair &amp; it actually works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions on the bag to the best of my ability since the directions are not exact.  </li>
            <li>It appears that the shelf life is 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for those worried about buying a knock-off or adulterated product, you may feel most comfortable buying directly from Amazon as the seller instead of one of the other options.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have to wait for very long, 2 hours is ok.</li>
            <li>The package is easy to open without wasting any product.</li>
            <li>saying that, after I got the knots out and I blew my hair dry, it felt and looked better than I ever remember it feeling before.</li>

            <li>(My hair is normally medium brown - the copper was lovely, I just wanted it darker and richer looking and not so red.)</li>
            <li>When my hair is dry, I have shoulder length hair, I put it in a pony tail at the top of my head, like a whale spout</li>
            <li>My hair was super soft and shiny after using it.</li>
            <li>The result was - super soft and shiny hair.</li>
            <li>The henna cover my gray better than a Chemical dye because I can leave the henna on my hair as long as I want and redo it as much as I want without damage my hair.  </li>
            <li>just let my hair air dry, and it looks absolutely stunning.</li>
            <li>Within two weeks and a few shampoos later, my hair is a beautiful reddish brown color and with auburn highlights where the grays used to be.</li>
            <li>After the first few days of washing, my color leveled out to a nice auburn color that gleamed in the sun.</li>
            <li>The color of the Lush hennas seems more vibrant in my hair, and the Lush henna imparted a shine that this hasn&#x27;t.  </li>

            <li>This is a natural dye, it will tone down the orange and the tannic acid in the tea also prevents your hair from falling out, so it is good for your hair.  </li>

            <li>The first days of the henna, my hair was an red Irish Setter color (like the dog breed) which didn&#x27;t bother me as it wasn&#x27;t freakish looking - just a bit trendy, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>After a few days my scalp faded and the color mellowed to a gorgeous deep cool auburn</li>
            <li>Once you get the whole henna journey complete you will have a great color added to your dark hair and if you have gray like me, you have a natural solution for your gray.</li>

            <li>have used Rainbow Henna consistently (but infrequently) for over 30 years, mainly for conditioning.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s all said and done, my hair is so soft and manageable and PRETTY!</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t expect a nice little antiseptic product which is all neat, mmmkay?</li>
            <li>mixed it  with pure bottle lemon juice for 3 hours only and let on my hair for 3hours  also nice color</li>
            <li>I first used it on my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s hair, and her hair came out beautiful, soft, so soft and it gave her hair a little tint.</li>
            <li>Throughout this process, I stood in front of the huge mirror (which is obvious anyways)I wrapped the cape snugly around my shoulders</li>
            <li>Overall, the henna did a great job of covering the few gray hairs that I have.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time a month ago, I am Caucasian and my hair is fine, wavy and dry on the ends.  </li>
            <li>&quot; It turned out a very Reddish auburn.</li>
            <li>Curly Nikki&#x27;s demo- (...) and the results are very pleasing-</li>
            <li>This was ready in 3.</li>
            <li>I find the amount to be very generous too.</li>
            <li>It may have made my strands thicker, I can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
            <li>This formula is very conditioning and seems to fortify your hair with nutrients.</li>
            <li>My hair was really shiny without any type of oil.</li>
            <li>It also really soothed my itchy scalp.    </li>
            <li>Then when I&#x27;m ready to apply it, I mix in 3 eggs.</li>
            <li>so I was wondering how much henna to use.</li>
            <li>-really really helped, pair of disposable gloves.  </li>
            <li>I had already diluted a very generous amount of shampoo and warm-hot water.</li>
            <li>They are super-clean, deep conditioned, silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair feels nice-soft texture smooth hair shaft instead of coarse, after 4 hours of henna and an hour of conditioning with a homemade, oat milk-lecithin-ricebran oil-safflower oil-soy wax-glycerin-conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is much shinier.</li>
            <li>regular hairstyle would expose the orange areas, but fortunately I can style my hair to come forward--bangs, etc--and hide it.</li>
            <li>It absolutely SCREAMS orange.</li>
            <li>Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;About 2 1/2 hours in, I was so tired I decided to wash it out knowing that if I wasn&#x27;t happy with the color, I could re-apply it in a couple days.</li>

            <li>This henna is real henna.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Well the hair along my hairline is much brighter than the rest of the red/orange hair.  </li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience with Henna</li>
            <li>After this process, my hair is stronger and feels very conditioned.</li>
            <li>it really made my hair feel thicker and stronger</li>
            <li>but for those woth longer hair may need to use the whole thing</li>
            <li>It took probably 10 solid mins of rinsing and an application of conditioner to get my hair feeling free of the henna grit.&lt;br</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s got so much body and shine, people always comment on it.</li>
            <li>well it doesnt really now</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really show up on my hair indoors, though my sister&#x27;s hair did turn reddish/orange before darkening to an auburn color indoors.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product and used it on my hair and my daughters hair as a deep conditioner and the results were fantastic.</li>
            <li>Our press lasted almost 2 weeks, our hair didn&#x27;t stay entirely straight for 2 weeks</li>
            <li>the one from Evolving Dish -- made the process much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;--I start with the brush to slop it all on, and then massage it into the whole strand/chunk of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I used too much coconut oil</li>
            <li>I did however wash out with shampoo after rinsing because I am very sensitve to smells.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nourished my hair and make much brighter look and silky.</li>
            <li>The color was very unnatural.</li>
            <li>This product absolutely fried my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the result, after dying my hair with this henna.</li>
            <li>I do not have much to say about the color, I don&#x27;t have any grays in my hair yet.</li>
            <li>but fortunately my husband said her hair looked red on the front</li>
            <li>the packaging is very misleading</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use to much hair conditioner, gel, oil, or even some shampoo.  </li>
            <li>highlight my hair got really burnt at the ends</li>
            <li>really pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and I was ready to put it on my head.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it to be very moisturizing</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use henna for the purpose of coloring my hair.</li>
            <li>Well.... product mixes up well, but does smell like canned spinach, which I don&#x27;t really mind.</li>
            <li>So the color is not really visible, but the texture is phenomenal.</li>

            <li>but now my hair is too straight.</li>
            <li>I am very concerned.</li>
            <li>Phurchase it via amazon, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I am very happpy with this product.  </li>
            <li>Covered whole head with cling wrap, then put a plastic bag on, then wraped in a towel.</li>
            <li>Have had it on for about an hour and its really drippy thru the Saran wrap and plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews I expected better on that front.</li>

            <li>(OMG, look at how much gray I have), I am going to embrace my hair, grays included.</li>
            <li>My hair was also much softer afterwards, though i had to wash my hair four times to get the rest of the mixture out.</li>
            <li>conditioner washed it out very easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was really scared to use it</li>

            <li>I have shoulder-length hair and used 1 packet for my whole head, will use 1/2 packet to do my roots.  </li>
            <li>I found a few, but I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>mixed about 1/3 of the powder with warm water enough to make a paste</li>
            <li>IT IS MESSY AND KIND OF SMELLY.  </li>
            <li>I will not go back to bleaching my hair, now that it is soft and shiny and growing and healthy...  </li>
            <li>i only use 75g mixed with warm coffee and 2tbsp of olive oil.</li>
            <li>It left my hair manageable, soft, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>Actually my skin is sensitive with most chemical products.  </li>
            <li>A plus for me (may be a con for some) is that it left a nice ruby red tint on my highlights.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>These were not concerns of mine because 1) my natural (no relaxer) hair was already healthy and properly moisturized, 2)  </li>
            <li>and I am still trying to correct the damage by continuing to do my weekly deep conditioning, eliminating hair products with protein  and co-washing more frequently.  </li>
            <li>I remember it being a real messy hassle (it still is), but loved the results.  </li>
            <li>(it needs to be tight, make sure the plastic is in contact with the mix), and let it rest for 24h in a warm (not hot) place.</li>
            <li>Best part is that the color has not faded from the grey AT ALL and my hard well water has not changed the color either!  </li>
            <li>I only need to do roots about every 4 weeks, and the white hairs get a deep auburn color, which is very nice.</li>
            <li>and I love the complex, rich color.     </li>
            <li>This turned my strands a deep gorgeous mahogany color that I had envied on other women who use chemical dies.  </li>
            <li>My hair came out very soft and a beautiful mahogony color ( I have black and lots of grey hair).</li>
            <li>After about 10 minutes, when the indigo has set with the Nupur/conditioner mixture (or however long the indigo powder package says) - make sure you have an old t-shirt on - put on the gloves and carefully apply all over your hair, rubbing it in to make sure it is reaching all the hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The seller was very fast with delivery, I only wish it was double sealed and had a crop date, I gave it 4 stars because of that and doing so many hair rinses, but</li>

            <li>I began to research natural hair coloring methods and came across henna coloring, which seemed too good to be true: a completely natural herbal mixture that could subtly color and also enhance the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>- I start the night before I have nothing to do the next morning - so like a Friday night where I am just going to hang around and clean the house, watch TV etc.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product so far I have only bought it twice but was able to freeze my remaining left overs to use a second time.</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t understand why many are using the whole package as I always have some left over following this recipe, then again my hair is fairly straight</li>
            <li>I used a leave in homemade conditioner after using the henna the first time, and my hair softness came right back.</li>
            <li>I sometimes sleep on \\&quot;hanging\\&quot; twists at night to bring some texture back to the lower half of my hair, and it looks good with lots of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Left my hair very soft and the color was fantastic.</li>
            <li>We can only thank our lucky stars for this wonderfully natural way to color and restore hair!!!</li>
            <li>I have deep, dark hair with very early graying (whiteing would be more accurate).</li>
            <li>My hair feels amazing after I rinse this treatment out, and the feeling usually lasts for about a week or so.  </li>
            <li>It tints your hair and is fabulous for it in the long term.</li>
            <li>I mixed cool water, then henna in to make a pudding-like paste.</li>
            <li>The first three days after we used this, both of us had drier hair than when we started, but that pretty much went away with no lasting effects.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair feels so soft, I should be bald as much as I play in my hair now!</li>
            <li>My hair felt pretty soft and there was a noticeable shine.</li>
            <li>I meant to add that usually I don&#x27;t put conditioner on my scalp or on the top part of my hair, only on the lower ends because my fine hair gets oily fast when I do.  </li>
            <li>So I just started from the middle, applying henna to the hair roots first, right side then left side and then back and top of my head.</li>
            <li>Good quality and has other (different) natural ingredients</li>
            <li>Again, it&#x27;s not super drastic, but it is definitely more noticeable than doing the gloss.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for a darker, silky black hair like many Indian women.  </li>
            <li>Initially I was hesitant but the more I researched henna&#x27;s use for deep conditioning,</li>
            <li>Their henna is awesome, but so expensive, especially with shipping.</li>
            <li>4 inches (with regular trimming, as well as a really cute cut about a year ago), as well as overall increased thickness and hair health.</li>
            <li>goal was to color my grays, which was mainly on my front edges.</li>
            <li>I dislike red hair, to put it mildly, on me.</li>
            <li>The red isn&#x27;t that red and looks ok with olive skin.</li>
            <li>The good side is that my hair did not feel dried out after no poo shampoo and deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I apply whatever is left to the rest of my hair, if I have enough I apply it to all my hair, if not, I apply it to sections, it makes an interesting color variation that</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat this for natural, chemical free hair color, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>I can only imagine how many times you can use this on short hair!  </li>
            <li>I can only imagine how many times you can use this on short hair!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been researching and checking out youtube videos of women who tried this particular brew, so I decided to mix it all up over the holiday weekend.  </li>
            <li>: I have almost hip length hair, trying to grow into classic length (halfway of the body).</li>
            <li>Every 1 1/2 month as my main henna herbal hair pack.</li>
            <li>My mother and I have used this powder to dye our hair for awhile now, and since she has more white hair, it is obvious that this color does not fade!</li>
            <li>Color are all similar, bronze brown in the beginning and later will turn more brown.</li>
            <li>the color is strong so you don&#x27;t have to wonder if you&#x27;re going to get pink hair or apricot poodle hair.</li>
            <li>so, I would usually follow with indigo after henna, and I was gonna do same this time too, but when I saw rich, beautiful and dark shade, it gave to my hair</li>
            <li>considering my extra long hair, I would take a guess that one bag will easily provide me with 6 uses!  </li>
            <li>So considering my extra long hair, I would take a guess that one bag will easily provide me with 6 uses!  </li>
            <li>Years later, I find myself sprouting a couple of gray hairs and order Godrej Nupur Mehendi (henna), and that odd, hay-like scent takes me back many years, though it&#x27;s not nearly as pungent as what I grew up smelling (which is a good thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mixed up the whole package and had more than enough for my hair which reaches to my mid-back and is of average thickness but quite fine.</li>
            <li>Compared with the hennas I had used in the past, I found the texture of the Nupur Mehendi really pleasant, sort of slippery (maybe because of the aloe?) and not nearly as gritty.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I highly recommend this Henna.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I highly recommend this Henna.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the Nupur henna with the 9 herbs.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product....</li>
            <li>While much messier and much more expensive, the Lush one gives me better results, so</li>
            <li>While much messier and much more expensive, the Lush one gives me better results, so I&#x27;ll be returning to it.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised many still make up the whole pack, one reviewer says she freezes half of it.</li>
            <li>the longer it sits in that iron pot, the iron leaches into the mix, turning it from green to black, adding a darker tint your blond/light brown hair, would imagine that the iron leached from the pot is a good thing as well, absorbed in to your scalp.)  </li>
            <li>This made my hair soft and feel really good, and did give it a slight red tint, which I wanted!</li>
            <li>but I am just so amazed at the rich, deep color this product provides NATURALLY ....</li>
            <li>-Mix whole package with 2 cups hot water, or 1 cup hot water and 1 cup hot black coffee</li>
            <li>I rinsed it out, and it felt a little bit better.</li>
            <li>I rinsed it out, and it felt a little bit better.</li>
            <li>And Wow!!  </li>
            <li>-Small plastic sheet (I used the bubble wrap and plastic sheet which is found inside the Amazon shipments sometimes :)  -Vaseline (100% pure petroleum jelly),</li>
            <li>My hair does not get colored easily neither am I fond of coloring my hair (I love my dark black hair) and this henna does the job.</li>
            <li>and I would say this is due to not over-watering the mix and leaving it to \\&quot;set up\\&quot; overnight for dye release which made the mix creamy and easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>although the whole process of mixing and applying is very exhausting i really enjoyed it!!   </li>
            <li>Even though this is a messy treatment which requires a serious time commitment, it is well worth it as it is economical and really good for your hair.</li>
            <li>Even though this is a messy treatment which requires a serious time commitment, it is well worth it as it is economical and really good for your hair.</li>
            <li>As far as how to mix and what to use to mix, its really up to you.</li>
            <li>(My natural color is medium brown with about 25% gray, I have chin-length straight hair.</li>
            <li>It has been a week since applying and my hair is silky soft, has a beutiful shine and just seems so much fuller.  </li>
            <li>We use this to color our grey hair - it is a natural product that the hairdresser will apply for you at a huge cost.</li>
            <li>After much research about natural alternatives (henna, indigo, etc.), I decided to try henna.  </li>
            <li>Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder with purified water, extra virgin Olive Oil, and Coconut Oil (My hair responded very well with this mix the first time).</li>
            <li>but your hands will eventually return to its normal color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hair started becoming thicker with henna and my heart was pumping fast-I was actually applying henna finally!</li>
            <li>The results were unbelievable: my dullish dark brown hair had hints of auburn and a deep reddish tone and my hair that can be \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; was relaxed and full of shine, feeling great to the touch (and easier to style too).</li>
            <li>I normally just agree with others</li>
            <li>finally few days ago i was able to try it.</li>
            <li>Now the Lush bar is supposed to contain indigo, but no idea why the colour was so light on the grey.</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s better than the noticeably grown-out blonde highlights, but it&#x27;s by no means back to my natural color.</li>
            <li>This stuff is SO worth it!ezer for future use.  </li>
            <li>Not only is my hair thicker , it is also silky and my dandruff is pretty much cured.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>That is normal.</li>
            <li>few more stirs</li>
            <li>But doesn&#x27;t cost much, it&#x27;s worth a try if you are in dire need of deep conditioning...!</li>
            <li>Normally I would do a ACV rinse, but I did not.</li>
            <li>It was a nice consistency- not runny and not too thick either.  </li>
            <li>it works great, is easy to use, and is less messy than other brands that I have tried.</li>
            <li>Not hard to wash out.  </li>
            <li>The consistency can be like ketchup but not hard and not liquidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mix Zenia Indigo Powder (apply immediately) apply paste to hair; Cover head with saran wrap and let sit for one hour or more; rinse and marvel at your shiny black hair!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I had read countless reviews stating that this stuff adds amazing shine, I thought that it was a slight exaggeration.  </li>
            <li>I mixed it with strong cofee, covered it a and left over night.</li>
            <li>I let the henna sit on my head for 4 hours and deep condition right after.</li>
            <li>Through trial and error, I finally found the right combination.  </li>
            <li>months later, I would like to share my education and journey to get it right.  </li>
            <li>When i don&#x27;t use it, it comes right back.  </li>
            <li>When I did the gloss, since it&#x27;s more slippery with the conditioner, I made a mess!  </li>
            <li>I mix it with organic whole milk yogurt, egg (if i have it on hand), oil (melted coconut oil, jamaican black castor oil, or homemade hair oil), lime juice (if i have on hand, i use it mainly for its refreshing scent), essential oils (if i feel like it).</li>
            <li>While it didn&#x27;t lighten my hair, it did add definite red highlights to it that were even more apparent in the sun.  </li>
            <li>The combination of 9 herbs makes it stand out from other hennas available in the market.</li>
            <li>I have rather long thick hair and really got good use of this</li>
            <li>So when I used this product I actually can honestly say my hair feels stronger, yes of course its still rubbery that is going to take a long time to heal but Its possible.</li>
            <li>I mix the henna with warm water and leave it over night, then mix with indigo and a little coconut oil later.  </li>
            <li>For those new to henna, it WORKS fantastically without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li>I am completely new at coloring my hair with henna.  </li>
            <li>Indigofera Tinctoria New Crop]]  </li>
            <li>Indigofera Tinctoria New Crop]]  </li>
            <li>a new option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really just slightly lighter tone of brown from my original hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>1/3 or healthy squeeze of raw honey</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American and my hair is naturally light to medium brown.</li>
            <li>However, I shied away as it seemed too exotic and some people made it sound like it would be difficult to use.  </li>
            <li>It gives my hair nice red streaks without looking harsh.</li>
            <li>Light color deposited on my hair, only obvious in the sun.</li>
            <li>but i decided to stop putting harsh chemicals on my hair a to go with a more natural approach...</li>
            <li>I first mixed this henna with hot water to a yogart consistency the night before and then refrigerated it for a few hours the next day to bring out more color.  </li>
            <li>Then mixed the whole thing real well.  </li>
            <li>Just doing roots I should be able to get by on 3 bags per year - at a cost of $3.43 per bag, this is just a little over $10 per year to color my hair!  </li>
            <li>Just doing roots I should be able to get by on 3 bags per year - at a cost of $3.43 per bag, this is just a little over $10 per year to color my hair!  </li>
            <li>&quot; Of course, we all like to add a little shine and snazz up our color from time, as was quickly becoming the case with myself.</li>
            <li>this hena doesnt look right , doesnt smell right and the results are aweful , it made my hair look brown to really light even though my hair was dark black.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very natural</li>
            <li>It also looked very natural.  </li>
            <li>It is a very natural color, and I like to apply it once every 2 or 3 weeks</li>
            <li>Out of 3 boxes I used, however, 1 was very old</li>
            <li>I get compliments on my hair all the time and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>After the first use, my hair felt different and I thought, meh new product and my hair needs to get adjusted.  </li>
            <li>Just because it is natural does not mean it will work without errors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not easy trying to go a more natural route in life</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I henna&#x27;d for the first time last weekend.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I&#x27;d ever personally dyed my hair.  </li>
            <li>This product completely covered greys!  </li>
            <li>I recently bought this from a local Indian grocer and was skeptical to try it at first but after reading all the incredible reviews about Nupur Mehendi, I decided to try it to start off my natural hair journey.</li>
            <li>I have straight-ish black fine hair</li>
            <li>My husband commented \\&quot;it&#x27;s early Halloween time!</li>
            <li>It changes my gray hair to a pretty auburn red.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft &amp; silky!</li>
            <li>I used this henna for the first time last week.</li>
            <li>My grays are completely covered and are now copper highlights!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 38, so I really didn&#x27;t want to be stuck damaging my hair and scalp for another 20+ years!</li>
            <li>Also, as other users have surely mentioned, rub vaseline or something similar around your hairline and neck to avoid staining your face.  </li>
            <li>I used about 3/4 of the package of this Nupur henna this first time, and had some left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used about 3/4 of the package of this Nupur henna this first time, and had some left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>henna process takes so long, but for the way my hair feels I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>My hair color looks natural!  </li>
            <li>My hair color looks natural!  </li>
            <li>It was getting pretty obvious and I decided to do something about it.</li>
            <li>This henna also made my hair pretty red...</li>
            <li>Start at the bottom and work in small sections towards the top of your head.</li>
            <li>but my roots are very red still pretty though...</li>
            <li>this is the smell of henna because it is a natural herb!.  </li>
            <li>After the first application my hair was coppery red and shone in the sun.  </li>
            <li>Next time I will use the whole bag, probably not for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>Next time I will use the whole bag, probably not for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>I left mine on for 1 hour and the result is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking i like this one better simply because it has all the other stuff mix into it.</li>
            <li>I bought it first, and then watched several you tube videos about how to henna your hair.</li>
            <li>The only downfall for this product I have noticed is that it STINKS, not the \\&quot;earthy\\&quot; smell so many people nicely give it...</li>
            <li>(My 4 year old son asked me why I put poo on my hair!)</li>
            <li>Now my hair is dry and frazzled, (despite using plenty of oil and moisture masques) the same color it was before all this, and full of sand!  </li>
            <li>(I spent a good amount of time rinsing the first time, but not enough as I still had a tiny trace left, but not enough to be noticable.</li>
            <li>Might be dry, the ends, for some reason for a few days after, but i use oils, and pretty soon ends are better than ever.</li>
            <li>clean cool whip plastic bowl or some other plastic food bowl along with a wooden ice cream stick that you can purchase on Amazon, Walmart or your local scrapbooking store is used to make the mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well I bought Light Mountain (black) Henna.</li>
            <li>Just put it on freshly cleaned, dry hair, wrap your head with plastic wrap &amp; put a shower cap over it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle enough, that even when I do it more rarely</li>
            <li>so I kept the clip aside and wore the cap (Underneath this pretty blue cap, I also wore one of my old shower caps).   </li>
            <li>I mixed this with warm chamomile tea and the juice of 1/2 a small lemon.  </li>
            <li>When I was using the Lush henna, people regularly commented on how pretty and shiny my hair was, and that hasn&#x27;t happened at all since I used the Nupur brand.  </li>
            <li>When I was using the Lush henna, people regularly commented on how pretty and shiny my hair was, and that hasn&#x27;t happened at all since I used the Nupur brand.  </li>
            <li>soooo pretty sooo soft and shiny...i&#x27;m not big on the smell</li>
            <li>I use it as part of a deep conditioner for my dark brown 4A/B hair, and I love how my hair feels when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m still going to do the indigo process next to get more of a dark brown/black color.  </li>
            <li>I knew that henna would not change the color of my dark brown hair, at the most give me reddish highlights which could only be seen in the sun.  </li>
            <li>your hair is not dark enough, brew a big pot of tea, strong black tea, and cool it to room temperature.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m black, so my hair is dark brown, now my hair has a reddish brown tint to it and is really really soft and strong!!</li>
            <li>I whisked it until it was smooth, covered it with plastic wrap (pushed down into the container to sit directly on the henna</li>
            <li>that they leave a huge mess all over the place.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rich dark chocolate color with burgundy highlights.  </li>
            <li>The color is rich and dark.</li>
            <li>i bought this thinking it would make my mousy brown hair a rich dark brown</li>
            <li>I imagine that once I cut off my commercially dyed black ends it will look more even.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dyed my hair with typical commercial dyes before, and they never color the greys, make my head itch, and make too many hairs fall out.  </li>
            <li>and i am ordering more i only needed half a pack</li>
            <li>Grey is easier to tame and a nice glistening redish hue versus the unsightly salt on pepper color.  </li>
            <li>VERY glad I left it on for only half the recommended time!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, strong and curlier and does not dry it out like other type of henna i have used.</li>
            <li>The result was a reddish, light brown color which was very pretty and lasted approximately 12 weeks.  </li>
            <li>It definitely works and you certainly can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
            <li>So I bought some regular, pure indigo powder from Amazon, the Zenia brand.  </li>
            <li>I mix full fat yoghurt and a scrambled raw egg in with the mixture when I am ready to apply it, for the fat and protein treatment.  </li>
            <li>They all pretty much recommended 100% henna, and so I was a bit concerned when I realized that this had alot of other natural ingredients...</li>
            <li>I have tried several cheap brands, but most of them were too weak, had chemical additives in them, or weren&#x27;t ground finely enough.</li>
            <li>But, I highly recommend adding some sort of oil: moroccan, avocado, coconut or even an egg apparently to the mix before putting on your hair.  </li>
            <li>The color is saturated, not pale.</li>
            <li>All the previous nupur reviews were really useful for me!</li>
            <li>It is a little more red auburn than copper auburn now.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While the hair is being washed out, the water looks muddy but the water will turn clear after the paste is washed out of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rest of the mixture I applied directly with gloves since I had to cover the whole length of hair-brush was helpful for the roots only.</li>
            <li>I rinsed until the water ran clear.</li>
            <li>let it sit for 1 hour and then rinsed until the water was clear.  </li>
            <li>let the henna sit on my hair for 4-5 hours covered with a plastic grocery bag, then rinse it off till the water runs clear.</li>

            <li>I removed the cap and rinsed my hair until the water ran clear.</li>

            <li>I am always looking for natural beauty products that don&#x27;t have harmful chemicals in them.  </li>
            <li>I just did this gloss yesterday and my hair is still so soft and shiny, and not a bit oily.</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd day after the application, and the color hasn&#x27;t really changed.  </li>
            <li>With only one use this product left my 4b type curly hair shiny and smooth, I evenly mixed it with [[ASIN:B000RLBTMA Jamila Henna Powder 3.5oz (100g)]] for the added ingredients and followed</li>
            <li>-Rinse henna out completely after 3-4 hours.  </li>
            <li>You also want to put an old towel or something on the floor.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so soft after I use it.  </li>
            <li>Depending on your natural hair color, henna WILL make your hair red/orange.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a chance to see it in natural daylight yet, but inside it almost has some purplish tones to it.</li>
            <li>If you have short hair, you probably don&#x27;t need that much.      </li>
            <li>To deepen the color of my locs, I had been using Bijen powdered hair dye and had become sensitive to the product.</li>
            <li>I had developed itching and an adult cradle cap.  </li>
            <li>I did my internet research and decided to go natural.    </li>
            <li>It covers my gray and makes my hair shinny and soft.</li>
            <li>My hair was soooo soft during and aftewards...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those girls who faithfully sticks by natural hair and who is always trying to find ways to boost the health and shine of my hair, rather than blasting it with chemical treatments and colors.</li>
            <li>(I used to have a stylist put highlights in, but I&#x27;ve become sensitive to chemical hair</li>
            <li>I watched a couple videos on YouTube, and then decided to mix it with coffee, a natural conditioner and coconut oil.  </li>

            <li>B00312PRU2 100 Grams Bag of Natural Indigo Powder (wasma in Arabic and Urdu)</li>
            <li>It does not color my hair but makes my hair so soft and shiny and soothes my itchy scalp too.</li>
            <li>My result was exactly as expected on the hair that is still my natural color--the same lovely red highlights and body</li>
            <li>so far.</li>
            <li>If you let this sit on your hair for the recommended amount of time, you WILL get redder hair, based off your natural color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural product, which is plant-based.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft and luscious.</li>
            <li>You just are not supposed to use it and expect your hair to remain blond or have it revert your grey/white hair to its natural state.</li>
            <li>I developed allergic reaction to PPD in permanent hair dyes, so I&#x27;m looking for something \\&quot;natural\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered this product now a third time and it really conditions my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the formula and process that worked very well for me after different experiments and attempts - if you have brown hair and want it softer, shinier, richer, deeper, with coppery shine in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It will soon be soft and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks like I went to a salon and had my hair professionally colored.</li>
            <li>My hair has been natural for three years now.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the red highlights</li>
            <li>and I used the product to cover modest gray around my hairline.  </li>
            <li>(it was getting really late) and the color came out fantastic!  </li>
            <li>So far I have still not figured how to combat the dryness immediately after henna.</li>
            <li>However, the strength and body that my hair takes on after the treatment far outweighs the temporary dryness.</li>
            <li>Overall, If you think it might turn your hair orange do try it on some of your hair before applying it to your whole head.</li>
            <li>I am going to compare this product with Lush Henna bars because these are the two products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Another advantage is that it is easier to wash off than the Lush henna.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rinse in a metal sink (kitchen)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike Hair dye you can wash your hair directly after using henna.</li>

            <li>The 150 grams made enough for 2+ uses on my whole head.)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really comment on the tint because I mixed it with indigo to forego the reddish color.</li>

            <li>Hello,  Nupur henna is 100% natural</li>
            <li>I did not dare to do the bleach, as much as I wanted my blond hair back</li>
            <li>it does take about 3 shampoos, even if in a row, to completely rinse residue.  </li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m just not that much of a natural girl.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t surprised.  </li>
            <li>So far i feel that my hair is soft...</li>
            <li>If you are protein sensitive, I would not use this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason I tried this product is because I was told it made your hair soft.</li>
            <li>I have naturally chestnut brown hair and it colors my hair auburn.</li>
            <li>I also put a old towel around my neck to catch the drips.  </li>

            <li>i&#x27;m 39 years old and have been dying my hair for years</li>
            <li>It is a pain in the butt to completely rinse off.</li>
            <li>and after I washed the henna out my hair was sooooo soft.</li>
            <li>It should turn from green to a brownish color, leave it to sit in warm place for at least 24hrs, I used my stove and left the stove light on.</li>
            <li>I am still looking for a old cast iron pot.  </li>
            <li>My hair is now soft, silky and even feels stronger and thicker than ever before.</li>
            <li>This brand worked very well because it covered my white hair without any difficulty.  </li>
            <li>her gray hair turned totally orange, and did not see much conditioning effect either.</li>
            <li>However, i know that is not the companies fault that I am allergic but, as a warning if your sensitive, this may not be the product for</li>
            <li>I have used this henna 4 times so far</li>
            <li>I have a mix of 4a-c in my hair and the the curls were soft and</li>
            <li>A drawback from using natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>A drawback from using natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and the shedding stopped immediately.  </li>
            <li>Now I switched to the natural stuff,</li>
            <li>all natural though)</li>
            <li>(I never dye, cut or do really anything with my hair, just regular trims!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The hair did lose some natural curl but is stronger and healthier feeling after this treatment.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m natural.</li>
            <li>I would recommend trying another product if you&#x27;re sensitive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an African-American natural with 4a/4b hair.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural way to cover the gray and did a lot of research on henna, as i used to use it when I was in my 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>doing a month of research on henna from wherever possible, I was still just not into it,so many questions brewing in my mind everyday seemed like solving the never ending mysteries of hennaland.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few different hennas on my hair and all have been better than this.</li>
            <li>This henna is so powerful that my scalp is a bit orange, but wait to shampoo until the next day, or until several days have passed.</li>
            <li>I mush the cap to my head and make sure that there is a thick towel or two on my pillow.  </li>
            <li>even better I only used half the bag!</li>
            <li>i will do another review i will try tomorrow  with hibiscus infusion and plain yogurt and coconut oil so far it will have a total of 24 plus hours more than planned but didn&#x27;t have the time to apply it today.</li>
            <li>It made my hair a nice reddish brown as my hair is naturally quite dark brown, almost black.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this a little over a year and in the beginning just used on its own but have since added some other herbs for conditioning  before i freeze.  </li>
            <li>I made a smooth mixture of this product and plain yogurt (curd).</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t fade so much that the white returns; that only happens on the new hair growth!  </li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t fade so much that the white returns; that only happens on the new hair growth!  </li>
            <li>Okay, this is really partially my fault, but I was not aware that this was henna.  </li>
            <li>First the mix was too dry</li>
            <li>then i usually buy them for, so i was worried a little, but it was cheap and free shipping</li>
            <li>, the hard well water would fade the beautiful red shade within a week - a waste of money.  </li>
            <li>Around 2 cups, but slowly add until pudding consistency, a little more watery is better than too dry.</li>
            <li>If you have black hair (the rest of my hair that was dyed black) it will add astounding tones and hues of red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have black hair (the rest of my hair that was dyed black) it will add astounding tones and hues of red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a little messy but i am very pleased with the results and having found this product, as i use to purchase this product in the Uk where i am from.</li>
            <li>Since January 2013, I&#x27;ve gained over 3 inches on average in hair growth all over my head, so I expect to retain more length using the Godrej Nupur and can only imagine the total growth in inches by the end of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another fun thing about henna you what other have posted on here and on the web or create a recipe that works for your hair type.</li>
            <li>Even before reapplication, the roots weren&#x27;t overly obvious, but upon close inspection it looked as though my hair was growing in gray due to the contrast between the rich henna color and my natural lack of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(buy a new cheap one you will need it for the next few times you wash your hair)&lt;br /&gt;water</li>
            <li>(I left it on for 2 hours for my first treatment, but I will do an extra hour in the future).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***After</li>
            <li>Since this particular brand does not include any instructions and doesn&#x27;t come with gloves or a cap (the reason for only 4 stars)</li>
            <li>It took a bit of extra time to do the separate applications, but I knew what I wanted and was willing to spend a bit of extra time to achieve it.</li>
            <li>My hair used to be blonde turning to a honey brown as I grew older.</li>
            <li>I repeated the exact steps 4 days later and got the same results except my strands appeared stronger than before...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t color hair dark in one application though you will have to use the whole packet and it works very well for coloring hairs.</li>
            <li>I henna all my hair first, and do only root cover one week later.  </li>
            <li>Then the next day, I mixed the indigo henna with hot water and let that set for 10 to 15 minutes before adding it it to the Mehendi mixture.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands of henna over the past year .  </li>
            <li>I used 2 cups h2o with 4 green tea bags and pretty much used all the liquid to get a yogarty consistancy.</li>
            <li>The result was a pretty deep red color, and my hair feels silky and thicker as well.</li>
            <li>Generally she prefer other brands back in India but none of those were available hence went for this.</li>
            <li>Very, very hard...which I expected, but was still not used</li>
            <li>Very, very hard...which I expected, but was still not used to.  </li>
            <li>I highly suggest mixing a lot of lemon juice and tea tree oil to &amp;#34;turp&amp;#34; it, and leaving it overnight for the dye to release before applying it to your head the next day.</li>
            <li>I was aware that the amla may make it a little less red, but that was okay with me.  </li>
            <li>The only thing was that it was a little grainny, but it washed out just fine.</li>
            <li>I made up the entire batch and divided into 3 thicker than normal applications (froze 2 of them in some plastic wrap)</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I completed applying the mixtures, I wrapped my hair in saran wrap, covered it with a plastic shower cap, and also about an hour in, I covered the plastic cap with a hot wet towel.</li>
            <li>My cousin hair turned back to normal after a year.</li>
            <li>my hair may be back to normal in 6 months ^.^.</li>
            <li>Shampoo the next day as normal.</li>
            <li>And last but not least, while I was using the henna my head started hurting</li>
            <li>I normally mix my henna with Hibiscus tea to bring out the color, but this time I used a South African Rooibos Tea.</li>
            <li>and I let it sit a few days in a cool place so it won&#x27;t mold.  </li>
            <li>True, it was a bit messy</li>
            <li>had a cap-soft and very fit for average sized head and had ties, a paint brush, a plastic spatula/mixer, a dark cape</li>
            <li>I am Asian and originally have black hair.</li>
            <li>&quot; Most of the other people complaining do not seem to understand that henna does turn your hair some shade of orange not brown or black.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty common for cheaper hennas to use sand as filler, but not usually this much.    </li>
            <li>Yes, needs effort and a block of your precious time, but sooo much better than other artificial conditioners and hair colors on the market.</li>
            <li>I am relatively new to ayervedic hair care, so I did not realize mehendi meant the same as henna.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t remember how much this Amazon seller is asking, but I bought mine at a local Indian grocery for $3.99 for 188g, which will last me 2-3 treatments.</li>
            <li>If you do not have a head full of grey hair, it appears that it does not add color or not much to the rest of the hair as I guess it depends on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I felt that the effects lasted only a couple of weeks unlike the color which is lasting much longer.</li>
            <li>Usually, in the shower I get pieces of hair more than a foot long that get pulled out.</li>
            <li>I mix this a few tablespoons,because i keep my hair short, with a capful of mustard oil, olive oil and cocunut oil (Vatika is a fabulous oil), and brewed tea.  </li>
            <li>I try not to use chemical hair dye as I&#x27;ve developed an allergy to ppd in dark hair dye, and the result was a pretty color</li>
            <li>Mixed it with water, got dye release in 3 hours, added coconut oil, then applied over the whole head and left it on for 4 hours.  </li>
            <li>First, as others have mentioned, it was gritty (possible sand) and second, most of the color has seemed to wash out in less than two weeks time (which has never happened to me with other brands).</li>
            <li>After using this product and deep conditioning, my hair was just as soft and nice as it usually is after any other henna treatment.</li>
            <li>my natural hair colour is black or a very very brown color.</li>
            <li>This henna also rinsed out very easy, not like some of the other brands I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to start applying it that was not able to sleep well, but had to wait for around 8 hours.</li>
            <li>(make sure it&#x27;s coconut milk that DOES NOT contain other additives such as any type of sugar or other fillers.</li>
            <li>i was a bit histant at first due to the fact</li>
            <li>My hair felt very striped and stiff this time and it didn&#x27;t even seem like there was much color change.</li>
            <li>I only used half the bag (shoulder-length hair) and mixed it in water and lemon juice until it was a yogurt consistency for 3.5 hours, in a warm (not hot) place.  </li>
            <li>My scalp feels clean as opposed to greasy (it usually gets oily, I can&#x27;t skip hair wash every morning)...</li>
            <li>The first results are dark brown, where my hair is dark brown, and a russett color where I am gray, in the next few days the russet turns to a nice mahogany/burgundy.  </li>
            <li>I made a huge mess but it was only on my naked self &amp; all over the shower stall!  </li>
            <li>I expected more mess and not enough.</li>
            <li>Always leaves my hair smoother and curlier, and I can tell it works particularly well on my crown area which is the most difficult area of my hair for me to work with.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will purchase it again as long as the quality is maintained.  </li>
            <li>Dyed my hair a rich red color that I later toned down to a medium auburn with coffee and indigo powder.</li>
            <li>That gave the exact color that I was looking for - which was something that was a little deeper than my natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That gave the exact color that I was looking for - which was something that was a little deeper than my natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I admit to genuine fear when I took off my cap and seeing how rock hard my hair was.</li>
            <li>My dark brown hair was a little lighter and I was pleased with the shade.  </li>
            <li>I left it on for 6 hours and then rinsed well with water and used a conditioning shampoo to rinse out the henna until the water ran clear.  </li>
            <li>I have natural red hair (red red, not strawberry blond or auburn), and in the last 3 years it has really faded.</li>
            <li>My hair has NEVER, EVER felt soft or silky in my entire life.</li>
            <li>As for this natural chick, I&#x27;m hooked on henna if you can&#x27;t tell, and I can&#x27;t wait to see what develops next.</li>
            <li>: I am a natural blonde with wavy hair so don&#x27;t fret about the oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been putting on an old t-shirt with a big opening and putting a stylist&#x27;s robe on over that.  </li>
            <li>I went back to old faithful henna and will never dye with chemicals again.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, red hair.  </li>
            <li>my roots were starting to show as well, my natural color is a mousy brown.</li>
            <li>I applied with my bare hands thinking &amp;#34;if</li>
            <li>My hair is normally soft and still feels the same</li>
            <li>I have never had my eye do that before, apparently I must be allergic to one of the herbs added in.</li>
            <li>I actually used the rest of it on my 8 year old daughter (she has brown hair, and</li>
            <li>finish product is worth the trouble.</li>
            <li>It was messy and smelly, but fun to apply.</li>
            <li>Lots of white/gray coming in, manageability; which was growing worse as more gray showed up, shine, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning, 8 hours later, I sit in the bottom of the shower to minimize splashing of the mess that I have to clean up later.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally very curly, which means very dry!</li>
            <li>(and the whole time I was at work, I hoped that it wouldn&#x27;t have been left for too long and it started losing the color!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a blond or your hair is all gray or white, henna is going to turn  your hair probably like a strawberry red or orange, or the color of a shiny new penny.</li>
            <li>When my new growth is a bit longer I will use the same mixture only at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That was at this point more heavily disbursed in the bottom half of my head.</li>
            <li>method is to add some fresh lemon juice (strained) or a some plain yogurt, and the rest is water.  </li>
            <li>After half hour application and 3.5 hours left henna on my hair, I found this powder did not change much of my chemically dyed ends but turned my new grown root hair from gray to orange reddish.  </li>
            <li>All I did to make the gloss was add half a packet of this henna blend and one cup of hot water (from the tap) and mix it in a plastic bowl.  </li>
            <li>Tried this for the first time in 2014 and heard about it from black woman on YouTube.  </li>
            <li>I used half the mix for the first application, freezing the rest.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found that adding a little coconut oil when I mix it helps it be a little more workable.</li>
            <li>Most people complain about the smell, this brand smells just like any of the other hennas I have used in the past..</li>
            <li>The night before, I mixed the powder in a large Pyrex bowl, adding in hot water until it formed a thick paste that looked like peanut butter or brownie batter.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, if you mix it correctly and leave it on your hair long enough, it is extremely vibrant.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need 4 it to strengten your hair, just do other protein</li>
            <li>This really serves no purpose other than to help control the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will be using this henna from now on, it is also much creamier than the other brands I have used, there was no grittiness at all.  </li>
            <li>] in a bowl with a metal spoon (which is apparently a no-no, but I didn&#x27;t think it actually had a major effect on the product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taken me about two years to finally work up the nerve to do it, and, a few months ago, I tried the Lush henna for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it a few ways -- starting from the bottom up, and from the top down.  </li>
            <li>Grey hair turned very light brown, black hair remained black.</li>
            <li>I mixed the indigo with water, applied to my red new growth only,</li>
            <li>(if you have this accessories kit, you need not worry about looking for old shirts and towels), applied Vaseline on my forehead, ears, cheeks, neck), added very little water to the henna mixture since it looked little more thicker and mixed it again, wore gloves and started applying henna on my hair with the brush.</li>
            <li>Only bad thing is while applying she experienced some hair fall.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s such a great way to dye your hair without all the bad chemicals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural red head, but my color has been faded by recent bleaching.</li>
            <li>Not only does it dye as nicely as the expensive stuff</li>
            <li>Usually my hair has dark brown color, but after using this product my hair became reddish and I love how it&#x27;s looks now.</li>
            <li>I am an Asian with straight fine black hair which give a brownish tint in the sun, I am having many white hair showing up though I am in my mid twenties (never ever used any chemicals/perms/hot treatments on my hair)which looked ugly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a major bonus that I can keep applying it on a regular basis, and it continues to treat my hair every time.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend people take reviewer S. Waller&#x27;s protocol:   - wash hair, damp dry  - add eggs and lots of essential oil to the henna paste    </li>
            <li>Cover your hair with a shower cap or plastic wrap tightly (avoid too much air from getting in a drying the mixture; once it dries, it is not active anymore).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I made sure to use a dark bath towel to dry my hair &amp; put on a black shirt.  </li>
            <li>I made sure to use a dark bath towel to dry my hair &amp; put on a black shirt.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it right away but would think it should last longer than a few months.</li>
            <li>I rinsed it out until the water ran clear which didn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li>I rinsed it out until the water ran clear which didn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li>I apply conditioner to my hair, and then as I sit there, I carefully, apply coconut oil, to my scalp only, parting the hair the same way that I did when I applied the blend, and touch the coconut oil to my scalp, then gently with my fingers under my hair, massage my scalp with the oil.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s messy, so be ready!</li>
            <li>/&gt;You must wear gloves, and the stain will come off on your fingers the first few days when styling the hair.</li>
            <li>Approaching my near 30s, I had never permed, relaxed, or colored my hair (hard to believe, right?)</li>
            <li>For reference, we both have straight, black hair (pretty typical Asian hair).  </li>
            <li>&#x27;s my recipe for changing my short, thin, fine brunette hair with about 35% gray into a soft, glossy, deep brunette with glistening auburn highlights and plenty of body and wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then when you&#x27;re ready to apply, place the bucket mix inside your bathtub, and flip your hair upside down into the bucket.</li>
            <li>And my hair was little red at first,  </li>
            <li>BUT, I have considerably less shedding (my main reason for getting it!)</li>
            <li>This way it was very fast and zero mess!</li>
            <li>I tried few hennas, some much more expensive, but I have never liked any of them as much as  I liked this one.</li>
            <li>, just watch it carefully, then rinse if you think you can&#x27;t live w the color.</li>
            <li>After I rinsed my hair (without shampoo or conditioner), I let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly/kinky 4 b/c hair that can often be dry.</li>
            <li>Dec. 17, 2012*****&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve let the color develop for up to a week and that seems to work very well; it gets less orange with a longer development time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If the porcelain on your tub is old and porous, like mine, the small amount of water will prevent real contact and allow you to rinse the tub out quckly when you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had dyed it back to my natural color with chemical dye a year ago and have been using semipermanent dye since to cover my 5% grey.  </li>
            <li>This can get messy, especially the first time . .</li>
            <li>First off - It takes a few days for the tone to mellow and for the color to oxidize to the color it will actually be.</li>
            <li>The color (on us, obviously) darkened after the first few days as well.  </li>
            <li>The combo makes my hair appear super thick.  </li>
            <li>It will leave your hair a little dry after (like a day or so) but it is sooo worth it.</li>
            <li>I will probably mix a little indigo with it before applying next time though, because grey hair did turn red, but nothing loud, not orange like pure henna would.</li>
            <li>In general it is extremely difficult to deal with the smell of any power henna, not only that, the smell also stays in your hair and sculp for more than a month.</li>
            <li>There really wasn&#x27;t much of a mess at all.</li>
            <li>The comb was just slipping through my hair, they were so soft!</li>
            <li>The night before - in a glass or plastic bowl, using a plastic or wooden spoon, mix up all of the Nupur (green bag) with enough boiling hot water to make a pudding-like paste.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews, I really wanted to nourish my scalp, see new growth, have shiny thick hair...  </li>
            <li>I am sure the descriptions of all of these vibrant colors makes me sound like I went crazy with the crayola on my hair, but after a few washings, the colors toned down a lot!  </li>
            <li>B004IUN7JO 100g Pure USAWHR Indigo Powder Indigoferra Tinctoria To dye Hair Black Naturaly NO PPD]] ,emptied about 1/3 of the packet in a separate plastic container, mixed that with enough water to create a pudding like consistency, and let it sit for about 10 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>only used it twice so far (one month apart), but my hair feels soft, heathy, stronger, and neater (less frizz) along with coppery sheen.</li>
            <li>Now my hair is dark brown and what&#x27;s left of my high lights is brownish-reddish.</li>
            <li>Now I was little worried because the whole process was NOT MESSY AT ALL, and that was the last thing I expected.</li>
            <li>I am caucasian, with long straight dark brown hair.  </li>

            <li> Street Fighter\\&quot; LOL..  </li>
            <li> I had a great deal of breakage after using this.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> So great had to write a review.</li>
            <li> This stuff was great.</li>
            <li> I was happy that my gray hairs turned out this reddish coppery color that blended in my hair</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> But i eventually took the plunge &amp; I&#x27;m so happy i did.</li>
            <li> My hair feels/looks great.</li>
            <li> Great</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how much I love it!!)</li>
            <li> It turned out very nice without having to add lemon juice or apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is just amazing!</li>
            <li> I used coconut oil in my mix and water and just this bag, and the results were amazing!</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s say I was successful.</li>
            <li> For me, it is just as easy to use a heaping 1/3 cup measure with 2/3 cups of water and some of the Africa&#x27;s best oil.</li>
            <li> Seldom leave reviews, but something like bright orange hair needs a cautionary note.</li>
            <li> So after I&#x27;m done with my henna application, I follow up with the indigo just on my roots to cover the gray (which after the henna application is bright orange), leave it on for 1 hour, rinse, co-wash, rinse and</li>
            <li> It is an unwanted bright red/orange metallic color.  </li>
            <li> Things like people&#x27;s hair turning bright orange</li>
            <li> bright orange like 100% henna.</li>
            <li> looked like bright copper highlights.  </li>
            <li> (greys still bright copper highlights)-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always heard that Henna is good as a strengthner for you hair, but never knew which one to buy.  </li>
            <li> This is a good item</li>
            <li> The color deposit is really good.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this one after reading the reviews and it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> Really good hair color.</li>
            <li> Loved it.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have and all will be good after that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good as the others say even with all of the downsides.</li>
            <li> It practically feeds my hair with good stuff.  </li>
            <li> because I have what my stylists have called \\&quot;good hair.\\</li>
            <li> I tried explain to seller that it is expired but seller said it still good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this Henna the 5 stars it deserves because my hair feels soooo good,</li>
            <li> Not to mention, having gorgeous hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not to mention, having gorgeous hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , just felt it would be good to give you a time reference.</li>
            <li> I also followed up with a good dose of [[ASIN:B003XGYTQE</li>
            <li> It is so good.</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> so I had purchased indigo which will now be returned because the henna color I achieved is so jaw-droppingly gorgeous</li>
            <li> Between that time (salon color &amp; henna), I&#x27;ve again been researching and with good reason</li>
            <li> it stays looking good roots and all.  </li>
            <li> Condition, rinse again, and you&#x27;re good to go.     </li>
            <li> The result is too good to deny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good result.</li>
            <li> it had good dye release.</li>
            <li> but I have to say I loved the results.</li>
            <li> The product was good.</li>
            <li> would do this again just as a really good treatment but not as a hair dye.</li>
            <li> What is so good about Nupur?</li>
            <li> Then shampoo and give yourself a coconut oil treatment just for good measure, using [[ASIN:B006BA3BAY Dabur Vatika Coconut Hair Oil 150ml, 2 Count]].</li>
            <li> Keep up the good work</li>
            <li> At that time, I will give myself a coconut oil treatment just for good measure, using [[ASIN:B006BA3BAY Dabur Vatika Coconut Hair Oil 150ml, 2 Count]]</li>
            <li> Keep up the good work</li>
            <li> so i went for it, and lots of good reviews too.</li>
            <li> When I wash my hair and comb it out there is a good bit of halr coming out.  </li>

            <li> I love this Henna!</li>
            <li> I have abused and died my hair for many years, until it started falling out!</li>
            <li> my hair right now after this henna feels amazing!!</li>
            <li> It rinsed out of my locks very nicely and easily</li>
            <li> The free ebook at [...] is a great resource for directions.</li>
            <li> and I use this henna for its amazing nourishing properties.</li>
            <li> The way it sparkles in the sun is amazing, and my boyfriend compliments me almost every day on my hair now.</li>
            <li> hair is amazingly shiny, manageable, healthy-looking and I can redo whenever I see gray</li>
            <li> The conditioning benefits are amazing.  </li>
            <li> This is some amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> I use this to strengthen my hair/ retain length/ grow hair and it has been amazing.</li>
            <li> and it does amazing things for my curls.</li>
            <li> They look amazing for the week after I use this blend.</li>
            <li> and I have to say my have still feels and looks amazing still,</li>
            <li> the result is amazing, I did apply conditioner when I was washing it out, but</li>
            <li> The henna arrived fast, the day after ordering, and that was the best part of the purchase.  </li>
            <li> the 17hrs under the cap makes it effective.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for nice henna with quality, you would want to try Nupur.</li>
            <li> In the morning I removed the sheet and bubble wrap and looked at the paper-it was kind of orangish</li>
            <li> Or i may just buy everything piece by piece as I liked the effect and just have to bite the bullet.</li>
            <li> so much that would be wonderful!</li>
            <li> Also, my hair follicles are smoother and my hair has a nice sheen to it.</li>
            <li> It was actually kind of fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> mix a 60g pack with warm tea and leave it overnight.</li>
            <li> but once you figure out the best way to do it, it gets much easier.</li>
            <li> I add the coconut oil after the henna and coconut milk have sat in a warm place for about 6 hours.</li>
            <li> After about 5 minutes I rinsed it off and my my skin was nicely orange where the henna had sat.</li>
            <li> The best part of henna is its conditioning quality and this product really delivers.</li>
            <li> so I kinda liked it.</li>
            <li> Which of course kind a freaks me out.</li>
            <li> To each his/her own I suppose.</li>
            <li> I let it sit on my hair for about 5-6 hours while I did homework and cleaned my apartment, going over my covered head with a hairdryer every now and then to keep it nice and warm.</li>
            <li> that some of the photos were brighter than we would have liked.  </li>
            <li> I use this to make my own ayervedic hair oil.</li>
            <li> it has grown my customers hair as well as my own.</li>
            <li> Cover it with plastic wrap and allow to sit overnight in a warm place (which is supposed to help with dye release).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mom liked it as well, will buy again.</li>
            <li> after 2 hrs were up I rinsed out my hair, applied Aubrey organics honeysuckle rose conditioner to my hair 1st</li>
            <li> Very buttery and awesome..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a henna expert,but I liked this product.</li>
            <li> The color was a warm reddish brown.</li>
            <li> Nice quality product.</li>
            <li> This product is nice.  </li>
            <li> and they blend nicely.  </li>
            <li> I liked my gray blend.</li>
            <li> I saw many good review about it, so I tried.  </li>
            <li> I just heard so many good things about the Bragg ACV</li>
            <li> I liked this product</li>
            <li> my homemade hair oil.&lt;br /&gt;-Color: The Godrej Mix gives my hair a nice \\&quot;cherry\\&quot; chocolate color, whereas Karishma henna makes my hair a lot</li>
            <li> Gives a nice tingly sensation on scalp.</li>
            <li> a plastic grocery store bag handy</li>
            <li> but my daughter didn&#x27;t, it smelled like herbs or plants, which i liked, but you know how kids can be.</li>
            <li> Set in a warm place for about 4 hours or overnight until the color releases.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thicker, stronger and is striving nicely.</li>
            <li> (lmao)</li>
            <li> but Boy, were the results worth the work!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super cheap for a great quality product!    </li>
            <li> To me, the best part about this product was it was cheap and mild to my hair.</li>
            <li> Wish I had a camera handy: You&#x27;d all have a great laugh at my expense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product was easy to use and delivered good results.</li>
            <li> My hair use to be brittle and would brake off very easy.</li>
            <li> This product was also very easily washed out.  </li>
            <li> Split ends show very easily</li>
            <li> One of the best henna I have tried by far!</li>
            <li> Yields quality results, easy to mix, great saturated deposit on hair with easy rinse out.</li>
            <li> this product is the greatest henna ive used so far.</li>
            <li> This is the best by far.</li>
            <li> Best of all, it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> rinsed my hair and was very happy that the water ran clear in about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I rinsed my hair and was very happy that the water ran clear in about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this Henna the 5 stars it deserves because my hair feels soooo good, and it looks just a fabulous.</li>
            <li> That being said, I liked it better than the Jamila henna I used before.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best henna for hair.</li>
            <li> love it hair nice and shiny</li>
            <li> I rinse with warm water until most of dirt out and use hair conditioner to help rinse the rest out.  </li>
            <li> However, this brand is by far superior to any brand I have ever used!!!  </li>
            <li> I honestly believe the seller is writing most of these reviews.</li>
            <li> Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder is by far the BEST henna product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> What makes hair smooth is to use some good hair mask or conditioner (avacado etc) after washing off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to do!</li>
            <li> So easy!</li>
            <li> what i also like is that it&#x27;s very fine, not grainy at all,</li>
            <li> That one&#x27;s powder is very fine.</li>
            <li> I did the treatment about a month ago and have washed my hair many times and the color is still very strong.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to this beautiful, vibrant color in the summer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blown away by how great this product is, and even more amazed that it comes at such a great price.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a cheap and fun way to get gorgeous hair!</li>
            <li> Great color and with the addition of oil super easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li> 2 1/2 hours worked just fine!</li>
            <li> 2 1/2 hours worked just fine!</li>
            <li> This is very important,do not use hot water for rinsing hair, warm water is best.</li>
            <li> [...] easy to mix also so 5 stars so far &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> One thing I love about this is that my hair is now very smooth without a lot of hair product.  </li>
            <li> It is a very good product, not a chemical dye to harm the hair, but natural herbs that I like.</li>
            <li> LOVE LUCY.\\</li>
            <li> It mostly washed off, mostly.</li>
            <li> with lots of shine, so 5 stars for the conditioning.. :)</li>
            <li> sure you use gloves because it will stain your hands for about a week or so</li>
            <li> so enjoy the experience and make your own spa day at home.</li>
            <li> I received many compliments on the color</li>
            <li> Okay, I figured that might happen.</li>
            <li> But, I saw this brand and decided to try it because of all the great reviews and also because it&#x27;s real henna, and no chemicals added.  </li>
            <li> I also like the fact that there are added herbs that contribute to healthy, shiny hair.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did because I love the color.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> For me I use either orange juice or lemon juice, soak for more than 5 hours, apply the paste to hair and let it stay over night.</li>
            <li> not use any metal when mixing or dyeing, and be sure to remove jewelry.    </li>
            <li> But I do know that I am beyond satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s all better.</li>
            <li> i give this henna five stars for price, quality and best results overall.</li>
            <li> I ordered two more which should be on their way.</li>
            <li> , it was just lying on the top of my head like a globule</li>
            <li> Love the price, but do I love it after finding out I&#x27;ve paid for filler?</li>
            <li> To cut the sandiness and to relieve my hair more of the brittle feeling I may get after usisng</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker as well, and the curls have more body.  </li>
            <li> After 2 weeks or so, the burgundy highlights turned more brown.  </li>
            <li> I love this blend of herbs and henna.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the results from putting this henna in my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use this like, every month to condition my hair (goodbye to chemical relaxers).</li>
            <li> Even still I used more DPR+11 to condition my hair afterwards.</li>
            <li> My hair is more like a 4b/4c</li>
            <li> it is okay</li>
            <li> day I just became overwhelmingly fed up with my hair.  </li>
            <li> Even the damaged ends appeared to look healthy and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I am in love with this henna since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Next day after I shampoo and condition, and my hair feels like the best thing in the world!!</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure what would happen...</li>
            <li> I was content in just getting the benefits of a healthy henna treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> washed it 2 times, added more conditioner and let it sit for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> My mission now is to do more research on how I can get the knots out a bit better and easier.</li>

            <li> I washed it 2 times, added more conditioner and let it sit for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> My mission now is to do more research on how I can get the knots out a bit better and easier.</li>
            <li> but Im sure that will go away within a week  </li>
            <li> I let it sit for 2 hours more, and then rinsed out the henna.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t magical hair dye, people.</li>
            <li> Need I say more?</li>
            <li> I receive a monthly newsletter which provides tips on how to grow healthy hair.  </li>
            <li> I must say that I am pleasantly pleased with the look of my hair and the softness that this product added.  </li>
            <li> I receive so many compliments on my hair</li>
            <li> :-)\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> So I dyed in a brown to make it look better, but of course I still  have this &amp;#34; over processed problem&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> you leave henna on for the better and deeper</li>
            <li> Be SURE to condition you hair afterwards.</li>
            <li> henna can be drying to the hair, and even more so when you use protein(eggs) or lemon juice.</li>
            <li> So make sure you do a conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I also add a healthy squirt each of the coconut oil and the Burt&#x27;s Bees pre-shampoo treatment and mix it all up.</li>
            <li> (Some people do the henna, then the indigo after the henna is washed out - that seems even more time consuming</li>
            <li> Pile your hair on top of your head and put on a shower cap or tie a plastic grocery bag over your hair.</li>
            <li> I am trying to color correct with more henna .</li>
            <li> I am trying to color correct with more henna .</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> well i love this</li>
            <li> it just felt so much better</li>
            <li> I found it to be more moisturizing and the color redder than it is orange.  </li>
            <li> Love this oil and how it keeps my hair moisturized without greasiness.  </li>
            <li> Since then, Nupur has added wonderful herbs to the product such as Amla and Brahmi among others.  </li>
            <li> I love the results</li>
            <li> and I love the price.  </li>
            <li> It has so many beneficial herbs for hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still touching my hair.</li>
            <li> Using my hands (wearing gloves, of course) I applied the mixture all over and made sure to massage it through all of my hair.</li>
            <li> Those things caused the bottom part of my hair to be lighter than the part that just grew on the top.</li>
            <li> I love how it covers my gray hair.</li>
            <li> (I read that this helps to have more dye release.)  </li>
            <li> but my hair looked shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> , works better for me and allows me to add whatever I choose (eggs, yogurt, amla, oil, etc.)</li>
            <li> Henna was the next best thing...</li>
            <li> My hands were a hilarious orange color for two days...</li>
            <li> which was okay because it&#x27;s summer</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m home most of the time anyway,</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> To save money and to break away from more chemical dyes, I decided to use henna.</li>
            <li> work it into your scalp and roots to make sure the hair is covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> and i have been using it for the last 5 years, it helps reduce greyness of hair and excellent conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many brands of henna on my hair.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments, I am amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems to make my hair more manageable too.  </li>
            <li> There are many recipes on you tube henna is a wonder conditioner for kinky curly hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I just wish it would&#x27;ve warned about redness, since the labeling leads you to believe that henna is not the prominent ingredient.</li>
            <li> then about 3 months ago I was given a sample of the Hesh Amla powder (which I love)</li>
            <li> perhaps i&#x27;ll henna again in 10 days time :)</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more of this product because i suffer from Psorasis of the scalp and its herbs containing neem with help with my Psorasis.</li>
            <li> and I like it MUCH better than the ones I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> It came out just as lovely &amp; my hair is a dream!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I am satisfied with the turn out of the color and condition of hair.</li>
            <li> My hair looked real good for about a year then starting breaking off in the front till I had to cut my hair..</li>
            <li> I then put oils and yogurt or beet juice for more color or chamomile tea</li>
            <li> I recommend this quality henna for all you will love it try it,,&lt;br /&gt;God</li>
            <li> I am glad I did.     </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Miracles/Magic does exist :)</li>
            <li> I personally love this brand.</li>
            <li> I know many complain about the difficulties of applying henna.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not so sure I do.</li>
            <li> much better then chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Love, Love Love this product.</li>
            <li> Note that, once you start applying, you won&#x27;t be able to comb through your hair anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i love the way my hair came out</li>
            <li> I love this blend.</li>
            <li> It nourishes your roots to have a healthy scalp.</li>
            <li> I applied it making sure it coated all my hair.</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to rinse grit out of my hair forever when I use this henna mix.</li>
            <li> I used shampoo-conditioner more shampoo</li>
            <li> then more conditioner repeat 7times.  </li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> and i think my hair is shedding a lot more ever since i used it.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li> I have been using this henna for more than 4 months</li>
            <li> this product is just okay,</li>
            <li> I do realize there are already many reviews for this item</li>
            <li> i wasnt sure which brand to use.</li>
            <li> I mixed Godrej Nupur with indigo powder, and the results were great!</li>
            <li> I also love the reddish shine it gets in the sun.</li>
            <li> and I love the results I have.</li>
            <li> but this product sure made that easier to do.  </li>
            <li> So I finally do it and the results are wonderful.</li>
            <li> but after the mixture sat for 4 hours most of the lumps were gone.&lt;br /&gt;Mix</li>
            <li> I think with my hands pulled all the hair to the top of my head and started massaging the color.</li>
            <li> I placed on shower cap on my head and then another on top of that.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought three bags and will be ordering more soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> ground cloves (to add a lovely clove scent)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> but that part is okay.</li>
            <li> Better than the one I used before.</li>
            <li> well, and needed more rinsing because I still have grits coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> write more after I use the indigo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was sure detangling would be hell on earth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The result - lovely chocolatey brown hair with some coppery/auburn-ish highlights.</li>

            <li> product leaves my hair shiny and in better condition.  </li>

            <li> I love the color I get, a auburn.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not gonna do indigo any more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 4 different henna products and this one just works the best for me.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the way my hair looks after I used this henna</li>
            <li> I WILL do this again, even with the smell, because the positives WAY outweigh the smell :)</li>
            <li> .... Love it...</li>
            <li> I love this henna...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve henna&#x27;d many times and have tried many kinds as well - Jamila, Rainbow..and some others.</li>
            <li> This one is definitely the best that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> If your hair is shorter you may be able to split into 2 bags, and if so, what a steal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>

            <li> (see my review on Jamila henna for more details).  </li>

            <li> Your henna is just incredible, thanks to its purity and quality plus the nine special herbs.</li>
            <li> Your henna is just incredible, thanks to its purity and quality plus the nine special herbs.</li>
            <li> It gave my hair a nice color and what is more important for me, my hair feels strong and silky.</li>
            <li> I got my beautiful nice and shiny hair back.</li>
            <li> My gray streaks are a beautiful warm, copper red.</li>
            <li> For one, it is very fine, so that the paste you make is very smooth, easy to apply, and easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am super pleased with the results!  </li>
            <li> Excellent coverage, easy enough to use.</li>
            <li> Now at first, it will look hideous, like a bright orangey color-</li>
            <li> Followed directions exactly and had Bright orange hair.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s already fading pretty good.  </li>
            <li> So if I mix the two I will haave about 4 uses for a pretty good price.</li>
            <li> BUT, over the grey it is a brilliant, day-glo orange!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend likes to keep the apartment somewhat cool, so I needed to create a warm environment to store my Henna.</li>
            <li> I went into the wash room which is not as cool as the rest of the apartment, buried my container in the clothes basket, and turned on the dryer for about 1/2 and hour to warm up the room.</li>
            <li> Great for first time Henna users like myself, the shade is a beautiful red.</li>
            <li> the color is beautiful and natural looking.</li>
            <li> In fact, this is the first Amazon review I&#x27;ve ever written; that&#x27;s how impressed I am with this product, and I highly recommend it--with</li>
            <li> but most henna powders I have used just didn&#x27;t seemed to do a very good job of covering my white hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soooo worth it!!</li>
            <li> Give it a day or two and it will oxidize and your hair will become a beautiful shade of red (not to bright either, but very very pretty).</li>
            <li> Make sure you have everything you&#x27;ll need within easy reach -- hair color brushes, clips, shower cap, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love how easy this was to mix and apply.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel this strong and healthy even when I do protein treatments.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel this strong and healthy even when I do protein treatments.</li>
            <li> real nice only if it was more even that was my fault rushed through it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing to have a natural dye that is good for the hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> This was my first henna treatment and I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The color turned out lighter than I expected, but it&#x27;s very beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Okay let me say it was the first time using any kind of henna</li>
            <li> My hair is silky smooth and looks extremely healthy.</li>
            <li> is a more detailed video of my experience, Hope this helps someone out</li>
            <li> I was happy because I could cover the gray with a natural product.</li>
            <li> Love this,the uptake is fabulous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea to test the color on some hair from your hair brush before coloring your whole head, as it is permanent.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying this product again for myself and for a friend who loved the color so much she requested I henna her</li>
            <li> The best part is, it doesn&#x27;t smell like other power products.</li>
            <li> NOW FOR MY ORIGINAL REVIEW: This was my first time using Henna, and for the most part, I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to mix and apply.</li>
            <li> It mixes easily and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to rinse out.  </li>
            <li> It also washed out really easily.     </li>
            <li> It was easy to use.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply, didn&#x27;t have a strong odor at all</li>
            <li> (it smelled like chamomile or anise tea to me), and was really easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> Doing the skin &amp; strand test (wish I used hair from my denman brush) made this part easy</li>
            <li> it is so easy to apply and wash and leaves hair shiny and strong.</li>
            <li> Now my hair can manage easily.</li>
            <li> Great henna and even better when mixed with indigo and coconut milk!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was easy to mix and apply.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer, shinier, and I can easily see the color after just two applications.</li>
            <li> It helps to bring out more color and easier to clean.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy in and easy out.</li>
            <li> but the rest looked great, next time I used it had better results.  </li>
            <li> and I wanted my hair strong to stand up to the stress of braiding.</li>
            <li> and I wanted my hair strong to stand up to the stress of braiding.</li>
            <li> They were *ok*, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, I am ordering more of this stuff right away!    </li>
            <li> It made my hair feel so soft and it looked amazingly shiny!  </li>
            <li> and in this way it lasted me for 3 uses so pretty much a full year&#x27;s worth of Henna for a great price.  </li>
            <li> (Just to let you know what it will do to light colored hair... and for the first time I am glad my hair has gotten darker over the years!)    </li>
            <li> It gave my hair beautiful red highlights in the sun/light.</li>
            <li> Hair was beautiful and also red...</li>
            <li> I deleted most of the original post as it was panic filled and is no longer applicable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keep it out of the sun in a cool place if you are leaving it for more than a day so it won&#x27;t mold.  </li>
            <li> Regular use and leaving it on for 4-5 hrs gives a beautiful color to the hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, be advised: Henna is wonderful stuff, but if your hair is light or grey, give this product the full patch test.</li>
            <li> The consistency is really good to work with after mixing, because it&#x27;s a very fine powder, and it also leaves my hair in better condition than most other hennas I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Ultra fine powder</li>
            <li> It is a fine, khaki-green powder.</li>
            <li> You can add just water and mix it to a yogurt consistency and that is fine.     </li>
            <li> I doubt you would have to sift it the consistency is so fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But - if you can get used to the \\&quot;green\\&quot; odor, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> i did a strand test it turned fine</li>
            <li> - these conditioners make your hair softer and (almost as important) cut the strong horse poop smell of the henna/indigo mixture.</li>
            <li> when i used it on my hair, i loved the result, made my hair very soft too.</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work, I love the idea of all the herbs in it, but that sand was just a pain in the you-know-what!</li>
            <li> A little color wouldve been nice though lol.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I am about to order my second package.</li>
            <li> Important things to know -     </li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting too much.</li>
            <li> AND it&#x27;s insanely cheap, but it&#x27;s FASTER.</li>
            <li> I have used the Light Mountain brand and this one.  </li>
            <li> I used a glass bowl, which came clean easily with water when I was done.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with the purchase &amp; the result.</li>
            <li> Best of all was that the color of my hair looked very natural--I got compliments the next day in the office about how great it looked all around and no one recoiled at it looking radically different.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really want it for the color, but for the benefits of making my hair look amazing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s filled with newbie flaws.</li>
            <li> and it looks just a fabulous.</li>
            <li> now becomes brown under light or sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is important that there are no lumps</li>
            <li> Then I use a bunch of cheap Suave conditioner to get the rest out; it takes about 15 minutes of rinsing for the water to run</li>

            <li> one get one free hair product</li>
            <li> I dried my face &amp; neck real good, put on the un-petroleum, dried my hands real good &amp; put on the gloves.  </li>
            <li> For those who want to be chemical free this is it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Rainbow, Light Mountain, Surya, henna from henna for hair, and jamila</li>
            <li> Glad I did, because this product made me think how fun chemistry would have been had</li>
            <li> and I love how my natural hair is shiny, defined, and more importantly MANAGEABLE!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light ashy brown.</li>
            <li> I actually slept with this mixture on my hair and the results were great in the morning.</li>
            <li> This has definitely been a weekly/bi weekly process that has yielded great results.</li>
            <li> I rinsed and conditioned again with Gud conditioner and Giovanni Smooth as Silk.</li>
            <li> It was so smooth when I applied the henna to my hair.</li>
            <li> yet it doesnt feel smooth</li>
            <li> Mix Godrej Nupur Mehendi (let sit for three hours) apply paste to freshly cleaned damp hair; Cover head with saran wrap and let sit for one hour or more, rinse and then apply step two.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> I used a combo of cheapie VO5, followed by not so cheap Wen cleansing conditioner to get the stuff out of my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaply priced.</li>
            <li> After 8 hours, I separately combined my indigo with salt and water until also smooth.</li>
            <li> They are now a copper red ( I am happy with the results) and will use this product again.</li>
            <li> Coconut Oil (also available on Amazon for a</li>
            <li> Of course I use sulfate free shampoo</li>
            <li> I will update in case of any surprising or better results than expected :)</li>
            <li> Some \\&quot;henna\\&quot; products that are parading around the internet don&#x27;t have much really in the way of actual henna and may not be best for your hair.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I loved how my hair turned out, but the Lush hennas are so sandy/gritty</li>
            <li> I am going to use this product continuously, because its 100% natural .price also fair.</li>
            <li> People who haven&#x27;t seen me recently have really complimented it and assure me that it looks wonderful in sunlight as well as indoor</li>
            <li> Well it did, it gave my dark brown hair the most beautiful copper high lights, the women who do box braids in my town were impressed and knew only Henna could give my hair this rich beautiful deep copper highlights.</li>
            <li> -Nupur mehandi 150 mg/one pack  -Hair accessories kit (very very useful and cost-effective, available on amazon</li>
            <li> For another, it is very powerful...</li>
            <li> I originally have light brown hair with bloodiest highlights; this product changed my color to a coppery/fiery reddish color...</li>
            <li> , this is permanent you want to make sure you do it right the first time without too many hiccups.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is super easy to wash out,</li>
            <li> then is super easy to clean up -- no bowls, no spoons,</li>
            <li> This is the stuff which I collected first to prepare for my battle :)  </li>

            <li> It took a couple of days for the \\&quot;results\\&quot; to show, but it was worth the wait!</li>
            <li> 50 years worth!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the time!</li>
            <li> Godrej Nupur Henna is the best henna i&#x27;ve purchased in the past 18 years of dying my hair with henna.</li>
            <li> This stuff is SO worth it!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s been over 3 weeks with great color and grey coverage.  </li>
            <li> (search for \\&quot;Henna Caca Lush\\&quot;), which worked great; you basically create little buns on the top of your head as you work, and the hennaholds it all in place.  </li>
            <li> and i used too much of the powder since my hair if very fine in body.  </li>
            <li> I achieved the perfect deep, rich color with NO HARSH CHEMICALS.  </li>

            <li> Clean off any henna mixture that has dripped on your neck, ears, sink, floor, etc.</li>
            <li> Then I covered my head with two plastic shower caps and started to clean up.</li>

            <li> so even though my hair was clean &amp; felt clean it looked greasy.  </li>
            <li> so even though my hair was clean &amp; felt clean it looked greasy.  </li>
            <li> After first use my hair got so shiny and beautiful that I decided to use it every second week.</li>
            <li> I followed the steps described in the top review here and so far had no problems and love the results.</li>
            <li> 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was all set and my hair has never been so clean.  </li>
            <li> As the drain was clogged, I did not immediately clean the tub afterwards.  </li>
            <li> As the drain was clogged, I did not immediately clean the tub afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The baking soda will help to neutralize the henna smell, and leave you feeling clean without using shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li> ive always bought my henna from mehandi and this henna is super for the price and it leaves my hair shiny and smelling great with super red colors.</li>
            <li> After all the henna/amla is worked into your hair, sculpt your hair away from your hairline so you can  make sure you have good coverage around your hairline, and use a wet paper towel to remove any drips that are where you don&#x27;t want them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t, don&#x27;t, don&#x27;t assume the color will be OK because of all these positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I missed that beautiful, vibrant, strong red was used to getting.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t as pungent, it left my hair soooo soft, and I love the beautiful reddish color results I received</li>
            <li> Soft, shiny, with a nice dense rich color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soft, shiny, with a nice dense rich color.    </li>
            <li> This is pure magic for my hair.</li>
            <li> I use to be able to wear my large afro</li>
            <li> I kept this in my hair for about 4 hours and my hair came out with a beautiful rich color and felt thick and healthy.  </li>
            <li> My hair actually felt very strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> My hair actually felt very strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to henna because I heard stories about it making your hair bright red or loosening your curl pattern.  </li>
            <li> I somehow got away from it and used the more usual chemical products for years until I stumbled upon this product and all its great reviews.</li>
            <li> Gives my natural hair an amazing shine.</li>
            <li> Whatever, it has made my hair smell like sweet hay(?)</li>
            <li> I mixed it up really, really good and then sectioned my hair off, then proceeded to apply.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> Love this product so much.</li>
            <li> Even though it may do nothing, I figure its a nice clarifying shampoo and the henna having time to cure even more will at least be a nice treatment for my scalp.</li>
            <li> The henna paste kept dripping, so keep a paper towel handy, and wear old clothes.  </li>
            <li> A dream come true for my hair.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews and finding that the overall consensus was that everyone loved it, I ordered 2 packages.  </li>
            <li> For me, I can&#x27;t use a full henna, so I mix about 50g of henna with conditioner and oil for a henna gloss.</li>
            <li> During the next application I plan to use a good creamy hair conditioner to help remove the henna from my hair (we&#x27;ll see if that works).  </li>
            <li> and it is full of sand.</li>
            <li> Her hair is actually more medium brown and much longer than mine.  </li>
            <li> hair is healthy in appearance and much stronger (no shedding) after use..</li>
            <li> , then I have to wash it more often because the coconut oil makes my hair greasy if I get too much on it.  </li>
            <li> I used it the second time with avocado oil and loved the results...  </li>
            <li> I loved the results of this, I did a lot of research, read a lot of reviews and then did a strand and skin test, I do recommend everyone read properly.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this Henna (last night) because I saw and heard good reviews.  </li>
            <li> my hair is now a beautiful dark brown with copper/red tones to it.</li>
            <li> My hair really look healthy and I got a lot of compliments on how prety my hair was.</li>
            <li> Came out really good and my greys are red not</li>
            <li> the claims made about this helping with dandruff/dry scalp maybe true.</li>
            <li> the claims made about this helping with dandruff/dry scalp maybe true.</li>
            <li> This one needs rinsing a couple of more times but dyes gray hair very well.</li>
            <li> The smell was not bad at all-sorta like hay&lt;</li>
            <li> I have chosen this particular product due to the fact it contains very good beneficial herbs!</li>
            <li> My natural, fine 4a/b pen spring coils love protein.</li>
            <li> It sat in my beauty product closet for quite sometime mostly because I was going through a period of significant shedding and terrified of putting some new fangled product in my hair that would exacerbate the problem.</li>
            <li> but after i applied some conditioner to my hair it felt like pure silk!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can be sensitive to strong smells, but the smell of this didn&#x27;t really bother me; I liked the herbal scent of it.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used many, many different types and brands of henna.</li>
            <li> (is this a sign of obsessive-compulsive disorder) just to make sure that I am not missing any relevant detail.</li>
            <li> Being slightly impatient and impulsive, I took a chance and didn&#x27;t test the color, but fortunately it came out great</li>
            <li> Also, it dyes your hands unless you use gloves or rinse it off quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered Nupur from  Amazon a couple of times and the package came quickly and as advertised.</li>
            <li> With one pack, there was enough to cover all of my hair (of which I have A LOT) and most of my sister&#x27;s (she mostly did the ends of her</li>
            <li> I left on my hair for 1hr and 35 min then rinsed well with warm water, applied cheap vo5 moisture conditioner to wash/rinse the rest out hair, then reapplied</li>
            <li> I had a bit of a red tint and fabulous curls to my hair which I really liked a lot.</li>
            <li> My hair felt more conditioned but even more the gray hair was now a red color.  </li>
            <li> However, my hair quickly changes color</li>
            <li> I love the conditioning effect, not quite sure if I need to use it again nor whether or not I like the brassy red hair instead of my gray hairs.</li>
            <li> I had to update my Review now that I have used it multiple times with different mixes and must say this is the best henna mix/ blend that I have found.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair a wonderful deep red while conditioning it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a whole bunch, but the ones I do have are prominent and right in the place I like to part my hair.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Very pretty.  </li>
            <li> Place the bag into a 2 cup Pyrex filled with water, and nuke it until hot but not boiling.</li>
            <li> My hair is beautiful and the color is darker in a few days.</li>
            <li> Only warm water is good enough for</li>
            <li> I just did it a few days ago and it is so beautiful.</li>
            <li> This henna made my curls soooooo soft and strong!</li>
            <li> But this one, I can&#x27;t really smell any strong scent.</li>
            <li> Those who are familiar with those other herbs will know how good they are for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> pretty good for the price, I dyed my entire head twice with just one package.</li>
            <li> , I was so excited that I gave my first review of life for that too).The kit</li>
            <li> and it looks really pretty in the sunlight!  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!    </li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> it was my first time to use henna and also i have coloured my hair 7 months ago with highlights!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this natural henna!</li>
            <li> The drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t look good- almost like poop, and doesn&#x27;t apply easily and messy.</li>
            <li> like it better than pure Henna because pure Henna has a tendency to make the hair feel like straw.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You can only see the new color of my hair in the sun or a bright light.</li>
            <li> I have very wavy, fine hair, and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember if I put in a little Jojoba oil lol.</li>
            <li> But, the second time I did it and added more moisturizer, it was fine and it lasted 5-6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> My major selling point is that it&#x27;s easy to rinse out and doesn&#x27;t clog up your locs at all!</li>
            <li> I gently combed through the length of my hair and it went so smoothly.</li>
            <li> I also put a couple of streaks in my daughter&#x27;s light blond hair and it came out REALLY orange.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s calm, silky and auburn now.</li>
            <li> it gave it an amazing red tint!)</li>
            <li> the more I knew my natural hair journey would benefit from trying it.</li>
            <li> As the henna oxidized, it began to look more natural.</li>
            <li> but I was able to comb straight through my hair without detangling really.   </li>
            <li> The mixture actually smelled really nice and helped to make it soothing to have the it on my head for two hours, wrapped under saran wrap and a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> I am a complete dunce when it comes to being able to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you are wearing an old t-shirt as it can stain your clothes, skin, even jewelry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re going Old School, so be prepared :)</li>
            <li> The exchange is totally worth</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look so much more natural with highlights where my grays were.</li>
            <li> and i do have a nice red color to my hair</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural</li>
            <li> My hair is shinier and has a really nice red tint in the sunlight.  </li>
            <li> This henna produces a really nice auburn shade on my blonde highlights.  </li>
            <li> Those who are more familar with herbs and their appearance would know, but I&#x27;m a newbie to natural coloring.</li>
            <li> but when you buy something most people wouldn&#x27;t want it to be 4 years old.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with the out come of my natural hair.</li>
            <li> For $3.99 it is worth trying out.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how much powder to use or how much oil/water.  </li>
            <li> Also the product is safe, it&#x27;s contains just natural ingredients</li>
            <li> there are no harsh chemicals in it and makes your hair looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now, and it is so far my favorite henna product.</li>
            <li> My hair feel soft only when I used the conditioner, but if I use my own conditioner I have to use more to soften my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, actually.</li>
            <li> Place a roll of cling wrap and a second grocery story bag handy for wrapping up your head after you finish applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not some over the top color, it&#x27;s just natural looking.  </li>
            <li> Liked this product, it does cover the gray in your hair, last for months.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I liked the results.</li>
            <li> and I loved the brownish tint and my hair felt so good after a few deep conditions.</li>
            <li> It is a mild hair cleanser conditioner and it is very gentle with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You just have to refrain from wild motions or flinging and make sure and rinse away any of the product that gets on the tub or walls right away.  </li>
            <li> Thus, henna is even more affordable than other home hair treatments as well as better for hair health.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work better for shine without coffee, but i like the darker due to coffee color better.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had was that the sift isn&#x27;t as fine as I&#x27;m used to (Jamilia BAQ henna has a super fine sift).  </li>
            <li> I was super scared using this product for the first time.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but would recommend &amp;#34;Hannah Natural 100% Pure Henna Powder, 100 Gram&amp;#34; for more money.</li>
            <li> a point of reference, I have fine, wavy 2C curls that, when stretched, reach to the top of my waist.  </li>
            <li> so flat ironing or warm blow drying helps even though I am minimizing heat.</li>
            <li> Good quality and has other herbal ingredients</li>
            <li> It does not change the color of the dark hair but it colors the grays a wonderful golden red color that looks like hi lights.</li>
            <li> After the right consistency, Jojoba oil is also added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I knew I was on the right track.</li>
            <li> Teatree Oil shampoo and conditioner has taken the itch right away.  </li>
            <li> (I know that&#x27;s not the right spelling)</li>
            <li> I wash it off right away, it will come off&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and this is right up my alley.air.</li>
            <li> and this is right up my alley.</li>
            <li> So no you don&#x27;t have to apply indigo powder to your hair right after you do henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mix it before my shower, then use it right after I shampoo.</li>
            <li> right now I think I will just do it once in between relaxers.ner out of my hair</li>
            <li> right now I think I will just do it once in between relaxers.</li>
            <li> I am ready to apply the henna to clean hair, I snip one corner of the ziploc bag off and apply to hair like icing a cake.  </li>
            <li> This henna was easy to rinse out and made my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> 2 hours in henna turned it completely auburn: a very nice color, but not very natural looking on me.</li>
            <li> Ok, so my hair isn&#x27;t my normal blonde, but it is the most gorgeous natural looking red you have ever seen.</li>
            <li> When pouring the water just remember: you can easily add some more water, but it&#x27;s much harder to take it out</li>
            <li> I like this product better than regular henna because the dye release is so quick</li>

            <li> Based on the positive reviews for this Nupur powder, I decided to try it instead of using my Lush henna, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I smeared all the remaining henna on full length and rubbed some on my whole head again with gloved fingers.</li>
            <li> I have been bleaching/coloring my hair blond for years as my answer to the grey and the kinky kind of curl that comes with menopause....  </li>
            <li> Good colour and over time becomes dark brown.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply with no mess!</li>
            <li> Then I covered the container with plastic sheet and bubble wrap securely and kept it in a cardboard box (just to keep henna little warm).</li>
            <li> Fantastic results - total coverage of gray and beautiful black color.</li>
            <li> I have used many different brands of henna in the past and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I like the smell- much better than other chemical-based dyes, and the fact that it washes off clothing etc easily.</li>
            <li> You get a large amount of Henna for your buck!</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy this henna again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I tried it!air, I did do a second application with this product mixed with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Now, the auburn in my hair is a bit more noticeable, but it looks completely natural (haha, probably</li>
            <li> I had hoped for less hair breakage,but all in all it was good.</li>
            <li> Henna does well in the freezer, and it will be all ready to thaw and use the next time, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I blame the snafoo on me, but they really should have made it more clear on the package that it was henna.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t over-powering &amp; it rinses quite easily leaving hair soft, shiny, &amp; manageable.  </li>
            <li> If your looking for a fast quick fix, henna can color and treat your hair but you will work for it.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong but I already got used to it, and really it&#x27;s not much worse than the strong chemical smell of regular hair</li>
            <li> This is such a great deep conditioning treatment!</li>
            <li> Application was quite easy and not really messy at all.</li>
            <li> I put it in the fridge, and let it cool down to luke warm.</li>
            <li> Henna is the most natural way to give some nice shine and highlights to your hair if you have dark hair.  </li>
            <li> First time Henna use recently was in February 2013, purchased the Jamila henna (hair quality, not BAQ), and was pleasantly surprised, loved the color - it turned out a coppery color and greys</li>
            <li> My hair was pretty light brown before using this product, so the color came out an very lush vivid light auburn.</li>
            <li> hair has never felt this wonderful and thecolor has stayed extremely shiny and vibrant even 3 weeks later.</li>
            <li> I brew very strong tea, say 6 tea bags boiled in one cup of water, boiled down to 1/2 cup of water, let it sit over night to really get strong.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle and smells earthy.  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s not grainy it washes out very fast too.</li>
            <li> My original review works very well, but is very time consuming, and as you can tell...</li>
            <li> It DOES look far more vibrant while on, so no need to freak out.</li>
            <li> first time I used just the Nupur powder and loved the shine and softness, but I had wanted my hair a little darker brown, not as coppery.</li>
            <li> First time trying this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff, my hair feel instantly stronger after each application.  </li>
            <li> After the first use I immediately noticed THICKNESS, SHINE, and STRENGTH and practically no shedding.</li>
            <li> will tweak my process going forward, as I noticed there are things I can do to make the next treatment even better.</li>
            <li> MOST IMPORTANTLY - After rinsing out the henna, I WILL USE A DEEP CONDITIONING TREATMENT MIX WITH OILS (Olive, Avocado, Sweet Almond, and essential oils of Rosemary and Lavender work wonders for my hair).</li>
            <li> product gave me exactly what I was seeking in using a henna tratment: CONDITIONING, THICKNESS and STRENGTH.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I wash out the mixture, I add more powders to my hair as that is not necessary but</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have ever used henna.  </li>
            <li> I actually wanted to start out doing a henna gloss to see how it would look on my brunette hair before doing anything more drastic.  </li>
            <li> And I love the red highlights that it brought out in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I could see more red in my hair and it&#x27;s a deeper color.  </li>
            <li> It dried out my hair pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with equal part of indigo and a tbsp of Amla and my hair has never looked as healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I was a first time user and this stuff was dummy proof.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> First I rapidly flipped through the you tube videos again</li>
            <li> -actually don&#x27;t know how it helped :).</li>
            <li> I plan to order more, and incorporate this into my regular hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Godrej!</li>
            <li> I had to use more coconut oil later during the week to silken the hair.</li>
            <li> Besides throwing my hair into a bun or ponytail, I&#x27;m pretty clueless.  </li>
            <li> I do a hot oil treatment (combination of coconut, olive, almond and castor oil) and leave the oil overnight.</li>
            <li> I put a dab of henna on my palm (I read on many henna websites that this was recommended to check to see if the dye released correctly), re-covered the henna, and placed it back in the clothes basket.</li>
            <li> It was my first time applying it</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> will use this again, as it did exactly what everyone said it should do.</li>
            <li> I willuse this again, as it did exactly what everyone said it should do.</li>
            <li> Pretty, but if you don&#x27;t want this, you might scream.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results and will definitely continue to apply this henna to my hair.</li>
            <li> and it was so smooth not messy not runny at all</li>
            <li> I finally used the henna and I cannot express how much I LOVE my hair now.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely be ordering this product again and again!</li>
            <li> I get about five uses out of one 150g package - whole head!</li>
            <li> Also my grays first took on an orange hue</li>
            <li> It was my first time trying henna in my hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every time you wash your hair for some reason some of the Henna seeps out so for your first 6 showers</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every time you wash your hair for some reason some of the Henna seeps out so for your first 6 showers</li>
            <li> , I can do this fast and my hands won&#x27;t stain.\\&quot; NOPE!  </li>
            <li> Gray streaks actually came out a lighter shade, but I&#x27;m told they look interesting.  </li>
            <li> my mix was the consistently of brownie batter...</li>
            <li> Next time I would add indigo for a more Burnett hair color</li>
            <li> I was able to buy this at a local Punjab grocery.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you do a deep condition on your hair afterwards</li>
            <li> so I added a 1/2 cup hot water to about 2 tsp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time to use henna.</li>
            <li> I am a first time user of Henna and Nupur</li>
            <li> My hair turned out pretty</li>
            <li> it really hit home - this stuff lasts!  </li>
            <li> I use this powder to help it stay healthy and give it an extra boost of color.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you rinse a lot to get all of it out, use moisturizing shampoo then rinse again several times.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t even used all of the first, my hair is medium length.</li>
            <li> Thanks Godrej and Amazon.....!</li>
            <li> So I stopped using the dryer of course and started looking for some natural ( risk free) help for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Read</li>
            <li> This was the first henna treatment I&#x27;ve done.</li>
            <li> I am a first time henna user</li>
            <li> This was my first time using this Nupur Mehendi.</li>
            <li> I purchased four packs at once and will be back for more.</li>
            <li> (you&#x27;ll use a ton of conditioner, so get a cheap one for this purpose) until the water runs clear.</li>
            <li> I first started using this after I started loosing my hair.</li>
            <li> It does stain the skin, I learned that through my first application.</li>
            <li> Next just plan on being home for most of the day because it has to set on your hair for 4-6hrs.</li>
            <li> I used to work in a hospital, and asked many middle eastern co-workers about tips about Mehendi which is the ancient art of henna.  </li>
            <li> I really hope Amazon never stops selling it!  </li>
            <li> I tried henna for the first time this weekend.</li>
            <li> Love the color, and thinking about doing it again weekly for the next month.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second time purchasing this henna, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this product and will never go back to chemical dyes.</li>
            <li> cup of hot coffee and hot water&lt;br /&gt;Hemp</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with henna.</li>
            <li> make a whole batch with lemon juice and keep it in a glass jar in the fridge until I run out!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was willing to give this henna a shot, since some said it left their hair shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased with the transition.</li>
            <li> I love the color (especially in the light), and it made my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this and reccomend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> When the powder was mixed and let sit overnight, I was more worried because of the grassy smell and the mudlike texture.  </li>
            <li> Once in the shower I let the water run on my head briefly and then added more Suave conditioner to loosen up the hair and color.</li>
            <li> After doing more research on how I could could get my hair darker without using regular hair dye, I realized people were using indigo powder in addition to henna.</li>
            <li> I tried Nupur for the first time</li>
            <li> This was the first time I ever use henna and I was a Lil nerve</li>
            <li> And finally, the nine additional herbs have left my hair incredibly shiny and soft without the addition of any oils to</li>
            <li> I am starting to love the color.  </li>
            <li> Applied almost entire amt to hair in sections, making sure</li>
            <li> I love throwing in a bunch of food ingredients such as Coconut milk (as my liquid), oils and molasses or honey.</li>
            <li> Ordered this one when first choice item was out of stock.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t measure, so put in any additions first and then add some water.  </li>
            <li> then I wrapped a plastic bag around my hair, and the towel on top of it and left for 4 hours.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time 2 weeks ago &amp; was horrified at first looking at the goop in my bowl.</li>
            <li> The color is a better, deeper, red and stays longer.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technique: Mixed it with hot water plus coconut and lavender oils to form paste, waited 3 hours, applied to hair, waited 4 hours, rinsed.</li>
            <li> I was aware that it was a possibility but based on the research I did, I thought the color would mellow out.  </li>
            <li> After the second use, the shedding increased and my hair was more crunchy/hard to the touch.  </li>
            <li> As this was my first experience with henna and thus this product, I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to (i.e. product quality)</li>
            <li> (though I never saw henna listed on the ingredients, and it had me very nervous!)</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, made the gray almost a copper color</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I used this</li>
            <li> Product turned my hair a funny orange/red color</li>
            <li> so I applied more coconut oil and a conditioning cap and left it on overnight.</li>
            <li> I wanted something with more pizazz and up until the last 3 years had always dyed my hair a reddish brown.  </li>
            <li> so much darker than the Jamila and my scalp was psychedelic!  </li>
            <li> used to put pure henna in my hair all the time, and that was great, but having the other 8 herbs in this mix makes it even better.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone who likes to henna their hair, but wants a darker tone and more overall conditioning.</li>
            <li> I used to lighten my hair back to blonde which looked great except roots showing up a little sooner than I would have liked, my hair grows very fast.</li>
            <li> I dampen my hair, towel dry and apply with a tint brush, leave on four hours, rinse, lightly shampoos, rinse with cheap conditioner again then shampoo and condition and rinse again.  </li>
            <li> The process of application can be messy, but you get better each time, and it cleans easy from surfaces (not from clothes).</li>
            <li> Lastly, it turned my naturally black/brown hair a niiiiice reddish tinted brown, which at first I was against but after wearing a blown out fro I&#x27;m just in love with the color!</li>
            <li> This took my permed, fried, dried out hair and turned it into glossy, full, swinging, moist hair-of-a-lifetime in ONE USE!!!  </li>
            <li> My hair is so shiny, soft, pretty, rich looking and feeling now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also worried that this would leave my fine, 2C waves too limp, but they have retained their curl and I&#x27;m so happy with how my two inches of grey regrowth blended into the rest of my hair.</li>

            <li> All henna treatments will make your hair feel dry afterwards, so be sure to invest in a deep conditioning treatment and use it right after you henna, your hair will be soft, shiny and luxurious and you will love it!  </li>

            <li> I used to buy henna from bulk henna sellers or some other popular brands...</li>
            <li> Ordered some and followed directions, especially being sure to cover the parts of my hair that are now grey, mostly at top and sides surrounding my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (my hair is dark brown) but each day blends in a bit more!  </li>
            <li> but u can add other things to it for ur own peferrence</li>
            <li> This makes your hair so glossy and healthy that I can see finally achieving the long, healthy hair I have dreamed of.</li>
            <li> I am already planning on getting more, it came right on time which was great because I hate waiting and too cheap to pay for the one-business day:</li>
            <li> The only thing about henna is that it is very messy to use and the process takes forever, but the results are wonderful and my hair looks so much healthier with each use.</li>
            <li> This was my first time and my dreadlocks, which were shedding, breaking and all around unhappy, came out beautifully tinted and EXTREMELY strong.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft, clean, and shiny after using it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE ON 3-7-14:  While I love how much easier this is to use than the Lush hennas, now that the color has had more time to settle, I think I&#x27;m going to go back to Lush.  </li>

            <li> and i purchase them at that time for $5 a bottle, regular price for a big bottle of a good shampoo.  </li>
            <li> My hair is totally soft, full of body and very shiny!</li>
            <li> Next I tied an old grocery bag around my head, you need to keep your head warm and moist, a shower cap will also work.</li>
            <li> The color and texture of the actual paste was very similar to feces, but it smelled really, really good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fun to henna, it&#x27;s fun to experiment with different mixes.</li>
            <li> It DOES settle down to its own unique color and doesn&#x27;t look store-dyed, just natural.</li>
            <li> I used about half a package which was way more than I needed!</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft and so shiny!  </li>
            <li> After one henna/indigo application, my hair looks totally dandruff free right now.</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re on the hunt for good henna to strengthen you hair (amongst other things) Maybe you can give this a go!!!</li>
            <li> gave a beautiful red tone to my black hair.</li>
            <li> The FULL FAT yogurt is the key here, as it helps tremendously in the process of rinsing the henna out of the hair.</li>
            <li> Would positively recommend it.</li>
            <li> Based on this information, one positive for using henna would be a softening of my hair.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to leave it for that long, but I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it until I got home from work Friday</li>
            <li> I always start with my roots first, and use a hairdye brush to really work it into my roots, esp.</li>
            <li> and I apply the coconut oil to the hair that is sticking up, pretty much just the ends.  </li>
            <li> I used Rainbow brand first, I really did like it</li>
            <li> At first I though it is just a marketing effort to make people buy, but I still believe that some review should come from the real people.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have light hair check out how other reviews with light hair worked with henna to find something that works for you.</li>
            <li> If you have light hair check out how other reviews with light hair worked with henna to find something that works for you.</li>
            <li> When i am ready to apply it I mix a tablespoon of indigo with a pinch of salt in hot water and let it sit for 10 minutes, then combine the two.  </li>
            <li> I pretty much followed the directions with the exception of substituting some of the water for coffee because again, my fear of looking like a flaming red-haired crazed possessed terror doll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my hair grew really fast, if I did not apply it well the first time or if the color started to fade at the roots because after 5 weeks, I had quite a bit of gray hairs.  </li>
            <li> When my grays started to show again, I tried the Nupur due to the low price and great reviews.  </li>
            <li> This is not one of those squeeze out of a bottle chemical treatments, but part of the fun of henna is customizing your own mix, which will result in some different results overall.     </li>
            <li> In my younger years I used henna frequently and with good results on my naturally brown/auburn hair.</li>
            <li> My roots, edges and the rest of my hair is a nice dark brown/burgundy color.</li>
            <li> My roots, edges and the rest of my hair is a nice dark brown/burgundy color.</li>
            <li> My hair is a warm brown with dark copper/auburn highlights where it&#x27;s gray.</li>
            <li> My hair is full, soft with lots of shine.  </li>
            <li> I will be using this particular of  henna more regularly, probably every three-four months.</li>
            <li> natural texture is fine, curly, dry and breaks easily.  </li>
            <li> natural texture is fine, curly, dry and breaks easily.  </li>
            <li> Finally something that wont kill me or my hair &amp; it actually works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions on the bag to the best of my ability since the directions are not exact.  </li>
            <li> It appears that the shelf life is 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for those worried about buying a knock-off or adulterated product, you may feel most comfortable buying directly from Amazon as the seller instead of one of the other options.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to wait for very long, 2 hours is ok.</li>
            <li> The package is easy to open without wasting any product.</li>
            <li> saying that, after I got the knots out and I blew my hair dry, it felt and looked better than I ever remember it feeling before.</li>
            <li> In saying that, after I got the knots out and I blew my hair dry, it felt and looked better than I ever remember it feeling before.</li>
            <li> (My hair is normally medium brown - the copper was lovely, I just wanted it darker and richer looking and not so red.)</li>
            <li> When my hair is dry, I have shoulder length hair, I put it in a pony tail at the top of my head, like a whale spout</li>
            <li> My hair was super soft and shiny after using it.</li>
            <li> The result was - super soft and shiny hair.</li>
            <li> The henna cover my gray better than a Chemical dye because I can leave the henna on my hair as long as I want and redo it as much as I want without damage my hair.  </li>
            <li> just let my hair air dry, and it looks absolutely stunning.</li>
            <li> Within two weeks and a few shampoos later, my hair is a beautiful reddish brown color and with auburn highlights where the grays used to be.</li>
            <li> After the first few days of washing, my color leveled out to a nice auburn color that gleamed in the sun.</li>
            <li> The color of the Lush hennas seems more vibrant in my hair, and the Lush henna imparted a shine that this hasn&#x27;t.  </li>

            <li> This is a natural dye, it will tone down the orange and the tannic acid in the tea also prevents your hair from falling out, so it is good for your hair.  </li>
            <li> -Coconut oil  -Lavender oil (100% pure, got from Amazon)  </li>
            <li> pure henna</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference), add a large squirt</li>
            <li> (a large tupperware container works well)&lt;br</li>
            <li> And if anyone can suggest how my hair can be a bit more tame when I rinse and wash it right after my application, please leave a comment!  </li>
            <li> The first days of the henna, my hair was an red Irish Setter color (like the dog breed) which didn&#x27;t bother me as it wasn&#x27;t freakish looking - just a bit trendy, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> After a few days my scalp faded and the color mellowed to a gorgeous deep cool auburn</li>
            <li> Once you get the whole henna journey complete you will have a great color added to your dark hair and if you have gray like me, you have a natural solution for your gray.</li>

            <li> have used Rainbow Henna consistently (but infrequently) for over 30 years, mainly for conditioning.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s all said and done, my hair is so soft and manageable and PRETTY!</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t expect a nice little antiseptic product which is all neat, mmmkay?</li>
            <li> mixed it  with pure bottle lemon juice for 3 hours only and let on my hair for 3hours  also nice color</li>
            <li> I first used it on my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s hair, and her hair came out beautiful, soft, so soft and it gave her hair a little tint.</li>
            <li> Throughout this process, I stood in front of the huge mirror (which is obvious anyways)I wrapped the cape snugly around my shoulders</li>
            <li> Overall, the henna did a great job of covering the few gray hairs that I have.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time a month ago, I am Caucasian and my hair is fine, wavy and dry on the ends.  </li>
            <li> &quot; It turned out a very Reddish auburn.</li>
            <li> Curly Nikki&#x27;s demo- (...) and the results are very pleasing-</li>
            <li> This was ready in 3.</li>
            <li> I find the amount to be very generous too.</li>
            <li> It may have made my strands thicker, I can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
            <li> This formula is very conditioning and seems to fortify your hair with nutrients.</li>
            <li> My hair was really shiny without any type of oil.</li>
            <li> It also really soothed my itchy scalp.    </li>
            <li> Then when I&#x27;m ready to apply it, I mix in 3 eggs.</li>
            <li> so I was wondering how much henna to use.</li>
            <li> -really really helped, pair of disposable gloves.  </li>
            <li> I had already diluted a very generous amount of shampoo and warm-hot water.</li>
            <li> They are super-clean, deep conditioned, silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair feels nice-soft texture smooth hair shaft instead of coarse, after 4 hours of henna and an hour of conditioning with a homemade, oat milk-lecithin-ricebran oil-safflower oil-soy wax-glycerin-conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is much shinier.</li>
            <li> regular hairstyle would expose the orange areas, but fortunately I can style my hair to come forward--bangs, etc--and hide it.</li>
            <li> It absolutely SCREAMS orange.</li>
            <li> Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;About 2 1/2 hours in, I was so tired I decided to wash it out knowing that if I wasn&#x27;t happy with the color, I could re-apply it in a couple days.</li>
            <li> About 2 1/2 hours in, I was so tired I decided to wash it out knowing that if I wasn&#x27;t happy with the color, I could re-apply it in a couple days.</li>
            <li> This henna is real henna.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Well the hair along my hairline is much brighter than the rest of the red/orange hair.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s got so much body and shine, people always comment on it.</li>
            <li> well it doesnt really now</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really show up on my hair indoors, though my sister&#x27;s hair did turn reddish/orange before darkening to an auburn color indoors.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product and used it on my hair and my daughters hair as a deep conditioner and the results were fantastic.</li>
            <li> Our press lasted almost 2 weeks, our hair didn&#x27;t stay entirely straight for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> the one from Evolving Dish -- made the process much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;--I start with the brush to slop it all on, and then massage it into the whole strand/chunk of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (You can let it sit for 3 hours or 10 days, but the sitting lets the gritty texture smooth it out and</li>
            <li> The hair will draw the oil down/up into the rest of the hair like a wick draws oil out of a lamp, so your hair does not get greasy with too much oil at the roots.  </li>
            <li> It also never told how much water to add</li>
            <li> of product which was way too much.</li>
            <li> Once again thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so much thicker</li>
            <li> I used too much coconut oil</li>
            <li> I used too much coconut oil</li>
            <li> I did however wash out with shampoo after rinsing because I am very sensitve to smells.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nourished my hair and make much brighter look and silky.</li>
            <li> The color was very unnatural.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely fried my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the result, after dying my hair with this henna.</li>
            <li> I do not have much to say about the color, I don&#x27;t have any grays in my hair yet.</li>
            <li> but fortunately my husband said her hair looked red on the front</li>
            <li> the packaging is very misleading</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use to much hair conditioner, gel, oil, or even some shampoo.  </li>
            <li> highlight my hair got really burnt at the ends</li>
            <li> really pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and I was ready to put it on my head.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it to be very moisturizing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use henna for the purpose of coloring my hair.</li>
            <li> Well.... product mixes up well, but does smell like canned spinach, which I don&#x27;t really mind.</li>
            <li> So the color is not really visible, but the texture is phenomenal.</li>

            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Comb it away from your hairline the whole way around and smear a generous amount of petroleum jelly around your hairline and onto your ears...</li>
            <li> but now my hair is too straight.</li>
            <li> I am very concerned.</li>
            <li> Phurchase it via amazon, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I am very happpy with this product.  </li>
            <li> Covered whole head with cling wrap, then put a plastic bag on, then wraped in a towel.</li>
            <li> Have had it on for about an hour and its really drippy thru the Saran wrap and plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews I expected better on that front.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews I expected better on that front.</li>
            <li> (OMG, look at how much gray I have), I am going to embrace my hair, grays included.</li>
            <li> My hair was also much softer afterwards, though i had to wash my hair four times to get the rest of the mixture out.</li>
            <li> conditioner washed it out very easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was really scared to use it</li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length hair and used 1 packet for my whole head, will use 1/2 packet to do my roots.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length hair and used 1 packet for my whole head, will use 1/2 packet to do my roots.  </li>
            <li> I found a few, but I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> mixed about 1/3 of the powder with warm water enough to make a paste</li>
            <li> IT IS MESSY AND KIND OF SMELLY.  </li>
            <li> I will not go back to bleaching my hair, now that it is soft and shiny and growing and healthy...  </li>
            <li> i only use 75g mixed with warm coffee and 2tbsp of olive oil.</li>
            <li> It left my hair manageable, soft, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> Actually my skin is sensitive with most chemical products.  </li>
            <li> A plus for me (may be a con for some) is that it left a nice ruby red tint on my highlights.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> These were not concerns of mine because 1) my natural (no relaxer) hair was already healthy and properly moisturized, 2)  </li>
            <li> and I am still trying to correct the damage by continuing to do my weekly deep conditioning, eliminating hair products with protein  and co-washing more frequently.  </li>
            <li> I remember it being a real messy hassle (it still is), but loved the results.  </li>
            <li> (it needs to be tight, make sure the plastic is in contact with the mix), and let it rest for 24h in a warm (not hot) place.</li>
            <li> Best part is that the color has not faded from the grey AT ALL and my hard well water has not changed the color either!  </li>
            <li> I only need to do roots about every 4 weeks, and the white hairs get a deep auburn color, which is very nice.</li>
            <li> and I love the complex, rich color.     </li>
            <li> This turned my strands a deep gorgeous mahogany color that I had envied on other women who use chemical dies.  </li>
            <li> My hair came out very soft and a beautiful mahogony color ( I have black and lots of grey hair).</li>
            <li> After about 10 minutes, when the indigo has set with the Nupur/conditioner mixture (or however long the indigo powder package says) - make sure you have an old t-shirt on - put on the gloves and carefully apply all over your hair, rubbing it in to make sure it is reaching all the hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The seller was very fast with delivery, I only wish it was double sealed and had a crop date, I gave it 4 stars because of that and doing so many hair rinses, but</li>
            <li> And if anyone can suggest how my hair can be a bit more tame when I rinse and wash it right after my application, please leave a comment!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!it stew for about 4 hours.</li>
            <li> I do feel that my hair is stronger after doing these henna treatments, and the hair shaft actually looks thicker than my normal fine and wimpy strands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t), oil, tea, coffee, aloe vera juice, lemon, orange juice, yogurt, coconut milk, and many other things.</li>
            <li> I had doubts in the begging since it&#x27;s not listed as henna and has so many other ingredients (</li>
            <li> My has natutral red highlights and the henna covered my gray hair nicely and the red highlights shades appear so much better than using previous hair coloring products.  </li>
            <li> I began to research natural hair coloring methods and came across henna coloring, which seemed too good to be true: a completely natural herbal mixture that could subtly color and also enhance the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> - I start the night before I have nothing to do the next morning - so like a Friday night where I am just going to hang around and clean the house, watch TV etc.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product so far I have only bought it twice but was able to freeze my remaining left overs to use a second time.</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t understand why many are using the whole package as I always have some left over following this recipe, then again my hair is fairly straight</li>
            <li> I used a leave in homemade conditioner after using the henna the first time, and my hair softness came right back.</li>
            <li> I sometimes sleep on \\&quot;hanging\\&quot; twists at night to bring some texture back to the lower half of my hair, and it looks good with lots of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Left my hair very soft and the color was fantastic.</li>
            <li> We can only thank our lucky stars for this wonderfully natural way to color and restore hair!!!</li>
            <li> I have deep, dark hair with very early graying (whiteing would be more accurate).</li>
            <li> My hair feels amazing after I rinse this treatment out, and the feeling usually lasts for about a week or so.  </li>
            <li> It tints your hair and is fabulous for it in the long term.</li>
            <li> I mixed cool water, then henna in to make a pudding-like paste.</li>
            <li> The first three days after we used this, both of us had drier hair than when we started, but that pretty much went away with no lasting effects.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair feels so soft, I should be bald as much as I play in my hair now!</li>
            <li> My hair felt pretty soft and there was a noticeable shine.</li>
            <li> I meant to add that usually I don&#x27;t put conditioner on my scalp or on the top part of my hair, only on the lower ends because my fine hair gets oily fast when I do.  </li>
            <li> So I just started from the middle, applying henna to the hair roots first, right side then left side and then back and top of my head.</li>
            <li> Good quality and has other (different) natural ingredients</li>
            <li> Again, it&#x27;s not super drastic, but it is definitely more noticeable than doing the gloss.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for a darker, silky black hair like many Indian women.  </li>
            <li> Initially I was hesitant but the more I researched henna&#x27;s use for deep conditioning,</li>
            <li> Their henna is awesome, but so expensive, especially with shipping.</li>
            <li> 4 inches (with regular trimming, as well as a really cute cut about a year ago), as well as overall increased thickness and hair health.</li>
            <li> goal was to color my grays, which was mainly on my front edges.</li>
            <li> I dislike red hair, to put it mildly, on me.</li>
            <li> The red isn&#x27;t that red and looks ok with olive skin.</li>
            <li> The good side is that my hair did not feel dried out after no poo shampoo and deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I apply whatever is left to the rest of my hair, if I have enough I apply it to all my hair, if not, I apply it to sections, it makes an interesting color variation that</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this for natural, chemical free hair color, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> I can only imagine how many times you can use this on short hair!  </li>
            <li> I can only imagine how many times you can use this on short hair!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been researching and checking out youtube videos of women who tried this particular brew, so I decided to mix it all up over the holiday weekend.  </li>
            <li> : I have almost hip length hair, trying to grow into classic length (halfway of the body).</li>
            <li> Every 1 1/2 month as my main henna herbal hair pack.</li>
            <li> My mother and I have used this powder to dye our hair for awhile now, and since she has more white hair, it is obvious that this color does not fade!</li>
            <li> Color are all similar, bronze brown in the beginning and later will turn more brown.</li>
            <li> the color is strong so you don&#x27;t have to wonder if you&#x27;re going to get pink hair or apricot poodle hair.</li>
            <li> so, I would usually follow with indigo after henna, and I was gonna do same this time too, but when I saw rich, beautiful and dark shade, it gave to my hair</li>
            <li> considering my extra long hair, I would take a guess that one bag will easily provide me with 6 uses!  </li>
            <li> So considering my extra long hair, I would take a guess that one bag will easily provide me with 6 uses!  </li>
            <li> Years later, I find myself sprouting a couple of gray hairs and order Godrej Nupur Mehendi (henna), and that odd, hay-like scent takes me back many years, though it&#x27;s not nearly as pungent as what I grew up smelling (which is a good thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mixed up the whole package and had more than enough for my hair which reaches to my mid-back and is of average thickness but quite fine.</li>
            <li> Compared with the hennas I had used in the past, I found the texture of the Nupur Mehendi really pleasant, sort of slippery (maybe because of the aloe?) and not nearly as gritty.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this product....</li>
            <li> While much messier and much more expensive, the Lush one gives me better results, so</li>
            <li> While much messier and much more expensive, the Lush one gives me better results, so I&#x27;ll be returning to it.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised many still make up the whole pack, one reviewer says she freezes half of it.</li>
            <li> the longer it sits in that iron pot, the iron leaches into the mix, turning it from green to black, adding a darker tint your blond/light brown hair, would imagine that the iron leached from the pot is a good thing as well, absorbed in to your scalp.)  </li>
            <li> This made my hair soft and feel really good, and did give it a slight red tint, which I wanted!</li>
            <li> but I am just so amazed at the rich, deep color this product provides NATURALLY ....</li>
            <li> -Mix whole package with 2 cups hot water, or 1 cup hot water and 1 cup hot black coffee</li>
            <li> I rinsed it out, and it felt a little bit better.</li>
            <li> I rinsed it out, and it felt a little bit better.</li>
            <li> And Wow!!  </li>
            <li> -Small plastic sheet (I used the bubble wrap and plastic sheet which is found inside the Amazon shipments sometimes :)  -Vaseline (100% pure petroleum jelly),</li>
            <li> My hair does not get colored easily neither am I fond of coloring my hair (I love my dark black hair) and this henna does the job.</li>
            <li> and I would say this is due to not over-watering the mix and leaving it to \\&quot;set up\\&quot; overnight for dye release which made the mix creamy and easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> although the whole process of mixing and applying is very exhausting i really enjoyed it!!   </li>
            <li> Even though this is a messy treatment which requires a serious time commitment, it is well worth it as it is economical and really good for your hair.</li>
            <li> Even though this is a messy treatment which requires a serious time commitment, it is well worth it as it is economical and really good for your hair.</li>
            <li> As far as how to mix and what to use to mix, its really up to you.</li>
            <li> (My natural color is medium brown with about 25% gray, I have chin-length straight hair.</li>
            <li> It has been a week since applying and my hair is silky soft, has a beutiful shine and just seems so much fuller.  </li>
            <li> We use this to color our grey hair - it is a natural product that the hairdresser will apply for you at a huge cost.</li>
            <li> After much research about natural alternatives (henna, indigo, etc.), I decided to try henna.  </li>
            <li> Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder with purified water, extra virgin Olive Oil, and Coconut Oil (My hair responded very well with this mix the first time).</li>
            <li> but your hands will eventually return to its normal color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hair started becoming thicker with henna and my heart was pumping fast-I was actually applying henna finally!</li>
            <li> The results were unbelievable: my dullish dark brown hair had hints of auburn and a deep reddish tone and my hair that can be \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; was relaxed and full of shine, feeling great to the touch (and easier to style too).</li>
            <li> I normally just agree with others</li>
            <li> finally few days ago i was able to try it.</li>
            <li> Now the Lush bar is supposed to contain indigo, but no idea why the colour was so light on the grey.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s better than the noticeably grown-out blonde highlights, but it&#x27;s by no means back to my natural color.</li>
            <li> This stuff is SO worth it!ezer for future use.  </li>
            <li> Not only is my hair thicker , it is also silky and my dandruff is pretty much cured.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> That is normal.</li>
            <li> few more stirs</li>
            <li> But doesn&#x27;t cost much, it&#x27;s worth a try if you are in dire need of deep conditioning...!</li>
            <li> Normally I would do a ACV rinse, but I did not.</li>
            <li> It was a nice consistency- not runny and not too thick either.  </li>
            <li> it works great, is easy to use, and is less messy than other brands that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Not hard to wash out.  </li>
            <li> The consistency can be like ketchup but not hard and not liquidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mix Zenia Indigo Powder (apply immediately) apply paste to hair; Cover head with saran wrap and let sit for one hour or more; rinse and marvel at your shiny black hair!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I had read countless reviews stating that this stuff adds amazing shine, I thought that it was a slight exaggeration.  </li>
            <li> I mixed it with strong cofee, covered it a and left over night.</li>
            <li> I let the henna sit on my head for 4 hours and deep condition right after.</li>
            <li> Through trial and error, I finally found the right combination.  </li>
            <li> months later, I would like to share my education and journey to get it right.  </li>
            <li> When i don&#x27;t use it, it comes right back.  </li>
            <li> When I did the gloss, since it&#x27;s more slippery with the conditioner, I made a mess!  </li>
            <li> I mix it with organic whole milk yogurt, egg (if i have it on hand), oil (melted coconut oil, jamaican black castor oil, or homemade hair oil), lime juice (if i have on hand, i use it mainly for its refreshing scent), essential oils (if i feel like it).</li>
            <li> While it didn&#x27;t lighten my hair, it did add definite red highlights to it that were even more apparent in the sun.  </li>
            <li> The combination of 9 herbs makes it stand out from other hennas available in the market.</li>
            <li> I have rather long thick hair and really got good use of this</li>
            <li> So when I used this product I actually can honestly say my hair feels stronger, yes of course its still rubbery that is going to take a long time to heal but Its possible.</li>
            <li> I mix the henna with warm water and leave it over night, then mix with indigo and a little coconut oil later.  </li>
            <li> For those new to henna, it WORKS fantastically without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> I am completely new at coloring my hair with henna.  </li>

            <li> Indigofera Tinctoria New Crop]]  </li>
            <li> a new option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really just slightly lighter tone of brown from my original hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> 1/3 or healthy squeeze of raw honey</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and my hair is naturally light to medium brown.</li>
            <li> However, I shied away as it seemed too exotic and some people made it sound like it would be difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> It gives my hair nice red streaks without looking harsh.</li>
            <li> Light color deposited on my hair, only obvious in the sun.</li>
            <li> but i decided to stop putting harsh chemicals on my hair a to go with a more natural approach...</li>
            <li> I first mixed this henna with hot water to a yogart consistency the night before and then refrigerated it for a few hours the next day to bring out more color.  </li>
            <li> Then mixed the whole thing real well.  </li>
            <li> Just doing roots I should be able to get by on 3 bags per year - at a cost of $3.43 per bag, this is just a little over $10 per year to color my hair!  </li>

            <li> &quot; Of course, we all like to add a little shine and snazz up our color from time, as was quickly becoming the case with myself.</li>
            <li> this hena doesnt look right , doesnt smell right and the results are aweful , it made my hair look brown to really light even though my hair was dark black.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very natural</li>
            <li> It also looked very natural.  </li>
            <li> It is a very natural color, and I like to apply it once every 2 or 3 weeks</li>
            <li> Out of 3 boxes I used, however, 1 was very old</li>
            <li> I get compliments on my hair all the time and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> After the first use, my hair felt different and I thought, meh new product and my hair needs to get adjusted.  </li>
            <li> Just because it is natural does not mean it will work without errors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy trying to go a more natural route in life</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I henna&#x27;d for the first time last weekend.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I&#x27;d ever personally dyed my hair.  </li>
            <li> This product completely covered greys!  </li>
            <li> I recently bought this from a local Indian grocer and was skeptical to try it at first but after reading all the incredible reviews about Nupur Mehendi, I decided to try it to start off my natural hair journey.</li>
            <li> I have straight-ish black fine hair</li>
            <li> My husband commented \\&quot;it&#x27;s early Halloween time!</li>
            <li> It changes my gray hair to a pretty auburn red.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft &amp; silky!</li>
            <li> I used this henna for the first time last week.</li>
            <li> My grays are completely covered and are now copper highlights!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 38, so I really didn&#x27;t want to be stuck damaging my hair and scalp for another 20+ years!</li>
            <li> Also, as other users have surely mentioned, rub vaseline or something similar around your hairline and neck to avoid staining your face.  </li>
            <li> I used about 3/4 of the package of this Nupur henna this first time, and had some left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used about 3/4 of the package of this Nupur henna this first time, and had some left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> henna process takes so long, but for the way my hair feels I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> My hair color looks natural!  </li>
            <li> My hair color looks natural!  </li>
            <li> It was getting pretty obvious and I decided to do something about it.</li>
            <li> This henna also made my hair pretty red...</li>
            <li> Start at the bottom and work in small sections towards the top of your head.</li>
            <li> but my roots are very red still pretty though...</li>
            <li> this is the smell of henna because it is a natural herb!.  </li>
            <li> After the first application my hair was coppery red and shone in the sun.  </li>
            <li> Next time I will use the whole bag, probably not for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> Next time I will use the whole bag, probably not for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> I left mine on for 1 hour and the result is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking i like this one better simply because it has all the other stuff mix into it.</li>
            <li> I bought it first, and then watched several you tube videos about how to henna your hair.</li>
            <li> The only downfall for this product I have noticed is that it STINKS, not the \\&quot;earthy\\&quot; smell so many people nicely give it...</li>
            <li> (My 4 year old son asked me why I put poo on my hair!)</li>
            <li> Now my hair is dry and frazzled, (despite using plenty of oil and moisture masques) the same color it was before all this, and full of sand!  </li>
            <li> (I spent a good amount of time rinsing the first time, but not enough as I still had a tiny trace left, but not enough to be noticable.</li>
            <li> Might be dry, the ends, for some reason for a few days after, but i use oils, and pretty soon ends are better than ever.</li>
            <li> clean cool whip plastic bowl or some other plastic food bowl along with a wooden ice cream stick that you can purchase on Amazon, Walmart or your local scrapbooking store is used to make the mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well I bought Light Mountain (black) Henna.</li>
            <li> Just put it on freshly cleaned, dry hair, wrap your head with plastic wrap &amp; put a shower cap over it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle enough, that even when I do it more rarely</li>
            <li> so I kept the clip aside and wore the cap (Underneath this pretty blue cap, I also wore one of my old shower caps).   </li>
            <li> I mixed this with warm chamomile tea and the juice of 1/2 a small lemon.  </li>
            <li> When I was using the Lush henna, people regularly commented on how pretty and shiny my hair was, and that hasn&#x27;t happened at all since I used the Nupur brand.  </li>
            <li> When I was using the Lush henna, people regularly commented on how pretty and shiny my hair was, and that hasn&#x27;t happened at all since I used the Nupur brand.  </li>
            <li> soooo pretty sooo soft and shiny...i&#x27;m not big on the smell</li>
            <li> I use it as part of a deep conditioner for my dark brown 4A/B hair, and I love how my hair feels when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m still going to do the indigo process next to get more of a dark brown/black color.  </li>
            <li> I knew that henna would not change the color of my dark brown hair, at the most give me reddish highlights which could only be seen in the sun.  </li>
            <li> your hair is not dark enough, brew a big pot of tea, strong black tea, and cool it to room temperature.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black, so my hair is dark brown, now my hair has a reddish brown tint to it and is really really soft and strong!!</li>
            <li> I whisked it until it was smooth, covered it with plastic wrap (pushed down into the container to sit directly on the henna</li>
            <li> that they leave a huge mess all over the place.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rich dark chocolate color with burgundy highlights.  </li>
            <li> The color is rich and dark.</li>
            <li> i bought this thinking it would make my mousy brown hair a rich dark brown</li>
            <li> I imagine that once I cut off my commercially dyed black ends it will look more even.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dyed my hair with typical commercial dyes before, and they never color the greys, make my head itch, and make too many hairs fall out.  </li>
            <li> and i am ordering more i only needed half a pack</li>
            <li> Grey is easier to tame and a nice glistening redish hue versus the unsightly salt on pepper color.  </li>
            <li> VERY glad I left it on for only half the recommended time!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, strong and curlier and does not dry it out like other type of henna i have used.</li>
            <li> The result was a reddish, light brown color which was very pretty and lasted approximately 12 weeks.  </li>
            <li> It definitely works and you certainly can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
            <li> So I bought some regular, pure indigo powder from Amazon, the Zenia brand.  </li>
            <li> I mix full fat yoghurt and a scrambled raw egg in with the mixture when I am ready to apply it, for the fat and protein treatment.  </li>
            <li> They all pretty much recommended 100% henna, and so I was a bit concerned when I realized that this had alot of other natural ingredients...</li>
            <li> I have tried several cheap brands, but most of them were too weak, had chemical additives in them, or weren&#x27;t ground finely enough.</li>
            <li> But, I highly recommend adding some sort of oil: moroccan, avocado, coconut or even an egg apparently to the mix before putting on your hair.  </li>
            <li> The color is saturated, not pale.</li>
            <li> All the previous nupur reviews were really useful for me!</li>
            <li> It is a little more red auburn than copper auburn now.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While the hair is being washed out, the water looks muddy but the water will turn clear after the paste is washed out of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rest of the mixture I applied directly with gloves since I had to cover the whole length of hair-brush was helpful for the roots only.</li>
            <li> I rinsed until the water ran clear.</li>
            <li> let it sit for 1 hour and then rinsed until the water was clear.  </li>
            <li> let the henna sit on my hair for 4-5 hours covered with a plastic grocery bag, then rinse it off till the water runs clear.</li>
            <li> When the time&#x27;s up, rinse it out until the water runs clear - this can take a WHILE.</li>
            <li> When the time&#x27;s up, rinse it out until the water runs clear - this can take a WHILE.</li>
            <li> Cover hair for 3 hours and rinse until the water clear.</li>
            <li> and it runs clear.  </li>
            <li> well until clear</li>
            <li> I removed the cap and rinsed my hair until the water ran clear.</li>
            <li> When the water runs clear, put a couple of handsful of baking soda on your head, and work it into your scalp.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for natural beauty products that don&#x27;t have harmful chemicals in them.  </li>
            <li> I just did this gloss yesterday and my hair is still so soft and shiny, and not a bit oily.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd day after the application, and the color hasn&#x27;t really changed.  </li>
            <li> With only one use this product left my 4b type curly hair shiny and smooth, I evenly mixed it with [[ASIN:B000RLBTMA Jamila Henna Powder 3.5oz (100g)]] for the added ingredients and followed</li>
            <li> -Rinse henna out completely after 3-4 hours.  </li>
            <li> You also want to put an old towel or something on the floor.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so soft after I use it.  </li>
            <li> Depending on your natural hair color, henna WILL make your hair red/orange.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to see it in natural daylight yet, but inside it almost has some purplish tones to it.</li>
            <li> If you have short hair, you probably don&#x27;t need that much.      </li>
            <li> To deepen the color of my locs, I had been using Bijen powdered hair dye and had become sensitive to the product.</li>
            <li> I had developed itching and an adult cradle cap.  </li>
            <li> I did my internet research and decided to go natural.    </li>
            <li> It covers my gray and makes my hair shinny and soft.</li>
            <li> My hair was soooo soft during and aftewards...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those girls who faithfully sticks by natural hair and who is always trying to find ways to boost the health and shine of my hair, rather than blasting it with chemical treatments and colors.</li>
            <li> (I used to have a stylist put highlights in, but I&#x27;ve become sensitive to chemical hair</li>
            <li> I watched a couple videos on YouTube, and then decided to mix it with coffee, a natural conditioner and coconut oil.  </li>

            <li> B00312PRU2 100 Grams Bag of Natural Indigo Powder (wasma in Arabic and Urdu)</li>
            <li> It does not color my hair but makes my hair so soft and shiny and soothes my itchy scalp too.</li>
            <li> My result was exactly as expected on the hair that is still my natural color--the same lovely red highlights and body</li>
            <li> so far.</li>
            <li> If you let this sit on your hair for the recommended amount of time, you WILL get redder hair, based off your natural color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural product, which is plant-based.</li>
            <li> Hair is soft and luscious.</li>
            <li> You just are not supposed to use it and expect your hair to remain blond or have it revert your grey/white hair to its natural state.</li>
            <li> I developed allergic reaction to PPD in permanent hair dyes, so I&#x27;m looking for something \\&quot;natural\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered this product now a third time and it really conditions my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the formula and process that worked very well for me after different experiments and attempts - if you have brown hair and want it softer, shinier, richer, deeper, with coppery shine in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> B00312PRU2 Natural Indigo Powder 100 Grams Bag (wasma in Arabic and Urdu)</li>
            <li> It will soon be soft and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will soon be soft and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks like I went to a salon and had my hair professionally colored.</li>
            <li> My hair has been natural for three years now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the red highlights</li>
            <li> and I used the product to cover modest gray around my hairline.  </li>
            <li> (it was getting really late) and the color came out fantastic!  </li>
            <li> So far I have still not figured how to combat the dryness immediately after henna.</li>
            <li> However, the strength and body that my hair takes on after the treatment far outweighs the temporary dryness.</li>
            <li> Overall, If you think it might turn your hair orange do try it on some of your hair before applying it to your whole head.</li>
            <li> I am going to compare this product with Lush Henna bars because these are the two products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Another advantage is that it is easier to wash off than the Lush henna.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rinse in a metal sink (kitchen)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike Hair dye you can wash your hair directly after using henna.</li>

            <li> The 150 grams made enough for 2+ uses on my whole head.)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really comment on the tint because I mixed it with indigo to forego the reddish color.</li>

            <li> Hello,  Nupur henna is 100% natural</li>
            <li> I did not dare to do the bleach, as much as I wanted my blond hair back</li>
            <li> it does take about 3 shampoos, even if in a row, to completely rinse residue.  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m just not that much of a natural girl.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t surprised.  </li>
            <li> So far i feel that my hair is soft...</li>
            <li> If you are protein sensitive, I would not use this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I tried this product is because I was told it made your hair soft.</li>
            <li> I have naturally chestnut brown hair and it colors my hair auburn.</li>
            <li> I also put a old towel around my neck to catch the drips.  </li>

            <li> i&#x27;m 39 years old and have been dying my hair for years</li>
            <li> It is a pain in the butt to completely rinse off.</li>
            <li> and after I washed the henna out my hair was sooooo soft.</li>
            <li> It should turn from green to a brownish color, leave it to sit in warm place for at least 24hrs, I used my stove and left the stove light on.</li>
            <li> I am still looking for a old cast iron pot.  </li>
            <li> My hair is now soft, silky and even feels stronger and thicker than ever before.</li>
            <li> This brand worked very well because it covered my white hair without any difficulty.  </li>
            <li> her gray hair turned totally orange, and did not see much conditioning effect either.</li>
            <li> However, i know that is not the companies fault that I am allergic but, as a warning if your sensitive, this may not be the product for</li>
            <li> I have used this henna 4 times so far</li>
            <li> I have a mix of 4a-c in my hair and the the curls were soft and</li>
            <li> A drawback from using natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> A drawback from using natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and the shedding stopped immediately.  </li>
            <li> Now I switched to the natural stuff,</li>
            <li> all natural though)</li>
            <li> (I never dye, cut or do really anything with my hair, just regular trims!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The hair did lose some natural curl but is stronger and healthier feeling after this treatment.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m natural.</li>
            <li> I would recommend trying another product if you&#x27;re sensitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African-American natural with 4a/4b hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural way to cover the gray and did a lot of research on henna, as i used to use it when I was in my 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> doing a month of research on henna from wherever possible, I was still just not into it,so many questions brewing in my mind everyday seemed like solving the never ending mysteries of hennaland.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different hennas on my hair and all have been better than this.</li>
            <li> This henna is so powerful that my scalp is a bit orange, but wait to shampoo until the next day, or until several days have passed.</li>
            <li> I mush the cap to my head and make sure that there is a thick towel or two on my pillow.  </li>
            <li> even better I only used half the bag!</li>
            <li> i will do another review i will try tomorrow  with hibiscus infusion and plain yogurt and coconut oil so far it will have a total of 24 plus hours more than planned but didn&#x27;t have the time to apply it today.</li>
            <li> It made my hair a nice reddish brown as my hair is naturally quite dark brown, almost black.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this a little over a year and in the beginning just used on its own but have since added some other herbs for conditioning  before i freeze.  </li>
            <li> I made a smooth mixture of this product and plain yogurt (curd).</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t fade so much that the white returns; that only happens on the new hair growth!  </li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t fade so much that the white returns; that only happens on the new hair growth!  </li>
            <li> Okay, this is really partially my fault, but I was not aware that this was henna.  </li>
            <li> First the mix was too dry</li>
            <li> then i usually buy them for, so i was worried a little, but it was cheap and free shipping</li>
            <li> , the hard well water would fade the beautiful red shade within a week - a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Around 2 cups, but slowly add until pudding consistency, a little more watery is better than too dry.</li>
            <li> If you have black hair (the rest of my hair that was dyed black) it will add astounding tones and hues of red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have black hair (the rest of my hair that was dyed black) it will add astounding tones and hues of red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little messy but i am very pleased with the results and having found this product, as i use to purchase this product in the Uk where i am from.</li>
            <li> Since January 2013, I&#x27;ve gained over 3 inches on average in hair growth all over my head, so I expect to retain more length using the Godrej Nupur and can only imagine the total growth in inches by the end of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another fun thing about henna you what other have posted on here and on the web or create a recipe that works for your hair type.</li>
            <li> Even before reapplication, the roots weren&#x27;t overly obvious, but upon close inspection it looked as though my hair was growing in gray due to the contrast between the rich henna color and my natural lack of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (buy a new cheap one you will need it for the next few times you wash your hair)&lt;br /&gt;water</li>
            <li> (I left it on for 2 hours for my first treatment, but I will do an extra hour in the future).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***After</li>
            <li> Since this particular brand does not include any instructions and doesn&#x27;t come with gloves or a cap (the reason for only 4 stars)</li>
            <li> It took a bit of extra time to do the separate applications, but I knew what I wanted and was willing to spend a bit of extra time to achieve it.</li>
            <li> My hair used to be blonde turning to a honey brown as I grew older.</li>
            <li> I repeated the exact steps 4 days later and got the same results except my strands appeared stronger than before...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t color hair dark in one application though you will have to use the whole packet and it works very well for coloring hairs.</li>
            <li> I henna all my hair first, and do only root cover one week later.  </li>
            <li> Then the next day, I mixed the indigo henna with hot water and let that set for 10 to 15 minutes before adding it it to the Mehendi mixture.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands of henna over the past year .  </li>
            <li> I used 2 cups h2o with 4 green tea bags and pretty much used all the liquid to get a yogarty consistancy.</li>
            <li> The result was a pretty deep red color, and my hair feels silky and thicker as well.</li>
            <li> Generally she prefer other brands back in India but none of those were available hence went for this.</li>
            <li> Very, very hard...which I expected, but was still not used</li>
            <li> Very, very hard...which I expected, but was still not used to.  </li>
            <li> I highly suggest mixing a lot of lemon juice and tea tree oil to &amp;#34;turp&amp;#34; it, and leaving it overnight for the dye to release before applying it to your head the next day.</li>
            <li> I was aware that the amla may make it a little less red, but that was okay with me.  </li>
            <li> The only thing was that it was a little grainny, but it washed out just fine.</li>
            <li> I made up the entire batch and divided into 3 thicker than normal applications (froze 2 of them in some plastic wrap)</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I completed applying the mixtures, I wrapped my hair in saran wrap, covered it with a plastic shower cap, and also about an hour in, I covered the plastic cap with a hot wet towel.</li>
            <li> My cousin hair turned back to normal after a year.</li>
            <li> my hair may be back to normal in 6 months ^.^.</li>
            <li> Shampoo the next day as normal.</li>
            <li> And last but not least, while I was using the henna my head started hurting</li>
            <li> I normally mix my henna with Hibiscus tea to bring out the color, but this time I used a South African Rooibos Tea.</li>
            <li> and I let it sit a few days in a cool place so it won&#x27;t mold.  </li>
            <li> True, it was a bit messy</li>
            <li> had a cap-soft and very fit for average sized head and had ties, a paint brush, a plastic spatula/mixer, a dark cape</li>
            <li> I am Asian and originally have black hair.</li>
            <li> &quot; Most of the other people complaining do not seem to understand that henna does turn your hair some shade of orange not brown or black.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty common for cheaper hennas to use sand as filler, but not usually this much.    </li>
            <li> Yes, needs effort and a block of your precious time, but sooo much better than other artificial conditioners and hair colors on the market.</li>
            <li> I am relatively new to ayervedic hair care, so I did not realize mehendi meant the same as henna.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t remember how much this Amazon seller is asking, but I bought mine at a local Indian grocery for $3.99 for 188g, which will last me 2-3 treatments.</li>
            <li> If you do not have a head full of grey hair, it appears that it does not add color or not much to the rest of the hair as I guess it depends on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I felt that the effects lasted only a couple of weeks unlike the color which is lasting much longer.</li>
            <li> Usually, in the shower I get pieces of hair more than a foot long that get pulled out.</li>
            <li> I mix this a few tablespoons,because i keep my hair short, with a capful of mustard oil, olive oil and cocunut oil (Vatika is a fabulous oil), and brewed tea.  </li>
            <li> I try not to use chemical hair dye as I&#x27;ve developed an allergy to ppd in dark hair dye, and the result was a pretty color</li>
            <li> Mixed it with water, got dye release in 3 hours, added coconut oil, then applied over the whole head and left it on for 4 hours.  </li>
            <li> First, as others have mentioned, it was gritty (possible sand) and second, most of the color has seemed to wash out in less than two weeks time (which has never happened to me with other brands).</li>
            <li> After using this product and deep conditioning, my hair was just as soft and nice as it usually is after any other henna treatment.</li>
            <li> my natural hair colour is black or a very very brown color.</li>
            <li> This henna also rinsed out very easy, not like some of the other brands I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to start applying it that was not able to sleep well, but had to wait for around 8 hours.</li>
            <li> (make sure it&#x27;s coconut milk that DOES NOT contain other additives such as any type of sugar or other fillers.</li>
            <li> i was a bit histant at first due to the fact</li>
            <li> My hair felt very striped and stiff this time and it didn&#x27;t even seem like there was much color change.</li>
            <li> I only used half the bag (shoulder-length hair) and mixed it in water and lemon juice until it was a yogurt consistency for 3.5 hours, in a warm (not hot) place.  </li>
            <li> My scalp feels clean as opposed to greasy (it usually gets oily, I can&#x27;t skip hair wash every morning)...</li>
            <li> The first results are dark brown, where my hair is dark brown, and a russett color where I am gray, in the next few days the russet turns to a nice mahogany/burgundy.  </li>
            <li> I made a huge mess but it was only on my naked self &amp; all over the shower stall!  </li>
            <li> I expected more mess and not enough.</li>
            <li> Always leaves my hair smoother and curlier, and I can tell it works particularly well on my crown area which is the most difficult area of my hair for me to work with.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will purchase it again as long as the quality is maintained.  </li>
            <li> Dyed my hair a rich red color that I later toned down to a medium auburn with coffee and indigo powder.</li>
            <li> That gave the exact color that I was looking for - which was something that was a little deeper than my natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That gave the exact color that I was looking for - which was something that was a little deeper than my natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I admit to genuine fear when I took off my cap and seeing how rock hard my hair was.</li>
            <li> My dark brown hair was a little lighter and I was pleased with the shade.  </li>
            <li> I left it on for 6 hours and then rinsed well with water and used a conditioning shampoo to rinse out the henna until the water ran clear.  </li>
            <li> I have natural red hair (red red, not strawberry blond or auburn), and in the last 3 years it has really faded.</li>
            <li> My hair has NEVER, EVER felt soft or silky in my entire life.</li>
            <li> As for this natural chick, I&#x27;m hooked on henna if you can&#x27;t tell, and I can&#x27;t wait to see what develops next.</li>
            <li> : I am a natural blonde with wavy hair so don&#x27;t fret about the oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been putting on an old t-shirt with a big opening and putting a stylist&#x27;s robe on over that.  </li>
            <li> I went back to old faithful henna and will never dye with chemicals again.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, red hair.  </li>
            <li> my roots were starting to show as well, my natural color is a mousy brown.</li>
            <li> I applied with my bare hands thinking &amp;#34;if</li>
            <li> My hair is normally soft and still feels the same</li>
            <li> I have never had my eye do that before, apparently I must be allergic to one of the herbs added in.</li>
            <li> I actually used the rest of it on my 8 year old daughter (she has brown hair, and</li>
            <li> finish product is worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> It was messy and smelly, but fun to apply.</li>
            <li> Lots of white/gray coming in, manageability; which was growing worse as more gray showed up, shine, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning, 8 hours later, I sit in the bottom of the shower to minimize splashing of the mess that I have to clean up later.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very curly, which means very dry!</li>
            <li> (and the whole time I was at work, I hoped that it wouldn&#x27;t have been left for too long and it started losing the color!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a blond or your hair is all gray or white, henna is going to turn  your hair probably like a strawberry red or orange, or the color of a shiny new penny.</li>
            <li> When my new growth is a bit longer I will use the same mixture only at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That was at this point more heavily disbursed in the bottom half of my head.</li>
            <li> method is to add some fresh lemon juice (strained) or a some plain yogurt, and the rest is water.  </li>
            <li> After half hour application and 3.5 hours left henna on my hair, I found this powder did not change much of my chemically dyed ends but turned my new grown root hair from gray to orange reddish.  </li>
            <li> All I did to make the gloss was add half a packet of this henna blend and one cup of hot water (from the tap) and mix it in a plastic bowl.  </li>
            <li> Tried this for the first time in 2014 and heard about it from black woman on YouTube.  </li>
            <li> I used half the mix for the first application, freezing the rest.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that adding a little coconut oil when I mix it helps it be a little more workable.</li>
            <li> Most people complain about the smell, this brand smells just like any of the other hennas I have used in the past..</li>
            <li> The night before, I mixed the powder in a large Pyrex bowl, adding in hot water until it formed a thick paste that looked like peanut butter or brownie batter.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, if you mix it correctly and leave it on your hair long enough, it is extremely vibrant.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need 4 it to strengten your hair, just do other protein</li>
            <li> This really serves no purpose other than to help control the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will be using this henna from now on, it is also much creamier than the other brands I have used, there was no grittiness at all.  </li>
            <li> ] in a bowl with a metal spoon (which is apparently a no-no, but I didn&#x27;t think it actually had a major effect on the product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken me about two years to finally work up the nerve to do it, and, a few months ago, I tried the Lush henna for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it a few ways -- starting from the bottom up, and from the top down.  </li>
            <li> Grey hair turned very light brown, black hair remained black.</li>
            <li> I mixed the indigo with water, applied to my red new growth only,</li>
            <li> (if you have this accessories kit, you need not worry about looking for old shirts and towels), applied Vaseline on my forehead, ears, cheeks, neck), added very little water to the henna mixture since it looked little more thicker and mixed it again, wore gloves and started applying henna on my hair with the brush.</li>
            <li> Only bad thing is while applying she experienced some hair fall.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s such a great way to dye your hair without all the bad chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural red head, but my color has been faded by recent bleaching.</li>
            <li> Not only does it dye as nicely as the expensive stuff</li>
            <li> Usually my hair has dark brown color, but after using this product my hair became reddish and I love how it&#x27;s looks now.</li>
            <li> I am an Asian with straight fine black hair which give a brownish tint in the sun, I am having many white hair showing up though I am in my mid twenties (never ever used any chemicals/perms/hot treatments on my hair)which looked ugly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a major bonus that I can keep applying it on a regular basis, and it continues to treat my hair every time.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend people take reviewer S. Waller&#x27;s protocol:   - wash hair, damp dry  - add eggs and lots of essential oil to the henna paste    </li>
            <li> Cover your hair with a shower cap or plastic wrap tightly (avoid too much air from getting in a drying the mixture; once it dries, it is not active anymore).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I made sure to use a dark bath towel to dry my hair &amp; put on a black shirt.  </li>
            <li> I made sure to use a dark bath towel to dry my hair &amp; put on a black shirt.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it right away but would think it should last longer than a few months.</li>
            <li> I rinsed it out until the water ran clear which didn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li> I rinsed it out until the water ran clear which didn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li> I apply conditioner to my hair, and then as I sit there, I carefully, apply coconut oil, to my scalp only, parting the hair the same way that I did when I applied the blend, and touch the coconut oil to my scalp, then gently with my fingers under my hair, massage my scalp with the oil.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy, so be ready!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You must wear gloves, and the stain will come off on your fingers the first few days when styling the hair.</li>
            <li> Approaching my near 30s, I had never permed, relaxed, or colored my hair (hard to believe, right?)</li>
            <li> For reference, we both have straight, black hair (pretty typical Asian hair).  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s my recipe for changing my short, thin, fine brunette hair with about 35% gray into a soft, glossy, deep brunette with glistening auburn highlights and plenty of body and wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then when you&#x27;re ready to apply, place the bucket mix inside your bathtub, and flip your hair upside down into the bucket.</li>
            <li> And my hair was little red at first,  </li>
            <li> BUT, I have considerably less shedding (my main reason for getting it!)</li>
            <li> This way it was very fast and zero mess!</li>
            <li> I tried few hennas, some much more expensive, but I have never liked any of them as much as  I liked this one.</li>
            <li> , just watch it carefully, then rinse if you think you can&#x27;t live w the color.</li>
            <li> After I rinsed my hair (without shampoo or conditioner), I let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly/kinky 4 b/c hair that can often be dry.</li>
            <li> Dec. 17, 2012*****&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve let the color develop for up to a week and that seems to work very well; it gets less orange with a longer development time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If the porcelain on your tub is old and porous, like mine, the small amount of water will prevent real contact and allow you to rinse the tub out quckly when you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had dyed it back to my natural color with chemical dye a year ago and have been using semipermanent dye since to cover my 5% grey.  </li>
            <li> This can get messy, especially the first time . .</li>
            <li> First off - It takes a few days for the tone to mellow and for the color to oxidize to the color it will actually be.</li>
            <li> The color (on us, obviously) darkened after the first few days as well.  </li>
            <li> The combo makes my hair appear super thick.  </li>
            <li> It will leave your hair a little dry after (like a day or so) but it is sooo worth it.</li>
            <li> I will probably mix a little indigo with it before applying next time though, because grey hair did turn red, but nothing loud, not orange like pure henna would.</li>
            <li> In general it is extremely difficult to deal with the smell of any power henna, not only that, the smell also stays in your hair and sculp for more than a month.</li>
            <li> There really wasn&#x27;t much of a mess at all.</li>
            <li> The comb was just slipping through my hair, they were so soft!</li>
            <li> The night before - in a glass or plastic bowl, using a plastic or wooden spoon, mix up all of the Nupur (green bag) with enough boiling hot water to make a pudding-like paste.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, I really wanted to nourish my scalp, see new growth, have shiny thick hair...  </li>
            <li> I am sure the descriptions of all of these vibrant colors makes me sound like I went crazy with the crayola on my hair, but after a few washings, the colors toned down a lot!  </li>
            <li> B004IUN7JO 100g Pure USAWHR Indigo Powder Indigoferra Tinctoria To dye Hair Black Naturaly NO PPD]] ,emptied about 1/3 of the packet in a separate plastic container, mixed that with enough water to create a pudding like consistency, and let it sit for about 10 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only used it twice so far (one month apart), but my hair feels soft, heathy, stronger, and neater (less frizz) along with coppery sheen.</li>
            <li> Now my hair is dark brown and what&#x27;s left of my high lights is brownish-reddish.</li>
            <li> Now I was little worried because the whole process was NOT MESSY AT ALL, and that was the last thing I expected.</li>
            <li> I am caucasian, with long straight dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li> Because the product included other herbs in addition to pure henna, I expected a brownish-red color on my gray hairs.  </li>
            <li> There was enough product for me to get two uses (I have thick, hair which at the time stopped right above my neck).  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair every 7-10 days and usually by day 3-4, my scalp is showing signs of definite build up and dry patches and flakes, especially on the right side of my scalp.</li>

            <li> I am a 37 year old Black female with mostly dark brown hair and blessed with white and silver mainly around the front on my hairline back towards the crown of my head.  </li>
            <li> 100% Pure, Raw,</li>
            <li> so when I mixed it with water, it turned into smooth paste, which after 4 hours I poured into a sandwich size ziplock bag (I needed half of package for shoulder length hair, but didn&#x27;t realize it up until I mixed the entire bag, so i had to  freeze the other half) made a hole in one corner and applied with gloves.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think adding indigo powder will make much of a difference either because the henna is a pretty powerful red base</li>
            <li> Since I wanted to go back to my natural color of dark brown (I have some blonde  highlights)</li>
            <li> Please remember this can color your hair because it has a bit of henna along with the other powders that don&#x27;t dye your hair, so don&#x27;t be surprised.  </li>
            <li> I waited a few hours, applied it with my bare hands (and it didn&#x27;t stain!) and allowed it to remain in my hair while I cleaned the kitchen and watched an old 1970&#x27;s chick flick.  </li>
            <li> This and a few others high rating ones are similar.</li>
            <li> First, let me tell you that I was highly skeptical with this whole henna business.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color isn&#x27;t a color at all--a dark dishwater blonde.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 42 and have been dealing with grey hair for about the last ten years.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last long enough.  </li>
            <li> I had shoulder length hair and now (1 year after first application) is half way down my back.</li>
            <li> It did darken my hair to a very soft black.</li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive hair, use a less acidic medium, like pineapple juice or tea.</li>
            <li> My hair is wild frizzy and halfway down my back.</li>
            <li> The one thing I didn&#x27;t like was how long it took to get ready to use and all the stuff that needs to get mixed into the raw henna.  </li>
            <li> My dark hair takes on a slight auburn, but looks very natural and retains the natural color spectrum.  </li>
            <li> (careful here, it is really easy to make it too thin).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black, my hair is natural, I use it once (sometimes twice) a month as a deep conditioner</li>
            <li> but once you get the hang of it, I think it&#x27;s worth it in terms of saving $$ and having less harsh chemicals on your head.</li>
            <li> but once you get the hang of it, I think it&#x27;s worth it in terms of saving $$ and having less harsh chemicals on your head.</li>
            <li> So far, the henna has given me dark copper-red highlights over the grays and roots.  </li>
            <li> My natural color is really dark.  </li>
            <li> When my package arrived, I anxiously opened it ready to apply this product to my hair.  </li>
            <li> My natural hair color is dark brown.</li>
            <li> Once the indigo is ready (and it will be green!), mix it into the henna bowl.</li>
            <li> I want the dark brown to match my natural color, so I use with indigo.  </li>
            <li> I want to add that henna adds color to the natural color of dark hair, it will not alter your color.</li>
            <li> I want to add that henna adds color to the natural color of dark hair, it will not alter your color.</li>
            <li> The mixture was a bit watery than I hoped it to be when I applied it to her hair, but apart from that I am not sure why our results differ so much.</li>
            <li> hair was over 30% greys with the rest a natural dark brown.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, so I just used the entire bag.  </li>
            <li> Unlike my review below, I don&#x27;t mix the henna with the indigo powder, as I&#x27;ve noticed that the color doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so silky and there is enough powder in the packet for 3 applications (I have long hair).</li>
            <li> Even if I forget to condition my hair, as long as it isn&#x27;t blow-dried (my blow-drying method is leaving the car window open.)</li>
            <li> I have long, waves of sheer glossiness, no BHD&#x27;S for me.</li>
            <li> Next I scooped out the mixture &amp; kept globing it on my head; massaging it into my scalp &amp; working it into my long tresses.  </li>
            <li> I am waiting to see how long the color change last to determine whether I will upgrade to 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> Over the years, I have used henna from various sources and have never had my hair damaged or turned this strange color of neon orange.</li>
            <li> All of the hennas I have personally used do turn my hair orange but never this strange color of orange.</li>
            <li> But after using this, I was getting lots and lots of pieces that were only a couple inches long.</li>
            <li> My hair curled up and a few strands were red, but overall my natural hair color has not changed and my hair didn&#x27;t fall out.  </li>
            <li> Pull off a length of cling wrap that is long enough to go around your head and overlap.</li>
            <li> * shed/fall has reduced to a few strands per day in contrast to the normal 100-150&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Even though my hair is a bit long, I have thinner hair; therefore I mixed less than half of the bag in a plastic container with some regular temperature water, 3 tbsp of grape seed oil (which was a bit too much) and some essential oil.</li>
            <li> Actually, as I was combing out my very hard and knotted hair, I was contemplating if all of this was worth it.</li>

            <li> To prepare your area, put down newspaper, trash bags, or old towels.  </li>
            <li> hair is nearly down to my belly button and it was shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> was a little surprised about how red the henna made my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t break into little pieces like before, my dandruff has completely gone away, and my hair in shiny as ever!</li>
            <li> For African American women who have damaged hair, especially from dry, arid climates, you&#x27;d be doing yourself a disservice not getting a couple of bags and trying it out!!!</li>
            <li> I used it and my head with red like fire plus it makes your hair extremely DRY AND BREAK.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over a three day period, the henna gave my natural black hair a darker tint in the sunshine</li>
            <li> Once out of the shower, I towel dry my hair &amp; comb it with a big shower comb.  </li>
            <li> Once out of the shower, I towel dry my hair &amp; comb it with a big shower comb.  </li>
            <li> However, it is imperative that a deep conditioner is used after rinsing out the henna or else your hair will be dry.</li>
            <li> It is not pure henna and prob would cost the same for you to drive to a local store to pick up as it would in s&amp;h fees</li>
            <li> and I assumed this brand was mainly just conditioning with very little color staining.  </li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different henna products, on my dark brown graying 59 year old dark brown graying male head  </li>
            <li> , I consider it a protein treatment you will need to do some serious conditioning to soften your hair, like a hot oil treatment.</li>

            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent literally hours and hours reading reviews here and on other sites to work up the nerve to use the Lush henna and this one, and I&#x27;ve found that looking through all those reviews  -- esp.</li>
            <li> This might be because after I mixed it, I only let it sit for 3 hrs (as indicated on the package) instead of overnight like I do with my other henna treatments.  </li>
            <li> I have used other brands of henna that we&#x27;re more expensive</li>
            <li> My hair is about shoulder length now and thick, and half a pack was just enough the second time, though it was plenty on the first application.  </li>
            <li> * so far no significant change to my curl pattern (happens with henna sometimes),&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not put oil in, it will make it hard for the hair to accept the color, but if color is not your desire, do put coconut oil in instead of yoghurt and egg and it will really condition your hair.  </li>
            <li> using this henna for at least 2 years!&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair thicker every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Colors my grey hair in a nice dark orange tint and colors my brown hair with subtle shades of copper.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I still have a little stockpile of Jamila Henna, but was interested in this due to the other herbs and the price point, of course.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting my hair to stay red for so long!!!</li>
            <li> Cheap Suave shampoo works just as well as expensive shampoo, 2-3 washes</li>
            <li> It is helpful if you can have someone help at this point to part and paint the henna on for a thorough application, so far I have done it myself and usually I am the only one who knows where I missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> stylist had been coloring my hair dark brown with reddish tints that were only obvious when I am in the sun.</li>
            <li> My hair dries silky soft &amp; no more white hairs!  </li>
            <li> My hair dries silky soft &amp; no more white hairs!  </li>
            <li> I am a henna convert and will be using this brand of henna for as long as they manufacture it.</li>
            <li> and I plan to stick with this product for as long as they produce it.    </li>
            <li> I remember from long ago.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve applied it to wet hair also and the results are the same.</li>
            <li> Naturally, my hair is Caucasian medium-dark brown with a few auburn highlights.</li>
            <li> One package goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This product also covered my grey.</li>
            <li> I just wish I had known because I only used the one 150 gram package and didnt apply it carefully or evenly</li>
            <li> need to see how long my hair will stay like this.</li>
            <li> I know henna takes a long time to develop, but I don&#x27;t want the color effects of henna.</li>
            <li> For me the application was effortless and there was little to no mess in the shower.  </li>
            <li> and I use this to color the grey.  </li>
            <li> The package is larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Colors my grey but made my hair a bit reddish.  </li>
            <li> If you have grey hair, of course it will turn orange</li>
            <li> I let it grow until the roots were about a 1/2 inch long and then hennaed it again.</li>
            <li> after reading about henna treatments on long haircare forum i decided to try henna.</li>
            <li> Once I started halfway through my towel dried head, starting from the back, I realized I did not have enough.</li>
            <li> Cover Grey hair:&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> Covers grey well and adds shine and strength to my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to leave it on as long.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to leave it on as long.</li>
            <li> There will be some dye release with the first few shampoos, but the dye has already dried out and will wash out of your towels.</li>
            <li> you must use gloves or have yellow hands all week long, so be careful not to leave on ears or forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is a good base to help the Indigo set.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any acidic because my hair is a little dry and my skin is sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I usually use half a pack of Jamila or about a third of this pack for my between ear and chin length hair (think a long pixie when straight)</li>
            <li> Right down to making my hair feel hard like straw until it dries.</li>
            <li> Right down to making my hair feel hard like straw until it dries.</li>
            <li> All I did was to mix half the bag of henna mixture and enough hot water to make a thick paste (yogurt consistency).  </li>
            <li> previous  Godrej is different than present one.  </li>

            <li> Next I took off the gloves &amp; put the plastic bag over my head &amp; made it as tight as possible.  </li>
            <li> Next I took off the gloves &amp; put the plastic bag over my head &amp; made it as tight as possible.  </li>
            <li> I have a little left, and will try it without adding the henna to see if it would make the red darker.  </li>
            <li> I do one or the other steps above, but not both.</li>
            <li> , it will turn gray strands red/orange but a second process of  other powders will reduce that color.</li>
            <li> My only hope was a little shine, maybe a little extra red to cover up the blonde.</li>
            <li> BTW - no more itchy scalp and adult cradle cap!</li>
            <li> In a plastic bowl I mixed the entire packet of powder with a little under 2 cups of boiling water and several heaping tablespoons of coconut oil (for extra conditioning and to disguise a little bit of the alfalfa-ish smell of the henna).</li>
            <li> It lasts well on my white (gray) strands, where I&#x27;ve had some fading from other products.</li>
            <li> I only ended up using a little over 1/4 of the amount I mixed!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other henna products, and that did not happen, so I can only attribute it to this brand of henna.</li>
            <li> If want something like fire engine red you will not get that with henna unless its has some other  chemical agent added to it.</li>
            <li> If want something like fire engine red you will not get that with henna unless its has some other  chemical agent added to it.</li>
            <li> The entire process of it is weird and long but worth it for the benefits.</li>
            <li> My hair being a little dry, I mixed in some hair conditioner to it before applying to my hair and left it on for 3hrs.</li>
            <li> My hair are very long, upto my tailbone</li>
            <li> Towel dry.  </li>
            <li> henna to hair with gloves on, put plastic cap over hair to stop any drips, and blow dry cap intermittently.  </li>
            <li> I removed the caps, the henna was almost dry, I hopped in the shower and started rinsing thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair without conditioning, and let it dry, then pasted the henna goop to my head.  </li>
            <li> It took forever to rinse out in the shower, and made my hair dry, so you might want to use a conditioning treatment or oil afterwards.  </li>
            <li> My hair turned out dry.</li>
            <li> about 3 times, rinse and towel dry.</li>
            <li> It took 2 shampoos to get it out; it did kind-of dry my hair out, so I super-conditioned it.</li>
            <li> to softened hair because henna makes hair dry for a couple of days do to its protein levels and strengthening properties it takes your hair some time to soften up so to help after you wash it</li>
            <li> Please use with yogurt or egg, else will dry your hair</li>
            <li> Blow dry your hair (medium heat is needed) and leave your hair be for the night.</li>

            <li> * hair began to feel dry after a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> I also once my hair was about 95% dry</li>
            <li> Mix up these dry ingredients in a 1 qt.</li>
            <li> Rinse out the baking soda after a minute or two, and then towel dry your hair.</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair, you can even add oil.  </li>
            <li> no shampoo and didn&#x27;t treat with any oils, because my hair didn&#x27;t dry out,</li>
            <li> I ordered this a few months back in February 2013 and finally got around to using it.</li>
            <li> Regular henna will not turn my hair coppery all over, just a deep auburn after a few hours (I had it on for 3-4 hours).</li>
            <li> So I added indigo powder and a few other things and WOW!</li>
            <li> I have long dark brown hair with red tones</li>
            <li> During color development, check periodically to remove drips with a wet wad of toilet paper.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then towel dried and deep conditioned for 30 minutes with Kenra deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> Using your brow scissors very, very carefully so you don&#x27;t cut yourself, make a small hole at the center of each ear and gently pull your ear through.</li>
            <li> 4 days post application and no sign of a single flake anywhere.</li>

            <li> I plan to use chai tea instead of plain water initially then mix with Vatika coconut oil after dye release and will leave on only 2 hours.  </li>

            <li> My natural color is a slightly mousey dark blond/light-medium brown, and it came out quite a bit darker with tons of reddish and auburn highlights.</li>
            <li> It was very difficult combing out my hair, but remember reading somewhere that once you dry your hair, it will feel better.</li>
            <li> It was very difficult combing out my hair, but remember reading somewhere that once you dry your hair, it will feel better.</li>
            <li> I was afraid due to most people stating it does dry out hair.</li>
            <li> natural color is medium dark that looks a bit grey and flat compared to dyed hair and henna leaves my hair dark brown with slight reddish/copper undertones -</li>
            <li> I even added henna so it would be a dark brown, but after following directions, and taking the plastic off, I looked like \\&quot;I</li>
            <li> The color isa chocolate brown with highlighted dark red streaks(thanks to my premature gray).</li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s dark orange with some red.  </li>
            <li> and my hairs were unbelievably shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> It usually takes me 2 or 3 washes to completely get it off.</li>
            <li> I blow dried my hair, went to sleep and flat ironed my hair the next morning.</li>
            <li> With indigo powder, you mix it and let it sit for only about 15 min and then apply it to your hair and let it sit for anywhere to 20 min to 2 hours depending on how dark you want your hair.</li>
            <li> The gray hairs do turn red, but it just looks like highlights in my dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li> I mixed the entire bag, because my hair is quite long, past the bottom of my shoulder blades...</li>
            <li> My hair was dark brown with glints of red in the sunlight over the greys.</li>
            <li> 4 months is a long time to me to see no difference at all with filling in empty spaces.</li>
            <li> I only use about half of the package because my hair isn&#x27;t too long but A+ for Nupur!</li>
            <li> that toned down the brash, and even blended in my grey brown roots to make it all look natural.  </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s not very much.</li>
            <li> I have very very long nearly black hair with a lot of noticeable white strands.  </li>
            <li> And that is why you should use the indigo to tone down the red or orange tones!  </li>
            <li> It is very messy, I used an old towel that I didn&#x27;t care if it got stained around my shoulders.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it does start running down a little near the end of the time.  </li>
            <li> After the previously listed events, I&#x27;m wondering if that should have been my red flag.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, as long as you are careful and have a wet paper towel.    </li>
            <li> I then boiled about a half cup of red wine and added it to the water.</li>
            <li> I mixed up the rest of the henna with black coffee and water</li>
            <li> a 1/2 cup of black tea, used 2 tea bags and rip it and mixed in the tea leaves</li>
            <li> My hair is thicker, longer, shinier, healthier (less split ends,) than it has ever been in my entire life.</li>
            <li> With Nupur, my hair overall became slightly lighter.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and only used half of one package&lt;</li>
            <li> have had an easier time applying it to dry hair than wet hair.  </li>
            <li> Package was different and the product expired the previous month of my order.  </li>
            <li> I used about half of what was left.  </li>
            <li> I used about half of what was left.  </li>
            <li> I left it on for about 2 and a half hours.</li>
            <li> the first date is the manufacture date (which for me was 2013), then some random numbers/letters, then the actual expiration date (for me 2016).</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t use anything acidic, as I said earlier I use Coconut milk as my liquid and still my hair color has slightly changed.</li>
            <li> I now have 1B with a slight tint of red (depending on lighting).</li>
            <li> In a month I have not seen on single strand of grey yet!!!</li>
            <li> In a month I have not seen on single strand of grey yet!!!</li>
            <li> The next day, hair was a little dry</li>
            <li> I will not purchase again as long as I have locks, but will recommend to other loose-haired folks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be discouraged if your hair feels dry, coarse, and straw-like for a few days.</li>

            <li> (I didn&#x27;t want an orange halo), and the henna with a little bit of indigo (lighter mixture) to the rest of my head, hoping that my edges would be about the same color of the rest of my head in the end.</li>
            <li> (It turned out the same color as my little brother&#x27;s hair.)  </li>
            <li> I mixed it with 100gm of indigo as well as a little lemon juice, honey and Vatika Oil.</li>
            <li> i reordered this one and the indigo to i think next time i will mix a little indigo with it..</li>
            <li> I mixed mine with water, coconut oil, honey, almond oil and a little olive oil.</li>
            <li> I had a little left over.</li>
            <li> At first I was shocked at the vibrant color,</li>
            <li> I am protein sensitive so finding something to strengthen hair is hard</li>
            <li> This product turn my dirty blonde hair into pure red.</li>
            <li> After about a week, my naturally very dark brown hair is brown with deep auburn highlights!</li>
            <li> Next I took a shower, washing not only my messy self, but I hosed down the walls too!  </li>
            <li> Next I took a shower, washing not only my messy self, but I hosed down the walls too!  </li>
            <li> The added auburn, blonde highlights over my few gray strands is an added bonus too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I added a few drops of lavender essential oil, and coconut conditioner.</li>
            <li> I apply it to washed, and clarified, towel dried hair and left it on for 4 hours.</li>
            <li> The application process can be a bit messy initially</li>
            <li> 10 minutes with conditioner on your hair after rinsing the henna will eliminate any dryness that you may feel over the next few days.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to use towels that you cherish because the henna will stain them.  </li>
            <li> The next afternoon I put some plastic garbage bags on the floor of the bathroom (as well as one covering the sink/counter) because I had heard it was horribly messy.</li>
            <li> I then covered it and left it on the kitchen counter for a few hours, and then put it in the freezer.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I wanted and it is as I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Godrej Nupur is not available in our local Indian store.</li>
            <li> There are only a few reviews like that</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I would recommend this a friend, as it did make my hair shinier and smoother after the initial few days, and I would purchase this for myself again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your plants benefit from it as well if you don&#x27;t want to use it as a rinse, don&#x27;t waste it, use it to water your houseplants occasionally, it helps neutralize the salts that accumulate in potted plants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it  came  in  unknown  looking  package.</li>
            <li> Rinse off your skin, I use a wet wipe after I&#x27;m done wrapping up my hair, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem with hairline stains.</li>
            <li> Be careful when you by products like this online the one i was sent</li>
            <li> I was really tired of washing my hair so much even after</li>
            <li> The next day i washed my hair, toweled dried it, combed it and put it into 4 sections.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already spent $100 to cover.</li>
            <li> I did not really care about my hair feeling &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I did not really care about my hair feeling &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> well i mixed my nupur with green tea and let it sit for about two days.</li>
            <li> no drips -- just toss empty baggie and gloves and be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I placed one cap back on my head for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> No there was minimal hair loss in the drain.</li>
            <li> No there was minimal hair loss in the drain.</li>
            <li> Then I applied it to my pre washed somewhat wet hair (no conditioner) and let it sit for 4 hours.</li>
            <li> I left it on my hair for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> (so you can throw away your gloves and the empty henna bag) when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say on this one.</li>
            <li> I spent lots of time reading reviews about henna hair dyes.</li>
            <li> i hated my highlights and after the henna it turned them into a warm red colour !</li>
            <li> I mixed it just enough to turn it into a thick paste.</li>
            <li> After rinsing the deep conditioner out of my hair I geared up for what I hate most about washing my hair - detangling.</li>
            <li> but I knew that I was definitely going to need to use indigo to create a dark brown or black color.  </li>
            <li> an Asian with dark brown almost black hair.</li>
            <li> It shows up as a chestnut color on my dark brown hair (almost black), and as an auburn color on white hair.</li>
            <li> This is not a pure henna, but a blend of henna and 9 Indian herbs known for their hair-beautifying properties.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted something that did not have lots of chemicals that could turn the grey black, but I guess that&#x27;s not going to happen.  </li>
            <li> I had a few flecks of gray on my roots all over my head, but from ear to ear around the front half of my head was about 1/2 gray and half natural color.</li>
            <li> Grey hair turned brown, black hair remained black.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I usually have extremely coarse hair, it still feels a little coarse even after I relax it</li>
            <li> I started rubbing a little of this in my hair, combing it through (especially the ends) before styling, which has also helped with the insane softness and shininess of my new hair :-)</li>
            <li> I started rubbing a little of this in my hair, combing it through (especially the ends) before styling, which has also helped with the insane softness and shininess of my new hair :-)</li>
            <li> Now if you looking an immediate black dye, especially for my  black women, you also want to purchase some indigo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of Southeast Asian and Arabic descents and my hair is of reflect of that: dark brown to black, straight (with some random curly coily strand) and  thick (actually not as thick as it&#x27;s used to be due to some medications I was on 2 years ago).&lt;br</li>
            <li> so if you plan to return to conventional dye, it can take a few months for the henna to wash out enough to do</li>
            <li> so if you plan to return to conventional dye, it can take a few months for the henna to wash out enough to do</li>
            <li> I mixed with black tea and lemon juice, plus a little sugar to help hold it together.</li>
            <li> i left it for two and half hrs and rinised off little to none staining it</li>
            <li> avoid lots of the mess of prep &amp; application by putting my dry powder in a gallon sized ziploc baggie, then adding liquids as desired, and after sealing well, squishing around until well mixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I mean how long have I been going through constant BHD&#x27;S?</li>
            <li> I loose less hair</li>
            <li> It is a bit messy (next time I&#x27;ll use less water)</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s less red after few weeks.     </li>
            <li> any color will turn it green, I tried that, using different colors of brown on hair hidden under layers.  </li>
            <li> I have chin length Asian brown - black hair and have used quite a few brands.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Just be careful about the edges of your hairline and use latex gloves so you don&#x27;t look like an oompa loompa after application!</li>
            <li> It also has the benefit of 8 other herb blends that my hair just loves.</li>
            <li> I used to dye my partially gray hair with commercial dye and it starting getting really thin, so I gave henna a try.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m including my advice from the other brands:  -Do</li>
            <li> After thoroughly mixing, I kept a small piece of white paper on the dough/mixture, so that in the morning I could check its colour and guess what it would look like on my hair.</li>
            <li> I read that we need to take small strands of hair and apply henna separately, but then I realized that it is not practically being possible for my extra-long hair.</li>
            <li> and I usually wear it styled in a bob without bangs--the front combed towards the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to try using henna, this product intrigued me because it addressed other issues I have.</li>
            <li> so you can do other things</li>
            <li> so you can do other things</li>
            <li> I am still in the shower naked because this is messy!  </li>
            <li> I basically followed the tips of the other reviewers in mixing.  </li>
            <li> It was extremely unnatural looking.</li>
            <li> Read the instructions and hints from other users in feedback.</li>
            <li> hair also grew longer, and that&#x27;s due to the healthiness of my roots and hair.</li>
            <li> and i added olive oil one time and yogurt the other.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers pointed out, be patient when rinsing and washing out the product afterwards.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen this suggested in other reviews yet, so I&#x27;ll share my method:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s minimal grit and twigs in this formula which makes rinsing a breeze!</li>
            <li> Wipe off your neck and any other place where the henna/amla has dripped and tie a grocery store bag on your head to keep the heat</li>
            <li> I do, however, like the fact that there are a number of other herbs that make up this mix, neem being one of them.</li>
            <li> Additionally, like other reviews stated, it leaves a reddish residue color to the hair.</li>
            <li> Other observations included some people noticing a loosening of their curl pattern.  </li>
            <li> It was no more that what I could have regularly shed.  </li>
            <li> The other reviews are \\&quot;dead-on\\&quot; about this looking like \\&quot;poo\\&quot; though...</li>
            <li> Not sure about all the extra herbs and if they do what they promise,</li>
            <li> Not sure about all the extra herbs and if they do what they promise,</li>
            <li> You can even use a smear of it to touch up your hair if it feels a little dry and dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: May 26, 2012&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard henna can make your hair a little dry</li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown, curly, and a little bit grey.  </li>
            <li> After a few days, it&#x27;s settled into the final color - a dark coppery auburn!  </li>
            <li> The color cured to a very dark chocolately reddish brown with the glints over the next few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> was also shocked at how EASY it is to use.  </li>
            <li> After they dried a bit I looked at the sparse white hair which I had, they have turned orangish-goldenish, my hair are not frizzy as they used to be after being washed and dried.</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry and once dried</li>
            <li> I am going all natural with my hair, no more BS &amp;#34;no-lye&amp;#34; perms and no more chemical colors.</li>
            <li> The actual application of henna to the hair can be a little messy, as the paste is dark brown.  </li>
            <li> It was very messy to apply - an arduous process, really.</li>
            <li> My hair was damaged and very dry because of permanent wave I got few months ago.  </li>
            <li> My hair is black and I was actually not interested in coloring my hair.</li>
            <li> Previously I tried other easier henna products.  </li>
            <li> Looking at the other reviews I bagged half of the mixture and put it in the freezer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the dry brittleness that I usually get with other henna products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You must use this with indigo for a dark color too.</li>
            <li> Use it in a two step process to color my hair a dark brown</li>
            <li> The only gloves I had were the dish-washing gloves, which fit horribly, so I had to take them off in the middle of applying the henna gloss to my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dark brown.</li>
            <li> I suggest using some of the indigo powder if you want your hair to be dark without the red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stuff is dark</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally a dark auburn color</li>
            <li> (My hair was dark brown with silvers throughout.)  </li>
            <li> Does anyone know how to mix this to get dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair was dark brown from when i used the rainbow henna.</li>
            <li> But my hair did not change color at all because my hair is really dark</li>
            <li> The henna helped even my hair color to a dark brown with reddish highlights.</li>
            <li> : Dec. 17, 2012*****&lt;br /&gt;Several friends felt that using indigo made my hair too dark, and so I doubled the amla and skipped the indigo.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and a lot of gray.  </li>
            <li> I like my hair dark</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dark brown.</li>
            <li> After the mehendi, it was reddish for a day or so, then darkened to dark auburn with reddish highlights.</li>
            <li> My hair has been thin and damaged from perms and heat, and the natural hair has been a challenge.  </li>
            <li> People are always asking me what my secret is, and if my color is natural.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, not coarse shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I geared up for what I hate most about washing my hair - detangling.</li>
            <li> then you could probably get away with using just half a bag this time and then the other half in 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> My hair was starting to thin and was dry.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m half african and in my part of africa dying hair with henna is common), and I waited 3 hours before applying the henna.</li>
            <li> Upside, the staining also happens to your hair so, if you&#x27;re like me and your hair is mostly black with some reddish natural highlights and you&#x27;re tired of the &amp;#34;Do</li>
            <li> with plastic rap and tap it down: sleep on a towel&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wear disposable gloves to apply and a button down shirt you don&#x27;t care about.  </li>
            <li> My hair is reaches down to axillary (armpit) level to give you some idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used 1/3 of the bag and about 4 TBS of the Zenia indigo henna to tone down the orange color.  </li>
            <li> THUMBS DOWN</li>
            <li> so I will break it down into points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hesh Pharma Amla Hair Powder 3.5oz powder]] (to tone down the red)&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Once I laid down the newspaper in my bathroom, got my gloves on.</li>
            <li> After 2 to 4 hours, fill the bathtub and lay down to rinse your hair that way.  </li>
            <li> it closed with no air inside, and knead until it has the consistency of a stiff pudding):&lt;br /</li>
            <li> If you have black or dark brown locs and need gray coverage, purchase this product along with body art quality indigo.  </li>
            <li> Usually my hair&#x27;s dry,</li>
            <li> I had dark brownish black hair with fried almost reddish ends.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a henna to make your hair a dark brown or black</li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t AS dry as it usually is after doing a Jamilia BAQ henna treatment.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting my hair to be a dark brown or black afterwards, but instead, the blend made my hair lighter.</li>
            <li> Medium to dark brown and previously over-highlighted.  </li>
            <li> I picked and tried this one and a few other ones.</li>
            <li> I really feel bad for taking 3 years to update this review, but I&#x27;ve totally changed the way I&#x27;ve used this henna in terms of the preparation.</li>
            <li> I thought the powder would turn my hair black.  </li>
            <li> I did notice slight drying after using Godrej Nupur, but a DC will take care of this.</li>
            <li> I let it sit for about an hour and a half, covered.  </li>
            <li> I noticed after using this product that there&#x27;s less hair in my bathtub.  </li>
            <li> As for the color, my hair is already black.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite black, but it&#x27;s close.  </li>
            <li> I added some coconut oil  to  the henna and water pudding-like mixture,  and it made it softer and also less hay-like in scent.</li>
            <li> and I freeze half of it)</li>
            <li> It is stronger &amp;  my hair is falling out way less than before.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s just black</li>
            <li> For less than $5.</li>
            <li> I have black hair with lots of grey.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> I also added in 1 TB of lemon juice (which is supposed to make henna read less orange) and 1 TB of apple cider vinegar (which is supposed to help henna cover the grey).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair responded after the 1st treatment (about 75% less shedding)..</li>
            <li> The iron in the pot reacts with the herb blend and the tea and turns it almost black.  </li>
            <li> I did notice until I had used half of it.</li>
            <li> I think I could have split the bag in half for two uses.</li>
            <li> also noticeably less hair loss</li>
            <li> I added a squirt of evening primrose oil and an egg for half a bag of Nupur.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1. 1 cup of black coffee&lt;</li>
            <li> I have less scalp problems, my hair seems shinier, thicker, and stronger.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s much less harmful than the chemical-based dyes.</li>
            <li> But beware of the slight color change, if that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> BTW - I started off with 1B hair (off black)</li>
            <li> and then indigo powder to make my hair black,</li>
            <li> I left the product on for 3 hours and the result is subtle.</li>
            <li> The semipermanent was less damaging but would fade from the greys in about 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I leave it for as long as I have patience to sit around with a plastic bag on my head, trying hard not to stain anything around me -</li>
            <li> I did mess up with one thing though.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair so shiny, at first i was afraid to try it because of the rumors that it might change your hair orange and so forth.</li>
            <li> It is a gloppy mess of a process, though.  </li>
            <li> The amount of yoghurt I use depends on the consistency, 1/2 to 1 cup, not too runny, or you have a dripping mess, it will keep you awake, as it trickles it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like taking the time and dealing with the mess.</li>
            <li> I have premature gray, I have dark brown hair that was heavily salted with gray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried without yogurt in the past and it was a lot harder to rinse out</li>
            <li> What a mess.</li>
            <li> I have dark, weak, frizzy hair, and this brought my hair back to life.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> a little coco-glucoside and even less grapfruit seed extract.</li>
            <li> anyway if it doesn&#x27;t settle down in a few shampoos.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and set out to condition my tightly curly hair.</li>
            <li> I covered the bowl tightly in plastic wrap and then let it sit on the counter overnight.</li>
            <li> I cover this with a plastic bag tightly</li>
            <li> If I could not, I would be forced to chemically dye the grey areas--it&#x27;s that clown-like, head-spinning, eye-popping orange!</li>
            <li> you use Saran Wrap, put it around really tightly - pull out a few feet, and twist it around itself while it&#x27;s still on the tube - supposedly the tighter it is and the longer you leave in the henna, the less orange it will be.  </li>
            <li> you use Saran Wrap, put it around really tightly - pull out a few feet, and twist it around itself while it&#x27;s still on the tube - supposedly the tighter it is and the longer you leave in the henna, the less orange it will be.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair SOOOO hard!  </li>
            <li> I also think that the coco butter in the Lush bar makes it difficult for the henna and indigo to stain naturally dark</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think to do this but realized it just after I application so washed hands and hairline immediately, even used a little baking soda to exfoliate because I was already turning orange.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s little bit of work.  </li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m a little dissapointed.</li>
            <li> It was a little drippy, you need to wrap your head in saran wrap, and then in a towel.  </li>
            <li> but i notice it is past expiration date, it was sold in other country.</li>
            <li> The goal was to add the indigo with a little bit of henna (darker mixture) to my edges and my roots</li>
            <li> Little kids get grossed out just looking at the paste.</li>
            <li> Up until now, I haven&#x27;t used henna since I was a little kid, when my mother used to henna her hair when we lived in Egypt.</li>
            <li> Little stray grays are gone.</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t know anything about henna or the effects, please do a little search on youtube or</li>
            <li> a little tweaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a lot of product in this little bag.</li>
            <li> It is a little orange at 1st</li>
            <li> i had little to none shedding</li>
            <li> I put the tea in the cast iron pot, and add the Nupur blend, a little at a time, stirring until pudding consistency or a little thicker.  </li>
            <li> It is a little like having highlights through out wherever the gray hair was.  </li>
            <li> Like all henna, it is a little drying.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;ve learned from my years of hennaing is:  Body Quality Henna like this is the way to go, also it is god to add a little salt to your indigo.</li>
            <li> but here is my 2 cents:&lt;br /&gt;-A little bit about my hair</li>
            <li> mix it now with Indigo and lasts a little longer</li>
            <li> little lemon juice&lt;</li>
            <li> little</li>
            <li> Then I hopped out of the shower, towel dried my hair and saw one or two little knotty masses of hair which I entangled with little coconut oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy and a little time consuming to use.</li>
            <li> After I washed the henna out, massaged in just a little coconut oil, though it didn&#x27;t feel like the henna had dried it out at all.      </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very dark.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dark</li>
            <li> I have very dark hair with honey blond highlights that are almost all grown out.</li>
            <li> It adds SO much shine that it&#x27;s crazy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Morning gently wash away henna with apple cider vinegar and cold water&lt;</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re ready to rinse, put a stock pot in your bathtub and fill it with cold water.</li>
            <li> Use a big plastic glass or pitcher to pour cold water over the back of your head, and work on getting the henna/amla to loosen from your hairline as well as the rest of your scalp.</li>
            <li> Allowing the dye to release early lets you leave the paste on your head for a shorter amount of time, as the long hours can get very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will stain some clothes so wear a plastic cape as it can be messy as it depends on the consistency.  </li>
            <li> This product is dyed green, and doesn&#x27;t smell like henna should.</li>
            <li> I found out that it&#x27;s not as messy doing it this way than when I did the gloss.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using henna for a few years now.</li>

            <li> few tips for first-time users:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> A bit messy</li>
            <li> Once it dried it was not frizzy or fuzzy.  </li>
            <li> it is MESSY.</li>
            <li> This basically saved my hair from uneven pigment, graying, split ends, and lack of color and luster.</li>
            <li> It smells like green tea ice cream, and a grassy smell.</li>
            <li> I prepare my henna with water, a few tablespoons of olive oil and honey and freeze the prepared mixture.</li>
            <li> I towel dried my hair.</li>
            <li> When my hair dried it wasn&#x27;t any darker.</li>
            <li> (so you could just toss spoon after mixing) with green tea made the night before,</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a few months ago</li>
            <li> I mix with green tea and honey</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experimented and this round</li>
            <li> A few things I&#x27;d like to mention when using henna dyes.</li>

            <li> They turned pale green.</li>
            <li> They turned pale green.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is well past my bra line, I decided to mix half the bag.  </li>
            <li> I desired a darker shade for my mane, I usually add in additional bhringraj powder, black tea or coffee.</li>
            <li> and both my daughter and I have a lot less frizzies in our hair!</li>
            <li> Then I added some lavender essential oil (a few drops) to help with the smell (it actually wasn&#x27;t too bad), and about a cup and a half of conditioner.  </li>
            <li> though I know it would be black with chestnut reddish sheen in sun with very few coppery-auburn highlights).   </li>
            <li> I mix some plain yogurt and an egg.</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed ! :)</li>
            <li> I noticed that all the bad reviews were by people who didn&#x27;t know what they were getting into, so let me first say:    </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I decided to give in, hoping I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked after that first treatment.</li>
            <li> then let marinate the desired time (for me usually overnight, but I see that some people prefer anywhere from a few hours to a week!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was dull, damaged, thin and had some white streaks.  </li>
            <li> After letting it sit for 3 hours, I was shocked to find that my white and silver hair was tinted a really DEEP reddish-ORANGE!  </li>
            <li> Then I emptied approximately half the pack of nupur mehandi in the plastic container and slowly poured some water into it.</li>
            <li> It was bleached poorly and now my hair is over processed meaning its like rubbery and when dry like cotton candy just a b*tch to deal with.</li>
            <li> the color it was before applying henna was dark brown with lighter brownish highlights!!</li>
            <li> Little specks of sand-like stuff were stuck in some of my locks, which were not there before!</li>
            <li> My hair is a dark brown that ends approximately mid-way down my</li>
            <li> It was a little hard getting it into the hair because of the texture</li>
            <li> Pure henna, never had a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> A very little bit.</li>
            <li> A very little bit.</li>
            <li> Henna needs to mixed, I used half a cup of orange juice, 1/4 of cup of lemon ginger tea, ( you can make the lemon ginger tea by just cutting up a small lemon and cutting a thin slice of fresh ginger add to 1 cup of water and boiling it for about 5 to 6 minutes) than 1 to 2 table spoons of olive oil.</li>
            <li> As for the difficulty of use, I really did not find it to be bad at all.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to do much and just smells bad. ..</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> but it dyed my hair up in 2.5 hours rather than the usually 4-5 hours.</li>
            <li> I jumped in the shower and rinsed with out adding anuthing else and then styled as usual.  </li>
            <li> Then with trembling hands (I was anxious how will my hair turn out)</li>
            <li> I mix it with a small amount of Tresemme silicone-free conditioner before I apply to my hair.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I re-hennaed my hair recently</li>
            <li> , I was anxious to see if I&#x27;d made my mixture correctly, so I checked on it and it was brown</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had to go to work, so I left it until I got home that evening.</li>
            <li> Combing tangles out of your hair is difficult enough...</li>
            <li> Combing tangles out of your hair is difficult enough...</li>
            <li> It is MESSY!</li>
            <li> After washing, drying and styling my hair, I had mixed feelings about the intensity of the red/orange which is really difficult to miss as it frames my face.  </li>
            <li> Just did it this past weekend</li>
            <li> I usually order online.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m getting my money back with every henna treatment.</li>
            <li> I am 17 and have been dying my hair 4 or 5 times a year for the past 4 years.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s only because it was really difficult to show how the color&#x27;s changed without adjusting the camera&#x27;s brightness :/.  </li>
            <li> (Before mixing in the indigo, I spooned some henna into a small Ziploc baggie and froze it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also twisted it into a bun via small sections, and alternate the directions</li>

            <li> Not sure if it this product or the Eden body works hair shampoo, but my scalp itches and this never happens.  </li>
            <li> have a small cast iron pot that I use to prepare my mixture in.  </li>
            <li> i will oil my hair tomorrow and wash it as usual with shampoo</li>
            <li> I have used henna in the past</li>
            <li> I did my usual work.  </li>
            <li> I did my usual work.  </li>
            <li> I usually survive about 6 hours.</li>
            <li> No more roots, and the color is even redder and richer than before.  </li>
            <li> This past weekend was the seventh time I applied this product.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was the clay or the henna.</li>
            <li> It also stained the bottom of my tub, not sure how to get that out.</li>

            <li> It also stained the bottom of my tub, not sure how to get that out.</li>
            <li> I usually mix it the night before and apply for about 2 hrs the nextday.</li>
            <li> Android leave it in over night and when I wash it out my hair is hydrated and no more breaking endz</li>
            <li> It has all the herbs I usually have to add already in it.</li>
            <li> like it usually did with just henna</li>
            <li> My aging mother on the other hand was not very impressed-</li>
            <li> Before using this product I was using a regular dye and, i notice my hair was getting weak and thin....</li>
            <li> You can also add folded paper towels around the base of the Saran Wrap to front and back of hair to catch drips later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> i was really hesitant about my hair coming out this god awful red...</li>
            <li> Because of this, there were still small granules in my hair that were hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product not expecting much, and I was still disappointed.</li>
            <li> You need to adding water slowly in small quantities and mixing it with henna, do not overdo with water since we just require it to be like a thick paste.</li>
            <li> Seeing as I relax and usually use chemicals to color my hair (cover the gray), I decided that I can at least stop using chemicals for color (and stretch my relaxers).</li>
            <li> (I have thick medium-long hair, past my shoulders</li>
            <li> I have hair all the way to my tailbone, and I oil it at least once per week and usually twice.  </li>
            <li> It should very very slowly trickle down like thick yoghurt.</li>
            <li> The smell of these products is not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> The mess actually wasn&#x27;t *too* bad because we both wore bikini tops and used shower caps.  </li>
            <li> Hard to say no to that.</li>
            <li> woke this morning and rinsed my hair, and it was still hard.</li>
            <li> but when you have to do it when it&#x27;s as hard as straw was just disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I woke this morning and rinsed my hair, and it was still hard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;PS - it is hard to dye OVER henna as henna coats the hair shaft</li>
            <li> /&gt;PS - it is hard to dye OVER henna as henna coats the hair shaft</li>
            <li> It was not too hard to rinse out,</li>
            <li> Feel hair is hard .</li>
            <li> It is not clumpy or hard to rinse out.</li>
            <li> Now it has a texture like straw and looks dull.</li>
            <li> Be advised henna will make your hair feel hard</li>
            <li> Be advised henna will make your hair feel hard</li>
            <li> my hair felt hard after i rinsed it out.</li>
            <li> and I had a hard time applying.</li>
            <li> Then I would have at least had a clue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> The only disappointment was that my hair didn&#x27;t become silky.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do any crazy formula, but I just mixed the powder with water and a bit of [[ASIN:B001PEZAHI Slice of Nature© Virgin Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I get it now, duh.</li>
            <li> I have no dandruff, but my scalp does itch and drives me crazy if I don&#x27;t get enough coconut oil on it and sometimes even if I do</li>
            <li> NO SHAMPOO for at least 24 h.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The mixture was neither thick nor runny.</li>
            <li> Mixture will be EXTREMELY thick at this stage.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just didn&#x27;t do it thick</li>
            <li> It seemed thick like pudding.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Mixed until it looked like thick chocolate frosting</li>
            <li> I mean, I tried everything, jojoba oil, Pytho, Kerastase, Ojon, etc., but nothing worked and lasted like this.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s usually $2-3 in store!).</li>
            <li> I got to rinsing and boy, do I mean rinsing.</li>
            <li> no more chemicals!</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> The greys seem like subtle highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The greys seem like subtle highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I had loose hair, it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem, because it would just wash out, but with locks, the sand-like stuff gets trapped in the lock and make the lock look dirty!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re African-American and our hair is very thick and you will have to wash your hair out at least 2-3 times before all of the herbs are out of your hair.</li>
            <li> I WAS EMBARRASSED as I shocked my co-workers and total strangers on the street.  </li>
            <li> It was messy and difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Godrej Nupur: (Mixed with Amla powder</li>
            <li> It was especially horrible the first weeks after using this product.</li>
            <li> And it is still shiny and thick!</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair so thick, shiny and bouncy!</li>
            <li> I then washed my hair 3 or 4 times and was a bit dismayed because my hair felt very hard.</li>
            <li> I then washed my hair 3 or 4 times and was a bit dismayed because my hair felt very hard.</li>
            <li> I am going to try this product again with &amp;#34;Indigo&amp;#34;, which is very hard to find in NYC beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> , I have never gotten a bad batch, thought it very strange someone did.</li>
            <li> Just terribly dissapointed at finding that much sand in this product.</li>
            <li> This size product allows for approximately 3 henna treatments (I have almost shoulder-length hair).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also on the thin side.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also on the thin side.  </li>
            <li> As it is, I&#x27;m going to have to remember not to run my fingers through my hair, tuck it behind an ear, or stand in the wind for a while.</li>
            <li> Annoyed.  </li>
            <li> but worse.</li>
            <li> My hair had started to thin</li>
            <li> I sectioned my hair into 4 parts, starting from the hair at the base of my skull</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and almost shoulder length</li>
            <li> and I was exhausted at this point</li>
            <li> I did not ive been using for about 4 months and have not noticed any thickening in those thin places.</li>
            <li> I continue to add water until it is about yogurt or thin pudding mixture.  </li>
            <li> but worst part is I developed a serious allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> But I repeat, it&#x27;s not a hair dye, with the nasty chemicals and the crap so many Westerners are raised with in terms of hair products.</li>
            <li> Washing it out was a little time consuming, but it wasn&#x27;t bad at all.  </li>
            <li> but when you have to do it when it&#x27;s as hard as straw was just disappointing.  </li>
            <li> It can be messy to use, but if you prepare yourself, it won&#x27;t be too bad.</li>
            <li> When I have tried chemical dyes, they just strip the moisture from my hair, make my curls limp, and look bad when my roots start to show.  </li>
            <li> But I am a little disappointed in the results.</li>
            <li> I also blow dried and pressed our hair!!!!</li>
            <li> Am i doing this wrong?</li>
            <li> Actually, a lot of the henna powder I looked at had these nasty additives in there.  </li>
            <li> The I twisted all my hair together in sort of a bun and was just going to apply a clip when I realized that the mass of my matted medusa hair was not moving an inch anyways</li>
            <li> What some might find difficult about the product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why women who are fair-haired are buying this stuff, using it, and then saying there is something wrong with the product.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with it.</li>
            <li> You almost can&#x27;t go wrong with mixing henna, you can add conditioner,</li>
            <li> I kept it on overnight (and endured a headache as a result).&lt;br /&gt;- Difficult to wash out because of the coco butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong My hands looked like oompa loompas for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> this is where others went wrong.</li>

            <li> What&#x27;s  wrong with  that?</li>
            <li> Can you say OBSESSED.  </li>
            <li> , now don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> ( I am guilty of using the dryer).</li>
            <li> I think I am addicted!</li>
            <li> Henna strengthen my hair, when I was perming my hair and getting braids, prior to using it, some of my hair would fall out from the cruel stress and mistreatment I use to do my hair, henna repaired and colored my hair in one treatment.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m doing it wrong or what, but i don&#x27;t see what all the hype is about.</li>
            <li> this is where I went wrong.</li>
            <li> Well sifted &amp; leaves none of that horrible grassy residue behind like other brands.</li>
            <li> it makes dark brown hair bronze or copper in color and gray hair orange; hated that.  </li>
            <li> I shampooed and scrubbed that area like crazy with no softening at all of this garish orange color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Disappointing considering</li>
            <li> Cold pressed.</li>
            <li> To inconvenient...</li>
            <li> Also, I was afraid of coming out looking like</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&amp;iexcl;¦t do anything crazy to my hair</li>
            <li> WRONG!  </li>
            <li> it is just unpleasant but it sticks with you for 8 or so hours</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that bad at all.</li>
            <li> After doing some research and realizing how bad that was for you</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t smell too bad, as henna goes.</li>
            <li> my bad</li>
            <li> This product fried my hair so badly that pieces of it were breaking off everywhere.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t think it smells as bad as everyone else seems to.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> Because of the interest in this topic, I have put an updated review with pictures on our blog Evolving Dish: [...]</li>

            <li> I hate to say it</li>
            <li> After rinsing, I looked in the mirrow and was shocked to see that my gray hair was a flaming orange color!  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> OMG what a devastating catastrophe that was.</li>
            <li> i HATE them!..</li>
            <li> Now I look totally awful and my heart is broke.</li>

            <li> For me, this one was too drying, and the color was not deep enough.  I tried three brands from Amazon, and decided on one brand, but it is NOT this one.</li>
            <li> First time trying this product.  I thought the powder would turn my hair black.  I even added henna so it would be a dark brown, but after following directions, and taking the plastic off, I looked like \\&quot;I LOVE LUCY.\\&quot; It turned out a very Reddish auburn. I just wanted something that did not have lots of chemicals that could turn the grey black, but I guess that&#x27;s not going to happen.  I have a little left, and will try it without adding the henna to see if it would make the red darker.  Not sure if I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always heard that Henna is good as a strengthner for you hair, but never knew which one to buy.  I love this stuff, my hair feel instantly stronger after each application.  It&#x27;s easy to mix and apply.</li>
            <li> I am relatively new to ayervedic hair care, so I did not realize mehendi meant the same as henna. I thought it was a brand name or manufacturer or something. I thought the product would be a colorless mix of herbs...of the 9 listed herbs henna was not one. I have done cassia obovata and amla in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful about the edges of your hairline and use latex gloves so you don&#x27;t look like an oompa loompa after application! I didn&#x27;t think to do this but realized it just after I application so washed hands and hairline immediately, even used a little baking soda to exfoliate because I was already turning orange. It mostly washed off, mostly. My fingernails are the color of Cheetos though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product but I wish henna (or even the Mehendi) was listed along with the 9 herbs on the back where it tells you what each herb does. Then I would have at least had a clue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I can&#x27;t remember how much this Amazon seller is asking, but I bought mine at a local Indian grocery for $3.99 for 188g, which will last me 2-3 treatments.</li>
            <li> I ordered this a few months back in February 2013 and finally got around to using it. Initially I was hesitant but the more I researched henna&#x27;s use for deep conditioning, the more I knew my natural hair journey would benefit from trying it. Final analysis, Godrej Nupur Mehendi powder will now be a monthly conditioning process in my hair regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m African American with 3c/4a hair. After the first use I immediately noticed THICKNESS, SHINE, and STRENGTH and practically no shedding. I was just in awe. Since January 2013, I&#x27;ve gained over 3 inches on average in hair growth all over my head, so I expect to retain more length using the Godrej Nupur and can only imagine the total growth in inches by the end of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will tweak my process going forward, as I noticed there are things I can do to make the next treatment even better. So next time I will do the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Mix Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder with purified water, extra virgin Olive Oil, and Coconut Oil (My hair responded very well with this mix the first time). Allow mix to sit for 3 hours before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Pre-poo with one of my co-wash conditioners (I currently use VO-5 Kiwi Calrifying Conditioner or a Moisturizing conditioner)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Shampoo with Suave Clarifying Shampoo (NOTE: I do one or the other steps above, but not both. I will use the clarifying shampoo if I know I have product build up on my hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Apply Godrej Nupur &amp; leave on for 3 hours minimum. (I left it on for 2 hours for my first treatment, but I will do an extra hour in the future).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***After 3 hours, rinse out Godrej Nupur (I spent a good amount of time rinsing the first time, but not enough as I still had a tiny trace left, but not enough to be noticable. I well do extra rinsing next time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** MOST IMPORTANTLY - After rinsing out the henna, I WILL USE A DEEP CONDITIONING TREATMENT MIX WITH OILS (Olive, Avocado, Sweet Almond, and essential oils of Rosemary and Lavender work wonders for my hair). I did notice slight drying after using Godrej Nupur, but a DC will take care of this. I used a leave in homemade conditioner after using the henna the first time, and my hair softness came right back. However, on my next henna treatment, I will do a DC with heat for 20-30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gave me exactly what I was seeking in using a henna tratment: CONDITIONING, THICKNESS and STRENGTH. The added auburn, blonde highlights over my few gray strands is an added bonus too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s my review. Hope it helps someone else. (BTW I just ordered a 12 pack...that&#x27;s how much I love it!!)</li>
            <li> This is a good item but you must understand it or do extensive research or watch Youtube to understand the product. Just because it is natural does not mean it will work without errors. I used it and my head with red like fire plus it makes your hair extremely DRY AND BREAK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must use this with indigo for a dark color too.</li>
            <li> I mixed cool water, then henna in to make a pudding-like paste. Then I added a few drops of lavender essential oil, and coconut conditioner. I covered it and let it sit for 8+ hours. Then i did a strand test the day after, leaving the mix in my hair for 4 hours. But my hair looks the same! Am i doing this wrong? Whatever, it has made my hair smell like sweet hay(?) with lots of shine, so 5 stars for the conditioning.. :)</li>
            <li> Not hard to wash out.  The color deposit is really good.  Use it in a two step process to color my hair a dark brown</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I am about to order my second package. This is used as a pre-wash as it detangles prior to washing. This is used once or twice a month as it depends on the growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it will turn gray strands red/orange but a second process of  other powders will reduce that color. If you do not have a head full of grey hair, it appears that it does not add color or not much to the rest of the hair as I guess it depends on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family says the color of the mixture looks like mud. Lavender or another oil is added to try to soften the scent of the powder. After the right consistency, Jojoba oil is also added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you make it into a paste, let it soak for 2-3 hours and then let it set on your head for 3-4 hours per manufacture&#x27;s directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warm water is used to make the paste and then the oils are added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you use gloves because it will stain your hands for about a week or so but your hands will eventually return to its normal color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the hair is being washed out, the water looks muddy but the water will turn clear after the paste is washed out of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will stain some clothes so wear a plastic cape as it can be messy as it depends on the consistency.  The consistency can be like ketchup but not hard and not liquidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A clean cool whip plastic bowl or some other plastic food bowl along with a wooden ice cream stick that you can purchase on Amazon, Walmart or your local scrapbooking store is used to make the mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I wash out the mixture, I add more powders to my hair as that is not necessary but something that I choose to do and then I wash and condition my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finish product is worth the trouble. Everyone needs a spa day so enjoy the experience and make your own spa day at home.</li>
            <li> I have been using this powder as my henna hair treatment for over a year now. I&#x27;ve tried others and this one is the easiest to work with. It also has the benefit of 8 other herb blends that my hair just loves. The package is easy to open without wasting any product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using henna for the last 3 years instead of commercial dyes.  The one thing I didn&#x27;t like was how long it took to get ready to use and all the stuff that needs to get mixed into the raw henna.  This product only takes 3-4 hours to \\&quot;cure\\&quot; instead of 12 and already has all the herbs mixed into the henna. It mixes easily and is easy to apply.  My hair came out very soft and a beautiful mahogony color ( I have black and lots of grey hair). I received many compliments on the color --unsolicited ! I highly recommend this product. If you have never used henna there are videos and websites out there showing how to use the stuff properly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product not expecting much, and I was still disappointed. The henna arrived fast, the day after ordering, and that was the best part of the purchase.  Important things to know -     1. The henna is not body art quality. I was hoping for cut some corners and got this knowing that, but still hoping. I mixed with black tea and lemon juice, plus a little sugar to help hold it together. I then left the henna on for 15 hours. Low, and behold. It didn&#x27;t stain the skin at all!    2. Not hair dying quality either. Okay, I figured that might happen. So I went ahead and mixed for dying my hair. I&#x27;m a natural red head, but my color has been faded by recent bleaching. My only hope was a little shine, maybe a little extra red to cover up the blonde. After another 15 hours, I washed my hair. Now my hair is dry and frazzled, (despite using plenty of oil and moisture masques) the same color it was before all this, and full of sand!  It&#x27;s pretty common for cheaper hennas to use sand as filler, but not usually this much.    3. This product is dyed green, and doesn&#x27;t smell like henna should. After the previously listed events, I&#x27;m wondering if that should have been my red flag. I doubt there is any actual henna leaf in there.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have ever used henna.  I did a lot of research, watched tons of youtube videos on how it&#x27;s done, and then decided I wanted to give it a try.  I am always looking for natural beauty products that don&#x27;t have harmful chemicals in them.  Actually, a lot of the henna powder I looked at had these nasty additives in there.  But, I saw this brand and decided to try it because of all the great reviews and also because it&#x27;s real henna, and no chemicals added.  I also like the fact that there are added herbs that contribute to healthy, shiny hair.  I actually wanted to start out doing a henna gloss to see how it would look on my brunette hair before doing anything more drastic.  I have to say that I am super pleased with the results!  All I did to make the gloss was add half a packet of this henna blend and one cup of hot water (from the tap) and mix it in a plastic bowl.  I let it sit for about an hour and a half, covered.  Then I added some lavender essential oil (a few drops) to help with the smell (it actually wasn&#x27;t too bad), and about a cup and a half of conditioner.  I mixed it up really, really good and then sectioned my hair off, then proceeded to apply.  It was a nice consistency- not runny and not too thick either.  I did mess up with one thing though.  The only gloves I had were the dish-washing gloves, which fit horribly, so I had to take them off in the middle of applying the henna gloss to my hair.  So, yes my hands did turn orange, like I had been eating Cheetos all day. :)  But, it&#x27;s already fading pretty good.  I did remember to put petroleum jelly around my hair line so that I wouldn&#x27;t walk around with an orange forehead.  I let the mixture sit in my hair (under a shower cap, wrapped in a towel) for almost an hour.  It was easy to rinse out.  My hair is super soft and so shiny!  And I love the red highlights that it brought out in my hair.  It&#x27;s not a drastic color change, but it&#x27;s still noticeable.  I will definitely do this again.  As a matter of fact, I am ordering more of this stuff right away!    Oh yes, my favorite thing about this product is the price!  It&#x27;s super cheap for a great quality product!    I meant to add that usually I don&#x27;t put conditioner on my scalp or on the top part of my hair, only on the lower ends because my fine hair gets oily fast when I do.  But, I did put this henna gloss thru out all of my hair, even on the scalp, and it didn&#x27;t make my hair greasy at all.  I just did this gloss yesterday and my hair is still so soft and shiny, and not a bit oily. I am so happy that I made the decision to purchase this henna!    ***UPDATE May 31st***  I decided to try applying this henna the regular way instead of doing another gloss.  I&#x27;m glad I did because I love the color.  Again, it&#x27;s not super drastic, but it is definitely more noticeable than doing the gloss.  I could see more red in my hair and it&#x27;s a deeper color.  This is the 3rd day after the application, and the color hasn&#x27;t really changed.  All I did was to mix half the bag of henna mixture and enough hot water to make a thick paste (yogurt consistency).  I didn&#x27;t add any acidic ingredient such as lemon juice or anything.  I wanted to give it a try without it because I heard that can be drying to your hair.  After letting it sit for 2 hours, I applied the paste to my hair, put a shower cap on and then wrapped the towel around my shower capped hair.  I let it sit for 4 hours, which seems like it would be a pain, but it wasn&#x27;t.  I had time to give my self a manicure and play around on the computer.  After I rinsed my hair (without shampoo or conditioner), I let it dry naturally.  The color is so beautiful!  And it is still shiny and thick! It turned out very nice without having to add lemon juice or apple cider vinegar.  I found out that it&#x27;s not as messy doing it this way than when I did the gloss.  When I did the gloss, since it&#x27;s more slippery with the conditioner, I made a mess!  This time I didn&#x27;t even splatterany henna anywhere!  An added plus, I guess. :)  I love it so much and I will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> With only one use this product left my 4b type curly hair shiny and smooth, I evenly mixed it with [[ASIN:B000RLBTMA Jamila Henna Powder 3.5oz (100g)]] for the added ingredients and followed Curly Nikki&#x27;s demo- (...) and the results are very pleasing- the 17hrs under the cap makes it effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blown away by how great this product is, and even more amazed that it comes at such a great price. I&#x27;ve been using henna for a few years now. I have tried several cheap brands, but most of them were too weak, had chemical additives in them, or weren&#x27;t ground finely enough. For a while, I&#x27;d been using only a brand from another site that certifies the lawsone content of their henna. Their henna is awesome, but so expensive, especially with shipping. I came here to try to find a cheaper substitute. I found a few, but I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with the results. They were *ok*, but nothing special. I missed that beautiful, vibrant, strong red was used to getting. Found this brand and figured at this price, what the heck, I&#x27;ll try it. I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting too much. Wow! Not only does it dye as nicely as the expensive stuff AND it&#x27;s insanely cheap, but it&#x27;s FASTER. The stuff I was using needed to sit for several hours at a minimum. This was ready in 3. Not only that, but it dyed my hair up in 2.5 hours rather than the usually 4-5 hours. I have about 30-40% gray and this covered it perfectly. As a bonus, this also conditioned my hair wonderfully. I find the amount to be very generous too. After ordering this again, I decided to leave a review. I cannot praise this product enough. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many, many different types and brands of henna. Power, cream, essence, you name it. My purpose is to color my gray hair as well as moisturize it. I used to buy henna from bulk henna sellers or some other popular brands... I decided to try this one after reading the reviews and it&#x27;s really good. It gives the best coverage for my gray hair (among powders) and I just rinsed off henna paste but I can already feel my hair got smoother. The best part is, it doesn&#x27;t smell like other power products. In general it is extremely difficult to deal with the smell of any power henna, not only that, the smell also stays in your hair and sculp for more than a month. But this one, I can&#x27;t really smell any strong scent. For me I use either orange juice or lemon juice, soak for more than 5 hours, apply the paste to hair and let it stay over night. If you&#x27;re looking for nice henna with quality, you would want to try Nupur.</li>
            <li> Really good hair color.</li>
            <li> I used to dye my partially gray hair with commercial dye and it starting getting really thin, so I gave henna a try.  I have used the Light Mountain brand and this one.  Both worked quite well at getting the gray out, and my hair seems thicker already.  Since this particular brand does not include any instructions and doesn&#x27;t come with gloves or a cap (the reason for only 4 stars), I&#x27;m including my advice from the other brands:  -Do not use any metal when mixing or dyeing, and be sure to remove jewelry.    -Mix whole package with 2 cups hot water, or 1 cup hot water and 1 cup hot black coffee (I do this to avoid orange tones).  -Let mixture sit in bowl for 2-3 hours.    -Shampoo your hair, do not condition.  Towel dry.  -Apply henna to hair with gloves on, put plastic cap over hair to stop any drips, and blow dry cap intermittently.  -Rinse henna out completely after 3-4 hours.  Do not use shampoo or conditioner.  So far, the henna has given me dark copper-red highlights over the grays and roots.  I imagine that once I cut off my commercially dyed black ends it will look more even.  Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Loved it.  I will be purchasing and using again.  Seemed to have made my hair stronger.  I actually got 3 uses from this pouch.  I made up the entire batch and divided into 3 thicker than normal applications (froze 2 of them in some plastic wrap) and in this way it lasted me for 3 uses so pretty much a full year&#x27;s worth of Henna for a great price.  I have rather long thick hair and really got good use of this</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS FORMULA!!!    I henna&#x27;d for the first time last weekend. I LOVED IT!!!! I was hesitant to henna because I heard stories about it making your hair bright red or loosening your curl pattern.  I don&#x27;t want that at all. It did darken my hair to a very soft black. My hair is naturally dark brown. This henna made my curls soooooo soft and strong! It may have made my strands thicker, I can&#x27;t really tell. But I do know that I am beyond satisfied with the results. This formula is very conditioning and seems to fortify your hair with nutrients. My hair was really shiny without any type of oil. It also really soothed my itchy scalp.    I add water to the powder and let it sit for about 4-5 hours in a plastic bowl. Then when I&#x27;m ready to apply it, I mix in 3 eggs. My natural, fine 4a/b pen spring coils love protein. I also mixed in a TBS of Avocado oil and some essential oils. I apply it to washed, and clarified, towel dried hair and left it on for 4 hours. Next time I may leave it on longer. It is a bit messy (next time I&#x27;ll use less water) but it&#x27;s not that bad at all. It&#x27;s soooo worth it!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s little bit of work.  And I forgot to wear gloves on, so my hands got all orange for a while.  And my hair was little red at first,  but now it&#x27;s less red after few weeks.     One thing I love about this is that my hair is now very smooth without a lot of hair product.  My hair was damaged and very dry because of permanent wave I got few months ago.  Now, it&#x27;s all better.</li>
            <li> this product is the greatest henna ive used so far. ive always bought my henna from mehandi and this henna is super for the price and it leaves my hair shiny and smelling great with super red colors. i give this henna five stars for price, quality and best results overall.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I&#x27;d ever personally dyed my hair.  It definitely works and you certainly can&#x27;t beat the price.  But, I highly recommend adding some sort of oil: moroccan, avocado, coconut or even an egg apparently to the mix before putting on your hair.  It dried out my hair pretty good.  But, the second time I did it and added more moisturizer, it was fine and it lasted 5-6 weeks.  It&#x27;s messy, so be ready!</li>
            <li> This is the best henna I have tried. I mix it with equal part of indigo and a tbsp of Amla and my hair has never looked as healthy and shiny. I would not try another brand. This is the best by far.</li>
            <li> Love this product so much. I have been using it for a while and it makes my hair so thick, shiny and bouncy! Easy to apply with no mess! Great, great product. One of the best henna I have tried by far!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this stuff. I was a first time user and this stuff was dummy proof.  I let sit with lemon juice over night and left it in my hair for about 5 hrs. I rinsed it with conditioner then left in a conditioning treatment for 20 mins. I jumped in the shower and rinsed with out adding anuthing else and then styled as usual.  I even froze the leftover and used it later on to put some streaks in my sisters hair.  I ordered two more which should be on their way. P.S. you can find many tutorials on you tube!  ;)</li>
            <li> So gals n guys here is my experience...I am so excited!!!.After doing a month of research on henna from wherever possible, I was still just not into it,so many questions brewing in my mind everyday seemed like solving the never ending mysteries of hennaland. Then finally I decided to give it a go.   I am an Asian with straight fine black hair which give a brownish tint in the sun, I am having many white hair showing up though I am in my mid twenties (never ever used any chemicals/perms/hot treatments on my hair)which looked ugly. My hair are very long, upto my tailbone so I was wondering how much henna to use. This is the stuff which I collected first to prepare for my battle :)  -Nupur mehandi 150 mg/one pack  -Hair accessories kit (very very useful and cost-effective, available on amazon, I was so excited that I gave my first review of life for that too).The kit had a cap-soft and very fit for average sized head and had ties, a paint brush, a plastic spatula/mixer, a dark cape-really really helped, pair of disposable gloves.  -Coconut oil  -Lavender oil (100% pure, got from Amazon)  -Yoghurt  -warm-hot water  -Plastic container/bowl  -Small plastic sheet (I used the bubble wrap and plastic sheet which is found inside the Amazon shipments sometimes :)  -Vaseline (100% pure petroleum jelly), if applied on forehead, ears and neck-front and back, henna will not stain any part  -Conditioner (I used Pantene conditioning shampoo though, the one which claims to protect dye color)    Here are the steps which I followed,  First I rapidly flipped through the you tube videos again (is this a sign of obsessive-compulsive disorder) just to make sure that I am not missing any relevant detail. Then I emptied approximately half the pack of nupur mehandi in the plastic container and slowly poured some water into it. You need to adding water slowly in small quantities and mixing it with henna, do not overdo with water since we just require it to be like a thick paste. I also added 10-15 drops of lavender oil, 3 big scoops of youghurt,  15-20 drops of coconut oil and mixed everything well. The mixture was neither thick nor runny. You can check the consistency by taking it a plastic spoon and then tilting the spoon. It should very very slowly trickle down like thick yoghurt. After thoroughly mixing, I kept a small piece of white paper on the dough/mixture, so that in the morning I could check its colour and guess what it would look like on my hair. I didn&#x27;t want to do a strand test. Then I covered the container with plastic sheet and bubble wrap securely and kept it in a cardboard box (just to keep henna little warm). I was so excited to start applying it that was not able to sleep well, but had to wait for around 8 hours. In the morning I removed the sheet and bubble wrap and looked at the paper-it was kind of orangish-actually don&#x27;t know how it helped :). Throughout this process, I stood in front of the huge mirror (which is obvious anyways)I wrapped the cape snugly around my shoulders (if you have this accessories kit, you need not worry about looking for old shirts and towels), applied Vaseline on my forehead, ears, cheeks, neck), added very little water to the henna mixture since it looked little more thicker and mixed it again, wore gloves and started applying henna on my hair with the brush. I read that we need to take small strands of hair and apply henna separately, but then I realized that it is not practically being possible for my extra-long hair. So I just started from the middle, applying henna to the hair roots first, right side then left side and then back and top of my head. The hair started becoming thicker with henna and my heart was pumping fast-I was actually applying henna finally! Rest of the mixture I applied directly with gloves since I had to cover the whole length of hair-brush was helpful for the roots only. I smeared all the remaining henna on full length and rubbed some on my whole head again with gloved fingers. The I twisted all my hair together in sort of a bun and was just going to apply a clip when I realized that the mass of my matted medusa hair was not moving an inch anyways, it was just lying on the top of my head like a globule so I kept the clip aside and wore the cap (Underneath this pretty blue cap, I also wore one of my old shower caps).   Now I was little worried because the whole process was NOT MESSY AT ALL, and that was the last thing I expected. The henna didn&#x27;t dripped anywhere, only the gloves were soiled. I washed my face and carried out with my routine work for 4 hours. Then with trembling hands (I was anxious how will my hair turn out) I removed the caps, the henna was almost dry, I hopped in the shower and started rinsing thoroughly. I had already diluted a very generous amount of shampoo and warm-hot water. Then I conditioned my hair for around 15 minutes and rinsed. RINSE RINSE RINSE. This is very important,do not use hot water for rinsing hair, warm water is best. Then I hopped out of the shower, towel dried my hair and saw one or two little knotty masses of hair which I entangled with little coconut oil. I gently combed through the length of my hair and it went so smoothly.The comb was just slipping through my hair, they were so soft! After they dried a bit I looked at the sparse white hair which I had, they have turned orangish-goldenish, my hair are not frizzy as they used to be after being washed and dried. They are super-clean, deep conditioned, silky and smooth. I cannot wait to see the final henna color, the color to which it will settle finally will show up in 2-3 days (though I know it would be black with chestnut reddish sheen in sun with very few coppery-auburn highlights).   So this is my henna experience- I hope it would help some of the newbies like me. All the previous nupur reviews were really useful for me! I will update in case of any surprising or better results than expected :)IT WAS FUN!</li>
            <li> I still have a little stockpile of Jamila Henna, but was interested in this due to the other herbs and the price point, of course. I have to say I&#x27;m a little dissapointed. My hair feels nice-soft texture smooth hair shaft instead of coarse, after 4 hours of henna and an hour of conditioning with a homemade, oat milk-lecithin-ricebran oil-safflower oil-soy wax-glycerin-conditioner. I braid my hair to ensure a wave pattern and not a ball of frizz and did not find a lot of shedding while running my hands through my hair which tends to occur when my hair hasn&#x27;t been getting its henna strengthening in a while, which it hadn&#x27;t. However, whenever I have excess henna after making a mix I make a henna shampoo that lasts about two weeks just plopping henna in a lot of water a little coco-glucoside and even less grapfruit seed extract. Even though it may do nothing, I figure its a nice clarifying shampoo and the henna having time to cure even more will at least be a nice treatment for my scalp. What happened this time when I made my shampoo I saw a load of sand settle to the botton. No bueno. Love the price, but do I love it after finding out I&#x27;ve paid for filler? I will not fret though. To cut the sandiness and to relieve my hair more of the brittle feeling I may get after usisng pure henna I will mix this with even parts some of the Jamila Henna I have and all will be good after that. It will also make the Jamila last longer and cut the price of that so I may continue buying both of them and then using them together. I usually use half a pack of Jamila or about a third of this pack for my between ear and chin length hair (think a long pixie when straight) So if I mix the two I will haave about 4 uses for a pretty good price. Or i may just buy everything piece by piece as I liked the effect and just have to bite the bullet. Just terribly dissapointed at finding that much sand in this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown, curly, and a little bit grey.  I&#x27;ve dyed my hair with typical commercial dyes before, and they never color the greys, make my head itch, and make too many hairs fall out.  This product completely covered greys!  I only used half the bag (shoulder-length hair) and mixed it in water and lemon juice until it was a yogurt consistency for 3.5 hours, in a warm (not hot) place.  I used a glass bowl, which came clean easily with water when I was done.  I washed my hair without conditioning, and let it dry, then pasted the henna goop to my head.  It was a little drippy, you need to wrap your head in saran wrap, and then in a towel.  You also want to put an old towel or something on the floor.  I left the product on for 4 hours, then rinsed it.  The henna paste kept dripping, so keep a paper towel handy, and wear old clothes.  It took forever to rinse out in the shower, and made my hair dry, so you might want to use a conditioning treatment or oil afterwards.  My hair looks great!  It is a richer brown with shimmering copper highlights.  Very pretty.  It&#x27;s thicker as well, and the curls have more body.  If it wasn&#x27;t so messy I would give it 4 stars.  I&#x27;ll definitely use this again.  The free ebook at [...] is a great resource for directions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good as the others say even with all of the downsides. I also got a plastic condiment squeeze bottle for mixing and applying.</li>
            <li> This was my first henna treatment and I was very pleased with the results. I did the treatment about a month ago and have washed my hair many times and the color is still very strong. My hair is much shinier. I plan to order more, and incorporate this into my regular hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd order of this Henna.  It practically feeds my hair with good stuff.  My hair is so soft after I use it.  I don;t use it alone, I follow up with Indigo and the Henna is a good base to help the Indigo set.  The combo makes my hair appear super thick.  I will continue to use this Henna because to me it&#x27;s the best.  Ultra fine powder no twigs at all no sifting necessary.</li>
            <li> I noticed that all the bad reviews were by people who didn&#x27;t know what they were getting into, so let me first say:    1. It&#x27;s henna. Depending on your natural hair color, henna WILL make your hair red/orange. It&#x27;s a good idea to test the color on some hair from your hair brush before coloring your whole head, as it is permanent.  2. It&#x27;s henna. It&#x27;s messy and a little time consuming to use. Unless you want orange hands, use gloves.     I hadn&#x27;t used henna on my hair in years, but I had an idea of what I was getting into. I mixed up the whole package and had more than enough for my hair which reaches to my mid-back and is of average thickness but quite fine. Compared with the hennas I had used in the past, I found the texture of the Nupur Mehendi really pleasant, sort of slippery (maybe because of the aloe?) and not nearly as gritty. It also washed out really easily.     Being slightly impatient and impulsive, I took a chance and didn&#x27;t test the color, but fortunately it came out great; I LOVE it! My natural color is a slightly mousey dark blond/light-medium brown, and it came out quite a bit darker with tons of reddish and auburn highlights. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to see it in natural daylight yet, but inside it almost has some purplish tones to it. Gorgeous! After I washed the henna out, massaged in just a little coconut oil, though it didn&#x27;t feel like the henna had dried it out at all.      I also put a couple of streaks in my daughter&#x27;s light blond hair and it came out REALLY orange. (Just to let you know what it will do to light colored hair... and for the first time I am glad my hair has gotten darker over the years!)    I think I am officially hooked on henna and will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> First, let me tell you that I was highly skeptical with this whole henna business. I didn&#x27;t buy into the hype but I&#x27;m glad I tried this out!    For those new to henna, it WORKS fantastically without breaking the bank. This was my first time and my dreadlocks, which were shedding, breaking and all around unhappy, came out beautifully tinted and EXTREMELY strong. My shedding and breaking stopped after 2 days and the color turns into a deeper burgundy every day! My major selling point is that it&#x27;s easy to rinse out and doesn&#x27;t clog up your locs at all! Yes, the rinsing takes time, but I made a day of it and the results speak for themselves!    For African American women who have damaged hair, especially from dry, arid climates, you&#x27;d be doing yourself a disservice not getting a couple of bags and trying it out!!! Thanks, Godrej!</li>
            <li> I am completely new at coloring my hair with henna.  I am Asian with lightblack hair.  I was hoping for a darker, silky black hair like many Indian women.  The package arrived promptly. It simply asked you to mix the powder with water and add any oil if you wish - no quantity measurements at all.  I have long hair, so I just used the entire bag.  If you have short hair, you probably don&#x27;t need that much.      The actual application of henna to the hair can be a little messy, as the paste is dark brown.  Nevertheless, as long as you are careful and have a wet paper towel.    The color turned out lighter than I expected, but it&#x27;s very beautiful.  It&#x27;s a rich dark chocolate color with burgundy highlights.  After 2 weeks or so, the burgundy highlights turned more brown.  It&#x27;s very natural and I love the complex, rich color.     The only disappointment was that my hair didn&#x27;t become silky.  I mixed the henna with water, with just a bit of coconut oil.  My hair turned out dry. I had to use more coconut oil later during the week to silken the hair. I would highly recommend people take reviewer S. Waller&#x27;s protocol:   - wash hair, damp dry  - add eggs and lots of essential oil to the henna paste    Overall, I am happy with the purchase &amp; the result.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will purchase it again as long as the quality is maintained.  I used this product to touchup the gray re-growth of my locs.  To deepen the color of my locs, I had been using Bijen powdered hair dye and had become sensitive to the product. I had developed itching and an adult cradle cap.  I did my internet research and decided to go natural.    I chose this product because of the Amazon reviews.  Because the product included other herbs in addition to pure henna, I expected a brownish-red color on my gray hairs.  I followed the instructions to the letter using only water to mix with the powder.  I let the paste sit 2 hours at room temperature in a covered plastic bowl before applying it to the untwisted portion of my locs.  I let the paste sit for 4.5 hours with my head covered in plastic wrap.  I rinsed until the water ran clear. After rinsing, I looked in the mirrow and was shocked to see that my gray hair was a flaming orange color!  Not reddish but orange.    The color changed over a 2 day period to a subtler red but I knew that I was definitely going to need to use indigo to create a dark brown or black color.  I mixed the indigo with water, applied to my red new growth only, let it sit for 1 hour and then rinsed until the water was clear.  Fantastic results - total coverage of gray and beautiful black color. If you have black or dark brown locs and need gray coverage, purchase this product along with body art quality indigo.  BTW - no more itchy scalp and adult cradle cap!</li>
            <li> I love this blend of herbs and henna. It covers my gray and makes my hair shinny and soft. I will never go back to hair color that you buy in the store again. My hair was starting to thin and was dry. Now that I use Nupur 9 herbs blend I loose less hair and it feels so good!</li>
            <li> well im likin this powder it made some of my hair a reddish tint and it looks really pretty in the sunlight!  wish they had a really  big jug of it so that i wouldnt have to rebuy it so much that would be wonderful!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the results from putting this henna in my hair. I&#x27;m African American and my hair is naturally light to medium brown. I started getting gray hairs but did not want to put toxic hair color on my hair. I did research on henna and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m so glad I did. The first days of the henna, my hair was an red Irish Setter color (like the dog breed) which didn&#x27;t bother me as it wasn&#x27;t freakish looking - just a bit trendy, in my opinion. As the henna oxidized, it began to look more natural. Within two weeks and a few shampoos later, my hair is a beautiful reddish brown color and with auburn highlights where the grays used to be. I love my hair again! Also, my hair follicles are smoother and my hair has a nice sheen to it. I am a henna convert and will be using this brand of henna for as long as they manufacture it.</li>
            <li> I noticed after using this product that there&#x27;s less hair in my bathtub.  The powder is drying so I mix it with a small amount of Tresemme silicone-free conditioner before I apply to my hair.  I also use a homemade olive oil conditioner immediately afterwards to restore some moisture.  The powder does not list henna as an ingredient but it does dye the hair reddish brown (maybe it&#x27;s the hibiscus powder).  In addition to its conditioning properties, I use mehendi powder between my henna applications to maintain my color.</li>
            <li> Powerful Product! I recently bought this from a local Indian grocer and was skeptical to try it at first but after reading all the incredible reviews about Nupur Mehendi, I decided to try it to start off my natural hair journey. Results? Phenomenal!!! My hair has NEVER, EVER felt soft or silky in my entire life. Nupur Mehendi did the trick for me. I love that I can use this like, every month to condition my hair (goodbye to chemical relaxers). Best of all, it&#x27;s all natural. Hard to say no to that. A dream come true for my hair. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Soooo I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of this but my hair loves it! I mixed in jojoba oil and DPR+11 conditioner and sahara clay! My hair was soooo soft during and aftewards...even before I conditioned my hair afterwards. Even still I used more DPR+11 to condition my hair afterwards. It was kind of awesome. My hair is more like a 4b/4c but I was able to comb straight through my hair without detangling really.   As for the color, my hair is already black. I was in it for the nutrients. A little color wouldve been nice though lol. I will still use/buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s true. I&#x27;m one of those girls who faithfully sticks by natural hair and who is always trying to find ways to boost the health and shine of my hair, rather than blasting it with chemical treatments and colors. Approaching my near 30s, I had never permed, relaxed, or colored my hair (hard to believe, right?) because I have what my stylists have called \\&quot;good hair.\\&quot; Of course, we all like to add a little shine and snazz up our color from time, as was quickly becoming the case with myself. I began to research natural hair coloring methods and came across henna coloring, which seemed too good to be true: a completely natural herbal mixture that could subtly color and also enhance the texture of my hair. No way! I decided to give in, hoping I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked after that first treatment. The results were unbelievable: my dullish dark brown hair had hints of auburn and a deep reddish tone and my hair that can be \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; was relaxed and full of shine, feeling great to the touch (and easier to style too). Best of all was that the color of my hair looked very natural--I got compliments the next day in the office about how great it looked all around and no one recoiled at it looking radically different. Needless to say, I re-hennaed my hair recently and I plan to stick with this product for as long as they produce it.    What some might find difficult about the product (that I had no problems with, even as a 1st time henna user), is mixing it up. This is not one of those squeeze out of a bottle chemical treatments, but part of the fun of henna is customizing your own mix, which will result in some different results overall.     I mixed in the following to mine and let it set overnight in the fridge for proper dye release:  -lemon juice  -orange juice  -Tazo passion tea  -Aussie moist conditioner    The mixture actually smelled really nice and helped to make it soothing to have the it on my head for two hours, wrapped under saran wrap and a plastic bag. After the first few days of washing, my color leveled out to a nice auburn color that gleamed in the sun. I would caution henna users to look for a product such as this one that is fully herbal and does not have any chemical additives. Some \\&quot;henna\\&quot; products that are parading around the internet don&#x27;t have much really in the way of actual henna and may not be best for your hair. This size product allows for approximately 3 henna treatments (I have almost shoulder-length hair). Thus, henna is even more affordable than other home hair treatments as well as better for hair health. As for this natural chick, I&#x27;m hooked on henna if you can&#x27;t tell, and I can&#x27;t wait to see what develops next.</li>
            <li> it is okay but i notice it is past expiration date, it was sold in other country. I tried explain to seller that it is expired but seller said it still good. I still would not order henna because it might have pdd i am too spektic and scared. It maybe changing color. You really don&#x27;t need 4 it to strengten your hair, just do other protein</li>
            <li> I kept this in my hair for about 4 hours and my hair came out with a beautiful rich color and felt thick and healthy.  I will update this review after 3 months of monthly applications.</li>
            <li> I am a complete dunce when it comes to being able to style my hair.  Besides throwing my hair into a bun or ponytail, I&#x27;m pretty clueless.  I&#x27;ve never been one to use hair products, hair irons, dyes, etc.  (I used to have a stylist put highlights in, but I&#x27;ve become sensitive to chemical hair dyes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had wanted to try henna for the last couple years.  I didn&#x27;t really want it for the color, but for the benefits of making my hair look amazing.  However, I shied away as it seemed too exotic and some people made it sound like it would be difficult to use.  I also scared that it might turn out terribly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I just became overwhelmingly fed up with my hair.  It was dull, damaged, thin and had some white streaks.  It was aging me.  I needed something that would add shine and color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I had read countless reviews stating that this stuff adds amazing shine, I thought that it was a slight exaggeration.  I was amazed to find that it&#x27;s not.  It adds SO much shine that it&#x27;s crazy.  It took years off of my hair.  Even the damaged ends appeared to look healthy and shiny.  (I still did get it cut though!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also shocked at how EASY it is to use.  I watched a couple videos on YouTube, and then decided to mix it with coffee, a natural conditioner and coconut oil.  I waited a few hours, applied it with my bare hands (and it didn&#x27;t stain!) and allowed it to remain in my hair while I cleaned the kitchen and watched an old 1970&#x27;s chick flick.  Washing it out was a little time consuming, but it wasn&#x27;t bad at all.  I was expecting the process to be quite a bit messier than it actually was.  It was actually kind of fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little surprised about how red the henna made my hair.  My natural color is really dark.  It&#x27;s not quite black, but it&#x27;s close.  While it didn&#x27;t lighten my hair, it did add definite red highlights to it that were even more apparent in the sun.  Since I don&#x27;t have a skin tone that compliments red hair, I did do a second application with this product mixed with [[ASIN:B00312PRU2 100 Grams Bag of Natural Indigo Powder (wasma in Arabic and Urdu) Indigofera Tinctoria New Crop]]  That gave the exact color that I was looking for - which was something that was a little deeper than my natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My natural texture is fine, curly, dry and breaks easily.  It&#x27;s also on the thin side.  I&#x27;m happy to report that this didn&#x27;t damage or dry my hair out AT ALL.  I&#x27;m so happy that I tried it!air, I did do a second application with this product mixed with [[ASIN:B00312PRU2 100 Grams Bag of Natural Indigo Powder (wasma in Arabic and Urdu) Indigofera Tinctoria New Crop]]  That gave the exact color that I was looking for - which was something that was a little deeper than my natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My natural texture is fine, curly, dry and breaks easily.

            <li> I am in love with this henna since I started using it. I have straight-ish black fine hair and I use this henna for its amazing nourishing properties. My hair does not get colored easily neither am I fond of coloring my hair (I love my dark black hair) and this henna does the job. It does not color my hair but makes my hair so soft and shiny and soothes my itchy scalp too. The combination of 9 herbs makes it stand out from other hennas available in the market. Those who are familiar with those other herbs will know how good they are for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix a 60g pack with warm tea and leave it overnight. Before applying it to my hair I mix some plain yogurt and an egg. The application process can be a bit messy initially but once you figure out the best way to do it, it gets much easier. Just make sure you are wearing an old t-shirt as it can stain your clothes, skin, even jewelry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let the henna sit on my hair for 4-5 hours covered with a plastic grocery bag, then rinse it off till the water runs clear. I do not shampoo or condition my hair and rinsing. I let my hair air dry and once dried I do a hot oil treatment (combination of coconut, olive, almond and castor oil) and leave the oil overnight. Next day after I shampoo and condition, and my hair feels like the best thing in the world!! I use this henna treatment once a month...</li>
            <li> Seldom leave reviews, but something like bright orange hair needs a cautionary note. In my younger years I used henna frequently and with good results on my naturally brown/auburn hair. I somehow got away from it and used the more usual chemical products for years until I stumbled upon this product and all its great reviews. Ordered some and followed directions, especially being sure to cover the parts of my hair that are now grey, mostly at top and sides surrounding my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m VERY glad I left it on for only half the recommended time! My result was exactly as expected on the hair that is still my natural color--the same lovely red highlights and body I remember from long ago. BUT, over the grey it is a brilliant, day-glo orange! I shampooed and scrubbed that area like crazy with no softening at all of this garish orange color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My regular hairstyle would expose the orange areas, but fortunately I can style my hair to come forward--bangs, etc--and hide it. If I could not, I would be forced to chemically dye the grey areas--it&#x27;s that clown-like, head-spinning, eye-popping orange! I may have to resort to that anyway if it doesn&#x27;t settle down in a few shampoos. As it is, I&#x27;m going to have to remember not to run my fingers through my hair, tuck it behind an ear, or stand in the wind for a while. It absolutely SCREAMS orange. Wish I had a camera handy: You&#x27;d all have a great laugh at my expense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, be advised: Henna is wonderful stuff, but if your hair is light or grey, give this product the full patch test. Don&#x27;t, don&#x27;t, don&#x27;t assume the color will be OK because of all these positive reviews.</li>
            <li> UPDATE 2/22/15: I really feel bad for taking 3 years to update this review, but I&#x27;ve totally changed the way I&#x27;ve used this henna in terms of the preparation. My original review works very well, but is very time consuming, and as you can tell...it&#x27;s filled with newbie flaws. Gorej Nupur Mehendi Powder is the only henna I&#x27;ve ever used, and it has helped me grow my hair 4 inches (with regular trimming, as well as a really cute cut about a year ago), as well as overall increased thickness and hair health. The way I prep my henna is as follows: 1 package of henna, 1 can of coconut milk  (make sure it&#x27;s coconut milk that DOES NOT contain other additives such as any type of sugar or other fillers. The only ingredients should be coconut and water) and a tbsp or two of liquid coconut oil. I add the coconut oil after the henna and coconut milk have sat in a warm place for about 6 hours. I add the coconut oil to the mixture and mix it well and apply it to my hair. Usually my hair&#x27;s dry, but I&#x27;ve applied it to wet hair also and the results are the same. I leave it in anywhere from 3 to 6 hours. It rinses SO MUCH easier than the fiasco I experienced in my review below, and once the water runs clear, I co-wash (use conditioner instead of shampoo) about 3 times, rinse and towel dry. Unlike my review below, I don&#x27;t mix the henna with the indigo powder, as I&#x27;ve noticed that the color doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long. So after I&#x27;m done with my henna application, I follow up with the indigo just on my roots to cover the gray (which after the henna application is bright orange), leave it on for 1 hour, rinse, co-wash, rinse and it comes out perfect. When it&#x27;s all said and done, my hair is so soft and manageable and PRETTY! NOW FOR MY ORIGINAL REVIEW: This was my first time using Henna, and for the most part, I love it! I&#x27;m African American with relaxed hair, and I&#x27;m trying to improve the health of my hair. Seeing as I relax and usually use chemicals to color my hair (cover the gray), I decided that I can at least stop using chemicals for color (and stretch my relaxers). I love the way this Henna colored my hair, and the 9 herbs I believe is an added benefit! Here is the way I prepared and applied my Henna:&lt;br /&gt;Thursday evening, I steeped 5 bags of Earl Gray Tea in about 2 cups of water. I then boiled about a half cup of red wine and added it to the water. I put it in the fridge, and let it cool down to luke warm. I then emptied about 1/2 of the contents of the Henna into a plastic bowl and added enough of the tea/wine mixture to get it to a pudding consistency. I whisked it until it was smooth, covered it with plastic wrap (pushed down into the container to sit directly on the henna so there is no air/henna contact) and then placed the cover on the container. My boyfriend likes to keep the apartment somewhat cool, so I needed to create a warm environment to store my Henna. I went into the wash room which is not as cool as the rest of the apartment, buried my container in the clothes basket, and turned on the dryer for about 1/2 and hour to warm up the room. I then left the container to &#x27;marinate&#x27; for about 24 hours. You don&#x27;t have to leave it for that long, but I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it until I got home from work Friday evening.&lt;br /&gt;When I woke up Friday morning, I was anxious to see if I&#x27;d made my mixture correctly, so I checked on it and it was brown so I knew I was on the right track. I put a dab of henna on my palm (I read on many henna websites that this was recommended to check to see if the dye released correctly), re-covered the henna, and placed it back in the clothes basket. After about 5 minutes I rinsed it off and my my skin was nicely orange where the henna had sat. Yay! If I wanted to, I could have actually used it then. Unfortunately, I had to go to work, so I left it until I got home that evening. (and the whole time I was at work, I hoped that it wouldn&#x27;t have been left for too long and it started losing the color! I&#x27;m a newbieat this so I wasn&#x27;t sure what would happen...)&lt;br /&gt;When I got home, I ran to my waiting henna, unwrapped it, and it looked great, so that was a relief! I got the indigo,  [[ASIN:B004IUN7JO 100g Pure USAWHR Indigo Powder Indigoferra Tinctoria To dye Hair Black Naturaly NO PPD]] ,emptied about 1/3 of the packet in a separate plastic container, mixed that with enough water to create a pudding like consistency, and let it sit for about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;My goal was to color my grays, which was mainly on my front edges. I had a few flecks of gray on my roots all over my head, but from ear to ear around the front half of my head was about 1/2 gray and half natural color. If I wore my hair back, I looked like I had a grayish halo. Yay me. Sooo....&lt;br /&gt;After I let the indigo sit for about 10 minutes, I added about 1 tablespoon of the indigo to my henna mixture, and about 1 tablespoon of my henna mixture to my indigo. The goal was to add the indigo with a little bit of henna (darker mixture) to my edges and my roots (I didn&#x27;t want an orange halo), and the henna with a little bit of indigo (lighter mixture) to the rest of my head, hoping that my edges would be about the same color of the rest of my head in the end. I then added about 1 tablespoon of paprika and 2 tablespoons of honey to the lighter henna mixture. I applied the indigo heavy mixture to my edges, and sectioned my hair and applied it to my roots. I then got the henna heavy mixture and applied it to the rest of my hair. It took a bit of extra time to do the separate applications, but I knew what I wanted and was willing to spend a bit of extra time to achieve it. I didn&#x27;t actually time the application, but I figure somewhere around 40-45 minutes. It was my first time applying it, so I figure the next time might be a bit quicker.&lt;br /&gt;After I completed applying the mixtures, I wrapped my hair in saran wrap, covered it with a plastic shower cap, and also about an hour in, I covered the plastic cap with a hot wet towel. And planned to let it stew for about 4 hours. Mind you, because my boyfriend and I decided to stop and get a drink and a bit to eat, I got home about 8:00. By the time I finished applying the henna, it was about 9 PM. Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;About 2 1/2 hours in, I was so tired I decided to wash it out knowing that if I wasn&#x27;t happy with the color, I could re-apply it in a couple days. I was content in just getting the benefits of a healthy henna treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I rinsed my hair and was very happy that the water ran clear in about 5 minutes. I then washed my hair 3 or 4 times and was a bit dismayed because my hair felt very hard. Very, very hard...which I expected, but was still not used to.&lt;br /&gt;I towel dried my hair, added a mixture of [[ASIN:B00128WK4I Kinky Curly Knot Today Conditioner, 8 oz]], Honey, and Olive Oil, wrapped my hair in saran wrap, covered it in a silk wrap, and went to bed to let it deep condition.&lt;br /&gt;I woke this morning and rinsed my hair, and it was still hard. Annoyed.&lt;br /&gt;I washed it 2 times, added more conditioner and let it sit for about 10 minutes. I rinsed it out, and it felt a little bit better. A very little bit. It was very difficult combing out my hair, but remember reading somewhere that once you dry your hair, it will feel better. Actually, as I was combing out my very hard and knotted hair, I was contemplating if all of this was worth it. Combing tangles out of your hair is difficult enough...but when you have to do it when it&#x27;s as hard as straw was just disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;In saying that, after I got the knots out and I blew my hair dry, it felt and looked better than I ever remember it feeling before. And, the color came out perfect!! I didn&#x27;t have to leave it in for the 4 hours I&#x27;d planned. 2 1/2 hours worked just fine! My roots, edges and the rest of my hair is a nice dark brown/burgundy color. Exactly what I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this Henna the 5 stars it deserves because my hair feels soooo good, and it looks just a fabulous. Soft, shiny, with a nice dense rich color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use this again, as it did exactly what everyone said it should do. Right down to making my hair feel hard like straw until it dries. And from what I&#x27;ve read, it might feel that way for the next couple of days (if I decide to wash it, it might have the same straw feeling until it dries). My mission now is to do more research on how I can get the knots out a bit better and easier. Anyway, I highly recommend this Henna. And if anyone can suggest how my hair can be a bit more tame when I rinse and wash it right after my application, please leave a comment!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!it stew for about 4 hours. Mind you, because my boyfriend and I decided to stop and get a drink and a bit to eat, I got home about 8:00. By the time I finished applying the henna, it was about 9 PM. Ugh.  About 2 1/2 hours in, I was so tired I decided to wash it out knowing that if I wasn&#x27;t happy with the color, I could re-apply it in a couple days. I was content in just getting the benefits of a healthy henna treatment.  I rinsed my hair and was very happy that the water ran clear in about 5 minutes. I then washed my hair 3 or 4 times and was a bit dismayed because my hair felt very hard. Very, very hard...which I expected, but was still not used to.  I towel dried my hair, added a mixture of [[ASIN:B00128WK4I Kinky Curly Knot Today Conditioner, 8 oz]], Honey, and Olive Oil, wrapped my hair in saran wrap, covered it in a silk wrap, and went to bed to let it deep condition.  I woke this morning and rinsed my hair, and it was still hard. Annoyed.  I washed it 2 times, added more conditioner and let it sit for about 10 minutes. I rinsed it out, and it felt a little bit better. A very little bit. It was very difficult combing out my hair, but remember reading somewhere that once you dry your hair, it will feel better. Actually, as I was combing out my very hard and knotted hair, I was contemplating if all of this was worth it. Combing tangles out of your hair is difficult enough...but when you have to do it when it&#x27;s as hard as straw was just disappointing.  In saying that, after I got the knots out and I blew my hair dry, it felt and looked better than I ever remember it feeling before. And, the color came out perfect!! I didn&#x27;t have to leave it in for the 4 hours I&#x27;d planned. 2 1/2 hours worked just fine! My roots, edges and the rest of my hair is a nice dark brown/burgundy color. Exactly what I wanted!    I&#x27;m giving this Henna the 5 stars it deserves because my hair feels soooo good, and it looks just a fabulous. Soft, shiny, with a nice dense rich color.    I willuse this again, as it did exactly what everyone said it should do. Right down to making my hair feel hard like straw until it dries.

            <li> This is one of the best hair products I have&lt;br /&gt;used so far. It improves my hair and does not&lt;br /&gt;have any drawbacks that I can see. - Donna</li>
            <li> I mixed it with a lil lemon juice and boiled water that had a teaspoon of coconut oil.  It cured in 2 hours  I applied and ended up leaving it on for like 8 hours  So far so good.  It stained my scalp but Im sure that will go away within a week  it made my hair \\&quot;rough\\&quot; initially so I did a deep conditioner and as suggested by a fellow you-tuber  Will be purchasing again</li>
            <li> This henna is real henna. It is a fine, khaki-green powder. I did a test on a hairball before I applied it to all my hair: I took about 2 tbsps of henna powder, mixed in enough water to make a yogurty paste, let it sit for 2 hours, and then added the hairball. I let it sit for 2 hours more, and then rinsed out the henna. Naturally, my hair is Caucasian medium-dark brown with a few auburn highlights. 2 hours in henna turned it completely auburn: a very nice color, but not very natural looking on me. (It turned out the same color as my little brother&#x27;s hair.)  I mixed up the rest of the henna with black coffee and water (it smells like spinach and looks like goose poop), and let it sit in a plastic bowl for about an hour. I took about 1/2 cup, and mixed it with hair conditioner, washed my hair, and applied it. It is MESSY! Also, it dyes your hands unless you use gloves or rinse it off quickly. I left the henna gloss on for 5 minutes, and then rinsed it out. About an hour later, I glossed it again. (I have about 2 cups of henna leftovers, which I froze.) It took 2 shampoos to get it out; it did kind-of dry my hair out, so I super-conditioned it. Now, the auburn in my hair is a bit more noticeable, but it looks completely natural (haha, probably no one except me will even notice).   It was messy and smelly, but fun to apply. Little kids get grossed out just looking at the paste. If you let this sit on your hair for the recommended amount of time, you WILL get redder hair, based off your natural color. I would use this again, probably just for another 5-minute gloss.</li>
            <li> Up until now, I haven&#x27;t used henna since I was a little kid, when my mother used to henna her hair when we lived in Egypt. An eternity ago! Years later, I find myself sprouting a couple of gray hairs and order Godrej Nupur Mehendi (henna), and that odd, hay-like scent takes me back many years, though it&#x27;s not nearly as pungent as what I grew up smelling (which is a good thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It must be said that the thing about henna is that it&#x27;s not hair dye. It tints your hair and is fabulous for it in the long term. It&#x27;s a natural product, which is plant-based. But I repeat, it&#x27;s not a hair dye, with the nasty chemicals and the crap so many Westerners are raised with in terms of hair products. It can be messy to use, but if you prepare yourself, it won&#x27;t be too bad. Just don&#x27;t expect a nice little antiseptic product which is all neat, mmmkay? You&#x27;re going Old School, so be prepared :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been some excellent reviews about what to use and what not to use. The product worked perfectly for me, beautifully. I added some coconut oil  to  the henna and water pudding-like mixture,  and it made it softer and also less hay-like in scent. Hair is soft and luscious. Little stray grays are gone. I suggest using some of the indigo powder if you want your hair to be dark without the red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It must be mentioned too that I am a brunette. My hair is naturally very dark. Regular henna will not turn my hair coppery all over, just a deep auburn after a few hours (I had it on for 3-4 hours). If you&#x27;re a blond or your hair is all gray or white, henna is going to turn  your hair probably like a strawberry red or orange, or the color of a shiny new penny. Pretty, but if you don&#x27;t want this, you might scream. Henna is red. I don&#x27;t know why women who are fair-haired are buying this stuff, using it, and then saying there is something wrong with the product. There is nothing wrong with it. You just are not supposed to use it and expect your hair to remain blond or have it revert your grey/white hair to its natural state. It isn&#x27;t magical hair dye, people.</li>
            <li> Excellent Excellenet Marvelous Spectacular Stupendous. Need I say more? Great for first time Henna users like myself, the shade is a beautiful red. Now at first, it will look hideous, like a bright orangey color- but worse. Give it a day or two and it will oxidize and your hair will become a beautiful shade of red (not to bright either, but very very pretty). And at 4.00 its great!! Please Please try!!! You wont be disappointed ! :)</li>
            <li> Great product. gets the job done.  This product is as described.  I have ordered this item several times and plan to be a repeat client.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I receive a monthly newsletter which provides tips on how to grow healthy hair.  One month a tip on henna stated that it was an excellent product to restore moisture and repair damaged hair.  Instantly, I searched this site to find henna powder.  After reading some of the reviews and finding that the overall consensus was that everyone loved it, I ordered 2 packages.  I am a 37 year old Black female with mostly dark brown hair and blessed with white and silver mainly around the front on my hairline back towards the crown of my head.  When my package arrived, I anxiously opened it ready to apply this product to my hair.  What I did not read in the reviews was what it would do to my white and silver hair!  I mixed the product and after 2 hours applied it to my hair.  The only ingredient I added to the powder was oil.  After letting it sit for 3 hours, I was shocked to find that my white and silver hair was tinted a really DEEP reddish-ORANGE!  My dark brown hair was a little lighter and I was pleased with the shade.  My children said that I looked like a character from Dragon Ball Z!  After washing, drying and styling my hair, I had mixed feelings about the intensity of the red/orange which is really difficult to miss as it frames my face.  I have shoulder length hair and I usually wear it styled in a bob without bangs--the front combed towards the back of my head.  Well the hair along my hairline is much brighter than the rest of the red/orange hair.  Oh--this is the color of the white hair.  My silver locks now look like copper, bronze and gold!  I am sure the descriptions of all of these vibrant colors makes me sound like I went crazy with the crayola on my hair, but after a few washings, the colors toned down a lot!  Thank goodness!!!  I must say that I am pleasantly pleased with the look of my hair and the softness that this product added.  I will definitely use it again.  One package goes a long way.  I receive so many compliments on my hair and I tell everyonewho asks how I got all of these beautiful highlights in my hair!!</li>
            <li> The best part of henna is its conditioning quality and this product really delivers. My hair feels so silky and there is enough powder in the packet for 3 applications (I have long hair). I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I am Africian american and this product made my 4b hair stronger, I can tell it coated each hair strand and give life to my hair. Before using this product I was using a regular dye and, i notice my hair was getting weak and thin....This product also covered my grey. Very pleased with this product will order again.</li>
            <li> I found this henna to be all that it said it would be.It was easy to use.I had hoped for less hair breakage,but all in all it was good.</li>
            <li> I developed allergic reaction to PPD in permanent hair dyes, so I&#x27;m looking for something \\&quot;natural\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m a newbie to Henna.  I researched online reviews and had an impression that this product will darken my black/gray hair.  After half hour application and 3.5 hours left henna on my hair, I found this powder did not change much of my chemically dyed ends but turned my new grown root hair from gray to orange reddish.  It is an unwanted bright red/orange metallic color.  My husband commented \\&quot;it&#x27;s early Halloween time! :-)\\&quot;.  I wished they put this result as a warning on the package.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product now a third time and it really conditions my hair. It changes my gray hair to a pretty auburn red. It is just great all around.</li>
            <li> I had a heartbreaking experience with my hair. It was bleached poorly and now my hair is over processed meaning its like rubbery and when dry like cotton candy just a b*tch to deal with. So I dyed in a brown to make it look better, but of course I still  have this &amp;#34; over processed problem&amp;#34;. So when I used this product I actually can honestly say my hair feels stronger, yes of course its still rubbery that is going to take a long time to heal but Its possible. My cousin hair turned back to normal after a year. But I am hoping since this product made me hair feel like it has a shield around it, I am hoping after doing the once a month my hair may be back to normal in 6 months ^.^. the color is beautiful and natural looking. Its like a deep brownish red. The entire process of it is weird and long but worth it for the benefits. But I did it differently then the packet because I heard the longer you leave henna on for the better and deeper the color is. So I slept with mine on. The smell wasn&#x27;t like I thought it would be. My dad worked with horses so the smell reminded me of the mud and hay mixture that would happen on a rainy day, Its earthly like mud hay and herbs so I kinda liked it. So what I did was&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mixed a 1/2 cup of coffee (makes it darker)&lt;br /&gt;Mixed a 1/2 cup of black tea, used 2 tea bags and rip it and mixed in the tea leaves&lt;br /&gt;Mixed a spoon of olive oil and coconut oil (microwave the oils the henna work better with hot stuff)&lt;br /&gt;Mixed a can of coconut milk, refrigerate the coconut milk so its like yogurt consistent&lt;br /&gt;cover the mixture for 2 hours&lt;br /&gt;rub it on damp hair&lt;br /&gt;rap with plastic rap and tap it down: sleep on a towel&lt;br /&gt;Morning gently wash away henna with apple cider vinegar and cold water&lt;br /&gt;after to softened hair because henna makes hair dry for a couple of days do to its protein levels and strengthening properties it takes your hair some time to soften up so to help after you wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;Mixed one egg yolk only with coconut oil, olive oil and a cold beer, cover head completely and let it sit on your head for a hour if you have time, if not just run a beer thru your hair.nly with coconut oil, olive oil and a cold beer, cover head completely and let it sit on your head for a hour if you have time, if not just run a beer thru your hair.</li>
            <li> Dyed my hair a rich red color that I later toned down to a medium auburn with coffee and indigo powder. I would recommend this to anyone who is trying to thicken their hair or start growing out dyed hair (which is what I am doing). Good quality and nice smell.</li>
            <li> Henna is a great conditioner, dye, and strengthener for your hair but if you don&#x27;t know anything about henna or the effects, please do a little search on youtube or [...] so you can understand what you will be using.     As far as how to mix and what to use to mix, its really up to you. You almost can&#x27;t go wrong with mixing henna, you can add conditioner, eggs(although I don&#x27;t), oil, tea, coffee, aloe vera juice, lemon, orange juice, yogurt, coconut milk, and many other things. You need to know what you are wanting from it, what you hair needs, and then go from there.     It&#x27;s very fun to henna, it&#x27;s fun to experiment with different mixes. For me, I can&#x27;t use a full henna, so I mix about 50g of henna with conditioner and oil for a henna gloss. You can add just water and mix it to a yogurt consistency and that is fine.     Be SURE to condition you hair afterwards. 10 minutes with conditioner on your hair after rinsing the henna will eliminate any dryness that you may feel over the next few days. henna can be drying to the hair, and even more so when you use protein(eggs) or lemon juice. So make sure you do a conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li> Received before the actual shipping date, which was definitely a plus since it is about a month after you order.  I have been thinking about trying henna for months now. I was afraid due to most people stating it does dry out hair. Heard rave reviews about Nupur. LOVE IT. My hair was soft &amp; silky! Just did it this past weekend and I&#x27;ve already put in another order as I plan to henna on a regular now.</li>
            <li> Okay let me say it was the first time using any kind of henna but did like the color it gave me a copper color real nice only if it was more even that was my fault rushed through it mixed it  with pure bottle lemon juice for 3 hours only and let on my hair for 3hours  also nice color but oh sooooo drying i recommend to not using only lemon try a 50/50 of lemon to something else maybe tea i will do another review i will try tomorrow  with hibiscus infusion and plain yogurt and coconut oil so far it will have a total of 24 plus hours more than planned but didn&#x27;t have the time to apply it today. will let you all know what my result is. [...] easy to mix also so 5 stars so far &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> Because of the interest in this topic, I have put an updated review with pictures on our blog Evolving Dish: [...] - I hope it helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used just the Nupur powder and loved the shine and softness, but I had wanted my hair a little darker brown, not as coppery. (My hair is normally medium brown - the copper was lovely, I just wanted it darker and richer looking and not so red.) So I added indigo powder and a few other things and WOW! My hair is so shiny, soft, pretty, rich looking and feeling now. I am 42 and have done everything to my hair (can&#x27;t do the chemicals anymore as even the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; hair dyes make my scalp blister :-() and I have NEVER been happier with the color or texture of my hair than I am after using this product. The way it sparkles in the sun is amazing, and my boyfriend compliments me almost every day on my hair now. In fact, this is the first Amazon review I&#x27;ve ever written; that&#x27;s how impressed I am with this product, and I highly recommend it--with a little tweaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the formula and process that worked very well for me after different experiments and attempts - if you have brown hair and want it softer, shinier, richer, deeper, with coppery shine in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you will need to begin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Nupur henna mix (green bag)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Indigo powder (silver bag) [[ASIN:B00312PRU2 Natural Indigo Powder 100 Grams Bag (wasma in Arabic and Urdu) Indigofera Tinctoria Last crop]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- conditioning hair oil and/or pre-shampoo hair treatment - I have used [[ASIN:B000JWQ3NC Dabur Vatika Coconut Hair Oil 150ml (Pack of 2)]] AND [[ASIN:B000NURO7E Burt&#x27;s Bees Avacado Butter Pre-Shampoo Hair Treatment with Nettle and Rosemary, 4.34-Ounce Bottle  (Pack of 2)]] - these conditioners make your hair softer and (almost as important) cut the strong horse poop smell of the henna/indigo mixture. I have also used It&#x27;s A 10 hair masque, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- plastic or glass mixing bowl/spoon (NO metal)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- rubber or latex gloves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- shower cap (or plastic grocery bag in a pinch)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the process - I start the night before I have nothing to do the next morning - so like a Friday night where I am just going to hang around and clean the house, watch TV etc. for 4-6 hours on Saturday:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The night before - in a glass or plastic bowl, using a plastic or wooden spoon, mix up all of the Nupur (green bag) with enough boiling hot water to make a pudding-like paste. Around 2 cups, but slowly add until pudding consistency, a little more watery is better than too dry. I also add a healthy squirt each of the coconut oil and the Burt&#x27;s Bees pre-shampoo treatment and mix it all up. Leave it to sit overnight on the counter, covered by plastic wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The next morning - freeze in a ziplock bag the portion you are not planning you use (I have thick medium-long hair, past my shoulders and I freeze half of it) Henna does well in the freezer, and it will be all ready to thaw and use the next time, which is nice. (Indigo does NOT do well in the freezer, so just freeze the unused portion of henna/conditioner mix before adding the indigo.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Add to the henna/conditioner bowl about 1/2 of the indigo powder mix and enough boiling water to make it pudding-like again. (Some people do the henna, then the indigo after the henna is washed out - that seems even more time consuming but I haven&#x27;t tried that process, I just mix it all together.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. After about 10 minutes, when the indigo has set with the Nupur/conditioner mixture (or however long the indigo powder package says) - make sure you have an old t-shirt on - put on the gloves and carefully apply all over your hair, rubbing it in to make sure it is reaching all the hair. This can get messy, especially the first time . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Pile your hair on top of your head and put on a shower cap or tie a plastic grocery bag over your hair. Clean off any henna mixture that has dripped on your neck, ears, sink, floor, etc. - damp paper towels work well. It will stain cloth and skin if left on too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Hang out with that mixture on your head for 4-6 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. When the time&#x27;s up, rinse it out until the water runs clear - this can take a WHILE. Rinse with conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. The next day, shampoo and deep condition. Don&#x27;t be discouraged if your hair feels dry, coarse, and straw-like for a few days. It will soon be soft and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Bonus - recommended by my hair dresser - I started rubbing a little of this in my hair, combing it through (especially the ends) before styling, which has also helped with the insane softness and shininess of my new hair :-) [[ASIN:B0045WBFAI ALTERNA BAMBOO Smooth Pure Kendi Oil Pure Treatment Oil, 1.7 fl oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it seems like a lot but once you get the hang of it, I think it&#x27;s worth it in terms of saving $$ and having less harsh chemicals on your head. Not to mention, having gorgeous hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - it is hard to dye OVER henna as henna coats the hair shaft so if you plan to return to conventional dye, it can take a few months for the henna to wash out enough to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: DO NOT use the indigo if you want to highlight your hair!!! I waited a few months after doing the henna/indigo and wanted to put some highlights in. They turned pale green.

            <li> My natural hair color is dark brown. I used this henna for the first time last week. I tweeked the instructions a bit and mixed the Nupur henna with: hibiscus petal powder, water, a splash of grape juice, a splash of apple juice, and a bit of olive oil. I waited about 4 hours for dye release, applied it to my hair, and left it on for 4 hours. It was easy to apply, didn&#x27;t have a strong odor at all (it smelled like chamomile or anise tea to me), and was really easy to wash out. It gave my hair beautiful red highlights in the sun/light. Indoors my hair looks darker brown. It is a very rich and beautiful color. My hair is silky smooth and looks extremely healthy. It is stronger &amp;  my hair is falling out way less than before. It took a couple of days for the \\&quot;results\\&quot; to show, but it was worth the wait! I am pleased with the results and will definitely continue to apply this henna to my hair.</li>
            <li> Stuff is dark but I have red highlights in the sun. There is a lot of product in this little bag. If you have mid-neck length hair then you could probably get away with using just half a bag this time and then the other half in 6 weeks. No allergic reactions as I am allergic to hair dye!</li>
            <li> My hair used to be blonde turning to a honey brown as I grew older. I used to lighten my hair back to blonde which looked great except roots showing up a little sooner than I would have liked, my hair grows very fast. So I decided to try using henna, this product intrigued me because it addressed other issues I have. Lots of white/gray coming in, manageability; which was growing worse as more gray showed up, shine, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed about 1/3 of the powder with warm water enough to make a paste (My hair is well below my shoulders so I really don&#x27;t understand why many are using the whole package as I always have some left over following this recipe, then again my hair is fairly straight, I don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference), add a large squirt [[ASIN:B0009R14T0 Africa&#x27;s Best Ultimate Herbal Oil 8 oz.]] adjust water if necessary, should not be any thinner than a heavy cake batter (careful here, it is really easy to make it too thin). Let sit for a couple of hours. It is helpful if you can have someone help at this point to part and paint the henna on for a thorough application, so far I have done it myself and usually I am the only one who knows where I missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is amazingly shiny, manageable, healthy-looking and I can redo whenever I see gray I don&#x27;t have to wait 4-6 weeks which is great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I am a natural blonde with wavy hair so don&#x27;t fret about the oil. You can even use a smear of it to touch up your hair if it feels a little dry and dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: May 26, 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for over a year now, I have never gotten a bad batch, thought it very strange someone did. My hair is thicker, longer, shinier, healthier (less split ends,) than it has ever been in my entire life. I am over 50 now, eek!, just felt it would be good to give you a time reference. Even if I forget to condition my hair, as long as it isn&#x27;t blow-dried (my blow-drying method is leaving the car window open.) I have long, waves of sheer glossiness, no BHD&#x27;S for me. Which of course kind a freaks me out. I mean how long have I been going through constant BHD&#x27;S? 50 years worth! Ok, so my hair isn&#x27;t my normal blonde, but it is the most gorgeous natural looking red you have ever seen. The exchange is totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised many still make up the whole pack, one reviewer says she freezes half of it. For me, it is just as easy to use a heaping 1/3 cup measure with 2/3 cups of water and some of the Africa&#x27;s best oil. To each his/her own I suppose. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you considering henna tattoo&#x27;s I think the consistency of this product makes it perfect for that application. I doubt you would have to sift it the consistency is so fine.</li>
            <li> This was my 1st experience with henna and I LOVE it! It makes my hair look so much more natural with highlights where my grays were. It is a little orange at 1st (my hair is dark brown) but each day blends in a bit more!  I love the look and feel of my hair! I will use this instead of chemicals. I&#x27;m so happy with my results! It&#x27;s well worth the time!</li>
            <li> Godrej Nupur Henna is the best henna i&#x27;ve purchased in the past 18 years of dying my hair with henna. I didn&#x27;t have the dry brittleness that I usually get with other henna products.  I have shoulder length hair and I only used 1/3 of the henna to cover my hair root to ends. I was taught that you must have boiling water to mix the henna with, not luke warm or cold tap water (I&#x27;m half african and in my part of africa dying hair with henna is common), and I waited 3 hours before applying the henna. I let the henna sit on my head for 4 hours and deep condition right after. The next day, my hair was soo soft,shiny and luxurious. The color isa chocolate brown with highlighted dark red streaks(thanks to my premature gray). It looks like I went to a salon and had my hair professionally colored. I also followed up with a good dose of [[ASIN:B003XGYTQE Brahmi Amla Oil - 8 fl. oz.,(Bazaar of India)]]  .</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the reviews. I don&#x27;t have much experience with Henna but I followed some YOu tube videos instructions. My hair has been natural for three years now. My hair has been thin and damaged from perms and heat, and the natural hair has been a challenge.  After this process, my hair is stronger and feels very conditioned. I kept the process on my head for six hours and I deep conditioned afterwards. I don&#x27;t really care for the red highlights so I tried to focus on the roots. Overall, I still got red highlights. You get a large amount of Henna for your buck!</li>
            <li> I purchased the product for the hair dying properties as well as the conditioning properties.  I was pleased with the results.  My hair is naturally a dark auburn color and I used the product to cover modest gray around my hairline.  The result was a reddish, light brown color which was very pretty and lasted approximately 12 weeks.  It also looked very natural.  The only thing I dread when using the henna is the number of times you must wash your hair to get the henna out (about four or five).  During the next application I plan to use a good creamy hair conditioner to help remove the henna from my hair (we&#x27;ll see if that works).  In terms of preparation, I took cues from another reviewer and mixed the henna with Chamomile tea and the juice of a couple lemons.  I allowed the mixture to sit for a few hours in the fridge before applying, but I did not freeze it.  The henna was a pudding-like consistency when I applied and I left it on for a couple hours.  Be careful not to use towels that you cherish because the henna will stain them.  Otherwise, love the product!</li>
            <li> i had heard alot of women talk of henna and always wanting to try it i choose this one and well i love this it really made my hair feel thicker and stronger it just felt so much better i had little to none shedding and i mixed with oil and water and stranged it through a stocking and it was so smooth not messy not runny at all i left it for two and half hrs and rinised off little to none staining it was a great experience and i am ordering more i only needed half a pack so i can get two uses out of it but for those woth longer hair may need to use the whole thing but it a winner and i do have a nice red color to my hair im not complaining but u can add other things to it for ur own peferrence (mixture when mixing should be like a puddin)</li>
            <li> Okay, this is really partially my fault, but I was not aware that this was henna.  I have hennaed my hair once before and got a beautiful coppery auburn out of it.  I have hair all the way to my tailbone, and I oil it at least once per week and usually twice.  I bought this because I thought that it was just 9 conditioning herbs.  I was aware that the amla may make it a little less red, but that was okay with me.  The directions on the box didn&#x27;t say to use gloves and I assumed this brand was mainly just conditioning with very little color staining.  WRONG!  I have orange palms now...LOL!  I don&#x27;t mind the color I got. It is a little more red auburn than copper auburn now.  I just wish I had known because I only used the one 150 gram package and didnt apply it carefully or evenly as I would if I were coloring my hair.  That being said, I liked it better than the Jamila henna I used before.  I found it to be more moisturizing and the color redder than it is orange.  I give it a 5.  I blame the snafoo on me, but they really should have made it more clear on the package that it was henna.</li>
            <li> Love this oil and how it keeps my hair moisturized without greasiness.  The scent is wonderful and it doesn&#x27;t clash with perfumes you may wear.</li>
            <li> I found this product by accident.  I didn&#x27;t want to wait for the body art quality henna I usually order online.  I stopped in an Indian store and found Nupur.  It was a third of the price of my regular henna and I got the same results.  Since then, Nupur has added wonderful herbs to the product such as Amla and Brahmi among others.  I love the results and I love the price.  I&#x27;ve ordered Nupur from  Amazon a couple of times and the package came quickly and as advertised.</li>
            <li> I started using henna around April 2011. The brand I started using was Reshma henna. However, I saw this product and could not resist. It has so many beneficial herbs for hair. I purchased this product and set out to condition my tightly curly hair. I applied the Nupur henna, allowing it to stay on my hair for 4 hours. Afterwards, I was amazed. This henna was easy to rinse out and made my hair very soft. I couldn&#x27;t keep my fingers out of my hair...and I&#x27;m still touching my hair. I would highly recommend the Nupur henna with the 9 herbs. After using this product once, I went back to my local India market and purchased a total of 10 bags of this brand. Needless to say, I&#x27;m getting my money back with every henna treatment. Oh, and may I also add that I no longer have split ends and I attribute that to this product. This is the best hair conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> This henna arrived promptly after I ordered it, and in excellent condition. I have not yet had the opportunity to use it on my hair, but will update this review as soon as I do. For now this product gets an excellent review for packaging and delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I finally used the henna and I cannot express how much I LOVE my hair now. My hair was pretty light brown before using this product, so the color came out an very lush vivid light auburn. I adore it, and have gotten tons of compliments. As for the difficulty of use, I really did not find it to be bad at all. In a plastic bowl I mixed the entire packet of powder with a little under 2 cups of boiling water and several heaping tablespoons of coconut oil (for extra conditioning and to disguise a little bit of the alfalfa-ish smell of the henna). I covered the bowl tightly in plastic wrap and then let it sit on the counter overnight. The next afternoon I put some plastic garbage bags on the floor of the bathroom (as well as one covering the sink/counter) because I had heard it was horribly messy. Using my hands (wearing gloves, of course) I applied the mixture all over and made sure to massage it through all of my hair. Then I covered my head with two plastic shower caps and started to clean up. There really wasn&#x27;t much of a mess at all. I think I got one drop on the plastic and thats it.  I let it sit on my hair for about 5-6 hours while I did homework and cleaned my apartment, going over my covered head with a hairdryer every now and then to keep it nice and warm. Finally I rinsed my hair by kneeling next to the tub and just using the faucet. It took probably 10 solid mins of rinsing and an application of conditioner to get my hair feeling free of the henna grit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color did darken just a tad over the next 2 days, and I didn&#x27;t actually shampoo it for about 36 hours after applying the henna to give the color time to settle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has never felt this wonderful and thecolor has stayed extremely shiny and vibrant even 3 weeks later. I will absolutely be ordering this product again and again!</li>
            <li> I am Asian and originally have black hair. But seldom, I&#x27;d dye it a lighter color, straighten it, curl it, etc. Those things caused the bottom part of my hair to be lighter than the part that just grew on the top. I wanted to make the color similar. With Nupur, my hair overall became slightly lighter. I can feel the smoothness, but it&#x27;s not significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister used it and experienced frizzyness after rinsing it out. Her hair that&#x27;s just black now becomes brown under light or sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to see how long my hair will stay like this. Over all, great product. I love that it is all natural and I&#x27;m not worried about damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this henna for two months now.  I love how it covers my gray hair. My hair is also stronger because of the additional herbs that are in it.  I will continue to use this powder.</li>
            <li> I got this for $2.99 at my local Indian market.  I had been reading a lot about henna as an alternative to chemical dyes, so I wanted to try it.  This is not a pure henna, but a blend of henna and 9 Indian herbs known for their hair-beautifying properties.  I mixed this with warm chamomile tea and the juice of 1/2 a small lemon.  I then covered it and left it on the kitchen counter for a few hours, and then put it in the freezer. (I read that this helps to have more dye release.)  I thawed it the next day, and applied to my hair with gloved hands.  The texture should be like pudding.  I only left this on for 2 hours, not 4 as I was planning to, (it was getting really late) and the color came out fantastic!  It was not too hard to rinse out, I used some conditioner to help get the grit out of my chin-length hair.  I am VERY pleased with this product.  After a few days, it&#x27;s settled into the final color - a dark coppery auburn!  (My hair was dark brown with silvers throughout.)  My grays are completely covered and are now copper highlights!  I love this henna!!!  My hair also feels stronger too.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this in a local store and gave it a try. It is so good. My hair is black and I was actually not interested in coloring my hair. I mixed it as per instruction and applied and might had left it for an hour on my hair and washed it well. It didn&#x27;t change my hair color but my hair looked shiny and healthy. That&#x27;s what I wanted and it is as I expected.</li>
            <li> I normally just agree with others but I write for this product. I just use it simply. I mixed it with strong cofee, covered it a and left over night. Before using, I mixed 2 egg york in it and applied to my hair. Cover hair for 3 hours and rinse until the water clear. Apply hair conditioner, cover for 10 minutes and rinse. Feel hair is hard . Shampoo the next day as normal. My hair is beautiful and the color is darker in a few days. This henna covers gray well. I recommend it. I have been using it 3 times and keep ordering.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, it was great! Left my hair very soft and the color was fantastic. So I purchased again. From the same seller, same product...and it is full of sand. I had to wash my hair three times to get all of the sand out of it. You could see the sand sitting in the bottom of my shower. My hair felt very striped and stiff this time and it didn&#x27;t even seem like there was much color change. So I had two completely different experiences with this product and that&#x27;s enough to make me look elsewhere. I think I&#x27;ll give the jamila a try. I really wanted it to work, I love the idea of all the herbs in it, but that sand was just a pain in the you-know-what!</li>
            <li> **First off - It takes a few days for the tone to mellow and for the color to oxidize to the color it will actually be. It will darken.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is wonderful, wonderful stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes. It smells like baby diarrhea if the baby had split pea soup &amp; spinach smoothies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But - if you can get used to the \\&quot;green\\&quot; odor, you&#x27;ll be fine. And, once you wash it out, the odor is gone. I mix mine with coffee instead of water, and a tsp. of cinnamon. Helps! Cinnamon can irritate your skin though, so don&#x27;t use too much. But the coffee and cinnamon help darken the tone a bit too. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had gray since I was nineteen - so I&#x27;ve been every color in the book. Henna coloring works differently than standard hair dye - so, unlike standard hair dye, my grays don&#x27;t pop out after a week or two. The only gray I ever see now is when the roots grow out enough to show up. SO AWESOME! I&#x27;m only 38, so I really didn&#x27;t want to be stuck damaging my hair and scalp for another 20+ years! Henna is THE ANSWER. You can also do a rinse with indigo after the henna, to darken the color if you don&#x27;t wanna be red at all. I like the red highlights though! After about a week, my naturally very dark brown hair is brown with deep auburn highlights! Love it! And my scalp and hair are SO HEALTHY AND HAPPY. I have very wavy, fine hair, and a lot of it. It&#x27;s got so much body and shine, people always comment on it. Henna!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that adding a little coconut oil when I mix it helps it be a little more workable. It&#x27;s so easy to do! Just put it on freshly cleaned, dry hair, wrap your head with plastic wrap &amp; put a shower cap over it. Then go about your day for three-four hours. Rinse it out, wash and condition. Voila! Beautiful henna&#x27;d hair. Totally!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the coolest thing is that you don&#x27;t throw away the leftover henna mix! Mix it and store it in a freezer proof, airtight container. Freeze it until you&#x27;re gonna use it again, and just remember to take it out to thaw the night before you want to henna again. I get about five uses out of one 150g package - whole head! For less than $5. Seriously. Wonderful.</li>
            <li> So far I have still not figured how to combat the dryness immediately after henna. However, the strength and body that my hair takes on after the treatment far outweighs the temporary dryness. I have 4b/c hair I think, so flat ironing or warm blow drying helps even though I am minimizing heat. Also my grays first took on an orange hue but I find  that with additional treatments they are getting darker and fading into oblivion.</li>
            <li> I was dying to try this Nupur and finally few days ago i was able to try it. It was my first time trying henna in my hair and i absolutely love it. It is the best thing i put in my hair. It makes my hair so shiny, at first i was afraid to try it because of the rumors that it might change your hair orange and so forth. I went on,take a chance and try it without even testing it out, well it doesnt really now because i am in love with this Henna and the price is great. I would definitely buy this Henna. So, ladies this is the henna you should try. You wouldn&#x27;t regret it at all. Overall, If you think it might turn your hair orange do try it on some of your hair before applying it to your whole head. Best of luck!</li>
            <li> I am going to compare this product with Lush Henna bars because these are the two products I&#x27;ve tried. I have black hair with lots of grey.&lt;br /&gt;Both products add the henna shine, but the experience was different each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Godrej Nupur: (Mixed with Amla powder 2:1 ratio, 1 egg, olive oil, apple cider vinegar) - kept it on for 3 hours&lt;br /&gt;+ Already Powdered, so no need to grate&lt;br /&gt;+ Good quality and has other herbal ingredients&lt;br /&gt;+ Grey hair turned brown, black hair remained black.&lt;br /&gt;- Please use with yogurt or egg, else will dry your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lush Caca Brun: (used as is with apple cider vinegar) - kept overnight&lt;br /&gt;+ Good quality and has other (different) natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;- Grey hair turned very light brown, black hair remained black. Now the Lush bar is supposed to contain indigo, but no idea why the colour was so light on the grey. Disappointing considering I kept it on overnight (and endured a headache as a result).&lt;br /&gt;- Difficult to wash out because of the coco butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely prefer the Nupur - its cheaper, works better for me and allows me to add whatever I choose (eggs, yogurt, amla, oil, etc.) Another advantage is that it is easier to wash off than the Lush henna. I also think that the coco butter in the Lush bar makes it difficult for the henna and indigo to stain naturally dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Godrej Nupur is not available in our local Indian store. So Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I was super scared using this product for the first time. I am 17 and have been dying my hair 4 or 5 times a year for the past 4 years. After doing some research and realizing how bad that was for you I decided I needed an alternative. Henna was the next best thing...or so I had heard. I had also heard some product reviews that were just gastly. Things like people&#x27;s hair turning bright orange and then they tried to dye over it and their hair turned green and then they had to shave their head. There are only a few reviews like that and I think the reason they had to shave their head was because they panicked when they saw the orange and tried to dye over it.&lt;br /&gt;You will see a lot of different recipes that people have mixed with this so here is 1 more&lt;br /&gt; I have shoulder length hair and only used half of one package&lt;br /&gt;items needed:&lt;br /&gt;1 plastic bowl (a large tupperware container works well)&lt;br /&gt;1 wood/plastic spoon (dollar store cooking spoon works well do NOT use a metal spoon it messes with the chemical composition and changes your outcome)&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup of EVOO (if you don&#x27;t know what this is watch Rachel Ray)&lt;br /&gt;10 or so drops of essential oil&lt;br /&gt;plastic wrap&lt;br /&gt;towel (buy a new cheap one you will need it for the next few times you wash your hair)&lt;br /&gt;water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix the Henna and 1/2 cup of EVOO together. Mixture will be EXTREMELY thick at this stage. Add water until it is the consistency of yogurt. It is important that there are no lumps&lt;br /&gt;Add the essential oil. This really serves no purpose other than to help control the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I let my mix sit for about 4 hours covered in plastic wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you begin...&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pretty bad. Nothing unbearable it is just unpleasant but it sticks with you for 8 or so hours so plan not to do anything that day that requires you to be around people. I found that having Petrolium around my ears, neck and forehead did not work but go ahead and try it. Maybe I just didn&#x27;t do it thick enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1..2..3..GO!&lt;br /&gt;spread the mix on. Use gloves. I was like my hands will be in contact with this stuff for 5 min. It is not going to stain. Boy was I wrong My hands looked like oompa loompas for 2 weeks after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrap your head in plastic wrap this helps control it so you can do other things (I watched Netflix)&lt;br /&gt;I left my mix in for 1 hour. Even though some people say to leave it in for 2-3 hours. Next time I might do an hour and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse in a metal sink (kitchen)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike Hair dye you can wash your hair directly after using henna. Go ahead and do that now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your hair will feel weird coarse almost and it will stay like this for about 3 days depending on how many showers you have.&lt;br /&gt;It will also look ORANGE. DO NOT PANIC I REPEAT DO NOT PANIC. ONE MORE TIME DO NOOOT PANIC!!! this is where others went wrong. Blow dry your hair (medium heat is needed) and leave your hair be for the night. It will mellow into a very beautiful auburn color if you have light-medium/dark brown hair. (my roots) If you have black hair (the rest of my hair that was dyed black) it will add astounding tones and hues of red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time you wash your hair for some reason some of the Henna seeps out so for your first 6 showers I suggest using the same towel on your hair because I ruined one of my plush towels :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to everyone. Totally an awesome product!!enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1..2..3..GO!&lt;br /&gt;spread the mix on. Use gloves. I was like my hands will be in contact with this stuff for 5 min.

Totally an awesome product!!</li>
            <li> My sister and I used this, and we are both happy with the result.  My hair is shinier and has a really nice red tint in the sunlight.  For reference, we both have straight, black hair (pretty typical Asian hair).  Her hair is actually more medium brown and much longer than mine.  My hair is a dark brown that ends approximately mid-way down my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We didn&#x27;t do any crazy formula, but I just mixed the powder with water and a bit of [[ASIN:B001PEZAHI Slice of Nature© Virgin Argan Oil. 100% Pure, Raw, Cold pressed. 100ml(3.5oz)]] in a bowl with a metal spoon (which is apparently a no-no, but I didn&#x27;t think it actually had a major effect on the product.  meh.) until it had the consistency of yogurt.  Left it sitting at room temperature for 3 hours.  Put into hair for ~2.5 - 3 hours and washed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple notes:&lt;br /&gt;1. The first three days after we used this, both of us had drier hair than when we started, but that pretty much went away with no lasting effects.&lt;br /&gt;2. The color (on us, obviously) darkened after the first few days as well.  It doesn&#x27;t really show up on my hair indoors, though my sister&#x27;s hair did turn reddish/orange before darkening to an auburn color indoors.  Outside, our hairs both have red tints (pictures are attached).&lt;br /&gt;3. With one pack, there was enough to cover all of my hair (of which I have A LOT) and most of my sister&#x27;s (she mostly did the ends of her hair).&lt;br /&gt;4. DO use gloves.  I was like, \\&quot;Oh, I can do this fast and my hands won&#x27;t stain.\\&quot; NOPE!  My hands were a hilarious orange color for two days...which was okay because it&#x27;s summer and I&#x27;m home most of the time anyway, but if you&#x27;re going places in life, then use gloves!&lt;br /&gt;5. IT IS MESSY AND KIND OF SMELLY.  The mess actually wasn&#x27;t *too* bad because we both wore bikini tops and used shower caps.  Also, as other users have surely mentioned, rub vaseline or something similar around your hairline and neck to avoid staining your face.  The smell is a bit likehay and matcha powder, and for me, it stayed a day or two.  It&#x27;s not horrendous, but I wasn&#x27;t too fond of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I would recommend this a friend, as it did make my hair shinier and smoother after the initial few days, and I would purchase this for myself again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photos of our results:&lt;br /&gt;Note that some of the photos were brighter than we would have liked.  That&#x27;s only because it was really difficult to show how the color&#x27;s changed without adjusting the camera&#x27;s brightness :/.  Also, for some reason, the color was REALLY obvious in the close-ups...so keep that in mind when viewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First two pictures &#x3D; sister.  Last three &#x3D; me.</li>
            <li> I use this to make my own ayervedic hair oil. it has grown my customers hair as well as my own. I love this product will continue to buy</li>
            <li> This is the best henna product I&#x27;ve ever used. The color is saturated, not pale. It lasts well on my white (gray) strands, where I&#x27;ve had some fading from other products. The consistency is really good to work with after mixing, because it&#x27;s a very fine powder, and it also leaves my hair in better condition than most other hennas I&#x27;ve used. It also doesn&#x27;t smell too bad, as henna goes. I will definitely buy this again. (My natural color is medium brown with about 25% gray, I have chin-length straight hair. The 150 grams made enough for 2+ uses on my whole head.)</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and used it on my hair and my daughters hair as a deep conditioner and the results were fantastic. I made a day out of it one Saturday and conditioned our hair. We&#x27;re African-American and our hair is very thick and you will have to wash your hair out at least 2-3 times before all of the herbs are out of your hair. The finished results were that our hair was softer and shinier. I also blow dried and pressed our hair!!!! Loved it. Our press lasted almost 2 weeks, our hair didn&#x27;t stay entirely straight for 2 weeks but I did not have to run the comb through it to touch it up after a few days.</li>
            <li> Great henna!!  Well sifted &amp; leaves none of that horrible grassy residue behind like other brands. The smell isn&#x27;t over-powering &amp; it rinses quite easily leaving hair soft, shiny, &amp; manageable.  I can&#x27;t really comment on the tint because I mixed it with indigo to forego the reddish color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 42 and have been dealing with grey hair for about the last ten years. To save money and to break away from more chemical dyes, I decided to use henna. It&#x27;s taken me about two years to finally work up the nerve to do it, and, a few months ago, I tried the Lush henna for the first time.  I loved how my hair turned out, but the Lush hennas are so sandy/gritty that they leave a huge mess all over the place.  Based on the positive reviews for this Nupur powder, I decided to try it instead of using my Lush henna, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stylist had been coloring my hair dark brown with reddish tints that were only obvious when I am in the sun. Using this henna made it noticeably redder, even when I&#x27;m not in the sun.  Since I was worried about it reading too orange, I mixed in some indigo powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent literally hours and hours reading reviews here and on other sites to work up the nerve to use the Lush henna and this one, and I&#x27;ve found that looking through all those reviews  -- esp. the one from Evolving Dish -- made the process much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a point of reference, I have fine, wavy 2C curls that, when stretched, reach to the top of my waist.  I&#x27;d say that I&#x27;m about 20% grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the process I used:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The night before, I mixed the powder in a large Pyrex bowl, adding in hot water until it formed a thick paste that looked like peanut butter or brownie batter.  When pouring the water just remember: you can easily add some more water, but it&#x27;s much harder to take it out again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  I then added in ten drops of lavender oil, some [[ASIN:B00012NI7E Burt&#x27;s Bees Avocado Butter Pre-Shampoo Hair Treatment with Nettles and Rosemary - 4.34 fl oz]], and some [[ASIN:B000JWM7FA Dabur Vatika Enriched Coconut Hair Oil 300ml (Pack of 2 Bottles)]], which I had melted in the microwave.  I also added in 1 TB of lemon juice (which is supposed to make henna read less orange) and 1 TB of apple cider vinegar (which is supposed to help henna cover the grey).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Cover it with plastic wrap and allow to sit overnight in a warm place (which is supposed to help with dye release).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  In the morning, I mixed 2 TBS of [[ASIN:B00312PRU2 100 Grams Bag of Natural Indigo Powder (wasma in Arabic and Urdu) Indigofera Tinctoria New Crop]] with warm water and a pinch of salt in a Pyrex measuring cup.  I let it sit for ten minutes while I prepared my henna area.  Once the indigo is ready (and it will be green!), mix it into the henna bowl. (Before mixing in the indigo, I spooned some henna into a small Ziploc baggie and froze it so I could use it for a root touch-up in about six weeks.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  To prepare your area, put down newspaper, trash bags, or old towels.  I&#x27;ve also been putting on an old t-shirt with a big opening and putting a stylist&#x27;s robe on over that.  Make sure you have everything you&#x27;ll need within easy reach -- hair color brushes, clips, shower cap, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  Apply something like Vasoline all along your hairline.  I&#x27;ve been using Lush&#x27;s Ultrabalm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.  Put on gloves.  I&#x27;ve been using a pair of Playtex dishwashing gloves.  Another tip is to put a disposable glove under that on your left hand so that when you take the Playtex pair off, one hand will still have a covering to touch your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.  Apply it!  I&#x27;ve tried it a few ways -- starting from the bottom up, and from the top down.  I always start with my roots first, and use a hairdye brush to really work it into my roots, esp. where my greys are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--I start with the brush to slop it all on, and then massage it into the whole strand/chunk of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Really work it into your scalp and roots to make sure the hair is covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--This last time I applied henna, I used a bunning technique I saw on You Tube (search for \\&quot;Henna Caca Lush\\&quot;), which worked great; you basically create little buns on the top of your head as you work, and the hennaholds it all in place.  I&#x27;ve also twisted it into a bun via small sections, and alternate the directions I twist them around the base in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9.  Either put on a shower cap or use Saran Wrap to wrap it all up.  You can also add folded paper towels around the base of the Saran Wrap to front and back of hair to catch drips later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--If you use Saran Wrap, put it around really tightly - pull out a few feet, and twist it around itself while it&#x27;s still on the tube - supposedly the tighter it is and the longer you leave in the henna, the less orange it will be.  Then use that twist to twist it around the bun to keep it in place&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10.  I bought this beanie [[ASIN:B007R8T4BY Dickies Men&#x27;s 14 Inch Cuffed Knit Beanie Hat]] to put on top of the shower cap or Saran Wrap. It helps keep the plastic in place and creates more heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11.  Clean yourself up (wipe the henna off your skin) and clean up any drips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;14. Leave it in -- I left mine in for about four hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15. When it&#x27;s time to rinse it out, I dip my hair in a mop bucket of water, which loosens things up.  Then I use a bunch of cheap Suave conditioner to get the rest out; it takes about 15 minutes of rinsing for the water to run clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve applied henna three times, it takes me about 30-40 minutes to put it on my waist-length hair.  I used about 3/4 of the package of this Nupur henna this first time, and had some left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is incredibly silky and feels so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can be sensitive to strong smells, but the smell of this didn&#x27;t really bother me; I liked the herbal scent of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also worried that this would leave my fine, 2C waves too limp, but they have retained their curl and I&#x27;m so happy with how my two inches of grey regrowth blended into the rest of my hair. The greys seem like subtle highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m officially a henna head, and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back to using commercial dyes again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be brave and give it a go! I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 3-7-14:  While I love how much easier this is to use than the Lush hennas, now that the color has had more time to settle, I think I&#x27;m going to go back to Lush.  The color of the Lush hennas seems more vibrant in my hair, and the Lush henna imparted a shine that this hasn&#x27;t.  When I was using the Lush henna, people regularly commented on how pretty and shiny my hair was, and that hasn&#x27;t happened at all since I used the Nupur brand.  While much messier and much more expensive, the Lush one gives me better results, so I&#x27;ll be returning to it.holds it all in place.

            <li> prompt delivery. I apply it with shikakai and amla and works great. If you want to color your hair then may be have to look for another variety of mehndi</li>
            <li> The color is dimensional in appearance and long-lasting.  It covered gray well and lasted 6 weeks before starting to fade. Gray streaks actually came out a lighter shade, but I&#x27;m told they look interesting.  Started using henna because the boxed dyes were causing my hair to fall out.  It is a gloppy mess of a process, though.  Also, bcs of hay fever allergies my eyes tear up and I wheeze more than a bit when using henna.  You might be advised to ventilate your work area well as you use it.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product, not a chemical dye to harm the hair, but natural herbs that I like. It is healthy for the hair and no damage</li>
            <li> I liked it, gave my hair shine and made it smooth. My mom liked it as well, will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product strengthens and adds color and shine..hair is healthy in appearance and much stronger (no shedding) after use..I am African American (4b/4c hair)..I mixed this with coconut water, a teaspoon of neem powder, teaspoon of alma powder, a teaspoon of brahmi powder and let sit for 2 hrs on double boiler on low..while it was sitting, I put cholesterol conditioner in my hair and put plastic cap on and waited..after 2 hrs were up I rinsed out my hair, applied Aubrey organics honeysuckle rose conditioner to my hair 1st then applied the henna mix to hair (working from back to front in sections)..my mix was the consistently of brownie batter... I put a plastic cap on (not messy process..it didn&#x27;t run ... It stayed well under one plastic cap.. Make sure consistency is not runny) I left on my hair for 1hr and 35 min then rinsed well with warm water, applied cheap vo5 moisture conditioner to wash/rinse the rest out hair, then reapplied more Aubrey organics honeysuckle rose conditioner and left in my hair 2 hrs..after I rinsed out the conditioner (2hrs later) hair was soft... Very buttery and awesome.. I roller set and sat under dryer.. Hair was beautiful and also red... I originally have light brown hair with bloodiest highlights; this product changed my color to a coppery/fiery reddish color... Very attractive and beautiful... No orange issues... I repeated the exact steps 4 days later and got the same results except my strands appeared stronger than before... I was suffering with a shedding problem before I used this... My hair responded after the 1st treatment (about 75% less shedding).. After 2nd treatment (no shedding)... I will use once a month from here on out to maintain health, strength, and shine.... I highly recommend this product.... By the way, I relax my hair 3 to 4 times a year... My 1st application of this product was a week after I had gotten my relaxer.... Hope this review helps.</li>
            <li> Where have I been? Who was supposed to pass me the memo on this? I have fanatically tried every Sally&#x27;s deep cond over decades, from low end to moronically pricey. Also the homecooked coconut oil, any oil, ingredient, and spell, incl. leaving cond. on days on end. Hopefully some teen is rdg this, and can start NOW with this stuff, and have healthier hair forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know this would actually change hair color. Mehendi, yeah, I get it now, duh. So use gloves unless you like pumpkinish palms. I dislike red hair, to put it mildly, on me. But I&#x27;m staying with this. The red isn&#x27;t that red and looks ok with olive skin. It DOES settle down to its own unique color and doesn&#x27;t look store-dyed, just natural. But the shine? Oh. My. God. Might be dry, the ends, for some reason for a few days after, but i use oils, and pretty soon ends are better than ever. I comb thru hair once while the mehendi is ON my hair doing its thing, so the shower rinse out thing isn&#x27;t a drama getting comb thru.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re worried about red, just watch it carefully, then rinse if you think you can&#x27;t live w the color. It DOES look far more vibrant while on, so no need to freak out. I added coffee the 2nd time and turned out darker. I left it on 7 hours. Seemed to work better for shine without coffee, but i like the darker due to coffee color better.</li>
            <li> Awesome henna.  Next time I would add indigo for a more Burnett hair color</li>
            <li> Yields quality results, easy to mix, great saturated deposit on hair with easy rinse out. I get this auto shipped so that I always have it on hand.</li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff.  The conditioning benefits are amazing.  I have it on automatic order.  I will keep it in stock always.</li>
            <li> Hello,  Nupur henna is 100% natural and i have been using it for the last 5 years, it helps reduce greyness of hair and excellent conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was able to buy this at a local Punjab grocery. I don&#x27;t apply this to my hair as a colorant. Instead, I steep approx. 1 TBSP in 1.5 C of Coffee/Green Tea. Strain it into a spray bottle. Add a few drops of Lavender/Rosemary oil and apply it as a leave-in-protein(used 2-3/week) . The recipe is based on one provided by CurlyProverbz (YouTube). This stuff is AWESOME!  My hair has&lt;br /&gt;* shed/fall has reduced to a few strands per day in contrast to the normal 100-150&lt;br /&gt;* gradually gotten darker with red/auburn highlights in sunlight&lt;br /&gt;* so far no significant change to my curl pattern (happens with henna sometimes),&lt;br /&gt;* has started to feel tangibly thicker/stronger/healthier.&lt;br /&gt;* hair began to feel dry after a couple of weeks.  I added a deep condition(1-2 days after the leave-in) to my routine and problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this product again once I finally run out.  Just make sure you do a deep condition on your hair afterwards and you should have no issue. I am trying this as an oil infusion next and update my review if it works as well as the leave-in has.</li>
            <li> Tried this for the first time in 2014 and heard about it from black woman on YouTube.  Not sure if it this product or the Eden body works hair shampoo, but my scalp itches and this never happens.  The good side is that my hair did not feel dried out after no poo shampoo and deep conditioner.  Also beware: it makes dark brown hair bronze or copper in color and gray hair orange; hated that.  I am going to try this product again with &amp;#34;Indigo&amp;#34;, which is very hard to find in NYC beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many brands of henna on my hair. This is by far the best henna for hair. The color is rich and dark. You get a lot of product when you buy this so you have enough for 2 applications. It is not clumpy or hard to rinse out. Efficiently covers gray so they look red.</li>
            <li> No where on this package is the word HENNA printed.  I read the reviews, I really wanted to nourish my scalp, see new growth, have shiny thick hair...  I have been bleaching/coloring my hair blond for years as my answer to the grey and the kinky kind of curl that comes with menopause....  I read a lot of the reviews and thought this is what I needed, hair nutrition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turned my bleach blond hair ORANGE.  I PANICKED.  I CRIED.  I RESEARCHED.  I WAS EMBARRASSED as I shocked my co-workers and total strangers on the street.  Through trial and error, I finally found the right combination.  I LOVE IT NOW!  I will not go back to bleaching my hair, now that it is soft and shiny and growing and healthy...  What a difference.  I get so many compliments, I am amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 months later, I would like to share my education and journey to get it right.  I deleted most of the original post as it was panic filled and is no longer applicable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not bleach it, it could melt your hair.  Dying it any color will turn it green, I tried that, using different colors of brown on hair hidden under layers.  I did not dare to do the bleach, as much as I wanted my blond hair back, I did not want to risk melting my hair and going bald.  Orange is, after all, preferable to bald...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, to save the day, I discovered a product that is non chemical, it is a color wash, called Roux Fanci-Full temporary hair color rinse, Chocolate Kiss, that toned down the brash, and even blended in my grey brown roots to make it all look natural.  This does not stain your pillow or anything, but will run if you are caught in the rain because it is a wash, not a chemical.  I will still use it sometimes to touch up my roots if I can&#x27;t find the time to do the Blend when I need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a small cast iron pot that I use to prepare my mixture in.  I brew very strong tea, say 6 tea bags boiled in one cup of water, boiled down to 1/2 cup of water, let it sit over night to really get strong.  Squeeze the tea out of the bags, put the tea leaves in your garden or around the base of your house plants.  I put the tea in the cast iron pot, and add the Nupur blend, a little at a time, stirring until pudding consistency or a little thicker.  I cover this with a plastic bag tightly and I let it sit a few days in a cool place so it won&#x27;t mold.  (You can let it sit for 3 hours or 10 days, but the sitting lets the gritty texture smooth it out and the longer it sits in that iron pot, the iron leaches into the mix, turning it from green to black, adding a darker tint your blond/light brown hair, would imagine that the iron leached from the pot is a good thing as well, absorbed in to your scalp.)  Keep it out of the sun in a cool place if you are leaving it for more than a day so it won&#x27;t mold.  The iron in the pot reacts with the herb blend and the tea and turns it almost black.  I mix full fat yoghurt and a scrambled raw egg in with the mixture when I am ready to apply it, for the fat and protein treatment.  Do not put oil in, it will make it hard for the hair to accept the color, but if color is not your desire, do put coconut oil in instead of yoghurt and egg and it will really condition your hair.  The amount of yoghurt I use depends on the consistency, 1/2 to 1 cup, not too runny, or you have a dripping mess, it will keep you awake, as it trickles it will tickle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had an easier time applying it to dry hair than wet hair.  I take a rat tail brush/dye applicator and part it in sections 1/4 inch, dab generously on my scalp along the part, brush into the roots and about 1 inch up on each side of the part, getting every hair soaked, parting every 1/4 inch and applying across my scalp until all my roots are covered. I apply whatever is left to the rest of my hair, if I have enough I apply it to all my hair, if not, I apply it to sections, it makes an interesting color variation that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cover my head with acheap plastic shower cap.  I mush the cap to my head and make sure that there is a thick towel or two on my pillow.  Put a beanie on my head, over the shower cap, or put a towel over my head to keep the heat in and go to sleep.  When I wake up in the morning, 8 hours later, I sit in the bottom of the shower to minimize splashing of the mess that I have to clean up later.  Cheap Suave shampoo works just as well as expensive shampoo, 2-3 washes and it runs clear.  I apply conditioner to my hair, and then as I sit there, I carefully, apply coconut oil, to my scalp only, parting the hair the same way that I did when I applied the blend, and touch the coconut oil to my scalp, then gently with my fingers under my hair, massage my scalp with the oil.  This helps the dryness that results from using this product.  When my hair is dry, I have shoulder length hair, I put it in a pony tail at the top of my head, like a whale spout and I apply the coconut oil to the hair that is sticking up, pretty much just the ends.  The hair will draw the oil down/up into the rest of the hair like a wick draws oil out of a lamp, so your hair does not get greasy with too much oil at the roots.  The scalp and the roots get nourished and in a week, the balance is back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is not dark enough, brew a big pot of tea, strong black tea, and cool it to room temperature.  I have a bench I lay on, and I set the big pot of tea on a stool so that it is level with the bench. I lay my head back into the pot to soak the hair for a while.  This is a natural dye, it will tone down the orange and the tannic acid in the tea also prevents your hair from falling out, so it is good for your hair.  Keep the tea refrigerated and repeat the soak a couple of days in a row until the desired color is achieved.  You can put the tea in bottles and keep it in the fridge to use as a final rinse in the shower to continue to darken your hair.  Do not rinse it out.  Your plants benefit from it as well if you don&#x27;t want to use it as a rinse, don&#x27;t waste it, use it to water your houseplants occasionally, it helps neutralize the salts that accumulate in potted plants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUESTION:  Does anyone have any advise to help with the itching of my scalp?  I have no dandruff, but my scalp does itch and drives me crazy if I don&#x27;t get enough coconut oil on it and sometimes even if I do, then I have to wash it more often because the coconut oil makes my hair greasy if I get too much on it.  Advise?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/16/14  I FOUND THE ANSWER TO MY QUESTION.  Teatree Oil shampoo and conditioner has taken the itch right away.  When i don&#x27;t use it, it comes right back.  I use the Paul Mitchel Generic Tea Tree Oil Shampoo and conditioner found at Sally&#x27;s.  They go on sale every now and then or a coupon will come out buy one get one free hair product and i purchase them at that time for $5 a bottle, regular price for a big bottle of a good shampoo.  I bet Teatree oil in the mix might help too.  I may try that next time.</li>
            <li> It is not pure henna and prob would cost the same for you to drive to a local store to pick up as it would in s&amp;h fees so there was no difference in purchasing online verse store. It worked well coating my hair and that was all I wanted from it.</li>
            <li> I  have  bought Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder 9 Herbs Blend, 150-gram 2  times before.  Don&#x27;t  know  why  this  time  it  came  in  unknown  looking  package. Henna  color  of  my  previous  Godrej is different than present one.  What&#x27;s  wrong with  that? My  concern, is  the  quality  same  as  before?</li>
            <li> Package was different and the product expired the previous month of my order.  I didn&#x27;t use it right away but would think it should last longer than a few months.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how others r using this, but me, I mixed it with water in a bottle and would squirt some on my hair after I shower. I leave it on there and then blowdry.</li>
            <li> This henna produces a really nice auburn shade on my blonde highlights.  My hair feels amazing after I rinse this treatment out, and the feeling usually lasts for about a week or so.  I&#x27;ve used this product a few times now, and it never disappoints me.  I do feel that my hair is stronger after doing these henna treatments, and the hair shaft actually looks thicker than my normal fine and wimpy strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The henna process takes so long, but for the way my hair feels I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> My dark hair takes on a slight auburn, but looks very natural and retains the natural color spectrum.  Grey is easier to tame and a nice glistening redish hue versus the unsightly salt on pepper color.  Seems to make my hair more manageable too.  I used it the second time with avocado oil and loved the results...  it does take about 3 shampoos, even if in a row, to completely rinse residue.  One bag is enough for a lot of applications.  I felt the need to do it again about 2-3 mos later.  Very gentle and smells earthy.  Wear disposable gloves to apply and a button down shirt you don&#x27;t care about.  I use a hair dye applicator brush and it is helpful.  Apply liberally, throw a bag over your hair and watch a movie or something.  Then, you&#x27;re done.  Rinse off your skin, I use a wet wipe after I&#x27;m done wrapping up my hair, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem with hairline stains.</li>
            <li> There are many recipes on you tube henna is a wonder conditioner for kinky curly hair. I use it every 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. I mix with coconut milk and the Henna releases almost immediately.Great color.  Best Henna I&#x27;ve ever used. Willl be buying again.</li>
            <li> The online description coveniently left out the fact that you have to soak this in water for two hours, and leave it on for 3-4 hours. If I had known that, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. I know henna takes a long time to develop, but I don&#x27;t want the color effects of henna. The description says, \\&quot;alma darkens hair and bringjai (I know that&#x27;s not the right spelling) makes hair black.\\&quot; So I figured that would counteract the redness of henna and that henna was just added to give conditioning benefits. Since I wanted to go back to my natural color of dark brown (I have some blonde  highlights), I figured I&#x27;d leave it on an hour or two to see what happens. It also never told how much water to add so I added a 1/2 cup hot water to about 2 tsp. of product which was way too much. It never became a paste despite adding some conditioner cream(Queen Helene) to it.     I guess I&#x27;m just not that much of a natural girl. I don&#x27;t like taking the time and dealing with the mess. It was very messy to apply - an arduous process, really. I left it on about two hours, and it did darken my hair a bit and turned my blonde highlights reddish. I guess that&#x27;s better than the noticeably grown-out blonde highlights, but it&#x27;s by no means back to my natural color. I think I&#x27;ll do another application of 2 hours and see what happens. I just wish it would&#x27;ve warned about redness, since the labeling leads you to believe that henna is not the prominent ingredient. Those who are more familar with herbs and their appearance would know, but I&#x27;m a newbie to natural coloring.</li>
            <li> Can you say OBSESSED.  This works so well I wanted to do it again the NEXT DAY.  This took my permed, fried, dried out hair and turned it into glossy, full, swinging, moist hair-of-a-lifetime in ONE USE!!!  That is not even the best part though!  Color.  Oh. My. God. The. Color.  I had dark brownish black hair with fried almost reddish ends.  This turned my strands a deep gorgeous mahogany color that I had envied on other women who use chemical dies.  I achieved the perfect deep, rich color with NO HARSH CHEMICALS.  In fact, I had been hoping for blue-black so I had purchased indigo which will now be returned because the henna color I achieved is so jaw-droppingly gorgeous that I would not dare change it.  I have placed this on subscription and plan to do it monthly as a strengthening treatment.  This makes your hair so glossy and healthy that I can see finally achieving the long, healthy hair I have dreamed of. For me the application was effortless and there was little to no mess in the shower.  You just have to refrain from wild motions or flinging and make sure and rinse away any of the product that gets on the tub or walls right away.  In application, I had not one drip and I would say this is due to not over-watering the mix and leaving it to \\&quot;set up\\&quot; overnight for dye release which made the mix creamy and easy to work with.  I applied in sections and left it on for 2.5 hours.  I rinsed thoroughly then conditioner washed twice with Aussie Moist.  When God made henna he knocked it out of the park.  We can only thank our lucky stars for this wonderfully natural way to color and restore hair!!!</li>
            <li> my bad I didnt realise this product is conditioning only, It gives no henna color like I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> Be careful when you by products like this online the one i was sent it was expired i don&#x27;t know if that make a difference but when you buy something most people wouldn&#x27;t want it to be 4 years old. I did notice until I had used half of it.</li>
            <li> I loved the results of this, I did a lot of research, read a lot of reviews and then did a strand and skin test, I do recommend everyone read properly. Be a well informed consumer with all the research I did I knew what the outcome would be, now don&#x27;t get me wrong I was really tired of washing my hair so much even after a week later it still turned my water a henna color, but I knew that could happen so I wasn&#x27;t surprised.  Doing the skin &amp; strand test (wish I used hair from my denman brush) made this part easy and of course I left a spot of the henna on my wrist but no reaction, great.  Please remember this can color your hair because it has a bit of henna along with the other powders that don&#x27;t dye your hair, so don&#x27;t be surprised.  I would probably purchase this again, but a bit in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color came out to be a beautiful cherry cola color and it also covered my few grays, I had already permanently colored my hair the beginning of this year and then about 3 months ago I was given a sample of the Hesh Amla powder (which I love), this you can also purchase on Amazon.  Between that time (salon color &amp; henna), I&#x27;ve again been researching and with good reason, this is permanent you want to make sure you do it right the first time without too many hiccups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was very fast with delivery, I only wish it was double sealed and had a crop date, I gave it 4 stars because of that and doing so many hair rinses, but oh well, as I said with the skin &amp; strand test I wasn&#x27;t surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAPPY Hennaing</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this for natural, chemical free hair color, especially for the price.  My hair is very dark and I use this to color the grey.  It gives my hair nice red streaks without looking harsh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time to use henna. I have chosen this particular product due to the fact it contains very good beneficial herbs! i was a bit histant at first due to the fact it was my first time to use henna and also i have coloured my hair 7 months ago with highlights! my natural hair colour is black or a very very brown color. the color it was before applying henna was dark brown with lighter brownish highlights!! i did a strand test it turned fine so i decided to apply it to my entire hair.  although the whole process of mixing and applying is very exhausting i really enjoyed it!!   The result is amazing!!! i hated my highlights and after the henna it turned them into a warm red colour ! LOVE IT! So far i feel that my hair is soft... i mixed lemon and coconut oil with the henna..and i washed it off with water only and conditioner...i will oil my hair tomorrow and wash it as usual with shampoo..can&#x27;t wait for my order to arrive .. perhaps i&#x27;ll henna again in 10 days time :)</li>
            <li> worked . I was satisfied with the out come of my natural hair. it has red highlight on the edges now.</li>
            <li> Used this product of the weekend and i used too much of the powder since my hair if very fine in body.  I have used henna in the past so i am well knowledgable about its benefits. My hair is beautifully coloured to a shade darker than its orginal brown with a &amp;#34;slight hint&amp;#34; of red/burgundy  It is a little messy but i am very pleased with the results and having found this product, as i use to purchase this product in the Uk where i am from. I will be purchasing more of this product because i suffer from Psorasis of the scalp and its herbs containing neem with help with my Psorasis. Once again thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> pretty good for the price, I dyed my entire head twice with just one package. gave a beautiful red tone to my black hair. others might not like it because it may show up brassy on them.</li>
            <li> If you are protein sensitive, I would not use this product. It acts just like a protein. You will have to deep condition immediately. I used the product just  as it is, and left it on for 30mins and did not deep condition afterwards, and got protein overload. My hair has not been the same afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;It will condition your hair, and strengthen it. Please research this product and look at video tutorials for any treatment before you pile in on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I tried this product is because I was told it made your hair soft. Not mine!&lt;br /&gt;It worked for others because they conditioned afterwards or their hair loves protein already. Figure out which one you are.</li>
            <li> I started using this brand of henna and I like it MUCH better than the ones I&#x27;ve used before. It makes my hair feel so much thicker and it looks so shiny. I have naturally chestnut brown hair and it colors my hair auburn. I get compliments on the color and shine all the time!</li>
            <li> Made detangling a breeze. Light color deposited on my hair, only obvious in the sun. Hair is stronger, noticeably thicker and easier to manage. I only use about half of the package because my hair isn&#x27;t too long but A+ for Nupur!</li>
            <li> I am a first time user of Henna and Nupur let&#x27;s say I was successful. This is some amazing stuff. I did a whether simple henna mixture with water, honey, and coconut oil. You can also rub this onto your scalp since one of the key ingredients, Neem, fight against dandruff and build up.  I applied it the next day and left in for about four hours. Afterwhich, I rised by dunking my hair in a bathtub of water to get majority of it out then backed up with a moisturizing conditioner since henna acts like a protein. I had a bit of a red tint and fabulous curls to my hair which I really liked a lot. I also once my hair was about 95% dry I moisturized and seal. Over a three day period, the henna gave my natural black hair a darker tint in the sunshine you can see the bungrudy. Now if you looking an immediate black dye, especially for my  black women, you also want to purchase some indigo. I will be using this particular of  henna more regularly, probably every three-four months.</li>
            <li> For $3.99 it is worth trying out.  That&#x27;s how I felt &amp; I am so happy with this stuff, I know I will be ordering it again!  Previously I tried other easier henna products.  My hair turned out pretty but it didn&#x27;t last long enough.  This stuff lasts!  When I noticed my white roots (I have white not gray hairs) it really hit home - this stuff lasts!  Finally something that wont kill me or my hair &amp; it actually works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions on the bag to the best of my ability since the directions are not exact.  The directions are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;Soak Nupur Mehendi in water for 2-3 hours.  You may add curd/oil for extra softness.  Apply paste evenly from root to tip of the hair.  Leave for 3-4 hours.  Rinse thoroughly with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I did it:&lt;br /&gt;I let the mixture soak over night rather than the 2-3 hours.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how much powder to use or how much oil/water.  I have very very long nearly black hair with a lot of noticeable white strands.  Since my hair is well past my bra line, I decided to mix half the bag.  I added some water &amp; some extra virgin organic coconut oil.  I mixed it all together.  I didn&#x27;t measure it out.  It seemed thick like pudding.  The next day I got out rubber gloves, a hair clip &amp; a plastic bag to cover my head (this stuff is not included).  I also grabbed a bottle of un-petroleum by Alba to put around my hairline to protect my skin from staining. I hopped in the shower &amp; washed my hair only.  Then I squeezed out the water. I dried my face &amp; neck real good, put on the un-petroleum, dried my hands real good &amp; put on the gloves.  Note:  I am still in the shower naked because this is messy!  Next I scooped out the mixture &amp; kept globing it on my head; massaging it into my scalp &amp; working it into my long tresses.  I made a huge mess but it was only on my naked self &amp; all over the shower stall!  I only ended up using a little over 1/4 of the amount I mixed!  I put the lid back on the glass jar &amp; once out of the shower I stuck it in the freezer for future use.  Anyway, I wrapped up my hair in a twist &amp; secured it with the hair clip.  Next I took off the gloves &amp; put the plastic bag over my head &amp; made it as tight as possible.  Next I took a shower, washing not only my messy self, but I hosed down the walls too!  I made sure to use a dark bath towel to dry my hair &amp; put on a black shirt.  I also put a old towel around my neck to catch the drips.  I did my usual work.  About 4 hours later I hopped back into the shower &amp; rinsed rinsed rinsed my hair.  Next I washed it.  Then I washed it again.  I used too much coconut oil so even though my hair was clean &amp; felt clean it looked greasy.  Once out of the shower, I towel dry my hair &amp; comb it with a big shower comb.  My hair dries silky soft &amp; no more white hairs!  Now the hairs are a reddish hue.  The rest of my hair is simply more shiny &amp; beautiful.  You simply cannot get this look from a chemical hair dye.  My hair color looks natural!  The dye holds but the color does fade.  However, it doesn&#x27;t fade so much that the white returns; that only happens on the new hair growth!  So I dye it again with the stuff saved in the freezer.  I used about half of what was left.  It came out just as lovely &amp; my hair is a dream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So considering my extra long hair, I would take a guess that one bag will easily provide me with 6 uses!  I can only imagine how many times you can use this on short hair!  This stuff is SO worth it!ezer for future use.  Anyway, I wrapped up my hair in a twist &amp; secured it with the hair clip.

            <li> Best henna  I ever used!</li>
            <li> I basically followed the tips of the other reviewers in mixing.  The product stayed on the time as instructed.  My hair felt more conditioned but even more the gray hair was now a red color.  It is a little like having highlights through out wherever the gray hair was.  I am waiting to see how long the color change last to determine whether I will upgrade to 5 stars.  Otherwise, I am satisfied with the turn out of the color and condition of hair.</li>
            <li> Im never using another type of Henna anymore.This henna is the best. It leaves my hair soft, strong and curlier and does not dry it out like other type of henna i have used. It even cured my itchy scalp.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this henna, it is superb quality fine grain.  This henna rinses out so well you dont have to worry with dunking your head in a bathtub mermaid like. I mix my henna in few ways. I am a henna head, I have been using henna for years, I stopped using henna for a while about 5 yrs ago and dyed my hair blonde.  OMG what a devastating catastrophe that was. My hair looked real good for about a year then starting breaking off in the front till I had to cut my hair..I went back to old faithful henna and will never dye with chemicals again. I mix my henna with tea let the dye release over night. I then put oils and yogurt or beet juice for more color or chamomile tea just what ever I concoct. The color is always a surprise and the best thing is that this brand has 9 herbs blended in it,,, I love Henna and will experiment with concoctions just to enjoy my henna time... I recommend this quality henna for all you will love it try it,,&lt;br /&gt;God bless and have a great henna time....</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, red hair.  I use this powder to help it stay healthy and give it an extra boost of color.  People are always asking me what my secret is, and if my color is natural.  It is a very natural color, and I like to apply it once every 2 or 3 weeks so I never have roots that show.  It&#x27;s subtle enough, that even when I do it more rarely it stays looking good roots and all.  When I have tried chemical dyes, they just strip the moisture from my hair, make my curls limp, and look bad when my roots start to show.  This stuff is a lot healthier, and it smells earthy instead of like a box of toxic chemicals that are gonna fry me to death.  It also keeps my scalp from getting dandruff.  My hair is so soft, clean, and shiny after using it.  My curls stay bouncy and don&#x27;t frizz.  It&#x27;s amazing to have a natural dye that is good for the hair and scalp.  It&#x27;s also a major bonus that I can keep applying it on a regular basis, and it continues to treat my hair every time.  I leave it in over night, and rinse it out in the shower in the morning.  So easy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair Chocolate Brown (store box and retouch every 4-6 wks) for 3 yrs now. The last 4 months my hair has been falling out a lot. So, I decided to get a hair cut up to my shoulders and stop using chemical dye (this happened 3 wks ago). I decided to try this Henna (last night) because I saw and heard good reviews.  I mixed 1 1/2 Cup of Nupur, 1 Cup of Coffee, 2 tbsp of Olive Oil, 2 tbsp of Apple Cider Vinegar. I covered it, let it sit for 10 hrs.  Then applied on my roots put on a plastic cap and left it in for 2 1/2 hours. I had to rinse with A LOT of conditioner (Silk Therapy Conditioner by Biosilk) my roots were Orange, my son said \\&quot;Your hair looks like Blanka&#x27;s from Street Fighter\\&quot; LOL..  Now, it&#x27;s dark orange with some red.  Does anyone know how to mix this to get dark brown hair.  Thank You</li>
            <li> This was my second time dying my hair with Henna. I used Rainbow brand first, I really did like it but it is more expensive than i&#x27;d like and there&#x27;s not very much. So I bought three packages of Nupur Mehendi. I am glad I did.     I used about half a package which was way more than I needed! I added apple cider vinegar and water and mixed it to a pudding consistency then covered it with plastic wrap and let the dye release over night. The next day i washed my hair, toweled dried it, combed it and put it into 4 sections. I&#x27;ve heard henna can make your hair a little dry so I added two tablespoons of Cholesterol conditioner in the henna and mixed it well. Then I applied the Henna. Make sure you have gloves on! When I was done I wrapped my head with plastic wrap then put a towel around it. It helps contain heat, which helps a lot. I left it on for about 2 and a half hours. You can leave it on overnight too if you want. Make sure you rinse a lot to get all of it out, use moisturizing shampoo then rinse again several times. Condition, rinse again, and you&#x27;re good to go.     My hair was dark brown from when i used the rainbow henna. my roots were starting to show as well, my natural color is a mousy brown. my hair is now a beautiful dark brown with copper/red tones to it. it did darken as the day has gone on. My hair is totally soft, full of body and very shiny! I am very happy with my results!    **Update**  I bought three packages of this and I haven&#x27;t even used all of the first, my hair is medium length. I have used it 4 times. My hair has grown atleast 2 inches in a month. My hair doesn&#x27;t break into little pieces like before, my dandruff has completely gone away, and my hair in shiny as ever! I will never use chemical dye ever again!</li>
            <li> this is the smoothest henna ive ever seen. it is so easy to apply and wash and leaves hair shiny and strong. However, my hair quickly changes color so I just leave it there for about an hour and then wash it away. also i add some 40% indigo to it and it gives me a wonderful color and covers all my gray.</li>
            <li> After reading the review I utilized suggestion from each.  I mixed the henna with one cup of coffee, one cup of water, coconut oil, soy bean oil and 2 whipped eggs.  I let the mixture sit for 4 hours and left in my hair for 4 hours.  I did however wash out with shampoo after rinsing because I am very sensitve to smells. My has natutral red highlights and the henna covered my gray hair nicely and the red highlights shades appear so much better than using previous hair coloring products.  It has been a week since applying and my hair is silky soft, has a beutiful shine and just seems so much fuller.  I will use henna over commerical hair coloring prodcts.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s nourished my hair and make much brighter look and silky. Now my hair can manage easily. I am going to use this product continuously, because its 100% natural .price also fair. Thanks Godrej and Amazon.....!</li>
            <li> I would give this like 20 stars if I could! This is pure magic for my hair. My hair had started to thin ( I am guilty of using the dryer). It was getting pretty obvious and I decided to do something about it. So I stopped using the dryer of course and started looking for some natural ( risk free) help for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Read on some Indian forum that henna helps. I  picked Godrej Nupur in the Indian store , just because I recognised the Godrej brand. And Wow!!  Not only is my hair thicker , it is also silky and my dandruff is pretty much cured.&lt;br /&gt;Will never stop using!!! Miracles/Magic does exist :)</li>
            <li> Great henna! Pure henna, never had a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> Great henna and even better when mixed with indigo and coconut milk!</li>
            <li> For those who want to be chemical free this is it. This is a henna so it tints your hair red but you can buy the indigo powder to mix in to make it darker I haven&#x27;t had to tint my hair for the last two months. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> love it hair nice and shiny</li>
            <li> I personally love this brand. Like all henna, it is a little drying. But mix it with some coconut oil and conditioner and it should relieve the dryness enough.&lt;br /&gt;This was easy to mix and apply. I know many complain about the difficulties of applying henna. I recommend you mix the henna in a plastic, wider bucket. Then when you&#x27;re ready to apply, place the bucket mix inside your bathtub, and flip your hair upside down into the bucket. Work from the tips into the scalp. This reduces the mess.&lt;br /&gt;This mix had a lot in the bag. I think I could have split the bag in half for two uses. My hair is reaches down to axillary (armpit) level to give you some idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I was told to use plastic because henna can tarnish metal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a henna expert,but I liked this product. I felt that it made my hair shiny and conditioned but I felt that the effects lasted only a couple of weeks unlike the color which is lasting much longer. This henna also made my hair pretty red...my sister says she likes the color but I&#x27;m not so sure I do. I&#x27;m thinking of trying \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; henna in the future once the red dye disappears. I&#x27;ve read online that henna dye only lasts like 28 washes. I will admit that I did two applications of henna but it&#x27;s been months (I think close to six months) and my hair is still really red. Wasn&#x27;t expecting my hair to stay red for so long!!!</li>
            <li> This was the first henna treatment I&#x27;ve done. I mixed it with 100gm of indigo as well as a little lemon juice, honey and Vatika Oil. Left on for 6hrs. The color was a warm reddish brown. Beautiful! I will certainly buy this henna again!</li>
            <li> I am 100 percent convinced that this product has petrochemicals in it. It turned my hair to straw and it also made it a neon shade of orange--the same orange as Stephen King&#x27;s clown in the movie made based on his book, \\&quot;It.\\&quot; Most of the other people complaining do not seem to understand that henna does turn your hair some shade of orange not brown or black. But this herb mix does not turn your hair any color that herbs and plants could. It turns it a shade that only a man made chemical could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used henna for years. Over the years, I have used henna from various sources and have never had my hair damaged or turned this strange color of neon orange. The color was very unnatural. All of the hennas I have personally used do turn my hair orange but never this strange color of orange. It was extremely unnatural looking.This product absolutely fried my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is nearly down to my belly button and it was shiny and soft. Now it has a texture like straw and looks dull. It was especially horrible the first weeks after using this product. I have done my best to condition my hair but I think the damage is permanent. I had a great deal of breakage after using this. Usually, in the shower I get pieces of hair more than a foot long that get pulled out. That is normal. But after using this, I was getting lots and lots of pieces that were only a couple inches long. That has never happened to me before. This product fried my hair so badly that pieces of it were breaking off everywhere. So the product must have damaged my hair all along the hair shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a fraud. I still have some of the product. I wonder if there is anywhere that I can send this to be analyzed that protects against consumer fraud.</li>
            <li> I have tried this and loved it!  much better then chemicals.  Mixed in coffee, essential oils of lavender and pachouli, coconut oil and melted cocoa butter.  beautiful color! Covered up my greys.</li>
            <li> It colors well and covers greys/whites perfectly. Nice quality product.</li>
            <li> This product is nice.  It works, but it is messy</li>
            <li> Love, Love Love this product. My hair has never been stronger or healthier! I blend this with Zena Indigo once a month. I use this product by its self once a week. I think I am addicted! Hair feels so soft, I should be bald as much as I play in my hair now! HA HA HA.. The package is larger than I expected. i only use 75g mixed with warm coffee and 2tbsp of olive oil. I mix into a paste does not drip I let it sit covered for 4 hours then I apply to my hair and leave on for 4 hours then rinse well until clear then I do a final rinse with apple cider vinegar. I am so happy customer for life!</li>
            <li> I am a first time henna user and I love how easy this was to mix and apply.  True, it was a bit messy but I was expecting that because I researched henna before I started using it.  It made my hair a nice reddish brown as my hair is naturally quite dark brown, almost black.  It made my hair feel so soft and it looked amazingly shiny!  It covered the few gray hairs I have quite well and they blend nicely.  I will never go back to box dye again!</li>
            <li> This was my first time using this Nupur Mehendi. It left my hair manageable, soft, shiny and healthy. I purchased four packs at once and will be back for more.</li>
            <li> Make your hair soft, silky and shiny. I really like the result, after dying my hair with this henna. Usually my hair has dark brown color, but after using this product my hair became reddish and I love how it&#x27;s looks now. Also the product is safe, it&#x27;s contains just natural ingredients there are no harsh chemicals in it and makes your hair looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I use this henna powder for my monthly henna hair treatments. Best henna I&#x27;ve ever used! My hair was super soft and shiny after using it. I definitely think that 9-herb blend makes all the difference! I would def recommend this product! I&#x27;ve add it to my Amazon subscriptions!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now, and it is so far my favorite henna product. I have deep, dark hair with very early graying (whiteing would be more accurate). I only need to do roots about every 4 weeks, and the white hairs get a deep auburn color, which is very nice. Even my hair stylist asked me who did my highlights, because they were exceptionally well done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips for first-time users:&lt;br /&gt;- Mix the henna to a peanut butter consistency with an acidic medium (bottled lemon juice works well). If you have very sensitive hair, use a less acidic medium, like pineapple juice or tea. It will be on your head for a while, so avoid using coffee or vinegar (it smells foul).&lt;br /&gt;- Cover the mix with plastic wrap (it needs to be tight, make sure the plastic is in contact with the mix), and let it rest for 24h in a warm (not hot) place. This will let the dye release.&lt;br /&gt;- Before applying, cover all surfaces with old newspaper (this will permanently stain wood).&lt;br /&gt;- Wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo or with baking soda. Use a vinegar rinse if you can (1 cup of water with 2-3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar works well).&lt;br /&gt;- IMMEDIATELY after, apply the henna to your hair. Start at the bottom and work in small sections towards the top of your head. Note that, once you start applying, you won&#x27;t be able to comb through your hair anymore.&lt;br /&gt;- Cover your hair with a shower cap or plastic wrap tightly (avoid too much air from getting in a drying the mixture; once it dries, it is not active anymore).&lt;br /&gt;- Leave it on for a minimum of 4 h (overnight if you can).&lt;br /&gt;- Rinse thoroughly with water and conditioner (you&#x27;ll use a ton of conditioner, so get a cheap one for this purpose) until the water runs clear. NO SHAMPOO for at least 24 h.&lt;br /&gt;- The color oxidizes with time, so your initial color will be greenish or really red for about 24-48 h.&lt;br /&gt;- There will be some dye release with the first few shampoos, but the dye has already dried out and will wash out of your towels.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price. Read the instructions and hints from other users in feedback.</li>
            <li> Awesome awesome.  Colors my grey but made my hair a bit reddish.  I have long dark brown hair with red tones I think the next time I am to in to use a darker color</li>
            <li> I love the conditioning effect, not quite sure if I need to use it again nor whether or not I like the brassy red hair instead of my gray hairs.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and the product is great!! I used it with beetroot,coffee,egg,mayo and lemon and my hairs were unbelievably shiny and soft. It doesn&#x27;t color hair dark in one application though you will have to use the whole packet and it works very well for coloring hairs.</li>
            <li> Prior to this experience I would go to Indian hair salons to get henna treatments. This product was easy to use and delivered good results. I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I mixed it up to pudding like consistancy with tea lemon and oil and left it for 4 hour ls and then left it on my hair over night. I&#x27;m black, so my hair is dark brown, now my hair has a reddish brown tint to it and is really really soft and strong!! It did however take forever to wash out but I would buy it again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> i think i must have read over a hundred reviews on this henna i did a lot of research on doing henna...i was really hesitant about my hair coming out this god awful red...but it came out soooo pretty sooo soft and shiny...i&#x27;m not big on the smell but i decided to stop putting harsh chemicals on my hair a to go with a more natural approach...i&#x27;m 39 years old and have been dying my hair for years i&#x27;m brunette but the gray hairs are not for me i HATE them!..i love the way my hair came out but my roots are very red still pretty though...i reordered this one and the indigo to i think next time i will mix a little indigo with it..i will review again and let you know my results...my hair right now after this henna feels amazing!!</li>
            <li> It gave my hair a nice color and what is more important for me, my hair feels strong and silky. I love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product so far I have only bought it twice but was able to freeze my remaining left overs to use a second time. I am already planning on getting more, it came right on time which was great because I hate waiting and too cheap to pay for the one-business day:s. My hair is softer, shinier, and I can easily see the color after just two applications. It will leave your hair a little dry after (like a day or so) but it is sooo worth it.</li>
            <li> It made my hair so defined ( the curls) pop. But my hair did not change color at all because my hair is really dark so there was no tint of red or anything..  Will recommend..</li>
            <li> Used this to condition hair. Followed directions exactly and had Bright orange hair. I&#x27;ve already spent $100 to cover. I have to go back in two weeks to color again. I liked my gray blend. Now I look totally awful and my heart is broke. Will cost e lots of money and dignity. KS</li>
            <li> I had to update my Review now that I have used it multiple times with different mixes and must say this is the best henna mix/ blend that I have found. I use this to strengthen my hair/ retain length/ grow hair and it has been amazing. I am protein sensitive so finding something to strengthen hair is hard but this does the trick. So great had to write a review. Here is a video of how I mix the Henna and my results as well as how I apply the henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a more detailed video of my experience, Hope this helps someone out there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://youtu.be/bnek1f2QjtA</li>
            <li> I love this blend. I first started using this after I started loosing my hair. It nourishes your roots to have a healthy scalp. It is a pain in the butt to completely rinse off. It usually takes me 2 or 3 washes to completely get it off. My hair is very healthy and I stopped loosing my hair. I do not have much to say about the color, I don&#x27;t have any grays in my hair yet. I will say that it makes the hair of my color a bit brownish-reddish which I don&#x27;t mind at all. If you want your hair darker, adding indigo will do the trick. It does stain the skin, I learned that through my first application. I applied with my bare hands thinking &amp;#34;if I wash it off right away, it will come off&amp;#34; BIG MISTAKE! you must use gloves or have yellow hands all week long, so be careful not to leave on ears or forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair also grew longer, and that&#x27;s due to the healthiness of my roots and hair. My hair use to be brittle and would brake off very easy. I had shoulder length hair and now (1 year after first application) is half way down my back. Its just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Hair One as part of my hair care routine. It is a mild hair cleanser conditioner and it is very gentle with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just amazing!</li>
            <li> This made my hair soft and feel really good, and did give it a slight red tint, which I wanted! However, there was some residue left in my sisterlocks. Little specks of sand-like stuff were stuck in some of my locks, which were not there before! I&#x27;ve used other henna products, and that did not happen, so I can only attribute it to this brand of henna. If I had loose hair, it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem, because it would just wash out, but with locks, the sand-like stuff gets trapped in the lock and make the lock look dirty! I will not purchase again as long as I have locks, but will recommend to other loose-haired folks.</li>
            <li> i bought this thinking it would make my mousy brown hair a rich dark brown but fortunately my husband said her hair looked red on the front and I did some researching and it does turn hair a red color.  the packaging is very misleading</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this natural henna! My hair being a little dry, I mixed in some hair conditioner to it before applying to my hair and left it on for 3hrs. Also added some lime juice. The result was - super soft and shiny hair. Regular use and leaving it on for 4-5 hrs gives a beautiful color to the hair. Would positively recommend it.</li>
            <li> We use this to color our grey hair - it is a natural product that the hairdresser will apply for you at a huge cost.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I mixed mine with water, coconut oil, honey, almond oil and a little olive oil. I usually have extremely coarse hair, it still feels a little coarse even after I relax it and after I washed the henna out my hair was sooooo soft. I blow dried my hair, went to sleep and flat ironed my hair the next morning. I have very dark hair with honey blond highlights that are almost all grown out. Now my hair is dark brown and what&#x27;s left of my high lights is brownish-reddish. You can only see the new color of my hair in the sun or a bright light. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I started to have some gray. I used a chemical dye that comes with a hair conditioner to cover my gray hair.  My hair feel soft only when I used the conditioner, but if I use my own conditioner I have to use more to soften my hair.  Actually my skin is sensitive with most chemical products.  I can&#x27;t use to much hair conditioner, gel, oil, or even some shampoo.  I will have some bump like pimple on my head.  Since the hair dye is irritated my skin and damage my hair, I looked for alternative way.  I found the Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder 9 herbs.  I saw many good review about it, so I tried.  At first I though it is just a marketing effort to make people buy, but I still believe that some review should come from the real people.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;am an Asian with dark brown almost black hair. I want the dark brown to match my natural color, so I use with indigo.  I mix the henna with warm water and leave it over night, then mix with indigo and a little coconut oil later.  I put on my hair for a bout 5 hours.  I rinse with warm water until most of dirt out and use hair conditioner to help rinse the rest out.  I don&#x27;t use any acidic because my hair is a little dry and my skin is sensitive.  Only warm water is good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;The result is wonderful.  I got my beautiful nice and shiny hair back. I feel very good every time I touch my hair.  It took two applications to cover my damage hair (once a month).  I henna all my hair first, and do only root cover one week later.  The henna cover my gray better than a Chemical dye because I can leave the henna on my hair as long as I want and redo it as much as I want without damage my hair.  It takes time and effort.  I need to plan ahead.  The result is too good to deny.&lt;br /&gt;Additional suggestion:  Now I start to add about one to two table spoon of Bragg ACV in to the mixture.  It helps to bring out more color and easier to clean.  It is not irritate my skin and hair.  I just heard so many good things about the Bragg ACV so I try.</li>
            <li> I love this 9 herb blend! I&#x27;m black, my hair is natural, I use it once (sometimes twice) a month as a deep conditioner and it does amazing things for my curls. They look amazing for the week after I use this blend. Downside, it smells like dirt and will stain anything it touches so wear gloves. Upside, the staining also happens to your hair so, if you&#x27;re like me and your hair is mostly black with some reddish natural highlights and you&#x27;re tired of the &amp;#34;Do you die your hair?&amp;#34; comments, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I have premature gray, I have dark brown hair that was heavily salted with gray. I am going all natural with my hair, no more BS &amp;#34;no-lye&amp;#34; perms and no more chemical colors. I will admit I had doubts that this would tackle my gray. Well it did, it gave my dark brown hair the most beautiful copper high lights, the women who do box braids in my town were impressed and knew only Henna could give my hair this rich beautiful deep copper highlights. Henna strengthen my hair, when I was perming my hair and getting braids, prior to using it, some of my hair would fall out from the cruel stress and mistreatment I use to do my hair, henna repaired and colored my hair in one treatment. If your looking for a fast quick fix, henna can color and treat your hair but you will work for it. You want to start by washing your hair, 1st. I washed my hair the day before I used the henna. Henna needs to mixed, I used half a cup of orange juice, 1/4 of cup of lemon ginger tea, ( you can make the lemon ginger tea by just cutting up a small lemon and cutting a thin slice of fresh ginger add to 1 cup of water and boiling it for about 5 to 6 minutes) than 1 to 2 table spoons of olive oil. Another fun thing about henna you what other have posted on here and on the web or create a recipe that works for your hair type. Mix it until its like pudding. It should turn from green to a brownish color, leave it to sit in warm place for at least 24hrs, I used my stove and left the stove light on. Next just plan on being home for most of the day because it has to set on your hair for 4-6hrs. It is very messy, I used an old towel that I didn&#x27;t care if it got stained around my shoulders. I sectioned my hair into 4 parts, starting from the hair at the base of my skull I applied it making sure it coated all my hair. Next I tied an old grocery bag around my head, you need to keep your head warm and moist, a shower cap will also work. Than I cleaned my house and watched a movie while letting the henna do its thing on my hair. I left it on for 6 hrs, I had a lot of gray. I rinsed it out until the water ran clear which didn&#x27;t take long. Than I washed my hair and conditioned it. Be advised henna will make your hair feel hard, I consider it a protein treatment you will need to do some serious conditioning to soften your hair, like a hot oil treatment. I did not really care about my hair feeling &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;  I did not want to soften my hair because I was getting it braided the next day and I wanted my hair strong to stand up to the stress of braiding. I have had my hair braided for one month after henna and no hair brakeage!&lt;br /&gt;  Once you get the whole henna journey complete you will have a great color added to your dark hair and if you have gray like me, you have a natural solution for your gray. In a month I have not seen on single strand of grey yet!!! I want to add that henna adds color to the natural color of dark hair, it will not alter your color. If you have light hair check out how other reviews with light hair worked with henna to find something that works for you. If want something like fire engine red you will not get that with henna unless its has some other  chemical agent added to it. If you are seeking other colors not natural to human hair color you will have use chemicals to get that.its thing on my hair. I left it on for 6 hrs, I had a lot of gray.

            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to rinse grit out of my hair forever when I use this henna mix.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different henna products, on my dark brown graying 59 year old dark brown graying male head  This is got to be the best henna I&#x27;ve ever used.!  I&#x27;ve used Rainbow, Light Mountain, Surya, henna from henna for hair, and jamila, none have the quality of this henna!  I mix this a few tablespoons,because i keep my hair short, with a capful of mustard oil, olive oil and cocunut oil (Vatika is a fabulous oil), and brewed tea.  I let it sit for 24 hours in a sealable plastic bowl.  When i am ready to apply it I mix a tablespoon of indigo with a pinch of salt in hot water and let it sit for 10 minutes, then combine the two.  I dampen my hair, towel dry and apply with a tint brush, leave on four hours, rinse, lightly shampoos, rinse with cheap conditioner again then shampoo and condition and rinse again.  The first results are dark brown, where my hair is dark brown, and a russett color where I am gray, in the next few days the russet turns to a nice mahogany/burgundy.  Women stop me on the street and ask me what hair color I use, and I tell them it&#x27;s henna.  Two things I &#x27;ve learned from my years of hennaing is:  Body Quality Henna like this is the way to go, also it is god to add a little salt to your indigo. I used to work in a hospital, and asked many middle eastern co-workers about tips about Mehendi which is the ancient art of henna.  They suggested mustard oil, also mixing it in a iron vessel.  I am still looking for a old cast iron pot.  This henna it the holy grail of hennas!</li>
            <li> I have been using Henna for over third years as a conditioner for my hair.  I have chin length Asian brown - black hair and have used quite a few brands.  Most people complain about the smell, this brand smells just like any of the other hennas I have used in the past..this is the smell of henna because it is a natural herb!.  However, this brand is by far superior to any brand I have ever used!!!  My hair has never been so shiny!  I used 1/3 of the bag and about 4 TBS of the Zenia indigo henna to tone down the orange color.  I first mixed this henna with hot water to a yogart consistency the night before and then refrigerated it for a few hours the next day to bring out more color.  I also added fractionated coconut oil and some lavender oil to this mixture.  Then the next day, I mixed the indigo henna with hot water and let that set for 10 to 15 minutes before adding it it to the Mehendi mixture.  Then mixed the whole thing real well.  I left it on for 6 hours and then rinsed well with water and used a conditioning shampoo to rinse out the henna until the water ran clear.  This henna also rinsed out very easy, not like some of the other brands I have used in the past.  The color in my hair is superb!  In the sun it gives off a reddish mahogany color!  I will be using this henna from now on, it is also much creamier than the other brands I have used, there was no grittiness at all.  I really hope Amazon never stops selling it!  I immediately ordered another 20 bags because I never want to run out!  Henna is the most natural way to give some nice shine and highlights to your hair if you have dark hair.  If you have grey hair, of course it will turn orange, that is what henna does!  And that is why you should use the indigo to tone down the red or orange tones!  If you have blond hair, then this may not be an option for you unless you want red tones in your hair.</li>
            <li> I tried henna for the first time this weekend. A bit messy but you&#x27;ll get used to it. Love the color, and thinking about doing it again weekly for the next month. My hair has never been so shiny and healthy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second time purchasing this henna, and I absolutely love it. After first use my hair got so shiny and beautiful that I decided to use it every second week.</li>
            <li> I followed the steps described in the top review here and so far had no problems and love the results. My hair is now soft, silky and even feels stronger and thicker than ever before. I&#x27;ve been chemically dying my hair for years now and after last salon highlight my hair got really burnt at the ends so I decided to look for a new option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the mixture of 1/4 pack of henna, 1/4 pack of indigo powder and some coconut oil (and water). I leave it for as long as I have patience to sit around with a plastic bag on my head, trying hard not to stain anything around me - I usually survive about 6 hours. My hair is thin and almost shoulder length so the pack lasts me 4 uses (awesome deal!). The smell is strong but I already got used to it, and really it&#x27;s not much worse than the strong chemical smell of regular hair colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My natural color is medium dark that looks a bit grey and flat compared to dyed hair and henna leaves my hair dark brown with slight reddish/copper undertones - really pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product and will never go back to chemical dyes. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I honestly believe the seller is writing most of these reviews. This product turn my dirty blonde hair into pure red. My hair is normally soft and still feels the same so all I got out of this was red hair... THUMBS DOWN</li>
            <li> This henna leaves my hair feeling softer and stronger after application. However, it is imperative that a deep conditioner is used after rinsing out the henna or else your hair will be dry. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of gritty residue.</li>
            <li> I guess I was feeling daring when I decided to order this product.  I&#x27;ve been researching and checking out youtube videos of women who tried this particular brew, so I decided to mix it all up over the holiday weekend.  Glad I did, because this product made me think how fun chemistry would have been had my instructor had the class brew up some Nupur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 plastic bowl and plastic spoon&lt;br /&gt;1 cup of hot coffee and hot water&lt;br /&gt;Hemp seed oil tablespoon&lt;br /&gt;Grape seed oil tablespoon&lt;br /&gt;Sunflower oil teaspoon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mixed until it looked like thick chocolate frosting&lt;br /&gt;covered refrigerated overnight&lt;br /&gt;Next day:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few more stirs and I was ready to put it on my head.  I started from roots to ends then put on my &#x27;jerri curl&#x27; plastic cap and let it sit for 2.5 to 3hrs.  I started to panic at this point, because I saw a strand of hair turn fiery red.  I was so scared my hair was going to fall all out or it would be orange/blonde.  I started thinking about lead poisoning and how I could contact the CEO of this product.  That&#x27;s when I started washing...  I used shampoo-conditioner more shampoo then more conditioner repeat 7times.  My sink looked like tan sand and I was exhausted at this point so I put a deep conditioner in my hair and let it sit overnight.  The next morning I performed about 2 additional washes...ok 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was all set and my hair has never been so clean.  My hair curled up and a few strands were red, but overall my natural hair color has not changed and my hair didn&#x27;t fall out.  Once it dried it was not frizzy or fuzzy.  I liked this product and I may do it again but no time soon.</li>
            <li> I do not like product, just my personal opinion. It didn&#x27;t seem to do much and just smells bad. ..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m doing it wrong or what, but i don&#x27;t see what all the hype is about. yes it mixes well with my indigo and gives a red tint to my hair. I didn&#x27;t find it to be very moisturizing and i think my hair is shedding a lot more ever since i used it. I&#x27;ve done it twice and i added olive oil one time and yogurt the other. maybe it&#x27;s just not enough moisture for my curl pattern. 3b/c.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands of henna over the past year .  I hate to say it but most henna powders I have used just didn&#x27;t seemed to do a very good job of covering my white hair. This brand worked very well because it covered my white hair without any difficulty.  This product was also very easily washed out.  I will buy again because it has a great price too!</li>
            <li> I have dark, weak, frizzy hair, and this brought my hair back to life.&lt;br /&gt;I only used it twice so far (one month apart), but my hair feels soft, heathy, stronger, and neater (less frizz) along with coppery sheen. My scalp feels clean as opposed to greasy (it usually gets oily, I can&#x27;t skip hair wash every morning)... also noticeably less hair loss while shampooing. Heck, think there is even a spur of hair growth! Yes, needs effort and a block of your precious time, but sooo much better than other artificial conditioners and hair colors on the market. I mean, I tried everything, jojoba oil, Pytho, Kerastase, Ojon, etc., but nothing worked and lasted like this. I added a squirt of evening primrose oil and an egg for half a bag of Nupur. My aging mother on the other hand was not very impressed- her gray hair turned totally orange, and did not see much conditioning effect either. The mixture was a bit watery than I hoped it to be when I applied it to her hair, but apart from that I am not sure why our results differ so much. But doesn&#x27;t cost much, it&#x27;s worth a try if you are in dire need of deep conditioning...!</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with henna. Its been a month since I have applied the product and I have to say my have still feels and looks amazing still, even better I only used half the bag!</li>
            <li> This stuff was great. Gives my natural hair an amazing shine. I mixed with coconut milk, coconut oil, olive oil, aloe Vera juice, and honey,</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Been using this henna for at least 2 years!&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair thicker every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Colors my grey hair in a nice dark orange tint and colors my brown hair with subtle shades of copper.&lt;br /&gt;I make a whole batch with lemon juice and keep it in a glass jar in the fridge until I run out!</li>
            <li> This turned my scalp &amp; gray hairs orange, I left in for 3 hours...To inconvenient...I&#x27;m going back to the henna color kit.</li>
            <li> I have been using this henna for more than 4 months and I love how my natural hair is shiny, defined, and more importantly MANAGEABLE! A plus for me (may be a con for some) is that it left a nice ruby red tint on my highlights.&lt;br /&gt;The only con (like with ALL hennas) is that it takes forever to get out and make.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Good result.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was willing to give this henna a shot, since some said it left their hair shiny and healthy looking. But I am a little disappointed in the results. First, as others have mentioned, it was gritty (possible sand) and second, most of the color has seemed to wash out in less than two weeks time (which has never happened to me with other brands). So it appears I will need to Henna again before I was planning to.&lt;br /&gt; And last but not least, while I was using the henna my head started hurting I washed it off hours later, went to bed and woke up with my swollen shut! I have never had my eye do that before, apparently I must be allergic to one of the herbs added in. However, i know that is not the companies fault that I am allergic but, as a warning if your sensitive, this may not be the product for you.&lt;br /&gt; All in all (without the allergic reaction) this product is just okay, I have tried a few different hennas on my hair and all have been better than this. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color isn&#x27;t a color at all--a dark dishwater blonde.  I knew that henna would likely cause a drastic change, and it did.  After the first application my hair was coppery red and shone in the sun.  I let it grow until the roots were about a 1/2 inch long and then hennaed it again. No more roots, and the color is even redder and richer than before.  I love it!  Even before reapplication, the roots weren&#x27;t overly obvious, but upon close inspection it looked as though my hair was growing in gray due to the contrast between the rich henna color and my natural lack of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use, I mixed the henna into a paste with bottled lemon juice and let it sit over night to release.  I used half the mix for the first application, freezing the rest.  My hair is about shoulder length now and thick, and half a pack was just enough the second time, though it was plenty on the first application.  All in all, this is a cheap and fun way to get gorgeous hair!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use henna for the purpose of coloring my hair. Rather, I use it for conditioning my hair and for keeping my scalp psoriasis under control. I do realize there are already many reviews for this item but here is my 2 cents:&lt;br /&gt;-A little bit about my hair: I have almost hip length hair, trying to grow into classic length (halfway of the body). I&#x27;m of Southeast Asian and Arabic descents and my hair is of reflect of that: dark brown to black, straight (with some random curly coily strand) and  thick (actually not as thick as it&#x27;s used to be due to some medications I was on 2 years ago).&lt;br /&gt;-How I use the Godrej Henna Mix:&lt;br /&gt;+ Every 1 1/2 month as my main henna herbal hair pack. I mix it with organic whole milk yogurt, egg (if i have it on hand), oil (melted coconut oil, jamaican black castor oil, or homemade hair oil), lime juice (if i have on hand, i use it mainly for its refreshing scent), essential oils (if i feel like it). The FULL FAT yogurt is the key here, as it helps tremendously in the process of rinsing the henna out of the hair. I&#x27;ve tried without yogurt in the past and it was a lot harder to rinse out and my hair felt coarser.&lt;br /&gt;+In my homemade hair oil.&lt;br /&gt;-Color: The Godrej Mix gives my hair a nice \\&quot;cherry\\&quot; chocolate color, whereas Karishma henna makes my hair a lot redder.&lt;br /&gt;If I desired a darker shade for my mane, I usually add in additional bhringraj powder, black tea or coffee.</li>
            <li> I have henna&#x27;d my hair before with lower quality henna. It put me off, but I decided to give it another try. This product made my hair a wonderful deep red while conditioning it. I will be buying this product again for myself and for a friend who loved the color so much she requested I henna her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recipe:&lt;br /&gt;-henna&lt;br /&gt;-coffee&lt;br /&gt;-sage&lt;br /&gt;-cinnamon&lt;br /&gt;-yogurt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left in overnight it came out beautiful. Easy in and easy out. I expected more mess and not enough. My hair is wild frizzy and halfway down my back. It&#x27;s a light ashy brown. It&#x27;s calm, silky and auburn now. One package was just perfect.</li>
            <li> Well.... product mixes up well, but does smell like canned spinach, which I don&#x27;t really mind. BEWARE.... it is MESSY. Next time I will be prepared with gloves and possibly an application bottle if it will work. Gives a nice tingly sensation on scalp. Will update in a couple days to see how it turns out...</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife. Generally she prefer other brands back in India but none of those were available hence went for this. It gives red/orange shade to the hairs. Only bad thing is while applying she experienced some hair fall.</li>
            <li> Beware, it turned MY hair orange/red...not brown like the pic. shows. I am very disappointed. When mixed, it is brown, however i should have known it was orange because it stained my hands orange. I only kept it on my hair for 30 minutes, can&#x27;t imagine what color i would have ended it with if i had left it on for 3-4 hrs as they suggest.</li>
            <li> after reading about henna treatments on long haircare forum i decided to try henna. i wasnt sure which brand to use. i chose nupur because it had various ingredients that are beneficial to your hair. well i mixed my nupur with green tea and let it sit for about two days. it had good dye release. i added some coconut oil and conditioner before applying. i let it sit overnight. washed out in the morning. my hair felt hard after i rinsed it out. but after i applied some conditioner to my hair it felt like pure silk!!</li>
            <li> I started using this product about 6 months ago when I decided to stop paying big bucks at the hair salon for chemical dyes. I love the feel and shine of my hair! And I know it looks healthier. The process of application can be messy, but you get better each time, and it cleans easy from surfaces (not from clothes). I also add coconut hair oil to the mix, and some indigo powder (which makes my hair mahogany). Overall, I am pleased with the transition.</li>
            <li> I mixed Godrej Nupur with indigo powder, and the results were great! I love the color (especially in the light), and it made my hair soft. I&#x27;d definitely use this brand of henna again.</li>
            <li> This basically saved my hair from uneven pigment, graying, split ends, and lack of color and luster. Definitely buying a lifetime supply. I also don&#x27;t think it smells as bad as everyone else seems to. It smells like green tea ice cream, and a grassy smell. It&#x27;s nice, actually. I absolutely adore this and reccomend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> This past weekend was the seventh time I applied this product. I have naturally curly/kinky 4 b/c hair that can often be dry. I applied this mixture with cream, jojoba oil, and lemon juice, per some YouTube advice. I actually slept with this mixture on my hair and the results were great in the morning. The henna helped even my hair color to a dark brown with reddish highlights. Like the other reviewers pointed out, be patient when rinsing and washing out the product afterwards. I suggest using a non SLS/paraben/alcohol shampoo in order to not further strip the moisture  from the hair. This has definitely been a weekly/bi weekly process that has yielded great results. To me, the best part about this product was it was cheap and mild to my hair.</li>
            <li> Update: I haven&#x27;t seen this suggested in other reviews yet, so I&#x27;ll share my method:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I avoid lots of the mess of prep &amp; application by putting my dry powder in a gallon sized ziploc baggie, then adding liquids as desired, and after sealing well, squishing around until well mixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then let marinate the desired time (for me usually overnight, but I see that some people prefer anywhere from a few hours to a week!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I am ready to apply the henna to clean hair, I snip one corner of the ziploc bag off and apply to hair like icing a cake.  I do wear gloves and work it in well to all of my hair and scalp, and when done I cover my hair with plastic wrap or a shower cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This then is super easy to clean up -- no bowls, no spoons, no drips -- just toss empty baggie and gloves and be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen several reviews about the expiration date for the product received. I wanted to mention that there is two dates on mine -- the first date is the manufacture date (which for me was 2013), then some random numbers/letters, then the actual expiration date (for me 2016). It appears that the shelf life is 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for those worried about buying a knock-off or adulterated product, you may feel most comfortable buying directly from Amazon as the seller instead of one of the other options.  That&#x27;s what I do and I haven&#x27;t had quality issues yet.</li>
            <li> I use it as part of a deep conditioner for my dark brown 4A/B hair, and I love how my hair feels when I&#x27;m done. I also love the reddish shine it gets in the sun.</li>
            <li> I came across this henna while searching for affordable alternatives to Jamila henna. I have used this henna 4 times so far and I love the results I have. My gray streaks are a beautiful warm, copper red. I like that there are additional herbs and vitamins in the product. I prepare my henna with water, a few tablespoons of olive oil and honey and freeze the prepared mixture. Freezing increases the benefits of henna. I&#x27;ll keep you guys updated on my results.</li>
            <li> I chose this item because of the wonderful reviews but I was nervous about trying it.  It&#x27;s not easy trying to go a more natural route in life but this product sure made that easier to do.  When the powder was mixed and let sit overnight, I was more worried because of the grassy smell and the mudlike texture.  It was a little hard getting it into the hair because of the texture but Boy, were the results worth the work!!!  I have never written a review on Amazon before but I am just so amazed at the rich, deep color this product provides NATURALLY .... Gotta try it to believe it.</li>
            <li> I got this believing it would thicken my hair, well not thicken but fill in thinning spaces. I did not ive been using for about 4 months and have not noticed any thickening in those thin places. Some softening has occured but i wasnt buying for that reason. I know things take time but 4 months is a long time to me to see no difference at all with filling in empty spaces. I will not continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Transitioning hair 4/a-c&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this bag for a couple of months now and have been putting off doing it. So I finally do it and the results are wonderful. My preparation is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;In a glass bowl or plastic container pour bag.&lt;br /&gt;Add:&lt;br /&gt;1. 1 cup of black coffee&lt;br /&gt;2. 1 cup of oolong tea (5 tea bags steamed)&lt;br /&gt;3. 1/4 cup or so of EVOO&lt;br /&gt;4. 1/4 cup or so of Suave coconut conditioner (opted not to use coconut oil instead used EVOO)&lt;br /&gt;5. 1/3 or healthy squeeze of raw honey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****Slowly added these items, I did not but after the mixture sat for 4 hours most of the lumps were gone.&lt;br /&gt;Mix with plastic or wooden spoon.&lt;br /&gt;Cover with plastic and let sit for 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I started this by washing my hair with benzonite clay mixture to clarify my hair.&lt;br /&gt;So this is where I went wrong. Looking at the other reviews I bagged half of the mixture and put it in the freezer. Once I started halfway through my towel dried head, starting from the back, I realized I did not have enough. I have thick, not coarse shoulder length hair. I went to the freezer, but the mixture had already started to set. So for me I will have to use all of the mixture next time. I used a perm/color brush to put the color in my head. I think with my hands pulled all the hair to the top of my head and started massaging the color. That was at this point more heavily disbursed in the bottom half of my head. I placed on shower cap on my head and then another on top of that. I let the color set for 4 hours. Once in the shower I let the water run on my head briefly and then added more Suave conditioner to loosen up the hair and color. I placed one cap back on my head for a few minutes. I removed the cap and rinsed my hair until the water ran clear. I co washed with Hello Hydration and Coconut conditioner by Suave. I rinsed and conditioned again with Gud conditioner and Giovanni Smooth as Silk. Normally I would do a ACV rinse, but I did not. I towel dried my hair. So the color is not really visible, but the texture is phenomenal. I have a mix of 4a-c in my hair and the the curls were soft and loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: After rinsing out my shower was clogged. I am not sure if it was the clay or the henna. I am thinking it may be both. No there was minimal hair loss in the drain. Since I have been using the benozonite, it has been sticking to all my drains. It also stained the bottom of my tub, not sure how to get that out. As the drain was clogged, I did not immediately clean the tub afterwards.  A drawback from using natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I do it again, yes!!!!! Next time I will use the whole bag, probably not for a few more weeks. The hair at my nape feels like I just got a touchup. I am 12months transitioning and this is right up my alley.air. So the color is not really visible, but the texture is phenomenal.

            <li> I want to give a thorough review but not one involving blocks of paragraphs so I will break it down into points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. If you are looking for a henna to make your hair a dark brown or black this will not do it alone. I don&#x27;t think adding indigo powder will make much of a difference either because the henna is a pretty powerful red base color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It is wonderful for conditioning. Even though my hair is a bit long, I have thinner hair; therefore I mixed less than half of the bag in a plastic container with some regular temperature water, 3 tbsp of grape seed oil (which was a bit too much) and some essential oil. I mixed it just enough to turn it into a thick paste. I let it sit for 12 hours. Then I applied it to my pre washed somewhat wet hair (no conditioner) and let it sit for 4 hours. I rinsed it out about 6 times conditioning it in between rinses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. When my hair dried it wasn&#x27;t any darker. I was happy that my gray hairs turned out this reddish coppery color that blended in my hair well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. After doing more research on how I could could get my hair darker without using regular hair dye, I realized people were using indigo powder in addition to henna. Well I bought Light Mountain (black) Henna. I will NEVER buy that brand again. It is really gritty and it still didn&#x27;t make my hair a darker brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. So I bought some regular, pure indigo powder from Amazon, the Zenia brand.  Because I had already hennaed my hair the week before I was worried if the indigo would achieve the results I wanted.  I just did it a few days ago and it is so beautiful. With indigo powder, you mix it and let it sit for only about 15 min and then apply it to your hair and let it sit for anywhere to 20 min to 2 hours depending on how dark you want your hair. I left mine on for 1 hour and the result is exactly what I wanted. So no you don&#x27;t have to apply indigo powder to your hair right after you do henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The bottom line is thisbrand of henna improved the condition if my hair. I have less scalp problems, my hair seems shinier, thicker, and stronger. For the price of this and indigo powder it&#x27;s such a great way to dye your hair without all the bad chemicals.</li>
            <li> I tried to use this simply for the conditioning properties.  I used the same recipe as someone with my hair type and mixed it with EVOO and coconut oil.  I left it on my hair for a few hours.  It left my hair SOOOO hard!  I will try another recipe with what is left and leave another review.</li>
            <li> I tried Nupur for the first time and I love it.  My hair is so soft and the shedding stopped immediately.  After rinsing my hair, I combed it with a shower comb and could not believe I had only five strands of hair in the comb.  I&#x27;m glad I bought three bags and will be ordering more soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> It works perfect for my hair. Thanks</li>
            <li> This was the first time I ever use henna and I was a Lil nerve but I have to say I loved the results. my hair is softer and shiny, my gray has a copper color but it&#x27;s not overbearing... I well definitely be ordering this henna again. It&#x27;s has turned me into a henna head lol.</li>
            <li> The product was good. I put a bunch of stuff in it (honey, yogurt, lemon juice, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;It made my hair healthier and smoother but it didn&#x27;t change colors.&lt;br /&gt;The day I henna dyed my hair, it added some red tints to my hair but as time progressed, the color washed away. It&#x27;s really just slightly lighter tone of brown from my original hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would do this again just as a really good treatment but not as a hair dye.</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage, easy enough to use. The only thing about henna is that it is very messy to use and the process takes forever, but the results are wonderful and my hair looks so much healthier with each use.</li>
            <li> This henna mixture is great! I have used many different brands of henna in the past and this is by far the best. It was so smooth when I applied the henna to my hair. There&#x27;s minimal grit and twigs in this formula which makes rinsing a breeze! My hair felt pretty soft and there was a noticeable shine. As far as the color I am not really concerned because I am using this for the indigo process.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;d like to give it an infinite number of stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Rainbow Henna consistently (but infrequently) for over 30 years, mainly for conditioning. I switched to Gorej Nupur Mehendi because I was looking for gray coverage. What is so good about Nupur? For one, it is very fine, so that the paste you make is very smooth, easy to apply, and easy to rinse out. For another, it is very powerful...the color is strong so you don&#x27;t have to wonder if you&#x27;re going to get pink hair or apricot poodle hair. And finally, the nine additional herbs have left my hair incredibly shiny and soft without the addition of any oils to my mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my recipe for changing my short, thin, fine brunette hair with about 35% gray into a soft, glossy, deep brunette with glistening auburn highlights and plenty of body and wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Mix up these dry ingredients in a 1 qt. freezer bag, then add water, zip it closed with no air inside, and knead until it has the consistency of a stiff pudding):&lt;br /&gt;* 30 grams Godrej Nupur Mehendi&lt;br /&gt;* 15 grams [[ASIN:B005DNUWIY Hesh Pharma Amla Hair Powder 3.5oz powder]] (to tone down the red)&lt;br /&gt;* 1 heaping tsp. ground ginger (to neutralize the henna aroma)&lt;br /&gt;* 1 heaping tsp. ground cloves (to add a lovely clove scent)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that it is not necessary to add acid (lemon, etc.) when you are using amla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****UPDATE: Dec. 17, 2012*****&lt;br /&gt;Several friends felt that using indigo made my hair too dark, and so I doubled the amla and skipped the indigo. It has been very successful! My hair is a warm brown with dark copper/auburn highlights where it&#x27;s gray. People who haven&#x27;t seen me recently have really complimented it and assure me that it looks wonderful in sunlight as well as indoor light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Place the bag into a 2 cup Pyrex filled with water, and nuke it until hot but not boiling. Let it sit for three hours. You will see that the water in the Pyrex shows an orange tint.This means the color has developed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****UPDATE: Dec. 17, 2012*****&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve let the color develop for up to a week and that seems to work very well; it gets less orange with a longer development time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Put on an old teeshirt and wet your hair. Comb it away from your hairline the whole way around and smear a generous amount of petroleum jelly around your hairline and onto your ears...wherever you don&#x27;t want orange skin. Place a plastic grocery store bag handy (so you can throw away your gloves and the empty henna bag) when you&#x27;re done. Place a roll of cling wrap and a second grocery story bag handy for wrapping up your head after you finish applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Put on some vinyl gloves (I get the Sally Beauty Supply gloves when they&#x27;re on sale). Put about 1/4\\&quot; of water in your bathtub. Clip off a lower corner of your plastic bag with a pair of scissors, lean over the tub, and squeeze the henna/amla solution onto sections of your scalp, distributing it evenly and scrubbing it in so that you cover all of your hair from scalp to end. If any plops off, it will fall into the tub instead of onto the tile on your floor, where it could stain the grout. If the porcelain on your tub is old and porous, like mine, the small amount of water will prevent real contact and allow you to rinse the tub out quckly when you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. After all the henna/amla is worked into your hair, sculpt your hair away from your hairline so you can  make sure you have good coverage around your hairline, and use a wet paper towel to remove any drips that are where you don&#x27;t want them. Pull off a length of cling wrap that is long enough to go around your head and overlap. Wrap it around your head, about 1\\&quot; onto your forehead, over your ears, and 1\\&quot; below your hairline in back. Then pull off another length and wrap it even lower...2\\&quot; onto your forehead, over your ears, and below your hairline in back. Using your brow scissors very, very carefully so you don&#x27;t cut yourself, make a small hole at the center of each ear and gently pull your ear through. Now you can hear! And having the cling wrap below your earlobes will help keep it from riding up. In essence, you&#x27;ve created a cling wrap helmet. Wipe off your neck and any other place where the henna/amla has dripped and tie a grocery store bag on your head to keep the heat in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Allow your color to develop for four to six hours. During color development, check periodically to remove drips with a wet wad of toilet paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. When you&#x27;re ready to rinse, put a stock pot in your bathtub and fill it with cold water. Pull off the grocery store bag and the cling wrap. Lean over, dunk your head in the stockpot, and shake your head to loosen the henna/amla. Use a big plastic glass or pitcher to pour cold water over the back of your head, and work on getting the henna/amla to loosen from your hairline as well as the rest of your scalp. When the water runs clear, put a couple of handsful of baking soda on your head, and work it into your scalp. The baking soda will help to neutralize the henna smell, and leave you feeling clean without using shampoo or conditioner. Rinse out the baking soda after a minute or two, and then towel dry your hair. You will be astonished at its beauty, softness, shine, color, and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just let my hair air dry, and it looks absolutely stunning. This henna is so powerful that my scalp is a bit orange, but wait to shampoo until the next day, or until several days have passed.

            <li> This henna was cheaper then i usually buy them for, so i was worried a little, but it was cheap and free shipping and i needed henna so i went for it, and lots of good reviews too. I first used it on my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s hair, and her hair came out beautiful, soft, so soft and it gave her hair a little tint. when i used it on my hair, i loved the result, made my hair very soft too. i like the smell but my daughter didn&#x27;t, it smelled like herbs or plants, which i liked, but you know how kids can be. The only thing was that it was a little grainny, but it washed out just fine. I&#x27;m thinking i like this one better simply because it has all the other stuff mix into it.</li>
            <li> this hena doesnt look right , doesnt smell right and the results are aweful , it made my hair look brown to really light even though my hair was dark black. i put it in my hair for 18 hours and yet it doesnt feel smooth</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd time I&#x27;ve ordered this product. it works great, is easy to use, and is less messy than other brands that I have tried. Shipping was prompt.</li>
            <li> To begin with I want to say that I like the NUPUR product.  I have used it every week for ten weeks, the instructions said use weekly, up until three weeks ago. I am starting to love the color.  Each time I used it the redness in my hair got darker. I use to be able to wear my large afro but now my hair is too straight. I am not crazy about that but that part is okay. Before using the NUPUR I used to dye my hair to cover the gray. My hair really look healthy and I got a lot of compliments on how prety my hair was. When I was introduced to NUPUR I immediately stopped using dye. I was happy because I could cover the gray with a natural product. Now, I have begun to notice that my hair is now falling out.  When I wash my hair and comb it out there is a good bit of halr coming out.  I have backed off using the product but I would like to keep using it because I like what it does to my gray.  Has anyone with my grade of hair tried the product?  Can anyone please help me and suggest to me what to do about my hair falling out?  Can anyone suggest to me how often I should use it on my hair?  Please help.  I am very concerned.</li>
            <li> I like the smell- much better than other chemical-based dyes, and the fact that it washes off clothing etc easily. Plus it&#x27;s much less harmful than the chemical-based dyes. The drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t look good- almost like poop, and doesn&#x27;t apply easily and messy. However, with the price this is a good product and you can&#x27;t ask it to be perfect.</li>
            <li> One of my friends recommended me this product. Didn&#x27;t buy until my supply was used up. Phurchase it via amazon, fast delivery. Use once, very happy with the result. Better than the one I used before.</li>
            <li> Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder is by far the BEST henna product I have ever used.  I will definitely be reordering this product.  I use it for body, strength, and shine; however my hubby uses this product as step number one to cover his graying hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Cover Grey hair:&lt;br /&gt;Step 1:  Mix Godrej Nupur Mehendi (let sit for three hours) apply paste to freshly cleaned damp hair; Cover head with saran wrap and let sit for one hour or more, rinse and then apply step two.&lt;br /&gt;Step 2:  Mix Zenia Indigo Powder (apply immediately) apply paste to hair; Cover head with saran wrap and let sit for one hour or more; rinse and marvel at your shiny black hair!</li>
            <li> My mother and I have used this powder to dye our hair for awhile now, and since she has more white hair, it is obvious that this color does not fade! Additionally, if you mix it correctly and leave it on your hair long enough, it is extremely vibrant. It shows up as a chestnut color on my dark brown hair (almost black), and as an auburn color on white hair. I highly suggest mixing a lot of lemon juice and tea tree oil to &amp;#34;turp&amp;#34; it, and leaving it overnight for the dye to release before applying it to your head the next day. Allowing the dye to release early lets you leave the paste on your head for a shorter amount of time, as the long hours can get very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I usually mix it the night before and apply for about 2 hrs the nextday. Good colour and over time becomes dark brown.</li>
            <li> THIS HAS ALMOST ALL THE INGREDIENTS I USE IN MY HENNA APPLICATION.  I JUST ADD SOME OIL TO KEEP THE MOISTURE LEVEL UP IN MY HAIR AFTER THE APPLICATION.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t too bad.  My hair wasn&#x27;t AS dry as it usually is after doing a Jamilia BAQ henna treatment.  I always deep condition afterward so this doesn&#x27;t make a difference to me.  After using this product and deep conditioning, my hair was just as soft and nice as it usually is after any other henna treatment. The only issue I had was that the sift isn&#x27;t as fine as I&#x27;m used to (Jamilia BAQ henna has a super fine sift).  Because of this, there were still small granules in my hair that were hard to wash out. This might be because after I mixed it, I only let it sit for 3 hrs (as indicated on the package) instead of overnight like I do with my other henna treatments.  I do, however, like the fact that there are a number of other herbs that make up this mix, neem being one of them. Would I use this again? Yes, if I can find it at my local Indian grocer for a cheaper price than what it is sold here (It&#x27;s usually $2-3 in store!).</li>
            <li> I am very happpy with this product.  I bought it first, and then watched several you tube videos about how to henna your hair. They all pretty much recommended 100% henna, and so I was a bit concerned when I realized that this had alot of other natural ingredients...but they are suppose to be all good for your hair so I tried it anyways.  Came out really good and my greys are red not bright orange like 100% henna. I think I&#x27;m still going to do the indigo process next to get more of a dark brown/black color.  Here is what I did&lt;br /&gt;1.Made the henna (used all in bag) in a plastic bowl w/plastic spoon (so you could just toss spoon after mixing) with green tea made the night before,juice from 1/2 a lemon and virgin olive oil.  I used 2 cups h2o with 4 green tea bags and pretty much used all the liquid to get a yogarty consistancy. Let that sit covered with cling wrap for 12 hrs. The smell was not bad at all-sorta like hay&lt;br /&gt;2. Applied almost entire amt to hair in sections, making sure I got plenty at the roots.  Covered whole head with cling wrap, then put a plastic bag on, then wraped in a towel. left on for 3 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;3.Rinsed well, and needed more rinsing because I still have grits coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will write more after I use the indigo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it!!&lt;br /&gt;Just letting the indigo sit on my hair. What a mess. First the mix was too dry and I had a hard time applying. Then I got it to a creamy yogart consistancy and just had enough to cover my hair. Have had it on for about an hour and its really drippy thru the Saran wrap and plastic bag. Yuck. Will review my final outcome later</li>
            <li> This is such a great deep conditioning treatment! My hair is naturally very curly, which means very dry! And loves protein, so I use this in place of protein treatments. I love throwing in a bunch of food ingredients such as Coconut milk (as my liquid), oils and molasses or honey. Or just toss some in when i mix conditioners &amp; olive oil. Always leaves my hair smoother and curlier, and I can tell it works particularly well on my crown area which is the most difficult area of my hair for me to work with. Lastly, it turned my naturally black/brown hair a niiiiice reddish tinted brown, which at first I was against but after wearing a blown out fro I&#x27;m just in love with the color! GET THIS NOW! But beware of the slight color change, if that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re looking for. Def ordering again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I don&#x27;t let my mix sit overnight, or hours even. I mix it before my shower, then use it right after I shampoo. Also, I don&#x27;t use anything acidic, as I said earlier I use Coconut milk as my liquid and still my hair color has slightly changed. The Coconut milk is moisturizing &amp; makes rinsing a lot easier btw.</li>
            <li> A labelled this a tentative 5 star review because I only used this product just 4 days ago. Let me back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this and Zenia Indigo hair dye from Amazon way back on June 23, 2012. It sat in my beauty product closet for quite sometime mostly because I was going through a period of significant shedding and terrified of putting some new fangled product in my hair that would exacerbate the problem. Also, I was afraid of coming out looking like Chucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally marshaled my fears and decided to try this after my hair stop shedding and because my grays were really starting to get on my nerves. I don&#x27;t have a whole bunch, but the ones I do have are prominent and right in the place I like to part my hair. I pretty much followed the directions with the exception of substituting some of the water for coffee because again, my fear of looking like a flaming red-haired crazed possessed terror doll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I whipped it to a pudding consistency and let it sit over night. The next morning I mixed the indigo and let it sit for 15-20 minutes, then mixed the henna and indigo and let those two marinate while I washed my hair. I would say I had equal parts henna and indigo. Once I laid down the newspaper in my bathroom, got my gloves on. I nervously went to work. The smell of these products is not very pleasant. The henna smells like concentrated grass and the indigo like concentrated spinach. Application was quite easy and not really messy at all. The concoction wasn&#x27;t at all drippy and stuck to my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left it on for about 5 hours. I admit to genuine fear when I took off my cap and seeing how rock hard my hair was. I got to rinsing and boy, do I mean rinsing. I used a combo of cheapie VO5, followed by not so cheap Wen cleansing conditioner to get the stuff out of my hair. I then towel dried and deep conditioned for 30 minutes with Kenra deep conditioner. Make no doubt about it - this is an all day affair. After rinsing the deep conditioner out of my hair I geared up for what I hate most about washing my hair - detangling. I was sure detangling would be hell on earth. Not so at all. After putting in my leave in and some almond &amp; morrocan oil - detangling was a breeze and there was minimum shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result - lovely chocolatey brown hair with some coppery/auburn-ish highlights. My hair actually felt very strong and healthy. It doesn&#x27;t feel this strong and healthy even when I do protein treatments. One thing was that I didn&#x27;t think my hair was all that shiny. Based on the reviews I expected better on that front. Perhaps I should try mixing it with conditioner, essential oils or Vatika?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the lack of incredible shine, this product could be a win because I think that the claims made about this helping with dandruff/dry scalp maybe true. 4 days post application and no sign of a single flake anywhere. Not. A. Single. One. I wash my hair every 7-10 days and usually by day 3-4, my scalp is showing signs of definite build up and dry patches and flakes, especially on the right side of my scalp. This would be the case even if I used prescription strength shampoos and ointments. After one henna/indigo application, my hair looks totally dandruff free right now. I will keep my fingers crossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this again and do it again. I would do this every month if time permitted but right now I think I will just do it once in between relaxers.ner out of my hair I geared up for what I hate most about washing my hair - detangling.

            <li> I love this stuff.  I have been using henna for years and this is a superior product.  Covers grey well and adds shine and strength to my hair.  I receive a lot of complements.  I have dark brown hair and a lot of gray.  It does not change the color of the dark hair but it colors the grays a wonderful golden red color that looks like hi lights.</li>
            <li> Love my product and my hair shows it all. I mixed up several different hair herbs and I put the product on my scalp Android leave it in over night and when I wash it out my hair is hydrated and no more breaking endz</li>
            <li> I love this Henna! It makes my hair look younger even though it does not cover my gray all the way.&lt;br /&gt;I mix it now with Indigo and lasts a little longer and I get a better color that suits my needs. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Not bad, but would recommend &amp;#34;Hannah Natural 100% Pure Henna Powder, 100 Gram&amp;#34; for more money. Ordered this one when first choice item was out of stock. This one needs rinsing a couple of more times but dyes gray hair very well.</li>
            <li> I did not care for this product. It was messy and difficult to apply. Additionally, like other reviews stated, it leaves a reddish residue color to the hair. I didn&#x27;t use the entire package and ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two years now and I have it on autoship.  The gray hairs do turn red, but it just looks like highlights in my dark brown hair.  If you want to cover those, you can use indigo afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product leaves my hair shiny and in better condition.  I am caucasian, with long straight dark brown hair.  Split ends show very easily and I love how my hair looks and feels after using this henna.  I use this once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My method is to add some fresh lemon juice (strained) or a some plain yogurt, and the rest is water.  If you have dry hair, you can even add oil.  I don&#x27;t measure, so put in any additions first and then add some water.  I continue to add water until it is about yogurt or thin pudding mixture.  Set in a warm place for about 4 hours or overnight until the color releases.  Part hair and apply while wearing gloves, coating the entire strand from scalp to the root. Wrap head in plastic wrap.  I also put on a shower cap and towel.  Sometimes it does start running down a little near the end of the time.  After 2 to 4 hours, fill the bathtub and lay down to rinse your hair that way.  I cannot get it all out if I don&#x27;t do it this way.  Then you can drain and shower the rest out.  I do have to use some shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this,the uptake is fabulous. It has all the herbs I usually have to add already in it. I love the color I get, a auburn. I am African American.</li>
            <li> I have abused and died my hair for many years, until it started falling out! Now I switched to the natural stuff, no more chemicals! I tried few hennas, some much more expensive, but I have never liked any of them as much as  I liked this one. I had doubts in the begging since it&#x27;s not listed as henna and has so many other ingredients (all natural though) I like my hair dark so, I would usually follow with indigo after henna, and I was gonna do same this time too, but when I saw rich, beautiful and dark shade, it gave to my hair, I&#x27;m not gonna do indigo any more. I will probably mix a little indigo with it before applying next time though, because grey hair did turn red, but nothing loud, not orange like pure henna would. what i also like is that it&#x27;s very fine, not grainy at all, so when I mixed it with water, it turned into smooth paste, which after 4 hours I poured into a sandwich size ziplock bag (I needed half of package for shoulder length hair, but didn&#x27;t realize it up until I mixed the entire bag, so i had to  freeze the other half) made a hole in one corner and applied with gloves. This way it was very fast and zero mess! then I wrapped a plastic bag around my hair, and the towel on top of it and left for 4 hours. the result is amazing, I did apply conditioner when I was washing it out, but no shampoo and didn&#x27;t treat with any oils, because my hair didn&#x27;t dry out, like it usually did with just henna, it&#x27;s silky and shiny! Since it&#x27;s not grainy it washes out very fast too. Loved it, will be buying more!</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time 2 weeks ago &amp; was horrified at first looking at the goop in my bowl. I didn&#x27;t want to put it in my hair! But i eventually took the plunge &amp; I&#x27;m so happy i did. My hair feels/looks great. I mix Barlean&#x27;s Organic Oils Extra Virgin Coconut Oil &amp; Amla Oil with mines along with boiling water &amp; let it sit over night before putting in my hair. I will definitely be keeping up with this routine. Looking forward to this beautiful, vibrant color in the summer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 4 different henna products and this one just works the best for me.  The color is a better, deeper, red and stays longer.  Not much else to say on this one.</li>
            <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technique: Mixed it with hot water plus coconut and lavender oils to form paste, waited 3 hours, applied to hair, waited 4 hours, rinsed. So great! My hair is naturally dark brown. After the mehendi, it was reddish for a day or so, then darkened to dark auburn with reddish highlights. Hair seems shinier and healthier, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to put pure henna in my hair all the time, and that was great, but having the other 8 herbs in this mix makes it even better.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone who likes to henna their hair, but wants a darker tone and more overall conditioning.</li>
            <li> I wanted to stop chemically coloring my hair.  After much research about natural alternatives (henna, indigo, etc.), I decided to try henna.  I knew that henna would not change the color of my dark brown hair, at the most give me reddish highlights which could only be seen in the sun.  I read lots of reviews, blogs, websites dedicated to henna.  Based on this information, one positive for using henna would be a softening of my hair.  Other observations included some people noticing a loosening of their curl pattern.  These were not concerns of mine because 1) my natural (no relaxer) hair was already healthy and properly moisturized, 2)  I did not plan to use it on a regular basis.  The only reason for using henna was to color my gray hairs.  I purchased this product based on the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  There was enough product for me to get two uses (I have thick, hair which at the time stopped right above my neck).  It&#x27;s cheaply priced. I did not notice a loosening of my curl pattern.  It colored my grays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  It colored my grays a penny/copper.  I was aware that it was a possibility but based on the research I did, I thought the color would mellow out.  It did not.  I don&#x27;t know if my hair grew really fast, if I did not apply it well the first time or if the color started to fade at the roots because after 5 weeks, I had quite a bit of gray hairs.  So I used what was leftover (stored in the freezer).  This is when the problems started.  After the first use, my hair felt different and I thought, meh new product and my hair needs to get adjusted.  I noticed some shedding but not enough for concern.  It was no more that what I could have regularly shed.  After the second use, the shedding increased and my hair was more crunchy/hard to the touch.  I knew immediately that I was experiencing protein overload.  After each application, I did a deep conditioning treatment in addition to rinsing out the henna with conditioner. It has been two months since the last application and I am still trying to correct the damage by continuing to do my weekly deep conditioning, eliminating hair products with protein  and co-washing more frequently.  As this was my first experience with henna and thus this product, I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to (i.e. product quality) but I can not recommend this product.  There is a site dedicated to henna that IF I choose to color my grays again I MIGHT order  from but until that part of me kicks in (OMG, look at how much gray I have), I am going to embrace my hair, grays included.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the way my hair looks after I used this henna (though I never saw henna listed on the ingredients, and it had me very nervous!) I have natural red hair (red red, not strawberry blond or auburn), and in the last 3 years it has really faded. This brought my hair back to the color it used to be!  It&#x27;s funny that people that have only known me over the last few years noticed the change, but people that knew me before my hair dulled didn&#x27;t even notice (when I pointed it out they commented that yeah, I guess it had faded!) It&#x27;s not some over the top color, it&#x27;s just natural looking.  I mixed the entire bag, because my hair is quite long, past the bottom of my shoulder blades...and I could have done my hair twice with what I mixed.  I actually used the rest of it on my 8 year old daughter (she has brown hair, and it gave it an amazing red tint!) and STILL had quite a bit left that I threw away! I wish I knew if you could store the already mixed liquid for later touch ups, but I couldn&amp;iexcl;¦t find that info anywhere! The only downfall for this product I have noticed is that it STINKS, not the \\&quot;earthy\\&quot; smell so many people nicely give it...it smells like horse manure, it&#x27;s nasty. (My 4 year old son asked me why I put poo on my hair!) AND, the smell is still in my hair a month later, every time I wash my hair (daily)! BUT, I have considerably less shedding (my main reason for getting it!) and both my daughter and I have a lot less frizzies in our hair! I did quite a bit of research about it before I used it so I wouldn&amp;iexcl;¦t do anything crazy to my hair (I never dye, cut or do really anything with my hair, just regular trims!) I recommend you do research to before using it º I used coconut oil in my mix and water and just this bag, and the results were amazing! I WILL do this again, even with the smell, because the positives WAY outweigh the smell :)I have recommended this to two people who are both planning on use it as well!</li>
            <li> Great.... Love it... Works as promised</li>
            <li> I made a smooth mixture of this product and plain yogurt (curd). I then mixed in some organic ground ginger (for smell). After 8 hours, I separately combined my indigo with salt and water until also smooth. I added some of the henna mix into the indigo, about 1:1 ratio. I applied this to my hair, covered my head in plastic wrap, followed by wearing a knit beanie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was over 30% greys with the rest a natural dark brown. After rinsing out the henndigo 2 hours later, my greys were totally covered. My hair was dark brown with glints of red in the sunlight over the greys. The color cured to a very dark chocolately reddish brown with the glints over the next few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair did lose some natural curl but is stronger and healthier feeling after this treatment. I sometimes sleep on \\&quot;hanging\\&quot; twists at night to bring some texture back to the lower half of my hair, and it looks good with lots of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must wear gloves, and the stain will come off on your fingers the first few days when styling the hair. Wash as soon as you finish your hair. This is from the indigo, not the henna mix. But it&#x27;s been over 3 weeks with great color and grey coverage.  When my new growth is a bit longer I will use the same mixture only at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Liked this product, it does cover the gray in your hair, last for months.  The first time I used it, made the gray almost a copper color but the rest looked great, next time I used it had better results.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Works for me. No irritation to my scalp. I&#x27;ve been using this one for a year now.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a few months ago and I&#x27;m currently awaiting the arrival of my second order!! I love this henna... My hair loves it too!! My hair is thicker, stronger and is striving nicely. My only problem is that people come up to me asking \\&quot;Is all that YOUR hair?\\&quot; - smh (lmao) My hair is a combination 4b/4c and I&#x27;m natural. If you&#x27;re on the hunt for good henna to strengthen you hair (amongst other things) Maybe you can give this a go!!! BTW - I started off with 1B hair (off black) I now have 1B with a slight tint of red (depending on lighting). The other reviews are \\&quot;dead-on\\&quot; about this looking like \\&quot;poo\\&quot; though... and I do not care for the scent but I wouldn&#x27;t let that deter me from this excellent henna!!</li>
            <li> The color and texture of the actual paste was very similar to feces, but it smelled really, really good. I was expecting my hair to be a dark brown or black afterwards, but instead, the blend made my hair lighter. Granted, it was a beautiful reddish-brown. My hair was also much softer afterwards, though i had to wash my hair four times to get the rest of the mixture out. Overall, I liked the results.</li>
            <li> Best hair conditioner. My hair felt so good after using this herb blend.&lt;br /&gt;I like it better than pure Henna because pure Henna has a tendency to make the hair feel like straw.&lt;br /&gt;I conditioner washed it out very easily.&lt;br /&gt;I will make this a regular monthly hair treatment.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands of henna that we&#x27;re more expensive and this definitely holds up. I mix with green tea and honey it is super easy to wash out, a difference I definitely notice.  My hair is full, soft with lots of shine.  Only downside is the curl losening. To remedy I will only do once every six weeks. Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice now. I mixed it with lemon, lime, and coffee, and I like the dye release for about 6 hours. I left it on for about 6 hours. The result was a pretty deep red color, and my hair feels silky and thicker as well. I try not to use chemical hair dye as I&#x27;ve developed an allergy to ppd in dark hair dye, and the result was a pretty color but a lot of lost hair. The first time I used this product, I used this and then indigo powder to make my hair black, but I think this time I&#x27;ll keep the red!</li>
            <li> Product turned my hair a funny orange/red color but worst part is I developed a serious allergic reaction. Hives, difficulty breathing, dizziness, etc. it was terrible. I would recommend trying another product if you&#x27;re sensitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with 4A hair. I left the product on for 3 hours and the result is subtle. Now I have reddish brown highlights. My gray hair is a copper color. I added olive oil to the paste before I applied to my hair. Will try again and leave on longer.</li>
            <li> I will definately use this again. I bought it based on the reviews here and mixed my henna with water, apple cider vinegar and some coconut oil. I let it sit for about 4 hours and then put it on for about 3.5 hours. It rinsed out of my locks very nicely and easily and I applied a deep conditioner for about 15 mins ( next time I will DC longer). The next day, hair was a little dry so I applied more coconut oil and a conditioning cap and left it on overnight. That did the trick with the dryness. Overall, the henna did a great job of covering the few gray hairs that I have. They are now a copper red ( I am happy with the results) and will use this product again.</li>
            <li> I was really scared to use it but I took a deep breath mixed it let it sit over night and applied it the next morning and only left it on about 3 hours and I loved the brownish tint and my hair felt so good after a few deep conditions. And haven&#x27;t seen any dandruff. Omg! Will be purchasing this again.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African-American natural with 4a/4b hair. I&#x27;ve henna&#x27;d many times and have tried many kinds as well - Jamila, Rainbow..and some others. This one is definitely the best that I&#x27;ve tried. The smell isn&#x27;t as pungent, it left my hair soooo soft, and I love the beautiful reddish color results I received (wish I had a picture). It was just the tint I was looking for. I normally mix my henna with Hibiscus tea to bring out the color, but this time I used a South African Rooibos Tea. My hair is BSL (Bra Strap Length)and this bag of 150 grams was perfect...I had a little left over. The boxes of henna I usaully purchase have 100 grams and I&#x27;m scraping to try to make do (now I know my needs). If your hair is shorter you may be able to split into 2 bags, and if so, what a steal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your mixture should contain ingredients that you know work well for YOUR hair. I&#x27;ve experimented and this round my mixture contained:&lt;br /&gt;Rooibos Tea&lt;br /&gt;Vatika Coconut Oil (also available on Amazon for a steal)&lt;br /&gt;Olive Oil (I love that my hair loves this)&lt;br /&gt;A little lemon juice&lt;br /&gt;A little honey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..I can&#x27;t remember if I put in a little Jojoba oil lol. Next time I will try avocado oil. Practice makes perfect :) Happy Hennaing!</li>
            <li> I spent lots of time reading reviews about henna hair dyes. I picked and tried this one and a few other ones. The best one is no longer selling on amazon. That one&#x27;s powder is very fine. Color is easier to get on. This and a few others high rating ones are similar. Color are all similar, bronze brown in the beginning and later will turn more brown. I don&#x27;t see this one helps overall hair health at all. A few things I&#x27;d like to mention when using henna dyes. 1. you don&#x27;t have to mix with the oils, etc. just water and stir. What makes hair smooth is to use some good hair mask or conditioner (avacado etc) after washing off. Otherwise, hair will feel coarse. 2. Apply heat for some time to help color on. 3. you don&#x27;t have to wait for very long, 2 hours is ok. However, coloring again in one or two weeks make difference.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time a month ago, I am Caucasian and my hair is fine, wavy and dry on the ends.  Medium to dark brown and previously over-highlighted.  I had dyed it back to my natural color with chemical dye a year ago and have been using semipermanent dye since to cover my 5% grey.  The semipermanent was less damaging but would fade from the greys in about 2 weeks.  I wanted something with more pizazz and up until the last 3 years had always dyed my hair a reddish brown.  I stopped when we moved to a home with a well, the hard well water would fade the beautiful red shade within a week - a waste of money.  I was looking for a natural way to cover the gray and did a lot of research on henna, as i used to use it when I was in my 20&#x27;s.  I remember it being a real messy hassle (it still is), but loved the results.  First time Henna use recently was in February 2013, purchased the Jamila henna (hair quality, not BAQ), and was pleasantly surprised, loved the color - it turned out a coppery color and greys looked like bright copper highlights.  Out of 3 boxes I used, however, 1 was very old and I think did not dye well.  (see my review on Jamila henna for more details).  When my grays started to show again, I tried the Nupur due to the low price and great reviews.  I also like the idea of the extra herbs.  Mixed it with water, got dye release in 3 hours, added coconut oil, then applied over the whole head and left it on for 4 hours.  At first I was shocked at the vibrant color, so much darker than the Jamila and my scalp was psychedelic!  After a few days my scalp faded and the color mellowed to a gorgeous deep cool auburn (greys still bright copper highlights)- just the color I was looking for.  I get compliments on my hair all the time and it looks very natural. Best part is that the color has not faded from the grey AT ALL and my hard well water has not changed the color either!  Of course I use sulfate free shampoo so I think that helps a lot. It is time to do my hair again, this time I will do the roots only (so as not to deepen the color)and make a few changes in my \\&quot;formula\\&quot;.  I plan to use chai tea instead of plain water initially then mix with Vatika coconut oil after dye release and will leave on only 2 hours.  I have shoulder-length hair and used 1 packet for my whole head, will use 1/2 packet to do my roots.  Even though this is a messy treatment which requires a serious time commitment, it is well worth it as it is economical and really good for your hair. I like this product better than regular henna because the dye release is so quick and I don&#x27;t have to leave it on as long. Not sure about all the extra herbs and if they do what they promise, but I do like the product.  All henna treatments will make your hair feel dry afterwards, so be sure to invest in a deep conditioning treatment and use it right after you henna, your hair will be soft, shiny and luxurious and you will love it!  I sure do and put it on my monthly Subscribe &amp; Save.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** 5/2/13&lt;br /&gt;I did my roots about 2 weeks ago, as mentioned above used the chai tea and 1/2 bag of Nupur for my just below shoulder length hair. Mixed with coconut oil after dye release. Could have done with 1/4 bag but saved the excess (froze it in a ziploc) to do my roots next month.  Was in a hurry and left it on for only 1 hour which did the trick but turned out lighter than last time.  Next time will leave on for 2 hours.  Color still gorgeous and hair very healthy. Just doing roots I should be able to get by on 3 bags per year - at a cost of $3.43 per bag, this is just a little over $10 per year to color my hair!  BEST DEAL EVERdo my hair again, this time I will do the roots only (so as not to deepen the color)and make a few changes in my \\&quot;formula\\&quot;.  I plan to use chai tea instead of plain water initially then mix with Vatika coconut oil after dye release and will leave on only 2 hours.  I have shoulder-length hair and used 1 packet for my whole head, will use 1/2 packet to do my roots.  Even though this is a messy treatment which requires a serious time commitment, it is well worth it as it is economical and really good for your hair. I like this product better than regular henna because the dye release is so quick and I don&#x27;t have to leave it on as long.

            <li> I have been using this a little over a year and in the beginning just used on its own but have since added some other herbs for conditioning  before i freeze.  Once out I use with Indigo for a one step process.  Great color and with the addition of oil super easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li> Got it on time and the price is perfect, I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I am planning on it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover any gray hair at all.</li>
