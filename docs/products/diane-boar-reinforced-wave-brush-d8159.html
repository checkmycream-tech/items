            <li>This was a good brush - I was happy with it till the bristles started to list to one side because of how I brush my hair.</li>
            <li>Nice quality!</li>
            <li>A good call if you don&#x27;t mind replacing the brush every six months or so,</li>

            <li>Good brush...</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I keep hearing how the boar brushes are so good for your hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect brush for shot male hair grooming and it also gives a perfect scalp treatment.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this brush and recommend it.</li>
            <li>If anything, it stimulates my scalp to create more oils!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>but I love the way it goes through my hair and massages the scalp!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>ALL THE MORE REASON TO GET THIS BRUSH!</li>
            <li>Amazing brush for 360 waves</li>
            <li>This is a nice brush.</li>
            <li>Nice hair brush.</li>
            <li>Cleans nicely as well.</li>
            <li>Liked the quality.  </li>
            <li>The brush works well, once you take care of your hair, and brush it after your hair has been in warm water for a while.</li>
            <li>it was cool &amp; if u ended up getting waves than hey it was a bonus lol</li>
            <li>Good name brand waving brush with extremely strong bristles.</li>
            <li>great product plus very fast delivery</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick &amp;, surprisingly, wasn&#x27;t charged fees for it.</li>
            <li>This brush does not make your hair static</li>
            <li>Yes it could be more durable, it could be all boar&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Okay, it says 100% boar hair....</li>
            <li>-Could have used better quality wood for handle (nit-picking)  -If</li>
            <li>Straighten it?\\&quot; :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping dianes 100% boar brush is better</li>
            <li>But for $7, I am more than pleased.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s a better one out for wavers at this price, someone let me know.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a big difference in the day to day condition of my hair and am very happy I purchased this brush.</li>
            <li>I like the softer versions better.</li>
            <li>And it creates a ton of static.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d love for this brush to work for me, but I need to brush all my hair, not just the top layer.  </li>
            <li>Love it, love to scratch my body all over with it.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of it.  </li>
            <li>Excellent, actually what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this as an alternative for a brush a lost, and was quite pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>i love this brush</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll keep it because the return shipping is more than the cost of the brush.  </li>
            <li>This brush is really good, it gets the work done right.</li>
            <li>and they were fast to ship!!!!</li>
            <li>so it really doesn&#x27;t feel nice!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for distributing natural oils and giving my hair a nice smooth finish.</li>
            <li>First, the good things about this product is its affordable price and a very quick</li>
            <li>days the brush does create a lot of static in my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Very good if it&#x27;s actually what you want.</li>
            <li>but I promise u&#x27;d like it more than a cheap Annie from the dollar store or beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive for a good boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair that knots easily and this brush works even on my hair.  </li>
            <li>-Strong</li>
            <li>REALLY STRONG</li>
            <li>He was very pleased with it and will be using it instead of his old favorite that is beginning to deterioate.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and as advertised; bought 2!</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean accumulated hair.  </li>
            <li>Looks to be well-made, and feels comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li>but thats the only kink in this great brush.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a cheap knock off.</li>
            <li>It feels amazing and my hair looks so much healthier already.</li>
            <li>Recommend to people looking for a cheap brush.</li>
            <li>Best to consult a hairdresser first before using this if you are worried about it being a bit rough on the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the product and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>I would give the brush a better rating if it had more natural boar hair, since believing it did was the reason why I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>Honestly, you are better off investing in a different brush or just saving your money by looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, fly away hair.  </li>
            <li>Reason is too much plastic &#x27;reinforcement&#x27; which leaves my hair a bit static.</li>
            <li>This brush is perfect if you have thick, tangle-prone hair.</li>
            <li>This is a good brush for those who have very coarse hair</li>
            <li>A quick comb does the trick.</li>
            <li>Arrived in mail quickly.</li>
            <li>Not as soft as my old one, but great on the scalp.</li>
            <li>I love it that much and the price is just right to buy a replacement.  </li>
            <li>Would be good for man, not for woman with long hair, hurt scalp.</li>
            <li>This brush has been pretty good for me, but was retired as I grew my hair out longer and went back to using shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Wood and bristles themselves very good quality, bristles just not long enough for my needs.</li>
            <li>It really added lustre and volume to my fine hair.</li>
            <li>ITS BIG!I CANT FIT THE WHOLE THING IN MY HAND.</li>
            <li>short, this brush is okay, but I would not claim it to be superior to a non-boar bristle brush of the same price.</li>
            <li>but I find the brush useful at days end to remove the additional hair product used for styling.</li>
            <li>Make sure you shampoo frequently to prevent stirring up dandruff when you brush your hair.</li>
            <li>She was looking for something that would be soft, but the reinforced bristles felt more like porcupine quills than boar hair.</li>
            <li>I run a plastic scalp massager through it and hair lifts right out.</li>
            <li>but they are just right.</li>
            <li>BUT IT BRUSHES GOOD AND KEEPS MY HAIR DOWN.</li>
            <li>This came recommended on a hair blog for those trying to move their natural oils down the length of the hair and it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Came very fast</li>
            <li>Brush is well made and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t find the brush very comfortable, and frankly I find it unsuitable for human use.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel more alive and vibrant.</li>
            <li>it feels great in my hair its really hard</li>
            <li>delivery.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is alright, I am not sorry I bought it, but I am not going to re-order this brush either.</li>
            <li>I got this brush as a present for my husband because they don&#x27;t sell them any more in stores.</li>
            <li>Currently, I&#x27;m wearing it pixie short with a floppy top section, but this brush is able to reach my scalp with no problems.  </li>
            <li>Brush is exactly how described.</li>
            <li>Consequently, it only brushes the top layer of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bristles started falling out at first...</li>
            <li>I had to wash it in hot water and put it in the freezer for a hour and then defrost it to soften the bristles.</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush to smooth my natural hair when I wear it in a bum, which is my go to style.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good firm brush.</li>
            <li>However, the bristles are too soft to push through my fine (but lots of it), straight hair to get to the scalp.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping,good handling great item, the brush is steady and it feels like a massage on your skull,good for male and female.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, should have gotten one a long time ago.</li>
            <li>Got this brush after reading an on line article on growing long healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Love the brush long time.</li>
            <li>It did exactly what I needed it to draining much water from my hair and keeping my waves intact.</li>
            <li>The bristles are not flimsy and my hair is super soft after using it.</li>
            <li>The brush I received is not the pictured brand of Diane brush and certainly isn&#x27;t 100% boar hair.</li>
            <li>and I certainly dont have it now...</li>
            <li>The boar bristles that you can find are so fine that they won&#x27;t stand up with the coarse plastic ones.</li>
            <li>Good hard brush..</li>
            <li>I bought the #8159 in search of a good hard brush to really get the job done while wolfing.</li>
            <li>This brush is great for wolfing it hard but don&#x27;t use it after a haircut use a soft brush so your hair dont get used to it.</li>
            <li>This is a brush, so I&#x27;m not going to say too much about it.</li>
            <li>This brush is well constructed, solid, yet still light.  </li>
            <li>Bristles much shorter than pictured.</li>
            <li>Hair much softer and shinier.</li>
            <li>(and I have straight, medium thickness hair).</li>
            <li>Works great on my thin hair.</li>
            <li>It is a nylon brush with very sparse boars hair on it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so much softer than the nylon</li>
            <li>Came fast and well packaged.</li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>Bristles are falling out when I brush with it and getting stuck in my hair every time I use it so much so that a section of the brush doesn&#x27;t have them anymore</li>
            <li>Bristles have held up and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>but you just have to brush your head gently and it does work.</li>
            <li>~ surprised it&#x27;s not more popular!</li>
            <li>I no longer have what used to be fairly severe psoriasis on my scalp and all I did was start brushing with this brush a few times a week and also stop putting conditioner directly on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I love the stiffness and sturdiness of the man-made fibers, mixed in with the boars hair to re-distribute my hair&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
            <li>Super hard brush, you better have a lot of hair so your not killing your scalp or soak in hot water</li>
            <li>The bristles are stiff and it feels nice on my scalp.</li>
            <li>Hoping that this would tame flyaways and be a nice brush.</li>
            <li>Well-made, but be aware that this is not a small brush by any means.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The seller responded quickly to my initial review and offered to refund the full price -- I declined the refund</li>
            <li>Very cheap and not a true &#x27;boar bristle brush.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>get better with time, but I have to admit being slightly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>previous reviewer had written that it does not create static electricity - yet every time I use it, my hair stands on end, leaving me feeling like I just went to a science fair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush to anyone with any type of hair.</li>
            <li>and the brushes are kind of soft ,but i dont need a hard brush really.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that it did the same job as much more expensive brushes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying something new.</li>
            <li>Brand new condition,</li>
            <li>Overall a good hard brush.</li>
            <li>The brush only feels cheap, but it is well sturdy-built to last.</li>
            <li>The brush seems solid, but closer inspection of the bristles showed that about 60% of it is plastic and the rest very sparse real hair.</li>
            <li>Nowhere near as good a brush as I expected but still efficient, none the less.</li>
            <li>The brush I received was a Gabriella soft bristle brush #G1012B that I would never order!</li>
            <li>My hair barely even touch the boar bristles because they are so soft that they have sunk to the bottom of the brush and really are doing nothing</li>
            <li>As others have indicated, this is probably due to the fact that most of the bristles are synthetic, and not natural.</li>
            <li>My son needed a hard bristle brush, he was ok with it</li>
            <li>The advertisement clearly reads that this is a Diane 8159 model brush, which I paid for, and I got an  8115 brush.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush for my elderly mother, whose scalp is quite sensitive.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels soft after brushing and looks shiny too.</li>
            <li>It is nearly all plastic-</li>
            <li>This brush is prolly the strongest I have used so far</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;reinforced\\&quot; plastic bristles would make this brush too harsh for some, but I like the way it lightly scratches my scalp while I brush.</li>
            <li>My two year old son even lets me brush his hair with it.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this brush if you are looking for soft bristles...</li>
            <li>I love that this brush is firm enough to do the job.</li>
            <li>I suggest that most only need to purchase this firmness if you are in 4th - 6th week of &amp;#34;wolfing&amp;#34; and you are new to the WAVE GAME and your hair still needs much training...</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s reinforced as it stands a shot at penetrating my ridiculous mane.</li>
            <li>It is more gentle than any other brush I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>but I could not down rate it if I cant remember.</li>
            <li>Much more effective and less expensive then treatment from a Dermatologist!</li>
            <li>got the wave brush, extra firm reinforced boar with light wood.  </li>
            <li>Bristles are just the right stiffness to get down through hair to scalp.</li>
            <li>The bristles on this brush are way stiffer than I expected; so stiff that they are better suited for use as a scrub brush</li>
            <li>It has the boar bristle to softly comb out the outer regions of her hair, and when she needs to get close to her scalp, the nylon bristles comb out the tangles where the boar bristle portion finishes up the daily brushing.  </li>
            <li>and I can use this straight from the shower with wet hair.  </li>
            <li>However, after talking to my stepfather who also owns this brush, he let me know that after using the brush several times it&#x27;ll get soft.</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of wave grease, and my hair, although African to the core, is quite soft.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much and the harder bristles actually penetrate all the way through to my scalp.</li>
            <li>The brush retains scalp skin and the boar hairs don&#x27;t stay on the brush worth a damn, and after a few uses all of the boar hair falls out and the brush ends up with only nylon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad the bristles aren&#x27;t too soft because then it&#x27;d be totally useless on my hair.</li>
            <li>No excuse!</li>
            <li>The plastic bristles are needed because a pure boar hair brush would just smash down against my head.</li>
            <li>Extra firm is right, and that is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>-Noticeably helps with tangles and split ends within the first few weeks</li>
            <li>I got a lot of comments the first few days after using it.</li>
            <li>A few bristles came out on the first brushing session, but after that it&#x27;s been everything I need.</li>
            <li>Bristles are strong enough and long enough even for my thick hair.</li>
            <li>It left my wavy hair soft and shiny even brushing dry.</li>
            <li>bristles themselves are pretty stiff and rough - they don&#x27;t pull on my hair as much as my old plastic brush did, which I like, but when they touch my scalp or the nape of my neck</li>
            <li>This brush does have boar bristles, but it is mostly made up of plastic bristles that are really hard with just a few boar bristles.  </li>
            <li>Bristles are long and hard and great for hard to wave and lay down hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;d have to say this is the best brush I have ever owned.</li>

            <li> This was a good brush - I was happy with it till the bristles started to list to one side because of how I brush my hair.</li>
            <li> Nice quality!</li>
            <li> A good call if you don&#x27;t mind replacing the brush every six months or so,</li>

            <li> Good brush...</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I keep hearing how the boar brushes are so good for your hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the perfect brush for shot male hair grooming and it also gives a perfect scalp treatment.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this brush and recommend it.</li>
            <li> If anything, it stimulates my scalp to create more oils!</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> but I love the way it goes through my hair and massages the scalp!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> ALL THE MORE REASON TO GET THIS BRUSH!</li>
            <li> Amazing brush for 360 waves</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush.</li>
            <li> Nice hair brush.</li>
            <li> Cleans nicely as well.</li>
            <li> Liked the quality.  </li>
            <li> The brush works well, once you take care of your hair, and brush it after your hair has been in warm water for a while.</li>
            <li> it was cool &amp; if u ended up getting waves than hey it was a bonus lol</li>
            <li> Good name brand waving brush with extremely strong bristles.</li>
            <li> great product plus very fast delivery</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick &amp;, surprisingly, wasn&#x27;t charged fees for it.</li>
            <li> This brush does not make your hair static</li>
            <li> Yes it could be more durable, it could be all boar&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Okay, it says 100% boar hair....</li>
            <li> -Could have used better quality wood for handle (nit-picking)  -If</li>
            <li> Straighten it?\\&quot; :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping dianes 100% boar brush is better</li>
            <li> But for $7, I am more than pleased.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s a better one out for wavers at this price, someone let me know.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a big difference in the day to day condition of my hair and am very happy I purchased this brush.</li>
            <li> I like the softer versions better.</li>
            <li> And it creates a ton of static.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d love for this brush to work for me, but I need to brush all my hair, not just the top layer.  </li>
            <li> Love it, love to scratch my body all over with it.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of it.  </li>
            <li> Excellent, actually what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this as an alternative for a brush a lost, and was quite pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> i love this brush</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll keep it because the return shipping is more than the cost of the brush.  </li>
            <li> This brush is really good, it gets the work done right.</li>
            <li> and they were fast to ship!!!!</li>
            <li> so it really doesn&#x27;t feel nice!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for distributing natural oils and giving my hair a nice smooth finish.</li>
            <li> First, the good things about this product is its affordable price and a very quick</li>
            <li> days the brush does create a lot of static in my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Very good if it&#x27;s actually what you want.</li>
            <li> but I promise u&#x27;d like it more than a cheap Annie from the dollar store or beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive for a good boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that knots easily and this brush works even on my hair.  </li>
            <li> -Strong</li>
            <li> REALLY STRONG</li>
            <li> He was very pleased with it and will be using it instead of his old favorite that is beginning to deterioate.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and as advertised; bought 2!</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean accumulated hair.  </li>
            <li> Looks to be well-made, and feels comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li> but thats the only kink in this great brush.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a cheap knock off.</li>
            <li> It feels amazing and my hair looks so much healthier already.</li>
            <li> Recommend to people looking for a cheap brush.</li>
            <li> Best to consult a hairdresser first before using this if you are worried about it being a bit rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the product and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I would give the brush a better rating if it had more natural boar hair, since believing it did was the reason why I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Honestly, you are better off investing in a different brush or just saving your money by looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, fly away hair.  </li>
            <li> Reason is too much plastic &#x27;reinforcement&#x27; which leaves my hair a bit static.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect if you have thick, tangle-prone hair.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush for those who have very coarse hair</li>
            <li> A quick comb does the trick.</li>
            <li> Arrived in mail quickly.</li>
            <li> Not as soft as my old one, but great on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I love it that much and the price is just right to buy a replacement.  </li>
            <li> Would be good for man, not for woman with long hair, hurt scalp.</li>
            <li> This brush has been pretty good for me, but was retired as I grew my hair out longer and went back to using shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Wood and bristles themselves very good quality, bristles just not long enough for my needs.</li>
            <li> It really added lustre and volume to my fine hair.</li>
            <li> ITS BIG!I CANT FIT THE WHOLE THING IN MY HAND.</li>
            <li> short, this brush is okay, but I would not claim it to be superior to a non-boar bristle brush of the same price.</li>
            <li> but I find the brush useful at days end to remove the additional hair product used for styling.</li>
            <li> Make sure you shampoo frequently to prevent stirring up dandruff when you brush your hair.</li>
            <li> She was looking for something that would be soft, but the reinforced bristles felt more like porcupine quills than boar hair.</li>
            <li> I run a plastic scalp massager through it and hair lifts right out.</li>
            <li> but they are just right.</li>
            <li> BUT IT BRUSHES GOOD AND KEEPS MY HAIR DOWN.</li>
            <li> This came recommended on a hair blog for those trying to move their natural oils down the length of the hair and it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> Came very fast</li>
            <li> Brush is well made and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t find the brush very comfortable, and frankly I find it unsuitable for human use.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel more alive and vibrant.</li>
            <li> it feels great in my hair its really hard</li>
            <li> delivery.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is alright, I am not sorry I bought it, but I am not going to re-order this brush either.</li>
            <li> I got this brush as a present for my husband because they don&#x27;t sell them any more in stores.</li>
            <li> Currently, I&#x27;m wearing it pixie short with a floppy top section, but this brush is able to reach my scalp with no problems.  </li>
            <li> Brush is exactly how described.</li>
            <li> Consequently, it only brushes the top layer of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bristles started falling out at first...</li>
            <li> I had to wash it in hot water and put it in the freezer for a hour and then defrost it to soften the bristles.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to smooth my natural hair when I wear it in a bum, which is my go to style.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good firm brush.</li>
            <li> However, the bristles are too soft to push through my fine (but lots of it), straight hair to get to the scalp.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping,good handling great item, the brush is steady and it feels like a massage on your skull,good for male and female.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, should have gotten one a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Got this brush after reading an on line article on growing long healthy hair.</li>
            <li> Love the brush long time.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what I needed it to draining much water from my hair and keeping my waves intact.</li>
            <li> The bristles are not flimsy and my hair is super soft after using it.</li>
            <li> The brush I received is not the pictured brand of Diane brush and certainly isn&#x27;t 100% boar hair.</li>
            <li> and I certainly dont have it now...</li>
            <li> The boar bristles that you can find are so fine that they won&#x27;t stand up with the coarse plastic ones.</li>
            <li> Good hard brush..</li>
            <li> I bought the #8159 in search of a good hard brush to really get the job done while wolfing.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for wolfing it hard but don&#x27;t use it after a haircut use a soft brush so your hair dont get used to it.</li>
            <li> This is a brush, so I&#x27;m not going to say too much about it.</li>
            <li> This brush is well constructed, solid, yet still light.  </li>
            <li> Bristles much shorter than pictured.</li>
            <li> Hair much softer and shinier.</li>
            <li> (and I have straight, medium thickness hair).</li>
            <li> Works great on my thin hair.</li>
            <li> It is a nylon brush with very sparse boars hair on it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so much softer than the nylon</li>
            <li> Came fast and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Thanks again</li>
            <li> Bristles are falling out when I brush with it and getting stuck in my hair every time I use it so much so that a section of the brush doesn&#x27;t have them anymore</li>
            <li> Bristles have held up and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> but you just have to brush your head gently and it does work.</li>
            <li> ~ surprised it&#x27;s not more popular!</li>
            <li> I no longer have what used to be fairly severe psoriasis on my scalp and all I did was start brushing with this brush a few times a week and also stop putting conditioner directly on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I love the stiffness and sturdiness of the man-made fibers, mixed in with the boars hair to re-distribute my hair&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
            <li> Super hard brush, you better have a lot of hair so your not killing your scalp or soak in hot water</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff and it feels nice on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Hoping that this would tame flyaways and be a nice brush.</li>
            <li> Well-made, but be aware that this is not a small brush by any means.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The seller responded quickly to my initial review and offered to refund the full price -- I declined the refund</li>
            <li> Very cheap and not a true &#x27;boar bristle brush.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> get better with time, but I have to admit being slightly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> previous reviewer had written that it does not create static electricity - yet every time I use it, my hair stands on end, leaving me feeling like I just went to a science fair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush to anyone with any type of hair.</li>
            <li> and the brushes are kind of soft ,but i dont need a hard brush really.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure that it did the same job as much more expensive brushes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying something new.</li>
            <li> Brand new condition,</li>
            <li> Overall a good hard brush.</li>
            <li> The brush only feels cheap, but it is well sturdy-built to last.</li>
            <li> The brush seems solid, but closer inspection of the bristles showed that about 60% of it is plastic and the rest very sparse real hair.</li>
            <li> Nowhere near as good a brush as I expected but still efficient, none the less.</li>
            <li> The brush I received was a Gabriella soft bristle brush #G1012B that I would never order!</li>
            <li> My hair barely even touch the boar bristles because they are so soft that they have sunk to the bottom of the brush and really are doing nothing</li>
            <li> As others have indicated, this is probably due to the fact that most of the bristles are synthetic, and not natural.</li>
            <li> My son needed a hard bristle brush, he was ok with it</li>
            <li> The advertisement clearly reads that this is a Diane 8159 model brush, which I paid for, and I got an  8115 brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my elderly mother, whose scalp is quite sensitive.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels soft after brushing and looks shiny too.</li>
            <li> It is nearly all plastic-</li>
            <li> This brush is prolly the strongest I have used so far</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;reinforced\\&quot; plastic bristles would make this brush too harsh for some, but I like the way it lightly scratches my scalp while I brush.</li>
            <li> My two year old son even lets me brush his hair with it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this brush if you are looking for soft bristles...</li>
            <li> I love that this brush is firm enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> I suggest that most only need to purchase this firmness if you are in 4th - 6th week of &amp;#34;wolfing&amp;#34; and you are new to the WAVE GAME and your hair still needs much training...</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s reinforced as it stands a shot at penetrating my ridiculous mane.</li>
            <li> It is more gentle than any other brush I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> but I could not down rate it if I cant remember.</li>
            <li> Much more effective and less expensive then treatment from a Dermatologist!</li>
            <li> got the wave brush, extra firm reinforced boar with light wood.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are just the right stiffness to get down through hair to scalp.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are way stiffer than I expected; so stiff that they are better suited for use as a scrub brush</li>
            <li> It has the boar bristle to softly comb out the outer regions of her hair, and when she needs to get close to her scalp, the nylon bristles comb out the tangles where the boar bristle portion finishes up the daily brushing.  </li>
            <li> and I can use this straight from the shower with wet hair.  </li>
            <li> However, after talking to my stepfather who also owns this brush, he let me know that after using the brush several times it&#x27;ll get soft.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of wave grease, and my hair, although African to the core, is quite soft.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much and the harder bristles actually penetrate all the way through to my scalp.</li>
            <li> The brush retains scalp skin and the boar hairs don&#x27;t stay on the brush worth a damn, and after a few uses all of the boar hair falls out and the brush ends up with only nylon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad the bristles aren&#x27;t too soft because then it&#x27;d be totally useless on my hair.</li>
            <li> No excuse!</li>
            <li> The plastic bristles are needed because a pure boar hair brush would just smash down against my head.</li>
            <li> Extra firm is right, and that is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> -Noticeably helps with tangles and split ends within the first few weeks</li>
            <li> I got a lot of comments the first few days after using it.</li>
            <li> A few bristles came out on the first brushing session, but after that it&#x27;s been everything I need.</li>
            <li> Bristles are strong enough and long enough even for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> It left my wavy hair soft and shiny even brushing dry.</li>
            <li> bristles themselves are pretty stiff and rough - they don&#x27;t pull on my hair as much as my old plastic brush did, which I like, but when they touch my scalp or the nape of my neck</li>
            <li> This brush does have boar bristles, but it is mostly made up of plastic bristles that are really hard with just a few boar bristles.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are long and hard and great for hard to wave and lay down hair</li>
            <li> The brush is initally a little hard on my scaple, but once I soaked it overnight in hot water, the brush really softened up and keeps my hair wavey and spinning.  </li>
            <li> The tight bristles help move oils through your hair and scalp making it healthier, but for thin delicate hair and lots of it in my case, it tended to feel tangled and tight after brushing, rather than falling more naturally and smoothly.</li>
            <li> My hair is in the \\&quot;long\\&quot; category, straight, &amp; not particularly thick or thin, but I need to brush the underside in order to get all the tangles out.</li>
            <li> Been waving pretty hard on and off since 5th grade..</li>
            <li> At first the bristles are hard on your he&#x27;d</li>
            <li> -Can be a bit rough on the skin (or scalp) if not careful  </li>
            <li> The brush offers less than what you see on the picture.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong this brush is probably great for a woman&#x27;s hair, but for a man this brush is terrible, it makes my scalp feel as if it just fought a battle in Iraq, definitely not what I want to feel out of my hair brush, need something gentler for the hair, or at least my hair, the bristles are super strong</li>
            <li> This is my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; brush when I want to relax and just brush my hair to destress after a long day.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> BCuz u could use it for long hair &amp; alter its firmness for men&#x27;s hair cuts.</li>
            <li> The brush is far too stiff, and scratches the scalp creating dandruff.</li>
            <li> He really likes the brush but said the bristles are a little too firm for him.  </li>
            <li> Blow dry it?</li>
            <li> One star to bring attention to the fact that &#x27;reinforced&#x27; means 75% plastic bristles (with a flat, sharp end) and 25% boar bristles</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 9 inches long and about 2.4 inches wide.</li>
            <li> Once the loose bristles were gone, the brush works well for long, thick hair and my 7 year old granddaughter likes using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this brush for about a week and a half now, so perhaps the issues I have with it</li>
            <li> and i love that if only i dont keep loosing it :(</li>
            <li> This brush is somewhere half way between soft and hard, and I would only recommend it if my friend likes scratching her head with her hairbrush.</li>
            <li> This brush was a bit hard especially for me since I have a very short haircut.</li>
            <li> My disappointment is primarily from this; I expected it to be reinforced boar hair, not plastic reinforced with bits of boar hair.</li>
            <li> But for the price, that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> IT WASNT WHAT I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> This brush should be called a nylon brush with a few boar bristles as there are only a few strands of actual boar bristles.</li>
            <li> It was a bit broader than I expected</li>
            <li> but it is firm enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> It is truely extra firm.</li>
            <li> (I am 24 now) &amp; never really cared about what brush I used.</li>
            <li> Just be careful with it.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are not as flexible as the Diane #9007 and tend feel rough against my hair even when I&#x27;m wolfing(4-6 weeks without a cut)</li>
            <li> When I got this brush in the mail I could tell it was a knock off Diane brush from the feel to the bristles of the brush, don&#x27;t be fooled by the price this is no real Diane brush.</li>
            <li> It is basically short plastic bristles with a few boar hairs added.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit harder than I expected and can be a bit rough sometimes.</li>
            <li> This only happened to me when my hair was a few days unwashed, and then I think it&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> The reinforced natural boar bristle allows you to brush through the hair to your scalp if you have thick hair</li>
            <li> boars hair ot would be soft, and have &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; It is not like the other boar head brushes I have had, This one is so hard</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my husband because he likes extra stiff bristles.  </li>
            <li> other than that any brush with get u waves as long as you wear your durag and use a pomade to lay it down or the \\&quot;water method\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The edges aren&#x27;t sharp or prone to splinter.  </li>
            <li> For extreme stages of wolfing...</li>
            <li> Other reviewers say they don&#x27;t like it because it &amp;#34;matted down&amp;#34; their hair.</li>
            <li> I should have read the other reviews.</li>
            <li> i bought this because i have very thick hair, but the bristles are so soft that it does nothing to help my hair, i&#x27;m disappointed, but for the price, its ok</li>
            <li> Way too hard on the human scalp!</li>
            <li> This boar bristle brush calms my hair to lay down &amp; even gives a shine</li>
            <li> Just as all the other 1 star reviews said, This brush is Garbage!</li>
            <li> , that may have lasted a little longer, but are at least ten times the price.</li>
            <li> Works as presented and is helping with my seborrheic dermatitis (removing scaling) for less scalp irritation and even oil distribution.</li>
            <li> I wish amazon wouldn&#x27;t sell less than quality items.</li>
            <li> I hope they&#x27;ll soften a little with age.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the brustles do fall out a little bit.</li>
            <li> but I used it a lot in the shower and it started to get a little mold</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone 4 weeks without cutting my hair and this brush handles my hair really well.</li>
            <li> Is was too firm for my scalp.</li>
            <li> It does what I&#x27;d like it to do - it&#x27;s firm, bristly, and it brushes.</li>
            <li> It does make my hair feel smoother after a few minutes of brushing</li>
            <li> This has plastic bristles with just a few boar placed here and there.</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t QUITE as firm as I thought they might be and are sort of bending on the one side after 1.5 months of use.</li>
            <li> the bristles are firm but not too harsh on the scalp.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t you waste your money on any of these (Amazon) boar bristle stuff.</li>
            <li> no brussels missing.</li>
            <li> Works well to get the knap out of my hair on an everyday basis.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard that this men&#x27;s brush will straighten and untangle any woman&#x27;s long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> Hoping in time they soften up (the nylon bristles are stiff).</li>
            <li> The product is too stiff to be used by my wife.</li>
            <li> I recommend this brush to all who prefer a stiff brush.</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;d recommend this produce to those that want a stiff bristled brush for those that want a stiff bristled brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are way too stiff.</li>
            <li> The bristles are at 1/3rd the density, and stiff as nails.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a brush with stiff bristles that will tame your hair and make your scalp tingle, this is your brush.  </li>
            <li> There were some really gross days where I had no choices but to braid my hair or wear a scarf, but overall the transition was not too painful.</li>
            <li> what little boar bristles there are are falling out before even using it!  </li>
            <li> Not sure length of bristles, about 1/2\\&quot; is a guess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s larger than I thought it would be, but that&#x27;s user fail for not reading the specs.  </li>
            <li> but I be not more.</li>
            <li> Very firm bristles.</li>
            <li> the number of boar bristles are so less you can count on fingers and remainins bristles are plastic that too very hard one.</li>
            <li> As said the bristles are so hard it rips your hair out even if you dont have hairfall problem.</li>
            <li> the finish on the wood is cheap/cheaply done &amp; the brush is extremely hard.</li>
            <li> However, it is extremely hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still to hard for me even after I&#x27;ve let it set overnight in some microwaved-hot water.</li>
            <li> Thought the bristles were going to be too hard</li>
            <li> Bristle are hard, has sold wood handle.</li>
            <li> The plastic bristles scratch my scalp and hurt because they are so hard.  </li>
            <li> The rest are hard plastic.</li>
            <li> I bet it wouldn&#x27;t be the case if your hair is thin as the bristles might be a little too abrasive.</li>
            <li> Hard brush, for thick hair or when you wolfing.</li>
            <li> This brush is such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> through thick bears with no fear of bristle-breakage  </li>
            <li> I recommend if you have thick, unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> However, I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I use it when my hair is thick</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t agree that it&#x27;s extra firm, but for a price of $3.99, I&#x27;d be an idiot to complain.  </li>
            <li> Needed a replacement for a horse hair brush which is next to impossible.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was disappointed with this very stiff brush with shedding bristles.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too bad of a hit to take tho because it was only about five dollars.</li>
            <li> It penetrates through my thick hair to the scalp and feels like a massage!</li>
            <li> It is very very hard.  </li>
            <li> It was a poor brush for my hair.</li>
            <li> cause they make YOU pay for return shipping when it&#x27;s THEIR false advertising.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because he needed a new brush (in the worst way).  </li>
            <li> They had them for a mere $35</li>
            <li> So unfortunately, I&#x27;ll be looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> and I mean literally is painful and it scratches and leaves marks on my neck if I brush it</li>
            <li> all the other Diane brushes were awful and shed their bristles and for some reason this one (\\&quot;reinforced boar\\&quot;) didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Bad Comb</li>
            <li> SO I WAS SHOCKED</li>
            <li> it is quite painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve built up anticipation just to be disappointed time and time again.</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> Disappointed -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m avoiding this company all together, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Save your time and energy and don&#x27;t buy this- awful brush.  </li>
            <li> This brush is terrible.</li>
            <li> Scratches your head terribly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love that this brush is firm enough to do the job. The bristles are not flimsy and my hair is super soft after using it. It is comfortable to use. Some people might find it bulky, but I&#x27;m not that picky. It is more gentle than any other brush I have used in the past. This brush does not make your hair static either if anyone is ever worried about that. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with bristles coming out. I&#x27;d have to say this is the best brush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong this brush is probably great for a woman&#x27;s hair, but for a man this brush is terrible, it makes my scalp feel as if it just fought a battle in Iraq, definitely not what I want to feel out of my hair brush, need something gentler for the hair, or at least my hair, the bristles are super strong so it really doesn&#x27;t feel nice!</li>
            <li> I have very dry, fly away hair.  I&#x27;ve tried everything!  This boar bristle brush calms my hair to lay down &amp; even gives a shine ~ surprised it&#x27;s not more popular!</li>
            <li> Is was too firm for my scalp.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush for 360 waves</li>
            <li> Good name brand waving brush with extremely strong bristles. I suggest that most only need to purchase this firmness if you are in 4th - 6th week of &amp;#34;wolfing&amp;#34; and you are new to the WAVE GAME and your hair still needs much training...</li>
            <li> I love this brush, should have gotten one a long time ago.It makes my hair feel more alive and vibrant. I use it every night before going to bed. Yeah!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my elderly mother, whose scalp is quite sensitive.  This brush works quite well.  It has the boar bristle to softly comb out the outer regions of her hair, and when she needs to get close to her scalp, the nylon bristles comb out the tangles where the boar bristle portion finishes up the daily brushing.  It meets her approval, so it must then meet with mine.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Diane #8119 brush and when my package arrived from \\&quot;My Dashing Beauty\\&quot; store, it was a completely different item. The brush I received was a Gabriella soft bristle brush #G1012B that I would never order! PISSED OFF!! BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY! you will lose your money!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a brush, so I&#x27;m not going to say too much about it. It does what I&#x27;d like it to do - it&#x27;s firm, bristly, and it brushes. I like it&#x27;s appearance. Yes it could be more durable, it could be all boar&#x27;s hair. Anyone expecting that from a $5 brush, however, is a deluded slave to marketing.</li>
            <li> This was a good brush - I was happy with it till the bristles started to list to one side because of how I brush my hair. But for the price, that is to be expected. I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the product and would buy it again. It really added lustre and volume to my fine hair. I&#x27;m pretty sure that it did the same job as much more expensive brushes, that may have lasted a little longer, but are at least ten times the price. A good call if you don&#x27;t mind replacing the brush every six months or so, and that&#x27;s just my preference.</li>
            <li> Okay, it says 100% boar hair....and yes, there is boar hair in this brush ALONG with nylon bristles.  This came recommended on a hair blog for those trying to move their natural oils down the length of the hair and it works beautifully.  The plastic bristles are needed because a pure boar hair brush would just smash down against my head.</li>
            <li> This brush is well constructed, solid, yet still light.  The edges aren&#x27;t sharp or prone to splinter.  Overall this item meets and exceeds my expectations for the price.  Pros:  -Well built  -Strong bristles  -Combs through thick bears with no fear of bristle-breakage  -No odor  -Noticeably helps with tangles and split ends within the first few weeks (this might be just my experience)  Cons  -Could have used better quality wood for handle (nit-picking)  -If the bristles weren&#x27;t claimed to be boar hair, I would have sworn it was synthetic  -Can be a bit rough on the skin (or scalp) if not careful  I recommend if you have thick, unruly hair.  Best to consult a hairdresser first before using this if you are worried about it being a bit rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS A GREAT BRUSH. IT WASNT WHAT I EXPECTED ITS BIG!I CANT FIT THE WHOLE THING IN MY HAND. BUT IT BRUSHES GOOD AND KEEPS MY HAIR DOWN. REALLY STRONG I DROPPED ONCE AND NOTHING HAPPENED AND ITS MADE OUT OF WOOD SO I WAS SHOCKED IT DIDNT CHIPPED OR ANYHTING. THE BRISTLES DONT FALL OFF AND THE DESIGN IS PERFECT. THIS IS A BUY YOU WONT REGRET.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush. The bristles are stiff and it feels nice on my scalp. It collects a lot of dust but that means it&#x27;s out of my hair! I got a lot of comments the first few days after using it. One co-worker stopped in her tracks and asked \\&quot;What did you do to your hair? Blow dry it? Straighten it?\\&quot; :-) My hair feels soft after brushing and looks shiny too. I like to comb it after brushing because the bristles are close together and it makes my hair almost lock so I can&#x27;t run my fingers through it. A quick comb does the trick.</li>
            <li> First, the good things about this product is its affordable price and a very quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is alright, I am not sorry I bought it, but I am not going to re-order this brush either. Reason is too much plastic &#x27;reinforcement&#x27; which leaves my hair a bit static. I have medium-thick hair and the brush does get through.</li>
            <li> I got this brush as a present for my husband because they don&#x27;t sell them any more in stores. He loves the brush. He uses it every day.</li>
            <li> Good hard brush.. For extreme stages of wolfing... Bristles are long and hard and great for hard to wave and lay down hair</li>
            <li> I use it as the last step in my daily brushing. It&#x27;s great for distributing natural oils and giving my hair a nice smooth finish. I love that it&#x27;s reinforced as it stands a shot at penetrating my ridiculous mane.</li>
            <li> I never knew the benefits of a boar bristle brush until walking into a fancy hair care shop in Scottsdale. They had them for a mere $35 and I was told that they would help alleviate the psoriasis on my scalp if used it before washing my hair. Of course I opted for Amazon and a $7 version, but I don&#x27;t think the lower price resulted in any lower quality in this case. I no longer have what used to be fairly severe psoriasis on my scalp and all I did was start brushing with this brush a few times a week and also stop putting conditioner directly on my scalp. Much more effective and less expensive then treatment from a Dermatologist!</li>
            <li> This is not a mans brush, especially not men with short or medium hair. The brush is far too stiff, and scratches the scalp creating dandruff. It&#x27;s like running a nail file across your head. The brush retains scalp skin and the boar hairs don&#x27;t stay on the brush worth a damn, and after a few uses all of the boar hair falls out and the brush ends up with only nylon. It wasn&#x27;t too bad of a hit to take tho because it was only about five dollars. I&#x27;m hoping dianes 100% boar brush is better</li>
            <li> Bristles are just the right stiffness to get down through hair to scalp. Using this my hair has a tendency to make a wave at the front,  something I have not had before,  but I like. Easy to clean accumulated hair.  I run a plastic scalp massager through it and hair lifts right out.</li>
            <li> Well-made, but be aware that this is not a small brush by any means. Very good if it&#x27;s actually what you want.</li>
            <li> I finally got the brush in the mail. The bristles are a bit harder than I expected and can be a bit rough sometimes. However, I have thick hair so it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much and the harder bristles actually penetrate all the way through to my scalp. I&#x27;m glad the bristles aren&#x27;t too soft because then it&#x27;d be totally useless on my hair. It does make my hair feel smoother after a few minutes of brushing so I guess in the end it does what it&#x27;s meant for. Great deal for this. Very inexpensive for a good boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> This has plastic bristles with just a few boar placed here and there. The boar bristles that you can find are so fine that they won&#x27;t stand up with the coarse plastic ones.</li>
            <li> Extra firm is right, and that is just what I wanted. Looks to be well-made, and feels comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li> It was a poor brush for my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this brush for about a week and a half now, so perhaps the issues I have with it get better with time, but I have to admit being slightly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;A previous reviewer had written that it does not create static electricity - yet every time I use it, my hair stands on end, leaving me feeling like I just went to a science fair.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles themselves are pretty stiff and rough - they don&#x27;t pull on my hair as much as my old plastic brush did, which I like, but when they touch my scalp or the nape of my neck it is quite painful. I hope they&#x27;ll soften a little with age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this brush is okay, but I would not claim it to be superior to a non-boar bristle brush of the same price. It just has different pros and cons.</li>
            <li> Very firm bristles. Hoping in time they soften up (the nylon bristles are stiff). Works as presented and is helping with my seborrheic dermatitis (removing scaling) for less scalp irritation and even oil distribution. My hair length is short but I find the brush useful at days end to remove the additional hair product used for styling. Great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/6/14:  Yep, still have this brush and it&#x27;s seen me from every hairstyle imaginable. Currently, I&#x27;m wearing it pixie short with a floppy top section, but this brush is able to reach my scalp with no problems.  This is my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; brush when I want to relax and just brush my hair to destress after a long day. If you&#x27;re wondering, it hasn&#x27;t deteriorated, degraded, or diminished in function since day one.</li>
            <li> This brush should be called a nylon brush with a few boar bristles as there are only a few strands of actual boar bristles.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time. It was a bit broader than I expected but it is firm enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> i bought this because i have very thick hair, but the bristles are so soft that it does nothing to help my hair, i&#x27;m disappointed, but for the price, its ok</li>
            <li> This brush is a great boar bristle brush for its price. The bristles aren&#x27;t QUITE as firm as I thought they might be and are sort of bending on the one side after 1.5 months of use. But for $7, I am more than pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my husband since it&#x27;s what he likes. I used it for myself and it felt great! It left my wavy hair soft and shiny even brushing dry. It penetrates through my thick hair to the scalp and feels like a massage!</li>
            <li> Nice hair brush. This one can actually change the direction your hair falls unlike a comb. the bristles are firm but not too harsh on the scalp. Make sure you shampoo frequently to prevent stirring up dandruff when you brush your hair.</li>
            <li> Advice to everyone out there: don&#x27;t you waste your money on any of these (Amazon) boar bristle stuff. I&#x27;ve built up anticipation just to be disappointed time and time again. Just get one from Wal-Mart and be happy and the availability and affordability. Plus, it works!The Wal-Mart ones, ie.</li>
            <li> As said the bristles are so hard it rips your hair out even if you dont have hairfall problem. the number of boar bristles are so less you can count on fingers and remainins bristles are plastic that too very hard one.</li>
            <li> would definately recommend this  brush to families and friends. washes well. great to brush and hold hair in place. used on short hair</li>
            <li> Bristles much shorter than pictured. Would be good for man, not for woman with long hair, hurt scalp. Not sure length of bristles, about 1/2\\&quot; is a guess. Wood and bristles themselves very good quality, bristles just not long enough for my needs.</li>
            <li> It is truely extra firm. I would only recommend to someone who is almost at the end of wolfing, 8+ weeks. IMO</li>
            <li> Save your time and energy and don&#x27;t buy this- awful brush.  It is nearly all plastic- what little boar bristles there are are falling out before even using it!  Very cheap and not a true &#x27;boar bristle brush.&#x27;  I wish amazon wouldn&#x27;t sell less than quality items.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was disappointed with this very stiff brush with shedding bristles.  Once the loose bristles were gone, the brush works well for long, thick hair and my 7 year old granddaughter likes using it.&lt;br /&gt;The seller responded quickly to my initial review and offered to refund the full price -- I declined the refund and I&#x27;m pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> I just realized that these reviews are for an assortment of brushes, not the specific one we purchased.  So a lot of comments  may not apply to what you&#x27;re thinking of getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the wave brush, extra firm reinforced boar with light wood.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t agree that it&#x27;s extra firm, but for a price of $3.99, I&#x27;d be an idiot to complain.  I have long hair and I can use this straight from the shower with wet hair.  It&#x27;s larger than I thought it would be, but that&#x27;s user fail for not reading the specs.  It&#x27;s 9 inches long and about 2.4 inches wide.</li>
            <li> This brush is excellent.  I bought it at a store and all the other Diane brushes were awful and shed their bristles and for some reason this one (\\&quot;reinforced boar\\&quot;) didn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s a great brush.</li>
            <li> The product is too stiff to be used by my wife. She was looking for something that would be soft, but the reinforced bristles felt more like porcupine quills than boar hair. This brush is somewhere half way between soft and hard, and I would only recommend it if my friend likes scratching her head with her hairbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought the #8159 in search of a good hard brush to really get the job done while wolfing. A few bristles came out on the first brushing session, but after that it&#x27;s been everything I need. It&#x27;s a good firm brush. Hardest brush I&#x27;ve ever bought. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be all nylon like someone else started. Overall a good hard brush. If there&#x27;s a better one out for wavers at this price, someone let me know.</li>
            <li> This brush has been pretty good for me, but was retired as I grew my hair out longer and went back to using shampoo.  The tight bristles help move oils through your hair and scalp making it healthier, but for thin delicate hair and lots of it in my case, it tended to feel tangled and tight after brushing, rather than falling more naturally and smoothly.</li>
            <li> Best boar brush out there.</li>
            <li> Nice quality! Bristles are strong enough and long enough even for my thick hair. Cleans nicely as well. Will buy this brand/product again.</li>
            <li> Been waving pretty hard on and off since 5th grade..(I am 24 now) &amp; never really cared about what brush I used. Back then we just wore durags and brushed all day bc it was cool &amp; if u ended up getting waves than hey it was a bonus lol..anyway the point I am trying to make is its not the brush u buy but how often you use it. This brush is prolly the strongest I have used so far &amp; like I said on the title it is great if you are wolfing for weeks on end..other than that any brush with get u waves as long as you wear your durag and use a pomade to lay it down or the \\&quot;water method\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect brush for shot male hair grooming and it also gives a perfect scalp treatment.</li>
            <li> I give this brush a 4/5 BCuz the finish on the wood is cheap/cheaply done &amp; the brush is extremely hard. The brush only feels cheap, but it is well sturdy-built to last. I&#x27;ve had mine about a month &amp; it has not shed. However, it is extremely hard. I have coarse/rugged hair that is almost the length of a 3guard (hair clippers). It&#x27;s so hard that this men&#x27;s brush will straighten and untangle any woman&#x27;s long, thick hair. It&#x27;s still to hard for me even after I&#x27;ve let it set overnight in some microwaved-hot water. If u keep boiling it, it will soften up. This is a good brush BCuz u could use it for long hair &amp; alter its firmness for men&#x27;s hair cuts.</li>
            <li> Super hard brush, you better have a lot of hair so your not killing your scalp or soak in hot water</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my husband because he likes extra stiff bristles.  He was very pleased with it and will be using it instead of his old favorite that is beginning to deterioate. I recommend this brush to all who prefer a stiff brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone 4 weeks without cutting my hair and this brush handles my hair really well. Perfect brush for wavers who are wolfing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it was shaped to contour your head like a crown brush.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t draw the oils from my scalp out to ends. If anything, it stimulates my scalp to create more oils! As others have indicated, this is probably due to the fact that most of the bristles are synthetic, and not natural.</li>
            <li> Liked the quality.  Nothing to dislike. Yes, I&#x27;d recommend this produce to those that want a stiff bristled brush for those that want a stiff bristled brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush.  Just be careful with it.  It is very very hard.  If your cut is low you can scratch your scalp with this.</li>
            <li> Durable Brush.  Can tell a difference after using 1 time.  Hair much softer and shinier. Never used this type of brush before and now I will never use another type.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying something new. Going without shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about 2 1/2 months for my hair to equalize and stop producing excess oils. There were some really gross days where I had no choices but to braid my hair or wear a scarf, but overall the transition was not too painful. I am very happy with my hair now the transition period is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is perfect for removing excess buildup on my hair that is not removed by water alone. I use it about twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some days the brush does create a lot of static in my fine hair. The \\&quot;reinforced\\&quot; plastic bristles would make this brush too harsh for some, but I like the way it lightly scratches my scalp while I brush. I have noticed a big difference in the day to day condition of my hair and am very happy I purchased this brush.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick &amp;, surprisingly, wasn&#x27;t charged fees for it. The brush seems solid, but closer inspection of the bristles showed that about 60% of it is plastic and the rest very sparse real hair. My disappointment is primarily from this; I expected it to be reinforced boar hair, not plastic reinforced with bits of boar hair. Regardless, it brushes without yanking on my hair. My hair is in the \\&quot;long\\&quot; category, straight, &amp; not particularly thick or thin, but I need to brush the underside in order to get all the tangles out. I would give the brush a better rating if it had more natural boar hair, since believing it did was the reason why I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> this brush is one of the best brushes i have ever had. I use it for waves and it gives the spaceing i need. but every bodies hair is different and im mixed so......... but the brustles do fall out a little bit. but it stops after a month. but thats the only kink in this great brush. and the brushes are kind of soft ,but i dont need a hard brush really.</li>
            <li> Way too hard on the human scalp! It may pull your hair out. I like the softer versions better. Peace</li>
            <li> The brush I received is not the pictured brand of Diane brush and certainly isn&#x27;t 100% boar hair. Just as all the other 1 star reviews said, This brush is Garbage! The seller is trying to con you. I wouldnt recommend buying any of his/her Diane products because their is no telling what you will get.</li>
            <li> Brush is exactly how described. Brand new condition, no brussels missing. Great!</li>
            <li> My son needed a hard bristle brush, he was ok with it but I noticed bristles were coming out rapidly</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because he needed a new brush (in the worst way).  He really likes the brush but said the bristles are a little too firm for him.  He said it will take some getting used to but found that he does not need to use hair products when using this brush.</li>
            <li> Got this brush after reading an on line article on growing long healthy hair. It is now part of my 100 brush strokes per night. Very good quality, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I read that boar bristle brushes were the best for your hair. Hoping that this would tame flyaways and be a nice brush. But it doesn&#x27;t even get through to my scalp at all (and I have straight, medium thickness hair). And it creates a ton of static.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect if you have thick, tangle-prone hair. It totally works for me since it brushes my hair (even the inside layers) but doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp. I bet it wouldn&#x27;t be the case if your hair is thin as the bristles might be a little too abrasive.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, well made brush.  A great value for the price.  However, the bristles are too soft to push through my fine (but lots of it), straight hair to get to the scalp.  Consequently, it only brushes the top layer of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d love for this brush to work for me, but I need to brush all my hair, not just the top layer.  So unfortunately, I&#x27;ll be looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> This brush is such a disappointment. I was looking forward to a boar bristle brush, but when I opened the package, I discovered that almost all the bristles are plastic. There is no mention of any plastic bristles in the product page on Amazon. I plan to report this. I would give zero stars if I could.</li>
            <li> The advertisement clearly reads that this is a Diane 8159 model brush, which I paid for, and I got an  8115 brush. No excuse!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush</li>
            <li> Great Brush to wash my pet pig</li>
            <li> One of the best wave brushes</li>
            <li> This brush is terrible. The bristles are way too stiff. Scratches your head terribly.</li>
            <li> intersting that i came across this item for rating. I know I ordered it but I dont remember getting it and I certainly dont have it now...but I could not down rate it if I cant remember.</li>
            <li> I love the stiffness and sturdiness of the man-made fibers, mixed in with the boars hair to re-distribute my hair&#x27;s natural oils. Affordable and sturdy product. Works great on my thin hair. Other reviewers say they don&#x27;t like it because it &amp;#34;matted down&amp;#34; their hair. This only happened to me when my hair was a few days unwashed, and then I think it&#x27;s to be expected. Doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It does the job I need it to.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t what i thought it&#x27;d be like. However, after talking to my stepfather who also owns this brush, he let me know that after using the brush several times it&#x27;ll get soft. He also let me know that this is a great brush for him.</li>
            <li> Love it, love to scratch my body all over with it. Very happy. Love the brush long time. mmm hmm</li>
            <li> It is a nylon brush with very sparse boars hair on it. Like the ratio os literally 9:1. The boars hair never even touches your hair cause it&#x27;s so much softer than the nylon so it bends underneath it. Do not buy this product it&#x27;s a cheap knock off. You can&#x27;t return it once you buy it cause they make YOU pay for return shipping when it&#x27;s THEIR false advertising. So I&#x27;m not paying $3 to send back a $5 product. I&#x27;m avoiding this company all together, very disappointed. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Great product! I will purchase again in the future and tell others . Came fast and well packaged. Thanks again</li>
            <li> The brush is initally a little hard on my scaple, but once I soaked it overnight in hot water, the brush really softened up and keeps my hair wavey and spinning.  The Lady Diane gives great head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about a week and I LOVE it!  My two year old son even lets me brush his hair with it.  I&#x27;m ordering another as a gift and another for myself because my dog ate the handle.  :(  I love it that much and the price is just right to buy a replacement.  It feels amazing and my hair looks so much healthier already.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome.  It feels so good to your scalp.  I use it about three days a week before I wash my hair.  I love the feel of it.  I have curly hair that knots easily and this brush works even on my hair.  I highly recommend this brush to anyone with any type of hair.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are way stiffer than I expected; so stiff that they are better suited for use as a scrub brush</li>
            <li> It is a good product. Good quality. And for people who need it, I recommend it 100%. In addition, this a good price.</li>
            <li> Thought the bristles were going to be too hard but they are just right. My hair is shorter than shoulder length but I love the way it goes through my hair and massages the scalp!</li>
            <li> its a very good brush. I use it when my hair is thick</li>
            <li> This brush is great for wolfing it hard but don&#x27;t use it after a haircut use a soft brush so your hair dont get used to it. But waves looking way better now thicker fuller and deeeeeeeepppppppppppp!!!</li>
            <li> This was just the type of brush I was looking for.  Nice design and of very good quality.  I am very pleased with this brush and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,good handling great item, the brush is steady and it feels like a massage on your skull,good for male and female.</li>
            <li> Hard brush, for thick hair or when you wolfing.</li>
            <li> Nowhere near as good a brush as I expected but still efficient, none the less. The bristles are not as flexible as the Diane #9007 and tend feel rough against my hair even when I&#x27;m wolfing(4-6 weeks without a cut) but I promise u&#x27;d like it more than a cheap Annie from the dollar store or beauty supply store. I use it as a shower brush.</li>
            <li> I thought being this is boars hair ot would be soft, and have &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; It is not like the other boar head brushes I have had, This one is so hard that it literally..and I mean literally is painful and it scratches and leaves marks on my neck if I brush it and it meets my skin. Don&#x27;t buy this brush if you are looking for soft bristles...these are like nails.</li>
            <li> Bristles are falling out when I brush with it and getting stuck in my hair every time I use it so much so that a section of the brush doesn&#x27;t have them anymore I threw it away.</li>
            <li> Excellent, actually what I wanted.  Bristle are hard, has sold wood handle. If I get good use of the brush I will order again. Came very fast</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush once before but I used it a lot in the shower and it started to get a little mold so I had to throw it away. When I got this brush in the mail I could tell it was a knock off Diane brush from the feel to the bristles of the brush, don&#x27;t be fooled by the price this is no real Diane brush.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and as advertised; bought 2!</li>
            <li> The brush is called out as &amp;#34;reinforced boar bristle&amp;#34; brush. I should have read the other reviews. It might be 10-15% boar bristle but I be not more. It is basically short plastic bristles with a few boar hairs added.  If you truly want a boar bristle brush do not buy this one.&lt;br /&gt;If I can&#x27;t return it I will donate it to Goodwill or Salvation Army. I won&#x27;t use it in my hair, there is no benefit to using it.</li>
            <li> Brush is well made and very reasonably priced. Arrived in mail quickly. It was a great bargain. Bought for my wife. She loves it.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush for those who have very coarse hair</li>
            <li> great product plus very fast delivery</li>
            <li> Needed a replacement for a horse hair brush which is next to impossible. Found this one and gave nit a try. Not as soft as my old one, but great on the scalp.</li>
            <li> This hair brush is perfect for my hair. The reinforced natural boar bristle allows you to brush through the hair to your scalp if you have thick hair</li>
            <li> Purchased this as an alternative for a brush a lost, and was quite pleased with the results. Works well to get the knap out of my hair on an everyday basis. Recommend to people looking for a cheap brush.</li>
            <li> Bristles have held up and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> i love this brush it feels great in my hair its really hard and i love that if only i dont keep loosing it :(</li>
            <li> Great product and a great price to purchase from!  Would purchase of them again and they were fast to ship!!!!</li>
            <li> The brush offers less than what you see on the picture.  The bristles are at 1/3rd the density, and stiff as nails.  I bought it to brush my cat.  She doesn&#x27;t find the brush very comfortable, and frankly I find it unsuitable for human use.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a brush with stiff bristles that will tame your hair and make your scalp tingle, this is your brush.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Good brush...bristles started falling out at first...quality purchase none the less...feels great</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of wave grease, and my hair, although African to the core, is quite soft. The brush works well, once you take care of your hair, and brush it after your hair has been in warm water for a while. My waves are all over my head now. I recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I keep hearing how the boar brushes are so good for your hair.  This brush does have boar bristles, but it is mostly made up of plastic bristles that are really hard with just a few boar bristles.  The plastic bristles scratch my scalp and hurt because they are so hard.  My hair barely even touch the boar bristles because they are so soft that they have sunk to the bottom of the brush and really are doing nothing what so ever for my hair.  Honestly, you are better off investing in a different brush or just saving your money by looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I am a novice with 360 waves and purchased this brush from someone who recommended it. It did exactly what I needed it to draining much water from my hair and keeping my waves intact. ALL THE MORE REASON TO GET THIS BRUSH!</li>
            <li> This brush was a bit hard especially for me since I have a very short haircut. I had to wash it in hot water and put it in the freezer for a hour and then defrost it to soften the bristles. I learned this trick when I was younger.</li>
            <li> Bad Comb It will take the skin off your head instead combing your hair Boar bristles might as well be called barb wire bristles</li>
            <li> This brush is really good, it gets the work done right. At first the bristles are hard on your he&#x27;d but you just have to brush your head gently and it does work.</li>
            <li> One star to bring attention to the fact that &#x27;reinforced&#x27; means 75% plastic bristles (with a flat, sharp end) and 25% boar bristles (I think calling it 25% is generous).  Disappointed - but I&#x27;ll keep it because the return shipping is more than the cost of the brush.  I guess I&#x27;ll be heading to the drug store to LOOK at what I&#x27;m buying.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to smooth my natural hair when I wear it in a bum, which is my go to style.  The brush did not snag my hair in anyway, and made my hair look very nice.  I would recommend this brush to anyone looking for a sturdy brush to make their hair look \\&quot;done\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> This comb has like 100 boar brristles, total. The rest are hard plastic. I returned it.</li>
