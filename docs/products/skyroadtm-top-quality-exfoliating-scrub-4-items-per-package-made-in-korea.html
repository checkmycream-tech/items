    <ol>
            <li>Wonderful for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I got these as a cheaper alternative to the Baiden mitten and I am really impressed!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;To get the best result, it takes a bit of preparation.  </li>
            <li>But they still do the job perfectly.</li>

            <li>great exfoliating mitt.</li>

            <li>Take a warm bath then scrub away!</li>
            <li>These work just like the kind they use at Korean spas!</li>
            <li>Feels good on skin.</li>
            <li>how well this exfoliates, go buy a GOOD one.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and they are just as good.</li>
            <li>My skin feels good</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mittens work really good both on body and face.</li>
            <li>But the price was good</li>
            <li>I run mine through the wash each week to keep them clean, and they continue to work brilliantly.</li>
            <li>I am in love!</li>
            <li>I got some more and gave them as Christmas gifts to my girlfriends!  </li>
            <li>Welp, this mitt is amazing.</li>
            <li>These things are amazing.</li>
            <li>As others have stated, this is amazing.</li>
            <li>These bath mittens are AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are others like me out there who are looking for a good exfoliator.</li>
            <li>Korean girlfriend introduced me to this product, which is feels kind of like a scouring pad for the skin.</li>
            <li>Ehhh, I liked it</li>
            <li>I have catching up to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>best and easiest &#x27;accessory&#x27; to help cleaning up old skin.  </li>
            <li>I love going to Korean spas, but wanted to be able to do my own body scrub from time to time.</li>
            <li>used it in a hot shower, and I was happy with the way it worked.</li>
            <li>They exfoliate way better than any loofa.  </li>
            <li>Follow your spa with your favorite skin moisturizer or cream for a healthy looking and renewed skin.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I was thinking of visiting a korean spa and after some research I found out that most places use mitts like these</li>
            <li>It should include some advice of how to better use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t pay $50 for another scrub mitt I was looking at on Amazon.</li>
            <li>more like your skin seems to peel off??</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE my ttae-mil-yee~~~~</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used better</li>
            <li>My acne scars have faded, and my skin has a much more healthy appearance.</li>
            <li>It got better when I stopped using soap, but it was still there.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 100% sure using this towel</li>
            <li>Make sure you soak in a bathtub for a while - otherwise, they will not work.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to figure out just how to use these, but now that I know how, I love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No need to pay more.</li>
            <li>and im satisfied with the price and ability to find this online</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked or felt better</li>
            <li>Works much better than a loofa</li>
            <li>Clearly many people love it.</li>
            <li>After so many years I decided to do some research and found those.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>My favorite part about the Korean Spa is getting my skin scrubbed and seeing balled clumps of skin slough off.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li>My skin feels very clean and exfoliated when I use these.</li>
            <li>They work best after a long soak in the tub.</li>
            <li>but I still get pretty good results with these.</li>
            <li>and I am excited to wear shorts this summer!</li>
            <li>These do a great job exfoliating and leaving skin baby soft.  </li>
            <li>This is a good exfoliator and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>I loved them so much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more important to remember to use lotion/oil free soap like Dial.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just not as strong or haven&#x27;t mastered the art of the gloves</li>
            <li>I am very sure that at the most by the end of the month the cracks in my skin will be completely gone.</li>
            <li>These are a great &amp;#34;dupe&amp;#34; for the Baiden mitten if you don&#x27;t want to spend all that money, definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>And I got similar results to what I experienced at the spa.  </li>
            <li>, I was kind of dissapionted, and yeah it does really shrink.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use them every time a bathe;I come out silky smooth and it lasts for a while.</li>
            <li>but I have and will continue to do so with a light touch.</li>
            <li>Yep, these are the gloves they use at the Korean Day Spas, just wish they were longer to fit my hands.</li>
            <li>and I struggle to fit my hands in.</li>
            <li>Fair enough, honey :)</li>
            <li>I only brought it for my sister, because she love the Korean bathroom stuff, it is good for washing faces.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no where near as good at scrubbing myself as they do at the spa</li>
            <li>If you have eczema, or dry skin, or icthyosis, this is the absolute best thing you can use.</li>
            <li>Afterward, I felt super soft, as good as going to the spa!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are cheap, effective, easy to use, and clean up is very easy and minimal.  </li>
            <li>I originally saw these at a Korean spa where I had a scrub done.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see what my spray tan will look like after scrubbing my body with this product.</li>
            <li>to use these: Most people say you have to soak in hot water</li>
            <li>Gross but effective!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy these again, though I will probably check out the same brand&#x27;s products if they have a bigger mitt - though I&#x27;m happy since the price is good to just go throw away after a couple uses.</li>
            <li>Clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m clean.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no cleaner showering than one that entails a full body exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been to a true Korean bath spa.</li>
            <li>When I read all the five-star reviews I could not believe they were true.</li>
            <li>You first wash your body using lotion/oil free soap then soak for about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>However the best results are achieved after a bath or hot shower (at least 10-15 minutes).</li>
            <li>Your skin feels so vibrant and clean, soft and healthy!</li>
            <li>Other than the size, this thing is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Great for scrubbing of dead skin cells and having baby soft skin! :)</li>
            <li>Great job exfoliating, but probably too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the cost.</li>
            <li>that I have done this kind of routine before using a regular sponge (and soap) and</li>
            <li>At the price, I think the &#x27;disposable&#x27; element is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Paid $8, probably worth $2.</li>
            <li>Still it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>Very simple, yet effective product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using one of them for several months and despite being kind of cheap-looking (mainly because it is cheap) it has held up so well that I haven&#x27;t had to replace it yet.  </li>
            <li>Finding this mitten was not an easy task but figuring out how to do the scrubbing properly has not been easy.</li>
            <li>The amount of dead skin these remove are amazing!  </li>
            <li>I did some research and apparently your best bet is to soak in a very hot tub/bath for at least 20 minutes then begin scrubbing.</li>
            <li>After having them for several months I can say I will never spend money on a liquid scrub/exfoliant again because these do such a great job.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t get into too much to avoid you the not so pleasant visual, so all I will say is that this things works and you will be as soft as a baby when you exit that tub and take a rinse shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I also do use this and the little washcloths like it with soap as well for a feel good scrub, but the maximum benefit is for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if these are the same ones they use at the those seems a little a more abrasive, but in a good way.</li>
            <li>I personally like this method better.  </li>
            <li>First time using it</li>
            <li>This really works!  </li>
            <li>making sure your bathroom gets steamy enough.  </li>
            <li>My tips soak in a hot or Epsom salt bath.</li>
            <li>It is something many asians use and is commonplace in public spas in asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These work pretty well if you use them the correct way.  </li>
            <li>Purchased because my appx $20 Dermasuri mitt (also from Amazon), which I love and which is the same type of fabric, started fraying a bit at the seams.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it and will keep on trying to use it properly.</li>
            <li>I went to a Korean public bath and asked for their famous scrub.</li>
            <li>Yellow is the most abrasive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using my first one</li>
            <li>These mits really work!</li>
            <li>They work great and last a long time.</li>
            <li>I first found them at the Korean Spa and have purchased them ever since.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this product was OK.</li>
            <li>As others have said take a hot shower or bath for atleast 15-20 mins before using.</li>
            <li>I did have to do some research about how to use them and am I glad I did (including the reviews on these specific towels).  </li>
            <li>I have small hands, but I found that rubbing with my fingers rather than palms yielded better results anyways and gave me more control.  </li>
            <li>Wow!!!!</li>
            <li>Only use these when you truly want to exfoliate though because it does the job, and use a gentle soap that you love.  </li>
            <li>Soaking in clear, warm water for 10 minutes, rubbing not scrubbing, and working in smaller sections.  </li>
            <li>Go gently the first time you use these to see how you feel afterwards.</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, it will shrink significantly once it gets wet, and you will have to stretch the &amp;#34;mitten&amp;#34; out in order for it to fit on your hand.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I usually dry-brush every couple of weeks, so</li>
            <li>I put mine into the dryer and when it came out it frayed significantly around the opening, but the other end was still fine.</li>
            <li>I have medium to large hands</li>
            <li>I certainly would not use this on my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After washing and soaking, stuff a damp washcloth into the mitt and scrub as much as you can tolerate.  </li>
            <li>and you really feel like it&#x27;s exfoliating your skin.  </li>
            <li>I felt like I spent more time stretching out the mitt</li>
            <li>Did the job very well, you have to wait maybe 15 minute to loosen your skin</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for me like</li>
            <li>However, I have been using them for about two weeks, and I&#x27;m really noticing a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>These really scrub your skin.  </li>
            <li>Nothing to say about the product itself which has been holding out really well.</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>so I can fit your entire hand into it.</li>
            <li>Really work.</li>
            <li>However these work really well.  </li>
            <li>but didn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>did not like how much my mittens shrunk, though.</li>
            <li>I will say it&#x27;s invigorating to the skin, but absolutely nothing came off of my legs, torso or forearms.</li>
            <li>and my arms felt much smoother.</li>
            <li>but I need to put so much effort.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe, and this might sound funny, but it kind of looks like what you get when you use a regular pencil eraser....</li>
            <li>Every other day would be okay depending on your skin type.</li>
            <li>I use mine about every 3 days or so for that extra clean feeling.</li>
            <li>My skin will finally be clear for the first time since I was a kid.</li>
            <li>You must use them after a long hot bath or shower and make sure there isn&#x27;t any soap residue left on your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;4 stars as the cloths are kind of small and shrink.</li>
            <li>Gross but cool.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super cheap and you can see the dead skin rolling off you!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend business.  </li>
            <li>I give 4 stars because the price was high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>O was surprised at how much skin comes off.</li>
            <li>Dead skin falls off like magic.</li>
            <li>it cause I thought it was going to be able to get rid of my dead skin cells</li>
            <li>I do it once a week, most of my dead skin tends to come off of torso.</li>
            <li>My legs are looking better even though I don&#x27;t see  that much dead skin come off of them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say the material is similar to the &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; texture option of the traditional Japanese nylon bath towels, and exfoliates quite effectively.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>I used one before an airbrush tan and it came out really even, with no dark patches.</li>
            <li>I was always trying new scrubs.  </li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t really tell much difference between this and a regular wash cloth.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, it was big enough for my hand to fit in it.</li>
            <li>kind of gross seeing all of the rolled up dead skin on the mitt.</li>
            <li>Smaller than I expected, but they work great for my little hands.  </li>
            <li>As you use it, it will roll up or fold in half when using the wash cloth-this is perfectly fine.  </li>
            <li>After a long hot shower I could scrape my fingernails over my legs and gray dead skin would be under my nails, many ingrown hairs, and lotion would just pill up when I put it on.</li>
            <li>It does the job, but the squares shrink in the hot water - it only covers my fingers, not my hand!</li>
            <li>I guess I would say more than I like it but not exactly love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>So, I had my &amp;#34;body scrub&amp;#34; at a spa by a professional &amp;#34;body scrubber&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>They make your skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>And I thought my skin was soft after using scrubs!  </li>
            <li>The pills of dead skin, the smoothness after, the easy cleanup.  </li>
            <li>However, this helped with my mild case of keratosis pilaris on the back of my upper arms that my dry-brushing has not helped -- I got some skin to come off</li>
            <li>I struggle with dry and peeling skin due to eczema and this towel makes my skin feeling smooth for days!</li>
            <li>My skin felt so soft after use</li>
            <li>Wow - I am blown away by how soft this leaves my skin.</li>
            <li>This review is coming from someone who has hands the size of a 10 year old child too.</li>
            <li>I wash my face with this cloth every day - and it beats Clarisonic at exfoliating by far.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so small that they can only fit on my eight-year-old son, my husband gave up on the first time.</li>
            <li>They tend to fall apart too, but put a few stitches at the top on both sides and they will last.</li>
            <li>they do shrink in hot water but return to size when dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are very small, so if you have small-ish hands they will be better - they do stretch some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>these last a few showers/baths is to make sure you stretch them out as much as you can when  you&#x27;re done before letting them dry.  </li>
            <li>The only downside to these particular mitts are they are quite a bit shorter</li>
            <li>Ideal texture, but poor construction and way waaaaay too small.</li>
            <li>is the only way to get legitimately clean, especially if your skin seems to be abnormally dry.</li>
            <li>and so my small hand can barely fit into the mit.</li>
            <li>they were a little more rough since what I was using before was.</li>
            <li>I love these little guys!!!  </li>
            <li>Really helped with some of my dry patches.  </li>
            <li>They won&#x27;t last through a washing machine without the shrinkage others have mentioned, but you should be able to get at least 3 usages out of them.  </li>
            <li>A long, hot shower or bath is necessary for the abrasion to work.</li>
            <li>These are super small, they do not fit my hand very well, so it is kind of hard to scrub.</li>
            <li>I did what other reviewers recommended and took a steamy 15-minute shower, made sure I didn&#x27;t have any lotion on my skin beforehand and then scrubbed with firm strokes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway I HIGHLY recommend everyone buy the smaller &amp;#34;mittens&amp;#34; (which are just square pockets) for the body, and this one to scrub your back.</li>
            <li>Your body and the cloth needs to be just barely damp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; with pretty tiny hands, and once these things get wet they barely reach my palm.</li>
            <li>the Japanese Salux towels in-between using these to keep your baby soft skin.</li>
            <li>Kind of weird</li>
            <li>First time using these, I had those gross (yet somehow very satisfying) rolls of dead skin coming off my arms and legs, which was kind of shocking</li>
            <li>The dead skin literally falls right off of you.</li>
            <li>I was not able to stretch them back to the original dimensions, not to mention that every time they are soaked with water they shrink</li>
            <li>My aesthetician explained that it&#x27;s because they are thin and able to dry completely between each use, minimizing bacteria.</li>
            <li>I found that this was easier when done at an angle - instead of slipping the mitt on with your fingers pointing straight up, try to tuck them into one of the upper corners.</li>
            <li>, cause all that new baby skin will dry up quick without a thick layer of moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Gets rid of dead skin fast!</li>
            <li>and I can now walk out without feeling self conscious about my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Another hour and a half later, so much dirt came off  in the tub and</li>
            <li>So if you have thin fragile easily irritated skin ignore this review.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>if you know how to scrub the right way (more like rub), you&#x27;ll end up with a bunch of thin and narrow, dark looking things in your shower filter...</li>
            <li>I like to use soft pressured scrubbing multiple times on the same spot--this process makes your skin less sensitive.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very satisfying--and maybe a little gross--because you can really see and feel the dead skin as it comes off.  </li>
            <li>For moisturizer, I just took a quick shower to wash my hair and rinse off, and then while my skin was wet put raw cocoa butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Take a warm bath then scrub away!</li>
            <li> These work just like the kind they use at Korean spas!</li>
            <li> Feels good on skin.</li>
            <li> how well this exfoliates, go buy a GOOD one.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and they are just as good.</li>
            <li> My skin feels good</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The mittens work really good both on body and face.</li>
            <li> But the price was good</li>
            <li> I run mine through the wash each week to keep them clean, and they continue to work brilliantly.</li>
            <li> I am in love!</li>
            <li> I got some more and gave them as Christmas gifts to my girlfriends!  </li>
            <li> Welp, this mitt is amazing.</li>
            <li> These things are amazing.</li>
            <li> As others have stated, this is amazing.</li>
            <li> These bath mittens are AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are others like me out there who are looking for a good exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Korean girlfriend introduced me to this product, which is feels kind of like a scouring pad for the skin.</li>
            <li> Ehhh, I liked it</li>
            <li> I have catching up to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> best and easiest &#x27;accessory&#x27; to help cleaning up old skin.  </li>
            <li> I love going to Korean spas, but wanted to be able to do my own body scrub from time to time.</li>
            <li> used it in a hot shower, and I was happy with the way it worked.</li>
            <li> They exfoliate way better than any loofa.  </li>
            <li> Follow your spa with your favorite skin moisturizer or cream for a healthy looking and renewed skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I was thinking of visiting a korean spa and after some research I found out that most places use mitts like these</li>
            <li> It should include some advice of how to better use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t pay $50 for another scrub mitt I was looking at on Amazon.</li>
            <li> more like your skin seems to peel off??</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE my ttae-mil-yee~~~~</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used better</li>
            <li> My acne scars have faded, and my skin has a much more healthy appearance.</li>
            <li> It got better when I stopped using soap, but it was still there.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 100% sure using this towel</li>
            <li> Make sure you soak in a bathtub for a while - otherwise, they will not work.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to figure out just how to use these, but now that I know how, I love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No need to pay more.</li>
            <li> and im satisfied with the price and ability to find this online</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked or felt better</li>
            <li> Works much better than a loofa</li>
            <li> Clearly many people love it.</li>
            <li> After so many years I decided to do some research and found those.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite part about the Korean Spa is getting my skin scrubbed and seeing balled clumps of skin slough off.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> My skin feels very clean and exfoliated when I use these.</li>
            <li> They work best after a long soak in the tub.</li>
            <li> but I still get pretty good results with these.</li>
            <li> and I am excited to wear shorts this summer!</li>
            <li> These do a great job exfoliating and leaving skin baby soft.  </li>
            <li> This is a good exfoliator and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> I loved them so much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more important to remember to use lotion/oil free soap like Dial.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just not as strong or haven&#x27;t mastered the art of the gloves</li>
            <li> I am very sure that at the most by the end of the month the cracks in my skin will be completely gone.</li>
            <li> These are a great &amp;#34;dupe&amp;#34; for the Baiden mitten if you don&#x27;t want to spend all that money, definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> And I got similar results to what I experienced at the spa.  </li>
            <li> , I was kind of dissapionted, and yeah it does really shrink.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use them every time a bathe;I come out silky smooth and it lasts for a while.</li>
            <li> but I have and will continue to do so with a light touch.</li>
            <li> Yep, these are the gloves they use at the Korean Day Spas, just wish they were longer to fit my hands.</li>
            <li> and I struggle to fit my hands in.</li>
            <li> Fair enough, honey :)</li>
            <li> I only brought it for my sister, because she love the Korean bathroom stuff, it is good for washing faces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no where near as good at scrubbing myself as they do at the spa</li>
            <li> If you have eczema, or dry skin, or icthyosis, this is the absolute best thing you can use.</li>
            <li> Afterward, I felt super soft, as good as going to the spa!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are cheap, effective, easy to use, and clean up is very easy and minimal.  </li>
            <li> I originally saw these at a Korean spa where I had a scrub done.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see what my spray tan will look like after scrubbing my body with this product.</li>
            <li> to use these: Most people say you have to soak in hot water</li>
            <li> Gross but effective!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy these again, though I will probably check out the same brand&#x27;s products if they have a bigger mitt - though I&#x27;m happy since the price is good to just go throw away after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> Clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m clean.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no cleaner showering than one that entails a full body exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been to a true Korean bath spa.</li>
            <li> When I read all the five-star reviews I could not believe they were true.</li>
            <li> You first wash your body using lotion/oil free soap then soak for about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> However the best results are achieved after a bath or hot shower (at least 10-15 minutes).</li>
            <li> Your skin feels so vibrant and clean, soft and healthy!</li>
            <li> Other than the size, this thing is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Great for scrubbing of dead skin cells and having baby soft skin! :)</li>
            <li> Great job exfoliating, but probably too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the cost.</li>
            <li> that I have done this kind of routine before using a regular sponge (and soap) and</li>
            <li> At the price, I think the &#x27;disposable&#x27; element is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Paid $8, probably worth $2.</li>
            <li> Still it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Very simple, yet effective product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using one of them for several months and despite being kind of cheap-looking (mainly because it is cheap) it has held up so well that I haven&#x27;t had to replace it yet.  </li>
            <li> Finding this mitten was not an easy task but figuring out how to do the scrubbing properly has not been easy.</li>
            <li> The amount of dead skin these remove are amazing!  </li>
            <li> I did some research and apparently your best bet is to soak in a very hot tub/bath for at least 20 minutes then begin scrubbing.</li>
            <li> After having them for several months I can say I will never spend money on a liquid scrub/exfoliant again because these do such a great job.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t get into too much to avoid you the not so pleasant visual, so all I will say is that this things works and you will be as soft as a baby when you exit that tub and take a rinse shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I also do use this and the little washcloths like it with soap as well for a feel good scrub, but the maximum benefit is for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if these are the same ones they use at the those seems a little a more abrasive, but in a good way.</li>
            <li> I personally like this method better.  </li>
            <li> First time using it</li>
            <li> This really works!  </li>
            <li> making sure your bathroom gets steamy enough.  </li>
            <li> My tips soak in a hot or Epsom salt bath.</li>
            <li> It is something many asians use and is commonplace in public spas in asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These work pretty well if you use them the correct way.  </li>
            <li> Purchased because my appx $20 Dermasuri mitt (also from Amazon), which I love and which is the same type of fabric, started fraying a bit at the seams.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it and will keep on trying to use it properly.</li>
            <li> I went to a Korean public bath and asked for their famous scrub.</li>
            <li> Yellow is the most abrasive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using my first one</li>
            <li> These mits really work!</li>
            <li> They work great and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I first found them at the Korean Spa and have purchased them ever since.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this product was OK.</li>
            <li> As others have said take a hot shower or bath for atleast 15-20 mins before using.</li>
            <li> I did have to do some research about how to use them and am I glad I did (including the reviews on these specific towels).  </li>
            <li> I have small hands, but I found that rubbing with my fingers rather than palms yielded better results anyways and gave me more control.  </li>
            <li> Wow!!!!</li>
            <li> Only use these when you truly want to exfoliate though because it does the job, and use a gentle soap that you love.  </li>
            <li> Soaking in clear, warm water for 10 minutes, rubbing not scrubbing, and working in smaller sections.  </li>
            <li> Go gently the first time you use these to see how you feel afterwards.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, it will shrink significantly once it gets wet, and you will have to stretch the &amp;#34;mitten&amp;#34; out in order for it to fit on your hand.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I usually dry-brush every couple of weeks, so</li>
            <li> I put mine into the dryer and when it came out it frayed significantly around the opening, but the other end was still fine.</li>
            <li> I have medium to large hands</li>
            <li> I certainly would not use this on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After washing and soaking, stuff a damp washcloth into the mitt and scrub as much as you can tolerate.  </li>
            <li> and you really feel like it&#x27;s exfoliating your skin.  </li>
            <li> I felt like I spent more time stretching out the mitt</li>
            <li> Did the job very well, you have to wait maybe 15 minute to loosen your skin</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me like</li>
            <li> However, I have been using them for about two weeks, and I&#x27;m really noticing a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> These really scrub your skin.  </li>
            <li> Nothing to say about the product itself which has been holding out really well.</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> so I can fit your entire hand into it.</li>
            <li> Really work.</li>
            <li> However these work really well.  </li>
            <li> but didn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> did not like how much my mittens shrunk, though.</li>
            <li> I will say it&#x27;s invigorating to the skin, but absolutely nothing came off of my legs, torso or forearms.</li>
            <li> and my arms felt much smoother.</li>
            <li> but I need to put so much effort.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe, and this might sound funny, but it kind of looks like what you get when you use a regular pencil eraser....</li>
            <li> Every other day would be okay depending on your skin type.</li>
            <li> I use mine about every 3 days or so for that extra clean feeling.</li>
            <li> My skin will finally be clear for the first time since I was a kid.</li>
            <li> You must use them after a long hot bath or shower and make sure there isn&#x27;t any soap residue left on your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;4 stars as the cloths are kind of small and shrink.</li>
            <li> Gross but cool.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super cheap and you can see the dead skin rolling off you!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend business.  </li>
            <li> I give 4 stars because the price was high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> O was surprised at how much skin comes off.</li>
            <li> Dead skin falls off like magic.</li>
            <li> it cause I thought it was going to be able to get rid of my dead skin cells</li>
            <li> I do it once a week, most of my dead skin tends to come off of torso.</li>
            <li> My legs are looking better even though I don&#x27;t see  that much dead skin come off of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say the material is similar to the &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; texture option of the traditional Japanese nylon bath towels, and exfoliates quite effectively.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> I used one before an airbrush tan and it came out really even, with no dark patches.</li>
            <li> I was always trying new scrubs.  </li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t really tell much difference between this and a regular wash cloth.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, it was big enough for my hand to fit in it.</li>
            <li> kind of gross seeing all of the rolled up dead skin on the mitt.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected, but they work great for my little hands.  </li>
            <li> As you use it, it will roll up or fold in half when using the wash cloth-this is perfectly fine.  </li>
            <li> After a long hot shower I could scrape my fingernails over my legs and gray dead skin would be under my nails, many ingrown hairs, and lotion would just pill up when I put it on.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but the squares shrink in the hot water - it only covers my fingers, not my hand!</li>
            <li> I guess I would say more than I like it but not exactly love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> So, I had my &amp;#34;body scrub&amp;#34; at a spa by a professional &amp;#34;body scrubber&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> They make your skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> And I thought my skin was soft after using scrubs!  </li>
            <li> The pills of dead skin, the smoothness after, the easy cleanup.  </li>
            <li> However, this helped with my mild case of keratosis pilaris on the back of my upper arms that my dry-brushing has not helped -- I got some skin to come off</li>
            <li> I struggle with dry and peeling skin due to eczema and this towel makes my skin feeling smooth for days!</li>
            <li> My skin felt so soft after use</li>
            <li> Wow - I am blown away by how soft this leaves my skin.</li>
            <li> This review is coming from someone who has hands the size of a 10 year old child too.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with this cloth every day - and it beats Clarisonic at exfoliating by far.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so small that they can only fit on my eight-year-old son, my husband gave up on the first time.</li>
            <li> They tend to fall apart too, but put a few stitches at the top on both sides and they will last.</li>
            <li> they do shrink in hot water but return to size when dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are very small, so if you have small-ish hands they will be better - they do stretch some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> these last a few showers/baths is to make sure you stretch them out as much as you can when  you&#x27;re done before letting them dry.  </li>
            <li> The only downside to these particular mitts are they are quite a bit shorter</li>
            <li> Ideal texture, but poor construction and way waaaaay too small.</li>
            <li> is the only way to get legitimately clean, especially if your skin seems to be abnormally dry.</li>
            <li> and so my small hand can barely fit into the mit.</li>
            <li> they were a little more rough since what I was using before was.</li>
            <li> I love these little guys!!!  </li>
            <li> Really helped with some of my dry patches.  </li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t last through a washing machine without the shrinkage others have mentioned, but you should be able to get at least 3 usages out of them.  </li>
            <li> A long, hot shower or bath is necessary for the abrasion to work.</li>
            <li> These are super small, they do not fit my hand very well, so it is kind of hard to scrub.</li>
            <li> I did what other reviewers recommended and took a steamy 15-minute shower, made sure I didn&#x27;t have any lotion on my skin beforehand and then scrubbed with firm strokes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway I HIGHLY recommend everyone buy the smaller &amp;#34;mittens&amp;#34; (which are just square pockets) for the body, and this one to scrub your back.</li>
            <li> Your body and the cloth needs to be just barely damp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; with pretty tiny hands, and once these things get wet they barely reach my palm.</li>
            <li> the Japanese Salux towels in-between using these to keep your baby soft skin.</li>
            <li> Kind of weird</li>
            <li> First time using these, I had those gross (yet somehow very satisfying) rolls of dead skin coming off my arms and legs, which was kind of shocking</li>
            <li> The dead skin literally falls right off of you.</li>
            <li> I was not able to stretch them back to the original dimensions, not to mention that every time they are soaked with water they shrink</li>
            <li> My aesthetician explained that it&#x27;s because they are thin and able to dry completely between each use, minimizing bacteria.</li>
            <li> I found that this was easier when done at an angle - instead of slipping the mitt on with your fingers pointing straight up, try to tuck them into one of the upper corners.</li>
            <li> , cause all that new baby skin will dry up quick without a thick layer of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of dead skin fast!</li>
            <li> and I can now walk out without feeling self conscious about my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Another hour and a half later, so much dirt came off  in the tub and</li>
            <li> So if you have thin fragile easily irritated skin ignore this review.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> if you know how to scrub the right way (more like rub), you&#x27;ll end up with a bunch of thin and narrow, dark looking things in your shower filter...</li>
            <li> I like to use soft pressured scrubbing multiple times on the same spot--this process makes your skin less sensitive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very satisfying--and maybe a little gross--because you can really see and feel the dead skin as it comes off.  </li>
            <li> For moisturizer, I just took a quick shower to wash my hair and rinse off, and then while my skin was wet put raw cocoa butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were a little small (I am a guy with smaller hands, fit over just the fingers).</li>
            <li> Scrub in a downward motion vigorously but not so much that your skin is scrubbed raw.  </li>
            <li> This product should have a 5 star rating, and everyone on the planet should be running for their lives to use this, especially if you have any form of dry skin.</li>
            <li> Works well enough, but was surprised how small they were.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when using as a facial scrub.</li>
            <li> Get even smaller after wet.</li>
            <li> The only way I can use this is to put my hand in a fist - even though it stretches when wet.</li>
            <li> They do shrink but when you wet them you can stretch them back.</li>
            <li> I have been a big fan of scrubs for a long time now and was slightly reluctant to try something different.  </li>
            <li> But overall, I don&#x27;t think I have ever found any other product that exfoliates as well as these</li>
            <li> The other three was sealed inside its packaging but one was outside the sealed bag.</li>
            <li> I have the other mitts as backup but next time I wash these</li>
            <li> However, it is a minor discomfort considering the price and obtained results!</li>
            <li> However, very goog to rub off dirty stuff and much cheaper Han the hamman mitt that I have been using.</li>
            <li> When I got too dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I finished, dry areas where I had scars from eczema flair ups visibly faded, cracked skin visibly reduced.</li>
            <li> If you have icthyosis oreczema, dry cracked skin-- use this.</li>
            <li> Wash them well and hang to dry.</li>
            <li> I have severely dry skin...scales even.  </li>
            <li> However if you want to wash your mittens you will probably will have let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I will air dry.</li>
            <li> When I received my package one of the mittens was loose inside the shipping bag.</li>
            <li> You will start seeing whitish little &amp;#34;worms&amp;#34; of worn out dead skin that this little cloth rolls into those funny shapes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not your typical scrub...</li>
            <li> These defoliators do an okay job at scrubbing your skin but they are ridiculously small after they get wet, which makes them difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> Works as advised, it isn&#x27;t that soft but nor is it too hard on screen.</li>
            <li> As posted by others, you will actually see your dead cells coming off your body.  </li>
            <li> These are as I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so rough</li>
            <li> it damages the skin but just enough to slough off the dead cells.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve read thorough those comments carefully before buying this.</li>
            <li> The mitt stretches when wet</li>
            <li> But as soon as it gets wet it shrinks.</li>
            <li> I bought a korean italy towel before that just shed off all that gross dead skin</li>
            <li> but I kinda expected this.</li>
            <li> These shrink to about 3x5&amp;#34; once wet.</li>
            <li> Scrubbing before the skin is thoroughly soaked is not very effective.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I deep-condition my hair every two weeks, and like to take advantage of the excess time spent in the shower by using this exfoliating mitt.</li>
            <li> But it works just way I expected.  </li>
            <li> There are some things (especially with beauty products) that you think you&#x27;ll use forever, and then you move onto something else in a few months.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have had is that they are small as it is and will shrink after they dry from using them.</li>
            <li> I do have very small hand because I&#x27;m petite, so if you have larger hand you might want to get the actual glove.</li>
            <li> and I admit it does tell you how dirty was and clean your body</li>
            <li> Really small and got even smaller when wet.  </li>
            <li> and my hand does not fit in these when they are dry, and certainly not when they are wet due to the shrinkage.</li>
            <li> Use firm strokes in the same area for a few seconds and the dead skin will start to come off -I&#x27;m only using these for exfoliating my body from now on</li>
            <li> I had been trying to get rid of the small bumps on the back of my arms for decades, and I&#x27;d never found a solution.</li>
            <li> because I fake tan and THOUGHT I already been exfoliating pretty well.</li>
            <li> It shrinks to be so small that it only covers my fingers and not even my palm.  </li>
            <li> Trust me though, it&#x27;s NOT as extreme as it sounds...</li>
            <li> I might try what that other commenter said about putting a face towel inside it and using it like a sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dead skin should slough off in little rope-like pieces, similar to what you see when you rub a piece of paper with an eraser.</li>
            <li> Might be a little small for your hand (short, not tight) but not too small to not fit at all.</li>
            <li> If the mitt grains get dirty, quickly wash it off and squeeze the water out with the washcloth in</li>
            <li> Lotions did not work for me, regular soaps made my skin way worse, moisturizing soaps only slowed the issue, sugar/salt scrubs gave me scars and discoloration</li>
            <li> You will be surprised at how much dead skin comes off!!!</li>
            <li> Just remember that soap with lotion/oil will make it harder for dead cells to come off.  </li>
            <li> But by using these mitts in the shower after scrubbing with an exfoliating soap and rinsing, I can literally rub all the dead dry skin and scales off and wash them down the drain!  </li>
            <li> I have small asian hands and found these somewhat awkward to use as a mitt since it shrunk so much.</li>
            <li> These things, while being just as &amp;#34;scrubby,&amp;#34; are even worse in that regard -- I tried to stretch and pull it further down over my palm while wet and one of the seams immediately started unravelling.</li>
            <li> The wetter they are the less friction</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about how well these would work, particularly at this price.</li>
            <li> Get too small when wet.</li>
            <li> You may add a little soap, it depends on what you like.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews saying it was too small and thought &amp;</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll shrink a little with each shower.  </li>
            <li> My hands feel a little funky now when I wash them.</li>
            <li> I tried using on my face, but was a bit too harsh.</li>
            <li> Soaps like Dove tends to have moisturizer that keeps dead skin hydrated but attached to the skin so the scrubbing will not be as effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My gosh did TONS of dead skin come off.</li>
            <li> You have to be in the shower for a few minutes before using this</li>
            <li> but it gets all the dead skin off</li>
            <li> She says there&#x27;s a satisfaction in seeing the dead skin is scoured off your body into rolleds she calls &amp;#34;noodles&amp;#34; .  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll see the dead skin balling</li>
            <li> dead skin</li>
            <li> Green is medium.</li>
            <li> Pink is the least abrasive.</li>
            <li> I got the green.</li>
            <li> It just &amp;#34;peels&amp;#34; off the dead skin and leaves you skin looking</li>
            <li> I immediately had dead skin rubbing off my body.</li>
            <li> Be warned however, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to use this everyday as it can irritate your skin when it&#x27;s not needed.</li>
            <li> I had rolls of dead skin coming off in some spots.</li>
            <li> Every time I use these I&#x27;m amazed at the dead skin these these things scrub off.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> They took off a lot of dead skin, including the dead skin on my hands.</li>
            <li> A few pieces of the stitching started coming undone after a couple months use</li>
            <li> Super disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> It dries very quickly so no worries about bacteria growing.</li>
            <li> I totally use them on my face despite the recommendation not to, and they get off rolls of dead skin that my expensive face brush (*cough cough* CLARISONIC) doesn&#x27;t even put a dent in.  </li>
            <li> not impressed, I get the same results with scrubbing gloves</li>
            <li> My hand fits in then past my fingers and they stretch some.</li>
            <li> and it is too small to put my hand into it.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but had to for this one.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> Really a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m small and have a small hand</li>
            <li> too small for men&#x27;s hands</li>
            <li> I think had I not found instructions from various sources I would have used them completely wrong.  </li>
            <li> so if you do not have small hands, you&#x27;ll have a hard time using it.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is their small size.</li>
            <li> it works well, but can be hard to hold</li>
            <li> AT LEAST 20 mins.</li>
            <li> Some irritated, some were messy with oil in the tub, some were too harsh, some didn&#x27;t do anything, some were expensive, and on and on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had thick oily skin.</li>
            <li> Plus, since it&#x27;s impossible to get them to cover your whole hand, they&#x27;re really difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because it is very small.  </li>
            <li> I have very small hands</li>
            <li> Very small and thin in size.</li>
            <li> Bath for like 20 minutes, air dry for a minute and when you&#x27;re still damp, rub this on you in long strokes and you will be amazed (and disgusted) by what happens.</li>
            <li> and it barely reaches the base of my palm.</li>
            <li> The small size is difficult to work with anywhere but on my face and arms.</li>
            <li> Before using them wash with a bar soap as liquid soaps leave behind the moisturizing benefit.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy any expensive exfoliates.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t uncomfortably scratchy to use, though with any manual exfoliate process, some work with scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Totally useless</li>
            <li> Very, very thin.  </li>
            <li> but afterwards you will be disgusted buy how much dead skin you have.</li>
            <li> Worthless and can&#x27;t believe the hype.  </li>
            <li> Takes all the nasty build up of skin, lotion, etc on my skin.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wonderful for exfoliating. Just be careful when using as a facial scrub.</li>
            <li> not impressed, I get the same results with scrubbing gloves</li>
            <li> I had been trying to get rid of the small bumps on the back of my arms for decades, and I&#x27;d never found a solution. These scrubs work wonders, clearing up my skin and keeping it that way. My aesthetician explained that it&#x27;s because they are thin and able to dry completely between each use, minimizing bacteria. I run mine through the wash each week to keep them clean, and they continue to work brilliantly. I won&#x27;t even travel without them.</li>
            <li> I got these as a cheaper alternative to the Baiden mitten and I am really impressed!! First time using these, I had those gross (yet somehow very satisfying) rolls of dead skin coming off my arms and legs, which was kind of shocking because I fake tan and THOUGHT I already been exfoliating pretty well. These are great for tanners, I never have problems with streaking or unevenness anymore. I tried using on my face, but was a bit too harsh. I think the colors indicate the roughness so I will try to find softer ones for my face. These are a great &amp;#34;dupe&amp;#34; for the Baiden mitten if you don&#x27;t want to spend all that money, definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> As a Korean, I have been using these kinds of mitts all my life.  I keep reading people complaining about the size of the mitt so I thought I address this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many Koreans stuff a damp washcloth and use it without putting your hands in the mitt.  As you use it, it will roll up or fold in half when using the wash cloth-this is perfectly fine.  I personally like this method better.  If the mitt grains get dirty, quickly wash it off and squeeze the water out with the washcloth in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the best result, it takes a bit of preparation.  You first wash your body using lotion/oil free soap then soak for about 20 minutes.  You can reverse the wash/soak process.  It&#x27;s more important to remember to use lotion/oil free soap like Dial.  Soaps like Dove tends to have moisturizer that keeps dead skin hydrated but attached to the skin so the scrubbing will not be as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing and soaking, stuff a damp washcloth into the mitt and scrub as much as you can tolerate.  I like to use soft pressured scrubbing multiple times on the same spot--this process makes your skin less sensitive.  As posted by others, you will actually see your dead cells coming off your body.  After scrubbing, moisturize well as you just put your skin through a peeling process.  You will see that your skin feels like baby&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can spot use it as well on elbows and knees.  Just remember that soap with lotion/oil will make it harder for dead cells to come off.  I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> First time using it and it&#x27;s great.  My skin felt so soft after use and you really feel like it&#x27;s exfoliating your skin.  Easy to clean.  Great product.</li>
            <li> These are the only scrub mitts that actually work for me.  I originally saw these at a Korean spa where I had a scrub done.  The amount of dead skin these remove are amazing!  The only downside to these particular mitts are they are quite a bit shorter then ones I have used before. But they still do the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works well enough, but was surprised how small they were. Only fits over my fingers, not my hand.</li>
            <li> These are as I expected. My hand fits in then past my fingers and they stretch some. I do with they were a little more rough since what I was using before was.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product after receiving a body scrub at a Korean spa.  This really works!  And I got similar results to what I experienced at the spa.  But the warning about the mitt shrinking is no joke.  The mitt shrinks.  It shrinks to be so small that it only covers my fingers and not even my palm.  I felt like I spent more time stretching out the mitt then I did rubbing it on my appendages.  So there&#x27;s an area for improvement.</li>
            <li> I love these little guys!!!  After having them for several months I can say I will never spend money on a liquid scrub/exfoliant again because these do such a great job.  It&#x27;s very satisfying--and maybe a little gross--because you can really see and feel the dead skin as it comes off.  I&#x27;ve been using one of them for several months and despite being kind of cheap-looking (mainly because it is cheap) it has held up so well that I haven&#x27;t had to replace it yet.  I totally use them on my face despite the recommendation not to, and they get off rolls of dead skin that my expensive face brush (*cough cough* CLARISONIC) doesn&#x27;t even put a dent in.  They leave your skin super-smooth and I think they have definitely helped with my keratosis pilaris.  In my experience, steam is really necessary for these to work, so if you&#x27;re like me and prefer to use them in the shower instead of after soaking in a bath, I recommend 1) waiting until the end of your shower and 2) making sure your bathroom gets steamy enough.  The bathroom at my parents&#x27; house doesn&#x27;t get quite as steamy as my tiny bathroom, so they don&#x27;t work quite as well there as they do at my house.  But overall, I don&#x27;t think I have ever found any other product that exfoliates as well as these and I would 100% recommend them!!</li>
            <li> *Warning* 5 stars but I can see where this product isn&#x27;t for everyone. I&#x27;ve always had thick oily skin. After a long hot shower I could scrape my fingernails over my legs and gray dead skin would be under my nails, many ingrown hairs, and lotion would just pill up when I put it on. So if you have thin fragile easily irritated skin ignore this review.&lt;br /&gt; I saw these on Amazon and was like why not? One of the best beauty choices I made in years. I use this on my face with Glytone gel wash and and my face has never looked younger. My tips soak in a hot or Epsom salt bath. Your body and the cloth needs to be just barely damp. The wetter they are the less friction and you want the friction. Shave after you do this and you will have the closest shave of your life. Good luck!</li>
            <li> A friend turned me onto these.  They are the best spa item I&#x27;ve met.  They exfoliate way better than any loofa.  Only use these when you truly want to exfoliate though because it does the job, and use a gentle soap that you love.  Follow your spa with your favorite skin moisturizer or cream for a healthy looking and renewed skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I grew up using these.  I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because it is very small.  I have very small hands and it is too small to put my hand into it.  It shrinks. I just use it by holding it.</li>
            <li> The towel is smaller than I thought. However, very goog to rub off dirty stuff and much cheaper Han the hamman mitt that I have been using.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but the squares shrink in the hot water - it only covers my fingers, not my hand!</li>
            <li> I was thinking of visiting a korean spa and after some research I found out that most places use mitts like these so I figured I would test out the roughness of this mitt to see if I was up to the task of a traditional spa. Welp, this mitt is amazing. I did some research and apparently your best bet is to soak in a very hot tub/bath for at least 20 minutes then begin scrubbing. I used epsom salt in my bath to help with toxin removal. My gosh did TONS of dead skin come off. I won&#x27;t get into too much to avoid you the not so pleasant visual, so all I will say is that this things works and you will be as soft as a baby when you exit that tub and take a rinse shower. Totally worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Feels good on skin. After effect my body tingles. Clean feeling. Will definitely buy again! Great choice. Works like spa</li>
            <li> These things are amazing. Dead skin falls off like magic. Got rid of the bumps on my butt. You gotta keep it up in the winter though, cause all that new baby skin will dry up quick without a thick layer of moisturizer. Can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like in the summer!</li>
            <li> works great.  got here on time</li>
            <li> it works well, but can be hard to hold/handle</li>
            <li> Works as advised, it isn&#x27;t that soft but nor is it too hard on screen. Skin definitely feels softer after using it. I got all my directions from reviews and the web. It should include some advice of how to better use it. Use it after taking a shower and your skin is not soaking but is still humid, soak it and rinse before use.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but had to for this one. I&#x27;m sure there are others like me out there who are looking for a good exfoliator. This is it. Wow - I am blown away by how soft this leaves my skin. You have to be in the shower for a few minutes before using this but it gets all the dead skin off - you can see it. It dries very quickly so no worries about bacteria growing. There is no scrub that works as well as this.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I tried this product and loved it! You can&#x27;t beat the price for what these mitts do for your skin. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t pay $50 for another scrub mitt I was looking at on Amazon. This is a keeper. I&#x27;m excited to see what my spray tan will look like after scrubbing my body with this product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no cleaner showering than one that entails a full body exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Korean girlfriend introduced me to this product, which is feels kind of like a scouring pad for the skin. It&#x27;s not so rough it damages the skin but just enough to slough off the dead cells. It is something many asians use and is commonplace in public spas in asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use soap with this product however my wife uses it in the traditional way, which is without soap, after which she applies moisturizing lotion.  She says there&#x27;s a satisfaction in seeing the dead skin is scoured off your body into rolleds she calls &amp;#34;noodles&amp;#34; .  I tried it and I admit it does tell you how dirty was and clean your body is when you&#x27;re done.  I like to use it with soap because I&#x27;m just used my Zest smell, plus I don&#x27;t get the unsightly noodles.  She says I don&#x27;t do it that way I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m clean.  Fair enough, honey :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I HIGHLY recommend everyone buy the smaller &amp;#34;mittens&amp;#34; (which are just square pockets) for the body, and this one to scrub your back.</li>
            <li> Get too small when wet.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t really tell much difference between this and a regular wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Oh man, I grew up with this stuff in Korean mok-yeok-tangs (communal bath-houses) and am soooo happy to find it here!!! It&#x27;s definitely not your typical scrub...more like your skin seems to peel off?? Trust me though, it&#x27;s NOT as extreme as it sounds...if you know how to scrub the right way (more like rub), you&#x27;ll end up with a bunch of thin and narrow, dark looking things in your shower filter... It&#x27;s hard to describe, and this might sound funny, but it kind of looks like what you get when you use a regular pencil eraser....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, it rocks! LOVE LOVE LOVE my ttae-mil-yee~~~~ Thanks Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> These work pretty well if you use them the correct way.  The only issue I have had is that they are small as it is and will shrink after they dry from using them.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Smaller than I expected, but they work great for my little hands.  Highly recommend business.  Excellent customer service!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the simplest type in China. I give 4 stars because the price was high.</li>
            <li> I only brought it for my sister, because she love the Korean bathroom stuff, it is good for washing faces.</li>
            <li> Very small and thin in size. Get even smaller after wet. Really a waste of money! I should&#x27;ve read thorough those comments carefully before buying this.</li>
            <li> Did the job very well, you have to wait maybe 15 minute to loosen your skin but afterwards you will be disgusted buy how much dead skin you have. It looks like pencil shavings</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me like everyone else says it does for them.</li>
            <li> Ehhh, I liked it but I bought it cause I thought it was going to be able to get rid of my dead skin cells but I&#x27;ve used better, I was kind of dissapionted, and yeah it does really shrink. I prefer the jaanease washclothes</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about how well these would work, particularly at this price. However, I have been using them for about two weeks, and I&#x27;m really noticing a difference in my skin. My acne scars have faded, and my skin has a much more healthy appearance. I will continue to buy them again and again!</li>
            <li> These are AWESOME. You must use them after a long hot bath or shower and make sure there isn&#x27;t any soap residue left on your skin. Use firm strokes in the same area for a few seconds and the dead skin will start to come off -I&#x27;m only using these for exfoliating my body from now on</li>
            <li> It shrinks. your soap bar fits inside. Just like the Korean spa used.  Do not put in dryer.</li>
            <li> Ideal texture, but poor construction and way waaaaay too small. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; with pretty tiny hands, and once these things get wet they barely reach my palm. Purchased because my appx $20 Dermasuri mitt (also from Amazon), which I love and which is the same type of fabric, started fraying a bit at the seams. These things, while being just as &amp;#34;scrubby,&amp;#34; are even worse in that regard -- I tried to stretch and pull it further down over my palm while wet and one of the seams immediately started unravelling. Plus, since it&#x27;s impossible to get them to cover your whole hand, they&#x27;re really difficult to work with. The remaining three I&#x27;ll probably just give away to friends as tester of sorts : &amp;#34;if you like how well this exfoliates, go buy a GOOD one.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These really scrub your skin.  Just wish they were a bit longer as to cover your entire hand.  I&#x27;m small and have a small hand and it barely reaches the base of my palm.</li>
            <li> These defoliators do an okay job at scrubbing your skin but they are ridiculously small after they get wet, which makes them difficult to use.  This review is coming from someone who has hands the size of a 10 year old child too.</li>
            <li> Four stars according to Amazon means &amp;#34;I like it&amp;#34;. I guess I would say more than I like it but not exactly love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use these: Most people say you have to soak in hot water AT LEAST 20 mins. I would say at 30 would be the trick. Before using them wash with a bar soap as liquid soaps leave behind the moisturizing benefit. Scrub in a downward motion vigorously but not so much that your skin is scrubbed raw.  You&#x27;ll see the dead skin balling up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the Japanese Salux towels in-between using these to keep your baby soft skin.</li>
            <li> So, I had my &amp;#34;body scrub&amp;#34; at a spa by a professional &amp;#34;body scrubber&amp;#34;! Finding this mitten was not an easy task but figuring out how to do the scrubbing properly has not been easy. Nothing to say about the product itself which has been holding out really well. I am glad I bought it and will keep on trying to use it properly.</li>
            <li> I bought this on ebay, as it was cheaper there (2.99). But this is the best thing I have ever used in my life. If you have eczema, or dry skin, or icthyosis, this is the absolute best thing you can use. I soaked in the tub for like 20 minutes then took the area I was rubbing out of the water or stood up. When I got too dry I sat back in the tub. Another hour and a half later, so much dirt came off  in the tub and my skin glowed.&lt;br /&gt;(Note that I have done this kind of routine before using a regular sponge (and soap) and dead skin NEVER came off! Not only that but my skin continued to have a lot of problems. It got better when I stopped using soap, but it was still there.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I finished, dry areas where I had scars from eczema flair ups visibly faded, cracked skin visibly reduced. I am very sure that at the most by the end of the month the cracks in my skin will be completely gone. My skin will finally be clear for the first time since I was a kid. I have catching up to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I didn&#x27;t use any soap except some bubble bath, and epsom salt i poured in the water. For moisturizer, I just took a quick shower to wash my hair and rinse off, and then while my skin was wet put raw cocoa butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Yes the towel did shrink, but It didn&#x27;t stop me from using it, my hand still went in. I might try what that other commenter said about putting a face towel inside it and using it like a sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am 100% sure using this towel is the only way to get legitimately clean, especially if your skin seems to be abnormally dry. This product should have a 5 star rating, and everyone on the planet should be running for their lives to use this, especially if you have any form of dry skin. This will cure it. Lotions did not work for me, regular soaps made my skin way worse, moisturizing soaps only slowed the issue, sugar/salt scrubs gave me scars and discoloration, alpha hydroxy lotion did nothing. I can not emphasize enough. If you have icthyosis oreczema, dry cracked skin-- use this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy any expensive exfoliates. This is all you will need. Follow the directions I found on here. Bath for like 20 minutes, air dry for a minute and when you&#x27;re still damp, rub this on you in long strokes and you will be amazed (and disgusted) by what happens.</li>
            <li> I went to a Korean public bath and asked for their famous scrub. The things I saw come off off me got me thinking that none of those at home scrubs or mittens work. Received these and they are just as good. Make sure you soak in a bathtub for a while - otherwise, they will not work. After 20 minutes, scrub away. You may add a little soap, it depends on what you like. You will start seeing whitish little &amp;#34;worms&amp;#34; of worn out dead skin that this little cloth rolls into those funny shapes. I do it once a week, most of my dead skin tends to come off of torso. I wash my face with this cloth every day - and it beats Clarisonic at exfoliating by far. These are super small, they do not fit my hand very well, so it is kind of hard to scrub. They tend to fall apart too, but put a few stitches at the top on both sides and they will last. Wash them well and hang to dry. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> As others have stated, this is amazing. The exfoliating powers are indicated by the color of the towel. Green is medium. Pink is the least abrasive. Yellow is the most abrasive. I got the green. I am in love! The dead skin literally falls right off of you. I&#x27;d only warn that this is not for small hands and do not have the water on too hot when using these. Other than that, it&#x27;s fantastic. I use mine about every 3 days or so for that extra clean feeling.</li>
            <li> The size of these bath mitts are definitely not for a grown adult male.&lt;br /&gt;Annoyingly small.&lt;br /&gt;Could have used 60 grit wet sand paper for same effect.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to figure out just how to use these, but now that I know how, I love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are very small, so if you have small-ish hands they will be better - they do stretch some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are intended to exfoliate the skin.  After you have finished your shower or bath.  You rub it on your skin without any soap.  It just &amp;#34;peels&amp;#34; off the dead skin and leaves you skin looking polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also do use this and the little washcloths like it with soap as well for a feel good scrub, but the maximum benefit is for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> It really does work. I immediately had dead skin rubbing off my body. Gross but effective! The mitt stretches when wet so I can fit your entire hand into it.</li>
            <li> This is a great exfoliating towel! It&#x27;s like getting a Korean body scrub from the spas yourself but 10x cheaper. I struggle with dry and peeling skin due to eczema and this towel makes my skin feeling smooth for days! Exfoliate regularly and slap some lotion on and I can now walk out without feeling self conscious about my dry skin. Be warned however, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to use this everyday as it can irritate your skin when it&#x27;s not needed. Every other day would be okay depending on your skin type.</li>
            <li> These are great exfoliators. No need to pay more. They work best after a long soak in the tub. I used one before an airbrush tan and it came out really even, with no dark patches. They make your skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li> When it arrived, it was big enough for my hand to fit in it. I read other reviews saying it was too small and thought &amp;#34;wow they must have some big hands.&amp;#34; But as soon as it gets wet it shrinks. Other than the size, this thing is AMAZING! Takes all the nasty build up of skin, lotion, etc on my skin. My skin feels good and I can get the closest shave ever. I highly recommend this product. Just wish it was a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!! Gets rid of dead skin fast! Take a warm bath then scrub away! You will be surprised at how much dead skin comes off!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good exfoliator and the price was reasonable. It shrinks on your hand, which worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;I used it in a hot shower, and I was happy with the way it worked.</li>
            <li> These work just like the kind they use at Korean spas! Might be a little small for your hand (short, not tight) but not too small to not fit at all. Probably not for a man&#x27;s hand though. I&#x27;m no where near as good at scrubbing myself as they do at the spa but I still get pretty good results with these. I&#x27;m still using my first one so these should last forever!</li>
            <li> I bought these to try since I wanted to see what the fuss was about in korean dramas and bathhouse scrubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work GREAT! I had rolls of dead skin coming off in some spots. It wasn&#x27;t uncomfortably scratchy to use, though with any manual exfoliate process, some work with scrubbing. Afterward, I felt super soft, as good as going to the spa!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars as the cloths are kind of small and shrink. I have small asian hands and found these somewhat awkward to use as a mitt since it shrunk so much. They aren&#x27;t that durable either, the stitching tore on the sides after one use. I&#x27;ll buy these again, though I will probably check out the same brand&#x27;s products if they have a bigger mitt - though I&#x27;m happy since the price is good to just go throw away after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> best and easiest &#x27;accessory&#x27; to help cleaning up old skin.  i&#x27;ve used them before and im satisfied with the price and ability to find this online</li>
            <li> These bath mittens are AMAZING.  I have severely dry skin...scales even.  But by using these mitts in the shower after scrubbing with an exfoliating soap and rinsing, I can literally rub all the dead dry skin and scales off and wash them down the drain!  My skin has never looked or felt better and I am excited to wear shorts this summer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the key to making these last a few showers/baths is to make sure you stretch them out as much as you can when  you&#x27;re done before letting them dry.  They&#x27;ll shrink a little with each shower.  They won&#x27;t last through a washing machine without the shrinkage others have mentioned, but you should be able to get at least 3 usages out of them.  At the price, I think the &#x27;disposable&#x27; element is worth it.  I don&#x27;t use them every time a bathe;I come out silky smooth and it lasts for a while.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super cheap and you can see the dead skin rolling off you! Awesome</li>
            <li> The only way I can use this is to put my hand in a fist - even though it stretches when wet. From the bottom of my palm to tip of finger, my hand is 7&amp;quot; . I am going to see if sewing two together (4 in package) can work. I have been to a true Korean bath spa. The exfoliating left my skin feeling like baby skin for a month.</li>
            <li> Every time I use these I&#x27;m amazed at the dead skin these these things scrub off.</li>
            <li> These do a great job exfoliating and leaving skin baby soft.  Really helped with some of my dry patches.  It&#x27;s not recommended you use this product facially but I have and will continue to do so with a light touch.</li>
            <li> Worthless and can&#x27;t believe the hype.  Really small and got even smaller when wet.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> These mits really work! O was surprised at how much skin comes off. They do shrink but when you wet them you can stretch them back. I do have very small hand because I&#x27;m petite, so if you have larger hand you might want to get the actual glove.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Really work.</li>
            <li> Very, very thin.  Paid $8, probably worth $2.</li>
            <li> too small for men&#x27;s hands</li>
            <li> Yep, these are the gloves they use at the Korean Day Spas, just wish they were longer to fit my hands.</li>
            <li> These are not the same quality as the one&#x27;s I have used in the Korean Bath Houses.</li>
            <li> Great job exfoliating, but probably too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> THis stuff literally scrubbed a layer of skin off my body. I am two shades lighter! Gross but cool. Im happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Super disappointed with this product. I bought a korean italy towel before that just shed off all that gross dead skin - this one didn&#x27;t remove any at all and it was really tiny also. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> The product was as discribed</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if these are the same ones they use at the those seems a little a more abrasive, but in a good way. However these work really well.  they do shrink in hot water but return to size when dry.</li>
            <li> great exfoliating mitt. after just a few uses, it really smooths out your skin. highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love going to Korean spas, but wanted to be able to do my own body scrub from time to time. These are the same ones used at Korean spas. They work great and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have medium to large hands and my hand does not fit in these when they are dry, and certainly not when they are wet due to the shrinkage. But you can take a pair of scissors and cut the mitt to use it like a cloth. I would really be careful with these if you have sensitive skin. Go gently the first time you use these to see how you feel afterwards. They took off a lot of dead skin, including the dead skin on my hands. My hands feel a little funky now when I wash them. I certainly would not use this on my face. But that&#x27;s just me. I think going forward I will only be using these on my feet and heels, and will wear gloves when using them.</li>
            <li> Works well. You can get similar products at any drug store. They were a little small (I am a guy with smaller hands, fit over just the fingers). A few pieces of the stitching started coming undone after a couple months use but I kinda expected this. Works much better than a loofa</li>
            <li> When I received my package one of the mittens was loose inside the shipping bag. The other three was sealed inside its packaging but one was outside the sealed bag. Kind of weird but didn&#x27;t really matter. It didn&#x27;t really take off a lot of dead skin to me, with the exception being my back, which was kind of gross seeing all of the rolled up dead skin on the mitt. I bought this to get  rid of the scaly skin on my legs, which no matter how well I moisturize appears hours later. My legs are looking better even though I don&#x27;t see  that much dead skin come off of them. However if you want to wash your mittens you will probably will have let it air dry. I put mine into the dryer and when it came out it frayed significantly around the opening, but the other end was still fine. I have the other mitts as backup but next time I wash these I will air dry.</li>
            <li> These cloths do the job but I haven&#x27;t experienced the &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; results others have. The small size is difficult to work with anywhere but on my face and arms. Still it&#x27;s worth a try. Clearly many people love it. It&#x27;s just not my exfoliator of choice.</li>
            <li> Finally found the scrubbing mitts so I don&#x27;t have to pay astronomical prices for a scrub at the Korean spa! The pockets are tiny though so if you do not have small hands, you&#x27;ll have a hard time using it. I recommend sewing two together to make a larger one. Good price.</li>
            <li> These shrink to about 3x5&amp;#34; once wet. Totally useless</li>
            <li> These bath towels have a convenience pouch design so you can use them like a mitten, OR put your bar of soap inside, and use it that way.  I&#x27;d say the material is similar to the &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; texture option of the traditional Japanese nylon bath towels, and exfoliates quite effectively. Very simple, yet effective product.</li>
            <li> When I read all the five-star reviews I could not believe they were true. But I still decided to try since $8 are not a big loss in case these mittens do not work. And I was very pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;The mittens work really good both on body and face. However the best results are achieved after a bath or hot shower (at least 10-15 minutes). Scrubbing before the skin is thoroughly soaked is not very effective.&lt;br /&gt;I did not like how much my mittens shrunk, though. I was not able to stretch them back to the original dimensions, not to mention that every time they are soaked with water they shrink and I struggle to fit my hands in. However, it is a minor discomfort considering the price and obtained results!</li>
            <li> These are the BEST!  I first found them at the Korean Spa and have purchased them ever since.  Your skin feels so vibrant and clean, soft and healthy!</li>
            <li> To be fair, I usually dry-brush every couple of weeks, so maybe that is why I didn&#x27;t see rolls of dead skin coming off, but I definitely did not see much exfoliation happening. I did what other reviewers recommended and took a steamy 15-minute shower, made sure I didn&#x27;t have any lotion on my skin beforehand and then scrubbed with firm strokes. I will say it&#x27;s invigorating to the skin, but absolutely nothing came off of my legs, torso or forearms. However, this helped with my mild case of keratosis pilaris on the back of my upper arms that my dry-brushing has not helped -- I got some skin to come off and my arms felt much smoother. Overall, this product was OK. I probably won&#x27;t repurchase, but in the meantime, I will use prior to shaving my legs and on the back of my upper arms.</li>
            <li> As others have said take a hot shower or bath for atleast 15-20 mins before using. Then use this with even pressure in one direction. Not a scrubbing motion. Works well.</li>
            <li> I come from Eastern Europe and I remember these from my childhood. When I moved in the states I couldn&#x27;t find anything like this. After so many years I decided to do some research and found those. They make the perfect skin exfoliation. My only disappointment is their small size. They&#x27;re so small that they can only fit on my eight-year-old son, my husband gave up on the first time. I still use them and get the resultI but I need to put so much effort. I wish the manufacturer makes them a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this product. As others have mentioned, it will shrink significantly once it gets wet, and you will have to stretch the &amp;#34;mitten&amp;#34; out in order for it to fit on your hand. I found that this was easier when done at an angle - instead of slipping the mitt on with your fingers pointing straight up, try to tuck them into one of the upper corners. A long, hot shower or bath is necessary for the abrasion to work. I deep-condition my hair every two weeks, and like to take advantage of the excess time spent in the shower by using this exfoliating mitt. Dead skin should slough off in little rope-like pieces, similar to what you see when you rub a piece of paper with an eraser.</li>
            <li> These shrunk as soon as they got water on them and so my small hand can barely fit into the mit. Go with a larger size.</li>
            <li> Great for scrubbing of dead skin cells and having baby soft skin! :)</li>
            <li> My favorite part about the Korean Spa is getting my skin scrubbed and seeing balled clumps of skin slough off. Maybe I&#x27;m just not as strong or haven&#x27;t mastered the art of the gloves but they don&#x27;t work like they seem to when I go to the spa.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very clean and exfoliated when I use these.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Gets the job done. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been a big fan of scrubs for a long time now and was slightly reluctant to try something different.  But the price was good and I thought I&#x27;d give it a go.  WOW!  And I thought my skin was soft after using scrubs!  I did have to do some research about how to use them and am I glad I did (including the reviews on these specific towels).  I think had I not found instructions from various sources I would have used them completely wrong.  Soaking in clear, warm water for 10 minutes, rubbing not scrubbing, and working in smaller sections.  But it works just way I expected.  The pills of dead skin, the smoothness after, the easy cleanup.  Very satisfied!  I was always trying new scrubs.  Some irritated, some were messy with oil in the tub, some were too harsh, some didn&#x27;t do anything, some were expensive, and on and on.  These are cheap, effective, easy to use, and clean up is very easy and minimal.  I actually didn&#x27;t mind the size.  I have small hands, but I found that rubbing with my fingers rather than palms yielded better results anyways and gave me more control.  I loved them so much I got some more and gave them as Christmas gifts to my girlfriends!  There are some things (especially with beauty products) that you think you&#x27;ll use forever, and then you move onto something else in a few months.  Then there are the things that you use for years and years because they always work the way you want.  I can see these being the latter for me.  Maybe I&#x27;ll buy a scrub here and there, and I definitely plan on trying different colors of the mitts, but for the foreseeable future, these are a keeper!</li>
