    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I think it is too abrasive so use this by your best judgement.</li>
            <li>The dentist had told me that I was an excellent candidate for whitening - but the COST - and considered a &amp;#34;cosmetic&amp;#34; treatment, so not covered by my insurance.</li>
            <li>The taste isn&#x27;t the best . . .</li>
            <li>However, for people who don&#x27;t have the qualms I do, this seems a very good toothpaste.</li>
            <li>As a polishing agent, this is a good product which I intend to replenish when our tube is emptied.</li>
            <li>This Colgate is looking good, tho.</li>
            <li>This is a good toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked for a stronger taste and smell but otherwise a great choice for toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The flavor is palatable and the consistency has no sense of grit or abrasive of any kind.  </li>
            <li>In fact, with my Sonicare, it becomes uncomfortably warm and \\&quot;weird.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This is doing the job nicely.</li>
            <li>Satisfactory toothpaste provides a nice taste or rather warmth upon adding it to the mouth.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy The Colgate Optic Platinum toothpaste; great minty flavor (not too strong,</li>
            <li>The toothpaste dispenses very smoothly and does not continue once squeezing has stopped.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sort of a wintermint, which is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love that</li>
            <li>I will not use this product any more.  </li>
            <li>My teeth haven&#x27;t suddenly, magically become three shades whiter since using Colgate Optic</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d appreciate more information about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When a product promise \\&quot;more than 3 shades whiter\\&quot;, I expect a lot better results.</li>
            <li>teeth do feel nice and clean after use.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste itself has a pleasant taste and my mouth feels clean and fresh after each brushing.</li>
            <li>So far I have been happy with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The taste is a strong minty flavor that I like.</li>
            <li>The taste is overly strong and burns my tongue.</li>
            <li>They also state that its  formula is enamel safe,  intended for twice daily use, and its crystal mint taste, pleasant.</li>
            <li>I love the minty fresh taste</li>
            <li>I have been using this product twice a day, for two minutes’ worth of brushing, for more than a week, since it arrived.  </li>
            <li>And, perhaps, since I am a confirmed tea drinker, and tea is well-known as a staining agent.  </li>
            <li>I like the strong, minty flavor, the way it leaves my teeth feeling clean, and the reasponable price.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>and not dental friendly</li>
            <li>Crest has been good to the entire family and we have used assorted configurations.  </li>
            <li>and I know full</li>
            <li>not bad,</li>
            <li>Not bad once you are used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my teeth feeling clean and fresh, and I&#x27;ve noticed some whitening/brightening, too.  </li>
            <li>The peroxide taste is less than in some others I&#x27;ve tried, but it isn&#x27;t completely masked and isn&#x27;t especially pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, as other reviewers have remarked, Colgate makes no claim that this toothpaste is good for sensitive teeth and gums, and judging by my mouth, it sure isn’t.  </li>
            <li>And that its WhiteSeal technology will help seal out new daily food and drink stains to help keep your smile bright and</li>
            <li>To come clean (haha)</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product at this point and very much doubt the assessment will change.</li>
            <li>If you use this, one tube is more than enough.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks now and my teeth have not  been &amp;#34;deeply whitened more than three shades&amp;#34</li>
            <li>but I suspect this will be all the whitening the Optic White will be able to do with my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I love and exclusively use Colgate products, this one is going to be left on the shelf (for me).</li>
            <li>I think perhaps a bit, but not enough to make me sure whether they are really shinier or</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Colgate Optic White Platinum, White and Radiant  toothpaste for a couple of weeks now, and while I think it&#x27;s good toothpaste, I&#x27;m not seeing any difference from before I used it.</li>
            <li>By and large, my experience with these &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes has been very marginal results.</li>
            <li>It rinses out of the mouth very well.  </li>
            <li>This colgate &amp;#34;white and radiant&amp;#34; toothpaste works very well</li>
            <li>I have been using a toothpaste called Closeys which I really like.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have foaming agents in it and no fluoride and has really helped.</li>
            <li>It doesn’t over foam from the Braun too much, almost every toothpaste does to some extent.</li>
            <li>More time is needed and I am only about half through the tube, but I am pleased so far.  </li>
            <li>There is no strange effect experienced on the gums which occurs with a ProHealth variety we&#x27;ve lately been using.  </li>
            <li>but I would like it better with a fresher and/or slightly mintier taste.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure that I was not alone (or crazy) in noticing that this toothpaste became warm/very warm when used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent toothpaste that cleans well, but I personally do not believe it works better than any toothpaste you could buy at the local grocery store.</li>
            <li>The product claims to be \\&quot;enamel safe,\\&quot; but there is no indication of whether this is a mild enough toothpaste to use beyond the four weeks that is claims to need to whiten by three shades.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this toothpaste because it isn&#x27;t gritty and leaves my mouth feeling fresh, not because it leaves my teeth &amp;#34;three shades whiter.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Constant compliments on my smile</li>
            <li>The foam is thick and it feels warm in my mouth (like bleaching) and leaves my teeth shiny and sleek.</li>
            <li>If you need a nice, minty fresh toothpaste and at least don&#x27;t want your teeth to yellow</li>
            <li>just right for getting rid of those morning furballs), and terrific at whitening my teeth.</li>
            <li>This is much more expensive than a normal toothpaste, so it&#x27;s up to you to decide if it&#x27;s worth more than your average buy.</li>
            <li>I am a pretty big fan of Colgate toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>This Colgate Optic White Platinum toothpaste seems to be making a difference, although not a startling difference.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, other reviewers have also noted this.</li>
            <li>B00KC4T3RK Colgate Optic White Platinum, White and Radiant, 3.4 Ounce (Pack of 6)]] has opened my eyes to a different formula which has so far been outstanding for us.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard for me to say if it works or not as I was barely able to use this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Applied to an electric toothbrush, this toothpaste cleans and smooths the tooth enamel and whether or not it actually alters the enamel shade three levels it is very agreeable.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gritty and doesn&#x27;t foam very well at all.</li>
            <li>Once I hit forty years old, I started paying close attention to the color of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going back to a simpler toothpaste that maybe doesn&#x27;t promise as much</li>
            <li>I used the entire tube and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Also that the product will deliver whitening results in one week when used twice a day,  provide daily anticavity fluoride protection; and add shine with extra polishing brighteners for a brighter smile.  </li>
            <li>It’s too high a price to pay for possible tooth whitening.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t walk away from the bathroom with the clean feeling that I usually have.    </li>
            <li>It does not foam a lot, so it doesn&#x27;t drip down the toothbrush handle very much.  </li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s a pretty average toothpaste</li>
            <li>well I didn&#x27;t brush my teeth for a full two minutes like I usually do.</li>
            <li>taste is odd at first if you are not used to a toothpaste that contains hydrogen peroxide, a bleaching agent.  </li>
            <li>So this is not any more whitening than all the other whitening toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>Meaning, I need to brighten my teeth and have not had much luck in the past with pastes and other quick fixes.  </li>
            <li>It has foaming agents which makes the toothpaste really foam in my mouth and because I&#x27;m not used to foaming toothpaste it seemed foreign to me.</li>
            <li>It makes my teeth shiny after use, but are they really shinier than with my other toothpastes?  </li>
            <li>As a former dental technician who used to build crowns and bridges, I can say that it is likely for this toothpaste to lighten the tooth enamel, but it is not going to whiten your teeth as much as a professional treatment can.  </li>
            <li>Still a little whitening is always appreciated.</li>

            <li> Still a little whitening is always appreciated.</li>
            <li> you are looking for that serious, glow-in-the-dark Mr. Potato Head smile, this isn&#x27;t the toothpaste you&#x27;re searching for.  </li>
            <li> Its makers state that it will, with its ingredient of hydrogen peroxide, deeply whiten teeth more than three shades when used at least twice daily, but preferably after each meal, for at least two minutes, for one month.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a very slight whitening, but my teeth are now back to being extremely sensitive and my guns are already bleeding again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for roughly 10 days, and while I suppose there&#x27;s still some time to see an improvement, I have definitely not noticed any change in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> This dentifrice is, of course, made by Colgate, a company with a long history in the area of dental products.  </li>
            <li> I can feel that this toothpaste has left my mouth feeling cleaner than other toothpastes I have used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on yellow patrol - actively guarding against the signs of oral aging.  </li>
            <li> Finally, the taste is slightly off-putting ...</li>
            <li> The tubes are smaller than I usually purchase, but it will work when traveling through TSA checkpoints.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not seeing any whitening compared to any of the other toothpastes I use.</li>
            <li> ; (I know because I have that little color swatch that comes with whitestrips</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also also in red lettering printed on shiny silver background, very hard to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I get a dramatic, though unwanted, result I’ll report back.</li>
            <li> I have seen a small difference in the color of my teeth but not 3 shades yet.</li>
            <li> and I noticed the difference in a few days!</li>

            <li> So far I have been happy with this toothpaste. I love the minty fresh taste but it&#x27;s not overpowering. I can feel that this toothpaste has left my mouth feeling cleaner than other toothpastes I have used.  I have seen a small difference in the color of my teeth but not 3 shades yet. This will be a product I will be using in the future.</li>
            <li> Too abrasive for long-term use. and not dental friendly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a chemical taste that heats up your mouth.  It has a noticeable grit that reminds me or Pearl Drops.  If you use this, one tube is more than enough.  I think it is too abrasive so use this by your best judgement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks now and my teeth have not  been &amp;#34;deeply whitened more than three shades&amp;#34; (I know because I have that little color swatch that comes with whitestrips and I noted my shade before and after - it&#x27;s the same). So this is not any more whitening than all the other whitening toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried in the past. I also am not a fan of the &amp;#34;crystal mint&amp;#34; flavor - it&#x27;s sort of a wintermint, which is not my favorite. All in all, it&#x27;s a pretty average toothpaste and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend paying any extra for the whitening claims.</li>
            <li> Colgate Optic White Platinum is a solid addition to the Colgate line up! To come clean (haha) I am a pretty big fan of Colgate toothpaste.  In a nutshell, I feel like I&#x27;m brushing my teeth with the teeth bleaching kits when I use Optic White. The foam is thick and it feels warm in my mouth (like bleaching) and leaves my teeth shiny and sleek. I love that feeling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks of use, my teeth have gotten a shade whiter but I suspect this will be all the whitening the Optic White will be able to do with my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> Crest toothpaste has had a space on our sink for years and was pushed aside only when Mentadent was on sale and I didn&#x27;t think about their wasteful packaging.  Crest has been good to the entire family and we have used assorted configurations.  The [[ASIN:B00KC4T3RK Colgate Optic White Platinum, White and Radiant, 3.4 Ounce (Pack of 6)]] has opened my eyes to a different formula which has so far been outstanding for us.  Applied to an electric toothbrush, this toothpaste cleans and smooths the tooth enamel and whether or not it actually alters the enamel shade three levels it is very agreeable.  It does not foam a lot, so it doesn&#x27;t drip down the toothbrush handle very much.  The flavor is palatable and the consistency has no sense of grit or abrasive of any kind.  There is no strange effect experienced on the gums which occurs with a ProHealth variety we&#x27;ve lately been using.  It rinses out of the mouth very well.  The tubes are smaller than I usually purchase, but it will work when traveling through TSA checkpoints.  The toothpaste dispenses very smoothly and does not continue once squeezing has stopped. As a former dental technician who used to build crowns and bridges, I can say that it is likely for this toothpaste to lighten the tooth enamel, but it is not going to whiten your teeth as much as a professional treatment can.  As a polishing agent, this is a good product which I intend to replenish when our tube is emptied.</li>
            <li> This colgate &amp;#34;white and radiant&amp;#34; toothpaste works very well and I noticed the difference in a few days! I don&#x27;t smoke, but do drink coffee and tea, so my teeth were definately getting dull looking. The dentist had told me that I was an excellent candidate for whitening - but the COST - and considered a &amp;#34;cosmetic&amp;#34; treatment, so not covered by my insurance. This Colgate is looking good, tho.</li>
            <li> This is a good toothpaste.  It leaves my teeth feeling clean and fresh, and I&#x27;ve noticed some whitening/brightening, too.  The taste isn&#x27;t the best . . . not bad, but I would like it better with a fresher and/or slightly mintier taste.</li>
            <li> I have tooth sensitivity and bleeding gums. I have been using a toothpaste called Closeys which I really like. It doesn&#x27;t have foaming agents in it and no fluoride and has really helped. My gums no longer bleed while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Colgate Optic White is the total opposite. It has foaming agents which makes the toothpaste really foam in my mouth and because I&#x27;m not used to foaming toothpaste it seemed foreign to me. I have noticed a very slight whitening, but my teeth are now back to being extremely sensitive and my guns are already bleeding again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be sticking with my Closeys toothpaste.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Meaning, I need to brighten my teeth and have not had much luck in the past with pastes and other quick fixes.  This Colgate Optic White Platinum toothpaste seems to be making a difference, although not a startling difference.  More time is needed and I am only about half through the tube, but I am pleased so far.  I would recommend this product at this point and very much doubt the assessment will change.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure that I was not alone (or crazy) in noticing that this toothpaste became warm/very warm when used. Sure enough, other reviewers have also noted this. In fact, with my Sonicare, it becomes uncomfortably warm and \\&quot;weird.\\&quot; Likewise, the consistency is a little \\&quot;slimy.\\&quot; When brushing, the toothpaste becomes runny and uncomfortable. Finally, the taste is slightly off-putting ... I don&#x27;t walk away from the bathroom with the clean feeling that I usually have.    While I love and exclusively use Colgate products, this one is going to be left on the shelf (for me).</li>
            <li> Colgate Optic White Platinum, White and Radiant, 3.4 Ounce (Pack of 6)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been using this with my Oral B electric brush with the polishing head. It’s been a couple of weeks since I started and I do notice some whitening going on. I don’t over whiten my teeth as I have some crowns and they are matched to the surrounding teeth. Still a little whitening is always appreciated. This is doing the job nicely. The taste is a strong minty flavor that I like. It doesn’t over foam from the Braun too much, almost every toothpaste does to some extent. I like and will continue to use it. If I get a dramatic, though unwanted, result I’ll report back.</li>
            <li> Satisfactory toothpaste provides a nice taste or rather warmth upon adding it to the mouth. I found that it does work as it says making a noticeable clearing of color on the teeth appear after using it twice a day for the entire duration of one of the packs. I would have liked for a stronger taste and smell but otherwise a great choice for toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is much more expensive than a normal toothpaste, so it&#x27;s up to you to decide if it&#x27;s worth more than your average buy. I have been using this toothpaste for roughly 10 days, and while I suppose there&#x27;s still some time to see an improvement, I have definitely not noticed any change in the whiteness of my teeth. It&#x27;s a decent toothpaste that cleans well, but I personally do not believe it works better than any toothpaste you could buy at the local grocery store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to say if it works or not as I was barely able to use this toothpaste. The texture is truly horrible. It&#x27;s gritty and doesn&#x27;t foam very well at all. The taste is overly strong and burns my tongue. I&#x27;ve never really been bothered by a toothpaste before but this one is awful. I tried very hard to use it twice a day for a few weeks to see if I could notice a difference in the color of my teeth but this was hard for me to accomplish and I know full well I didn&#x27;t brush my teeth for a full two minutes like I usually do. I won&#x27;t ever use this again.</li>
            <li> Colgate Optic White Platinum, White and Radiant, 3.4 Ounce (Pack of 6).  This dentifrice is, of course, made by Colgate, a company with a long history in the area of dental products.  Its makers state that it will, with its ingredient of hydrogen peroxide, deeply whiten teeth more than three shades when used at least twice daily, but preferably after each meal, for at least two minutes, for one month.  Also that the product will deliver whitening results in one week when used twice a day,  provide daily anticavity fluoride protection; and add shine with extra polishing brighteners for a brighter smile.  They also state that its  formula is enamel safe,  intended for twice daily use, and its crystal mint taste, pleasant. And that its WhiteSeal technology will help seal out new daily food and drink stains to help keep your smile bright and radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have been using this product twice a day, for two minutes’ worth of brushing, for more than a week, since it arrived.  I see no whitening of my teeth: perhaps it is just not noticeable.  And, perhaps, since I am a confirmed tea drinker, and tea is well-known as a staining agent.  Furthermore, as other reviewers have remarked, Colgate makes no claim that this toothpaste is good for sensitive teeth and gums, and judging by my mouth, it sure isn’t.  My gums are red, swollen and sore, and show the beginnings of lesions.  I will not use this product any more.  It’s too high a price to pay for possible tooth whitening.</li>
            <li> Once I hit forty years old, I started paying close attention to the color of my teeth.  I&#x27;ve been on yellow patrol - actively guarding against the signs of oral aging.  I purchased several whitening products, including Strips, Gels, Pastes, Trays, Rinses, and Toothpaste Boosters.  I even ordered a tube of red, cinnamony flavored whitening toothpaste from France.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict:  The only way to truly whiten your teeth - I&#x27;m talking visibly whiten your teeth - is to visit a dentist and order whitening trays.  Toothpastes aren&#x27;t gonna do it for you.  They didn&#x27;t for me - and I don&#x27;t drink coffee or smoke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this toothpaste for several months now.  I like the strong, minty flavor, the way it leaves my teeth feeling clean, and the reasponable price.  I would recommend this toothpaste because it isn&#x27;t gritty and leaves my mouth feeling fresh, not because it leaves my teeth &amp;#34;three shades whiter.&amp;#34;  My teeth haven&#x27;t suddenly, magically become three shades whiter since using Colgate Optic White.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for that serious, glow-in-the-dark Mr. Potato Head smile, this isn&#x27;t the toothpaste you&#x27;re searching for.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> While this toothpaste does seem to help with surface stains, it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for teeth that have just yellowed with age. It makes my teeth shiny after use, but are they really shinier than with my other toothpastes?  I think perhaps a bit, but not enough to make me sure whether they are really shinier or if that is just me hoping they are shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is odd at first if you are not used to a toothpaste that contains hydrogen peroxide, a bleaching agent.  The peroxide taste is less than in some others I&#x27;ve tried, but it isn&#x27;t completely masked and isn&#x27;t especially pleasant.  Not bad once you are used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth do feel nice and clean after use.  The product claims to be \\&quot;enamel safe,\\&quot; but there is no indication of whether this is a mild enough toothpaste to use beyond the four weeks that is claims to need to whiten by three shades.  I&#x27;d appreciate more information about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list of ingredients is rather intimidating.  It&#x27;s also also in red lettering printed on shiny silver background, very hard to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to a simpler toothpaste that maybe doesn&#x27;t promise as much but that I don&#x27;t have to question ingredients and long-term use.  However, for people who don&#x27;t have the qualms I do, this seems a very good toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I used the entire tube and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference. I did like how made my mouth feel, but as for the whitening, don&#x27;t expect enormous results. By and large, my experience with these &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes has been very marginal results. If you need serious whitening, see a dentist. If you need a nice, minty fresh toothpaste and at least don&#x27;t want your teeth to yellow get any darker, then you might give this a go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Colgate Optic White Platinum, White and Radiant  toothpaste for a couple of weeks now, and while I think it&#x27;s good toothpaste, I&#x27;m not seeing any difference from before I used it. My teeth look the same as they did before. The toothpaste itself has a pleasant taste and my mouth feels clean and fresh after each brushing. I&#x27;m just not seeing any whitening compared to any of the other toothpastes I use. When a product promise \\&quot;more than 3 shades whiter\\&quot;, I expect a lot better results.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy The Colgate Optic Platinum toothpaste; great minty flavor (not too strong, just right for getting rid of those morning furballs), and terrific at whitening my teeth. Constant compliments on my smile; I can&#x27;t point to any one aspect of my regimen, but I&#x27;d be loathe to give up my Colgate, my regular cleanings, or my regular smiles.</li>
