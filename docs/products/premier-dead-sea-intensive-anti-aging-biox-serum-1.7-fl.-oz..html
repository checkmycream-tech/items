            <li>I love this stuff and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting use to it and believe the price to be more than competitive.  </li>
            <li>I had bought this from one of the booths in a casino for so much more than Amazon carries it</li>
            <li>Then I got it from Amazon for a much, much better prize.</li>
            <li>i love this product for my face</li>
            <li>Boy, I was so glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>My husband, parents, extended family and friends all tell me I look so youthful and healthy.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product and with regular use, does just what the manufacturer claims.</li>
            <li>(I am a physician and have access to many products ...)</li>
            <li>They are the perfect pair for extremely dry skin!</li>
            <li>After using this serum, my skin feels smooth and appears to have more elasticity.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for your fast service and good product, as you promised.</li>
            <li>Obviously my price was super better!!!!  </li>
            <li>I have also used the mask and feel its pretty good but didn&#x27;t see the overall great results I did with the Cream and Serum.</li>
            <li>The Seller shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a strong smell</li>
            <li>It feels good on and no dryness so that is nice but no overall changes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them and a big bonus - they all smell great!!!</li>
            <li>I have tried many of them and find Premier Dead Sea very good.  </li>
            <li>The results of Premier Dead Sea Intensive Anti Aging Biox Serum are great !!!</li>
            <li>The guys were smooth sales people that talked you into putting the product on your face.</li>
            <li>Good product so far.</li>
            <li>A very good complement with other product of this line.</li>
            <li>wish I could have enjoyed some of the benefits the other posters experienced.</li>
            <li>They are much improved!!!</li>
            <li>way through first bottle...will get more.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product while in Las Vegas and have used it for years.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this product in Spain and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this product at a kiosk for a lot more money.  </li>
            <li>Premier Dead Sea is a good product and I will continue using it because of the results others are seeing how nice my skin look.</li>
            <li>I use this product after cleansing my face at night; it has such a pleasant mild scent, is not greasy and just the name makes me feel like it is doing its job targeting wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It was great to find the exact same product on amazon at a reduced price without any change in quality.</li>
            <li>It is silky smooth and keeps my face fresh looking all day.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and have bought it several times it somehow magically wakes up my skin every time I use it...</li>
            <li>Tried many many different anti age serums.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I would highly recomend it.</li>
            <li>I certainly see a difference in my fine lines.  </li>
            <li>When I first started using this product my girlfriends noticed a difference!</li>
            <li>At the Mall in Albuquerque I purchased about 2,000 dollars worth of this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ladies, invest in the set, it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought these products and so far i love theme , but there is one thing i do not understand</li>
            <li>I rarely leave product feedback.  </li>
            <li>and she promised to make it right with me.</li>
            <li>Will buy again if price right.</li>
            <li>I can see a visible difference right away.  </li>
            <li>The price is right as well.</li>
            <li>For a half of year, I have been using the Anti Aging Biox, the eye serum and their creams that go over the serum, and their wonderful facial that I do 1X/wk.</li>
            <li>This one is very smooth and rich; it instantly absorbs and you don&#x27;t have to use much.  </li>
            <li>I went to the local vendor and was talked into the product based on the one he used on my face - instant softening of the skin was great.  </li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>I am 41 years old and fortunately don&#x27;t have any wrinkles (yet)</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I use it and it really works!</li>
            <li>This was the first time I tried the Intensive  serum</li>
            <li>Similar to the biox cream, I believe this package was also tampered with but the distributor did a much better job in hiding it.  </li>
            <li>They said my skin looked better and younger.</li>
            <li>I love this product but not lasting a lot.</li>
            <li>after second treatment, I see my skin more pump.</li>
            <li>I think if someone went to buy this should first go to a cosmetic place to try the item first before purchase</li>
            <li>I like how it feels, but am not too sure if it actually does what it claims.</li>
            <li>Have used other Premier products and have liked all of them.  </li>
            <li>I am middle aged and my skin has greatly improved since using this product.  </li>
            <li>I just wish that it came in a bigger size as I use so much of it because I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend the product--takes away the fine lines and reduces age appearance by ten years--well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52 and starting with the crow&#x27;s feet and fine lines.</li>
            <li>It is affordable, has no adverse effects, removes fine lines, and keeps my skin looking young at 58 years old.</li>
            <li>that is why PRODUCT reviews are given nor are they responsible for people commenting without cause.</li>
            <li>It does absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li>It really worked very well on my skin.  </li>
            <li>delivered fast, item as described</li>
            <li>It goes on very silky and  I often use it much like a&lt;br /&gt;primer</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 5 years and it really makes a difference in my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Do i have the real thing????</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t seem like the real thing.</li>
            <li>It works also very well with the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much change in my skin.</li>
            <li>I pressed the plunger as gently as I could but to no avail.  </li>
            <li>would not necessarily buy again, but the eye serum is fantastic.</li>
            <li>love it and will purchase again don&#x27;t want to use any other product</li>
            <li>I am copy pasting this to the other products so that I can try to help others to make a more informed purchase.</li>
            <li>For those of you who are middle-aged and older I would suggest you try this product.</li>
            <li>I received the product quickly and is the same product that Premier is selling in his website at $500.00!!!!  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend this product for any age.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the Biox Serum and Biox anti-aging cream.  </li>
            <li>an expected result was an improvement in fine lines or wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I just love everything from Premier Dead Sea products.  </li>
            <li>I love all dead sea products by Premier.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Dead Sea products for several years now and I love them for achieving the results they claim to achieve!</li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with the Premier Dead Sea biox intensive anti-aging cream, and the combo leaves my skin very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft</li>
            <li>this product came in a box with no warranty seal, there is no way of knowing if it is really brand new and an original product, and not filled out.</li>
            <li>My face has never looked better in the past year that I have been using it.</li>
            <li>I have been using these two products together for the past 3 years and my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>Love this product it was so much less than what I ecpected!!</li>
            <li>It really has brought elasticity back to my face.</li>
            <li>It makes the skin feel soft and moist.  </li>
            <li>I feel it makes my skin look much healthier and younger</li>
            <li>Ladies with mature skin, try them.  </li>
            <li>Tried for about 1 week so far.</li>
            <li>but I find the scent to be musty and old smelling.  </li>
            <li>old plus face.</li>
            <li>I love this serum,really works for me, my face after a few application looks much younger.</li>
            <li>I have always used high end facial products on my face.</li>
            <li>This was a huge waste of money!</li>
            <li>Feel it has helped prevent lines due to ageing on my face better than any previous products I had used.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this product, although a true advocate of all of the other Premier Dead Sea products.  </li>
            <li>I use this product in with the Biox intensive age treatment cream and it works really well, softens lines  and helps with the dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I was a sucker for paying the obnoxious price, but at the same time, it was worth the money to discover products that finally made a huge difference in the wrinkles around my eyes, forehead, above the lip, and neck.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft, brighter and younger looking.</li>
            <li>at times it is difficult to locate but Amazon has been very helpful in keeping this product available  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time or money, doesn&#x27;t work and is a waste of time and energy, but is better than being attacked at the mall by the women who peddle it there.</li>
            <li>It never leaves my skin sticky and is a perfect base before I apply any other products to my face as well.  </li>
            <li>I unfortunately have used so many other products since purchasing this that i truly do not remember much about it.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this and any other products by this company&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I originally bought Premier Dead Sea products from one of those kiosks in a mall where the salespeople flag you down for a demonstration.</li>

            <li> I have also used the mask and feel its pretty good but didn&#x27;t see the overall great results I did with the Cream and Serum.</li>
            <li> The Seller shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a strong smell</li>
            <li> It feels good on and no dryness so that is nice but no overall changes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them and a big bonus - they all smell great!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many of them and find Premier Dead Sea very good.  </li>
            <li> The results of Premier Dead Sea Intensive Anti Aging Biox Serum are great !!!</li>
            <li> The guys were smooth sales people that talked you into putting the product on your face.</li>
            <li> Good product so far.</li>
            <li> A very good complement with other product of this line.</li>
            <li> wish I could have enjoyed some of the benefits the other posters experienced.</li>
            <li> They are much improved!!!</li>
            <li> way through first bottle...will get more.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product while in Las Vegas and have used it for years.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this product in Spain and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this product at a kiosk for a lot more money.  </li>
            <li> Premier Dead Sea is a good product and I will continue using it because of the results others are seeing how nice my skin look.</li>
            <li> I use this product after cleansing my face at night; it has such a pleasant mild scent, is not greasy and just the name makes me feel like it is doing its job targeting wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It was great to find the exact same product on amazon at a reduced price without any change in quality.</li>
            <li> It is silky smooth and keeps my face fresh looking all day.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and have bought it several times it somehow magically wakes up my skin every time I use it...</li>
            <li> Tried many many different anti age serums.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I would highly recomend it.</li>
            <li> I certainly see a difference in my fine lines.  </li>
            <li> When I first started using this product my girlfriends noticed a difference!</li>
            <li> At the Mall in Albuquerque I purchased about 2,000 dollars worth of this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ladies, invest in the set, it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought these products and so far i love theme , but there is one thing i do not understand</li>
            <li> I rarely leave product feedback.  </li>
            <li> and she promised to make it right with me.</li>
            <li> Will buy again if price right.</li>
            <li> I can see a visible difference right away.  </li>
            <li> The price is right as well.</li>
            <li> For a half of year, I have been using the Anti Aging Biox, the eye serum and their creams that go over the serum, and their wonderful facial that I do 1X/wk.</li>
            <li> This one is very smooth and rich; it instantly absorbs and you don&#x27;t have to use much.  </li>
            <li> I went to the local vendor and was talked into the product based on the one he used on my face - instant softening of the skin was great.  </li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> I am 41 years old and fortunately don&#x27;t have any wrinkles (yet)</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I use it and it really works!</li>
            <li> This was the first time I tried the Intensive  serum</li>
            <li> Similar to the biox cream, I believe this package was also tampered with but the distributor did a much better job in hiding it.  </li>
            <li> They said my skin looked better and younger.</li>
            <li> I love this product but not lasting a lot.</li>
            <li> after second treatment, I see my skin more pump.</li>
            <li> I think if someone went to buy this should first go to a cosmetic place to try the item first before purchase</li>
            <li> I like how it feels, but am not too sure if it actually does what it claims.</li>
            <li> Have used other Premier products and have liked all of them.  </li>
            <li> I am middle aged and my skin has greatly improved since using this product.  </li>
            <li> I just wish that it came in a bigger size as I use so much of it because I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend the product--takes away the fine lines and reduces age appearance by ten years--well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 and starting with the crow&#x27;s feet and fine lines.</li>
            <li> It is affordable, has no adverse effects, removes fine lines, and keeps my skin looking young at 58 years old.</li>
            <li> that is why PRODUCT reviews are given nor are they responsible for people commenting without cause.</li>
            <li> It does absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> It really worked very well on my skin.  </li>
            <li> delivered fast, item as described</li>
            <li> It goes on very silky and  I often use it much like a&lt;br /&gt;primer</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 5 years and it really makes a difference in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Do i have the real thing????</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem like the real thing.</li>
            <li> It works also very well with the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much change in my skin.</li>
            <li> I pressed the plunger as gently as I could but to no avail.  </li>
            <li> would not necessarily buy again, but the eye serum is fantastic.</li>
            <li> love it and will purchase again don&#x27;t want to use any other product</li>
            <li> I am copy pasting this to the other products so that I can try to help others to make a more informed purchase.</li>
            <li> For those of you who are middle-aged and older I would suggest you try this product.</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly and is the same product that Premier is selling in his website at $500.00!!!!  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend this product for any age.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the Biox Serum and Biox anti-aging cream.  </li>
            <li> an expected result was an improvement in fine lines or wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I just love everything from Premier Dead Sea products.  </li>
            <li> I love all dead sea products by Premier.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dead Sea products for several years now and I love them for achieving the results they claim to achieve!</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with the Premier Dead Sea biox intensive anti-aging cream, and the combo leaves my skin very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft</li>
            <li> this product came in a box with no warranty seal, there is no way of knowing if it is really brand new and an original product, and not filled out.</li>
            <li> My face has never looked better in the past year that I have been using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using these two products together for the past 3 years and my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> Love this product it was so much less than what I ecpected!!</li>
            <li> It really has brought elasticity back to my face.</li>
            <li> It makes the skin feel soft and moist.  </li>
            <li> I feel it makes my skin look much healthier and younger</li>
            <li> Ladies with mature skin, try them.  </li>
            <li> Tried for about 1 week so far.</li>
            <li> but I find the scent to be musty and old smelling.  </li>
            <li> old plus face.</li>
            <li> I love this serum,really works for me, my face after a few application looks much younger.</li>
            <li> I have always used high end facial products on my face.</li>
            <li> This was a huge waste of money!</li>
            <li> Feel it has helped prevent lines due to ageing on my face better than any previous products I had used.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this product, although a true advocate of all of the other Premier Dead Sea products.  </li>
            <li> I use this product in with the Biox intensive age treatment cream and it works really well, softens lines  and helps with the dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I was a sucker for paying the obnoxious price, but at the same time, it was worth the money to discover products that finally made a huge difference in the wrinkles around my eyes, forehead, above the lip, and neck.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft, brighter and younger looking.</li>
            <li> at times it is difficult to locate but Amazon has been very helpful in keeping this product available  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money, doesn&#x27;t work and is a waste of time and energy, but is better than being attacked at the mall by the women who peddle it there.</li>
            <li> It never leaves my skin sticky and is a perfect base before I apply any other products to my face as well.  </li>
            <li> I unfortunately have used so many other products since purchasing this that i truly do not remember much about it.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this and any other products by this company&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I originally bought Premier Dead Sea products from one of those kiosks in a mall where the salespeople flag you down for a demonstration.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last long enough to find out if it actually works.</li>
            <li> It was the same as I previously bought direct from a rep</li>
            <li> This serum not only keeps the skin firm but also very soft.</li>
            <li> start out the morning with a clean face, apply  a small amount of the Firming Eye Serum around the eyes, I let dry for a few seconds</li>
            <li> I used to use a serum from Costco, but it had a strange oily texture.  </li>
            <li> After a few months of using these products they are almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li> Has the feel of sanitizer mixed with other stuff.</li>
            <li> After spending way to much money on other products I took a chance and purchased the Premier Dead Sea Intensive Anti Aging Box Serum and the Premier Dead Sea Triple Firming Eye Serum,</li>
            <li> sometimes they come out a little bigger.</li>
            <li> The top of the bottle was broke and the cream smell bad, t have to threw in the trash.</li>
            <li> but lately their prices are much more expensive.</li>
            <li> Amazon is not responsible for what people sell</li>
            <li> Spent  tons of money from a skin care clinic on products and facials.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> It does nothing to keep your skin soft and subtle.</li>
            <li> There is very little about them on the net too.</li>
            <li> I have try ed other products</li>
            <li> Use a small amount and it can last up to 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Both complement to each other.</li>
            <li> My face used to be so dry around my nose with other moisturizing products, but with the dead sea products this is not a problem anymore.</li>
            <li> I dont like is that agter using almost a half of the bottle every time when I push the pump the cream comes with a small pieces of a red color!!!</li>
            <li> Along with the Anti-age complex it makes a big difference in the way my face looks and feels.</li>
            <li> little to no positive after appearance.</li>
            <li> Found it on Amazon for much less.  </li>
            <li> a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> Remember a little goes along</li>
            <li> Dead Seas Premier Products are sold here and at the mail.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product before and again a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> All one does is spend the money and waste it.</li>
            <li> It moisterizes in a dried out way.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this line of products...........</li>
            <li> I  was a bystander in the mall that got suckered into purchasing a few Premier Dead Sea products at their Kiosk.</li>
            <li> I use this serum as soon as I get finished washing my face, then put on the Dead Sea Moisture Cream.  </li>
            <li> Pores are tight and small lines are minimized.</li>
            <li> In the mean time I opened some of the other products to use them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used ebay in the past</li>
            <li> I didnt do any research which I usually do, about these products, or I probably wouldnt have ever even tried them.</li>
            <li> way.&lt;br /&gt;It usually lastes me 3/4 months</li>
            <li> It is so hard to rate skin care products.  </li>
            <li> and my skin was totally dull and dehydrated.  </li>
            <li> At least they didnt with me.  </li>
            <li> Use in conjuction with Biox Intensive Age Cream/Anti-Age Complex.</li>
            <li> It was thick like it was froze and would not pump out.</li>
            <li> ive been using this product every day for about 2 weeks and the crows feet in my eyes are slowly going away, i wished i would have known about premier products years ago.</li>
            <li> Although, it is much less expensive from Amazon, than the kiosk in the mall.</li>
            <li> lot less expensive than purchasing it at a mall.</li>
            <li> So sorry I did not originally take a close- up picture of my wrinkles, so that I could compare the difference.</li>
            <li> They do not stand behind what they are selling in the least.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the &amp;#34;less than helpful&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The really bad news was...</li>
            <li> I find it to be very unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> Instead of seeing an improvement my skin never looked so bad!</li>
            <li> I had very bad experience with this product, the mint I apply this on my face</li>
            <li> it is worst the price (not this</li>
            <li> The worst thing of all is the smell.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have always used high end facial products on my face. The results of Premier Dead Sea Intensive Anti Aging Biox Serum are great !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product that firms and clears the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank!!!</li>
            <li> love it and will purchase again don&#x27;t want to use any other product will recommend to others in the future</li>
            <li> This serum is a daily must used under my Premier moisturizer. It is silky smooth and keeps my face fresh looking all day.</li>
            <li> I have found this very good.  I also use the day or night moidturizing cream with it.  For the price of it, there it doesn&#x27;t seem to last.  Although, it is much less expensive from Amazon, than the kiosk in the mall.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and have bought it several times it somehow magically wakes up my skin every time I use it...I just wish that it came in a bigger size as I use so much of it because I absolutely love it.  It never leaves my skin sticky and is a perfect base before I apply any other products to my face as well.  All of the biox line has been a god send for my face...I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them and a big bonus - they all smell great!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product it was so much less than what I ecpected!!</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft</li>
            <li> Good for keeping the age lines from ones face</li>
            <li> I love this product, I would highly recomend it. It has made a big difference in my skin since I have been using it for about a year now and I will continue to keep using it. My face has never looked better in the past year that I have been using it. I am middle aged and my skin has greatly improved since using this product.  For those of you who are middle-aged and older I would suggest you try this product.</li>
            <li> I really love this product- I&#x27;ve been using it for a year.  I used to use a serum from Costco, but it had a strange oily texture.  This one is very smooth and rich; it instantly absorbs and you don&#x27;t have to use much.  I use it in conjunction with the Premier Dead Sea biox intensive anti-aging cream, and the combo leaves my skin very smooth and soft.  I am 41 years old and fortunately don&#x27;t have any wrinkles (yet) and I&#x27;m using these products as a preventative measure.  Amazon consistently has the best pricing- I&#x27;ve used ebay in the past but lately their prices are much more expensive.</li>
            <li> AAwesome product use every day I have try ed other products this is great . highly recommend this and any other products by this company&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Was in Vegas and tried a sample of this serum.  Loved it but too pricey there.  Found it on Amazon for much less.  Both my husband and I use it and it really works!</li>
            <li> This serum feels great on your skin.  I have already noticed a difference in the way my skin looks.  I will buy again.  Amazon has the best price on this product.</li>
            <li> Great product - excellent service from this supplier!</li>
            <li> I went to the local vendor and was talked into the product based on the one he used on my face - instant softening of the skin was great.  What I got was not what he used on me - he lied. It was a bait and switch.  They should sell the product he used. They would keep customers that way.  This product works as good as soap and water. HOWEVER, the cheaper eye serum does soften the eye lids... it is worst the price (not this product)&lt;br /&gt;The review is of the product  asked  for by Amazon. Nowhere do I attack Amazon. Amazon is not responsible for what people sell that is why PRODUCT reviews are given nor are they responsible for people commenting without cause. Dead Seas Premier Products are sold here and at the mail.  The review stands as is.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money, doesn&#x27;t work and is a waste of time and energy, but is better than being attacked at the mall by the women who peddle it there.</li>
            <li> At the Mall in Albuquerque I purchased about 2,000 dollars worth of this product. When I got home over 200 miles away I found that I had not made it home with all of the things I was supposed to have. I called the representative to let her know and she promised to make it right with me. She didnt.  In the mean time I opened some of the other products to use them. One was opened and used, one had the seal broke and had leaked in the box.   I contacted the company and told them what had happened and have had no reply what so ever. This was in September or October, and there still isnt any word from any of them. If you decide to purchase any of these products don&#x27;t depend on any one helping  you with what ever is the matter. They do not stand behind what they are selling in the least. At least they didnt with me.  I might have had better to say if they had just made an effort to help me in any way. I would not recommend these products. There is very little about them on the net too. I didnt do any research which I usually do, about these products, or I probably wouldnt have ever even tried them. I am copy pasting this to the other products so that I can try to help others to make a more informed purchase.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I tried the Intensive  serum It was thick like it was froze and would not pump out. Is this the way it is suppose to be? I have always used the concentrated facial serum before which is like the eye serum.</li>
            <li> I love everything in this line</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly and is the same product that Premier is selling in his website at $500.00!!!!  Obviously my price was super better!!!!  This is an excellent product with great results for your skin. My friends just already buy one for them.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years.  Feel it has helped prevent lines due to ageing on my face better than any previous products I had used.</li>
            <li> Use a small amount and it can last up to 6 months.  It really has brought elasticity back to my face. Use in conjuction with Biox Intensive Age Cream/Anti-Age Complex. Both complement to each other.</li>
            <li> i love this product. have been using it for over a year and can&#x27;  t be without it.  at times it is difficult to locate but Amazon has been very helpful in keeping this product available  The product is awsome.  tightens up the skin.  i love the feel it gives my skin. i highly recommend this product for any age.</li>
            <li> I bought this product before and again a few weeks ago.  It does absolutely nothing for my skin. All one does is spend the money and waste it. It does nothing to keep your skin soft and subtle.</li>
            <li> I received this product in a timely fashion. Perfect condition. have been using every evening since I received. Love the results, my son in law told my daughter that my skin looked really great. Very Happy!!! Would purchase again and again</li>
            <li> It really worked very well on my skin.  It does everything or more as stated in the product label . I just have 3 weeks using it and i feel the different. One of the best product in the market.  Good price in amazon.</li>
            <li> It makes a big difference in your skin.  Brighter, firmer and have had people ask what was different.  I/2 way through first bottle...will get more.</li>
            <li> I have been using these two products together for the past 3 years and my skin has never looked better.  I am over 65 and love these products.  The Seller shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> delivered fast, item as described</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dead Sea products for several years now and I love them for achieving the results they claim to achieve!</li>
            <li> Nothing remarkable, but not a bad product.  I unfortunately have used so many other products since purchasing this that i truly do not remember much about it.  I tend to go from one product to another but will stay with one that shows promise.  About all I can say is that if this had been anything really different I would still be using it, but I am not.  Sorry for the &amp;#34;less than helpful&amp;#34; review. I should have reviewed it at the time of purchase and I may have had more to say.</li>
            <li> Exceptional product!  I certainly see a difference in my fine lines.  They are much improved!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because the eye cream worked so well for me.  I ordered the eye cream and never received it.  The biox serum doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Tried the product on my face wrinkles to the best of my knowledge because it did not come with clear instructions. I saw no difference. This was a huge waste of money!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product while in Las Vegas and have used it for years.  It was great to find the exact same product on amazon at a reduced price without any change in quality. Highly recommend the product--takes away the fine lines and reduces age appearance by ten years--well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Similar to the biox cream, I believe this package was also tampered with but the distributor did a much better job in hiding it.  Cellophane was torn and, as I said, looks tampered with.  As mentioned with the cream, I do not expect this for a company that distributes for you,</li>
            <li> I use this product after cleansing my face at night; it has such a pleasant mild scent, is not greasy and just the name makes me feel like it is doing its job targeting wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The product is really nice.  It goes on very silky and  I often use it much like a&lt;br /&gt;primer under makeup.  The product has not improved my skin texture as I had hoped&lt;br /&gt;it would.  That&#x27;s the only reason I left off a star.  I had talked to someone at a mall and&lt;br /&gt;obviously an expected result was an improvement in fine lines or wrinkles.  So....overall, it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;a nice product, but one without noticeable results.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and did not seem to be tampered with. It was the same as I previously bought direct from a rep</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and was packaged well.  Inner package was still sealed.  This is a serum which I use in a mix with the cream.  It makes the skin feel soft and moist.  The moisturizing effect on the skin last for hours, and will hold up to outside heat.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product in Spain and fell in love with it.  Makes my skin so soft, brighter and younger looking.</li>
            <li> this serum is highly effective when used in conjunction with the rest of the biox products.  Do not think alone you would notice as great as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, invest in the set, it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;can use this on your neck as well</li>
            <li> Great product. I have been using it for 5 years and it really makes a difference in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Product was received in a timely fashion. I love this product and will continue to use it and order it here!</li>
            <li> Nice bottle but the pump does not work. I used it faithfully for a month without result. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Skin feels so great every time I smooth this on,absorbs quickly,never greasy. Love this product. I feel it makes my skin look much healthier and younger and I am 70+. Wish I had started with  this years ago.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this product my girlfriends noticed a difference! They said my skin looked better and younger. Now I use this with the moisturizer and I feel my skin has improved.</li>
            <li> This is nice product, it makes a difference on your skin just need to use it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;What I dont like is that agter using almost a half of the bottle every time when I push the pump the cream comes with a small pieces of a red color!!! The bottle is colored red!!&lt;br /&gt;I can even feel it on my skin sometimes they come out a little bigger. That makes me wondering if I should use it or no!?</li>
            <li> It was just as ordered and arrived ahead of time.&lt;br /&gt;A lot less expensive than purchasing it at a mall.</li>
            <li> Love it will order again</li>
            <li> I bought these products and so far i love theme , but there is one thing i do not understand why it&#x27;s call the intensive treatment cream and on the box it say&#x27;s intensive defying cream and it&#x27;s the same with the serum !!!! is there two diffrent cream and serum in  the biox collection or maby they just change the name from one to annother??? Do i have the real thing????</li>
            <li> I first bought this product at a kiosk for a lot more money.  It seems to have a calming effect on my skin and I am happy to find it at a more affordable price.  Use it with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this product but not lasting a lot. I would have 4 more bottles to quench my oh so thirsty skin. after second treatment, I see my skin more pump. soflty. A very good complement with other product of this line.</li>
            <li> I use this product in with the Biox intensive age treatment cream and it works really well, softens lines  and helps with the dry skin.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year and get compliments all the time. Coworkers are asking what I use. I use in combination with the Face Biox cream.</li>
            <li> I can see the lessening of wrinkles and &amp;#34;puffy, wrinkled spots&amp;#34;, as I have used this product over time.  I know both would be increased in appearance and number without it.  Amazon.com also has the best compared cost value as a purchase point.</li>
            <li> I had very bad experience with this product, the mint I apply this on my face I start to feel burning and start to get red spots  especially around my eyes. I think if someone went to buy this should first go to a cosmetic place to try the item first before purchase and I am a person I don&#x27;t use any chemical or make up at all.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  Have used other Premier products and have liked all of them.  Will buy again if price right.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem like the real thing. It moisterizes in a dried out way. Has the feel of sanitizer mixed with other stuff. I thought I would cut cost and it wasn&#x27;t a good idea.</li>
            <li> If you use this product, definitely use it with the intensive age treatment as I don&#x27;t think there would be any noticeable change.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this line of products...........little to no positive after appearance. Have already gone back to Skin Obsession products.</li>
            <li> I just love everything from Premier Dead Sea products.  I have side by side the ones I purchased from the mall and the ones I purchased from Amazon.  They are identical.  One difference is the ones from Amazon at 70-90% discount from the mall.  What not to love about the products.  Ladies with mature skin, try them.  Your skin will thank you.</li>
            <li> Just has not done what is described in brochure...will don&#x27;t inure to check it out though.  Tried for about 1 week so far.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and have been using it for years. Along with the Anti-age complex it makes a big difference in the way my face looks and feels.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product after using the eye serum.  I can see a visible difference right away.  After continued use, I was receiving compliments on how well I looked.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to rate skin care products.  I have tried many of them and find Premier Dead Sea very good.  It is affordable, has no adverse effects, removes fine lines, and keeps my skin looking young at 58 years old.</li>
            <li> ive been using this product every day for about 2 weeks and the crows feet in my eyes are slowly going away, i wished i would have known about premier products years ago.</li>
            <li> I love all dead sea products by Premier.  They make my skin feel luxurious nit obviously works because I&#x27;ve gotten plenty of compliments. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> No results with this serum.</li>
            <li> This serum not only keeps the skin firm but also very soft. It works also very well with the moisturizer. I highly recommend this item. The price is right as well.</li>
            <li> I really like the dead sea products. My face used to be so dry around my nose with other moisturizing products, but with the dead sea products this is not a problem anymore. Thank you for your fast service and good product, as you promised.</li>
            <li> I love this serum,really works for me, my face after a few application looks much younger.</li>
            <li> After using this serum, my skin feels smooth and appears to have more elasticity.  No oils, great smell, use it every day, and it works!</li>
            <li> After spending way to much money on other products I took a chance and purchased the Premier Dead Sea Intensive Anti Aging Box Serum and the Premier Dead Sea Triple Firming Eye Serum, .&lt;br /&gt;I start out the morning with a clean face, apply  a small amount of the Firming Eye Serum around the eyes, I let dry for a few seconds and then I apply the Anti Aging Biox Serum , a little goes along way. I have noticed a difference in my face and the wrinkles around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;If used properly you to will notice a big change in your complexion. Remember a little goes along way.&lt;br /&gt;It usually lastes me 3/4 months</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the Biox Serum and Biox anti-aging cream.  I&#x27;m 52 and starting with the crow&#x27;s feet and fine lines. After a few months of using these products they are almost completely gone.  They have greatly improved the texture of my skin and leaves it feeling great and non oily. I have also used the mask and feel its pretty good but didn&#x27;t see the overall great results I did with the Cream and Serum.</li>
            <li> Premier Dead Sea is a good product and I will continue using it because of the results others are seeing how nice my skin look.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this product, although a true advocate of all of the other Premier Dead Sea products.  I&#x27;m getting use to it and believe the price to be more than competitive.  Good product so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this product  because of the great reviews and, after 4 weeks using it, I began seeing some wrinkles which I did not have before and my skin was totally dull and dehydrated.  Instead of seeing an improvement my skin never looked so bad! I started re-using the Rilastil products I used before this one and my skin recovered. Save your money.  This product does NOTHING for your skin, on the contrary.</li>
            <li> I had bought this from one of the booths in a casino for so much more than Amazon carries it but it didn&#x27;t last long enough to find out if it actually works. Then I got it from Amazon for a much, much better prize. I like how it feels, but am not too sure if it actually does what it claims. I didn&#x27;t see much change in my skin.</li>
            <li> I tried this in the mall and just loved the effects it gave my face. I am 65 and everyone tells me I look 10 years younger than I did a year ago. Way to go</li>
            <li> i love this product for my face it is nice  thank you very much I always use it. Great item</li>
            <li> I would not leave the house without this on</li>
            <li> I rarely leave product feedback.  A product has to really WOW me or really not.  After a week of dispensing this product I thought it would settle in the bottle.  Evey time I dispensed it, the product shot out like a bullet and I ended up having to place it in front of the palm of my hand to keep it from shooting across the room.  I pressed the plunger as gently as I could but to no avail.  Also, after applying quite a bit of it my face still didn&#x27;t feel as moisturized as would have liked.  The worst thing of all is the smell.  It isn&#x27;t a strong smell but I find the scent to be musty and old smelling.  It&#x27;s been over 2 weeks now and I can no longer tolerate the smell.  I find it to be very unpleasant.  In the trash it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could have enjoyed some of the benefits the other posters experienced.</li>
            <li> this product came in a box with no warranty seal, there is no way of knowing if it is really brand new and an original product, and not filled out.</li>
            <li> I like this product under my moisturizer.  I don&#x27;t like it as the very best serum I&#x27;ve tried, but it is very good.</li>
            <li> Tried many many different anti age serums. Spent  tons of money from a skin care clinic on products and facials. Getting some results but nothing close to this product. I  was a bystander in the mall that got suckered into purchasing a few Premier Dead Sea products at their Kiosk. The guys were smooth sales people that talked you into putting the product on your face. Boy, I was so glad I tried it. Could not believe the instant results on my 50 yr. old plus face. I was a sucker for paying the obnoxious price, but at the same time, it was worth the money to discover products that finally made a huge difference in the wrinkles around my eyes, forehead, above the lip, and neck.  So I look at it as paying a consultant money to find products that work for me. For a half of year, I have been using the Anti Aging Biox, the eye serum and their creams that go over the serum, and their wonderful facial that I do 1X/wk. So sorry I did not originally take a close- up picture of my wrinkles, so that I could compare the difference. My husband, parents, extended family and friends all tell me I look so youthful and healthy. They all want to know what I am doing. So I am hooked, and will continue to purchase all of the products on Amazon. So far all of them have performed as expected. I have had no issues with shipments or products leaking during shipment yet.</li>
            <li> I use this serum as soon as I get finished washing my face, then put on the Dead Sea Moisture Cream.  They are the perfect pair for extremely dry skin!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and have yet to notice any change to my face. It feels good on and no dryness so that is nice but no overall changes.</li>
            <li> The top of the bottle was broke and the cream smell bad, t have to threw in the trash. I will not recoment if that is the way smell</li>
            <li> works well with the cream</li>
            <li> I originally bought Premier Dead Sea products from one of those kiosks in a mall where the salespeople flag you down for a demonstration. This is an excellent product and with regular use, does just what the manufacturer claims.</li>
            <li> Can tell a difference in my skin after only 2 weeks. Pores are tight and small lines are minimized. Premier has the best skin products I have found. (I am a physician and have access to many products ...) Expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> I got suckered into buying this stuff for about $200 when I was in Las Vegas.  The really bad news was...IT WORKED!!  I knew I&#x27;d never be able to afford to keep using it...until I found it on Amazon! Great price!</li>
            <li> The Drugmart brand has a softer feel and seems to do more.&lt;br /&gt;I would not necessarily buy again, but the eye serum is fantastic.</li>
