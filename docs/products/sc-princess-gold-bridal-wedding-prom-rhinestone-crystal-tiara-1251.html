            <li>The sides are bendable to better fit your head more securely.</li>
            <li>breaks very,very easy.</li>
            <li>the design is lovely and the frame is slightly flexible so you can adjust it for a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The price was fantastic.</li>
            <li>This one is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The 18 year old Princess loved it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will be fine for pictures, but I certainly won&#x27;t be wearing it on my wedding day, which it was intended for.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with this when I took it out of the box because it is so pretty.</li>
            <li>but with this elegant tiara she will look like a real princess.</li>
            <li>Bought for my niece&#x27;s Sweet 16</li>
            <li>Hoping to be able to send it back an get a new one in good shape.</li>
            <li>Also the very top of the tiara, the silver metal part wasn&#x27;t well made and looks slightly cracked where it meets the top gem.</li>
            <li>The crystals are clear and lovely, though.</li>
            <li>I do agree whit other reviews, it does seem a bit fragile, but no breaks yet, so I&#x27;m happy!!</li>
            <li>It is very elaborate, but not particularly sparkly.</li>
            <li>The small metal pieces at the top break easily.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, whimsical tiara.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a tiara.</li>
            <li>teenage daughter loves it and uses it not only for special occasions like prom, but wears it when she wants to feel like a princess.</li>
            <li>This hasn&#x27;t even been worn  (and I live alone, so</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this Tiara!  </li>
            <li>Pretty to set on a shelf only!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large, but no to big, and sooooo sparkly!!!!!</li>
            <li>It was a gift for my 5 year old granddaughter and she never takes it off</li>
            <li>I could not imagine spending so much on something I was only going to wear for 1 day.</li>
            <li>But did come completely intact.</li>
            <li>It was very pretty but missing stones.</li>
            <li>a definite adult crown!</li>

            <li> a definite adult crown!</li>
            <li> Its pretty heavy metal.  </li>
            <li> A lot of the gems weren&#x27;t fitted into their slots well, like some of them are crooked or some of them jut out too far, and you can see black outlines because the sides of the crystals that are supposed to be tucked inside the tiara&#x27;s grooves are black.</li>
            <li> This tiara is really pretty , but it is very delicate.  </li>
            <li> Missing several rhinestones</li>
            <li> The tiara is a lot sturdier than expected.  </li>
            <li> I later noticed one of the stones in front is missing!</li>
            <li> , I wanted a little purple in my tiara to blend in with the wedding party.</li>
            <li> I Just had to reglue a few stones when it arrived because they had fallen off.</li>
            <li> I would suggest a buyer look it over thoroughly immediately upon taking it out of the plastic box, and to check that each crystal is firmly seated.</li>
            <li> I disliked it within seconds of taking it out of its plastic container.</li>
            <li> Not too big &amp; cheesy.</li>
            <li> so I could at least fix it.</li>
            <li> we looked everywhere; all the tiara&#x27;s were ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding it difficult to find a replacement crystal.</li>
            <li> If I could have found the stone and reglued it in place, I&#x27;d not be disappointed now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know when the stone came out, but it&#x27;s very disappointing that it happened before the tiara was even worn for an event.</li>

            <li> Great service!!  Turned out more beautiful than the picture.</li>
            <li> Missing several rhinestones</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  Absolutely beautiful.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my 5 year old granddaughter and she never takes it off&lt;br /&gt;The picture does not do it justice, it is very beautiful</li>
            <li> This tiara is very very beautiful. I had bought it for my wedding day. I&#x27;ve had gotten so many compliments.. but I must say DO NOT bend it in any way, it will break! Over all though, it looks exactly like the picture.. so gorgeous!</li>
            <li> It was very pretty but missing stones. Wish I had them so I could at least fix it. Hoping to be able to send it back an get a new one in good shape.</li>
            <li> Bella, bella, bella, I buy  it  for mi nice&#x27;s quinceañera she is a beatiful girl but with this elegant tiara she will look like a real princess. Thank you ..</li>
            <li> This thing is massive. I got it for a Holly Golightly Halloween costume and I had to chip off the sides to make it smaller (which worked well and people couldn&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;d done it.) It&#x27;s unapologetically tacky so if you want it to wear it earnestly, like at a wedding or something of that sort... then approach with caution.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this Tiara!  Very good pretty for a wedding or anything else.  Its pretty heavy metal.  Nice stones, sparkly!  &amp;#34;Foo Foo&amp;#34;!!!!</li>
            <li> Looked absolutely stunning at my wedding!! Lots of compliments. It was beautiful &amp; photographed great. Everyone loved it &amp; thought it was more costly!</li>
            <li> This tiara is really pretty , but it is very delicate.  The small metal pieces at the top break easily. The crystals are clear and lovely, though.</li>
            <li> I Loved this tiara. I Just had to reglue a few stones when it arrived because they had fallen off.</li>
            <li> I/we looked everywhere; all the tiara&#x27;s were ridiculously expensive. I could not imagine spending so much on something I was only going to wear for 1 day. I had an idea for my wedding day, I wanted a little purple in my tiara to blend in with the wedding party. We never thought to search on Amazon for this product, it was the best blessing. The price was fantastic. The tiara is a lot sturdier than expected.  I tell everyone about this find. It was perfect!!</li>
            <li> Pretty to set on a shelf only! breaks very,very easy. But did come completely intact. Fell off daughters head and broke when it hit the floor. Our fault though.</li>
            <li> I love this crown!!!! It&#x27;s large, but no to big, and sooooo sparkly!!!!! I do agree whit other reviews, it does seem a bit fragile, but no breaks yet, so I&#x27;m happy!!</li>
            <li> Bought for my niece&#x27;s Sweet 16 and she loved it. Not too big &amp; cheesy. It fits perfect can also be adjusted but still not flimsy.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, whimsical tiara. The sides are bendable to better fit your head more securely.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this when I took it out of the box because it is so pretty. I only tried it on in my bedroom, then put it on a shelf with my jewelry boxes. I later noticed one of the stones in front is missing! I looked around it and in the plastic box it came in, but never found the stone. This hasn&#x27;t even been worn  (and I live alone, so no one else had access to it). I don&#x27;t know when the stone came out, but it&#x27;s very disappointing that it happened before the tiara was even worn for an event. I would suggest a buyer look it over thoroughly immediately upon taking it out of the plastic box, and to check that each crystal is firmly seated. If I could have found the stone and reglued it in place, I&#x27;d not be disappointed now. I&#x27;m finding it difficult to find a replacement crystal.</li>
            <li> Beautiful! Five stars for the fast shipping, great price and friendly service. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a tiara. the design is lovely and the frame is slightly flexible so you can adjust it for a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> love the crown. It looks beautiful and felt like a real princes</li>
            <li> It is well made and is heavier and less-fragile than it looks.</li>
            <li> a definite adult crown!</li>
            <li> excellent quality, looks like real gems. teenage daughter loves it and uses it not only for special occasions like prom, but wears it when she wants to feel like a princess. seller was excellent and met all expectations</li>
            <li> The tiara was just as lovely as I had hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;Made me want to order another for my daughter just because it was such a bargain.</li>
            <li> It is very elaborate, but not particularly sparkly. Also looks kind of bulky.</li>
            <li> The 18 year old Princess loved it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why some of the reviews say the metal is flimsy. What in the world?? I used to sell tiaras so I know. This one is fantastic. Very sturdy. Really gorgeous! Loved it.</li>
            <li> I disliked it within seconds of taking it out of its plastic container. A lot of the gems weren&#x27;t fitted into their slots well, like some of them are crooked or some of them jut out too far, and you can see black outlines because the sides of the crystals that are supposed to be tucked inside the tiara&#x27;s grooves are black. Also the very top of the tiara, the silver metal part wasn&#x27;t well made and looks slightly cracked where it meets the top gem. It seems like a toy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, its flaws won&#x27;t be noticeable from faraway and I&#x27;m sure it will be fine for pictures, but I certainly won&#x27;t be wearing it on my wedding day, which it was intended for.</li>
            <li> This crown was for our Beef Princess and it worked great. It held up well through 5 parades and several shows.</li>
