            <li>The quality is so good.</li>
            <li>The majority of the shades tend to have a fair bit of orange or gold in them, so if that is not your thing, def do not get this palette.</li>
            <li>The bottom two colors on the right are very beautiful goldy-pinky colors, which are very popular this fall.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this palette.  </li>

            <li>the put it on top</li>
            <li>I love Sleek&#x27;s makeup....</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the very bright blue, although I see how it can be used in conjunction with the rest of the colors to create pop.</li>
            <li>Very cool arrived intact</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited I purchased these :)</li>
            <li>Got the pallets I ordered fast,  nice colors, pretty good</li>
            <li>Plum shades are not really my cup of tea,  but this one again seems to be a perfect fit for the rest of the palette.  </li>
            <li>Plum shades are not really my cup of tea,  but this one again seems to be a perfect fit for the rest of the palette.  </li>
            <li>These shadows are beautifully pigmented and easy enough to blend out.</li>
            <li>Sleek products are pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this to be true in most Sleek palettes.  </li>
            <li>luckily, I was able to fix them.</li>
            <li>This pallet is all very &amp;#34;Maroon&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Burgundy&amp;#34; and warm.</li>
            <li>They also are very pigmented with an amazing color pay off.</li>
            <li>I went to my works Xmas party last night, dancing and sweating, and it still looked great.  </li>
            <li>The color does fade throughout the day, and because the colors are so similar you don&#x27;t get a great contrast or gradient.</li>
            <li>My favourite way to wear this is right under my waterline - it makes you look twice just to make sure you&#x27;re seeing what you&#x27;re seeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>These are by far the best pigmented eye shadows I have purchased from low end cosmetic companies</li>
            <li>Great price and minimal shipping fee.  </li>
            <li>If I had seen it in person, I would not have bought it, but overall, it&#x27;s a good palette.</li>
            <li>I find this to be probably the most versatile out of the whole bunch.  </li>
            <li>I find this to be probably the most versatile out of the whole bunch.  </li>
            <li>Sleek is beautiful long lasting the product is amazing</li>
            <li>I love them and will be purchasing more sets in the future.</li>
            <li>This is another red,  but this time it&#x27;s got a definite tinge of copper and it borrows from the pink-toned shades delightfully.  </li>
            <li>I buy from an Amazon seller (called Lucky Girl</li>
            <li>I buy from an Amazon seller (called Lucky Girl</li>
            <li>The colors are super pigmented, I recommended to everybody.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very,  very wearable and the shimmer is just light</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very,  very wearable and the shimmer is just light</li>
            <li>/&gt;Moving on,  the next shade  is simply beautiful -  despite how it looks in photos,  it&#x27;s actually a very pigmented darker rose red with a bit of shimmer.  </li>
            <li>Stay long and bright I never thought it works</li>
            <li>I got my package in within a week and a half :) love it!</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re looking to buy,  search for swatches instead - they&#x27;ll be far more true to the palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore it!!</li>
            <li>I expected the colors to be deeper, but the consistency is great, and the shadows are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>The colors on this palette are really pigmented and apply so smoothly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian with fair skin and these eyeshadows are so pigmented that you do not need too much.</li>
            <li>Overall nice but revlon,</li>
            <li>The colors are much darker and more vibrant than the picture shows, it does them no justice.</li>
            <li>pallet is SO fall forward right now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely pigmented and after blending it becomes more soft as a result - perfect for a more subtle look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipped much faster than the date given too!</li>
            <li>All the colors are really pretty and shimmery.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t wear shimmery eyeshadows all that often, I had to have this one because the colors were too pretty to pass up.</li>
            <li>Very affordable!</li>
            <li>instead I&#x27;ll just start at the top left and go from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely teal-ish blue</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely teal-ish blue</li>
            <li>/&gt;So,  &amp;#34;Sunset&amp;#34;  is a palette of beautiful fiery autumnal shades and unlike some of the other Sleek palettes,  this one has decided to remain incognito by not actually naming each colour,  so</li>
            <li>and  it&#x27;s more sheer  than the other shades which I find is absolutely appropriate (unless you&#x27;re 13).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and  it&#x27;s more sheer  than the other shades which I find is absolutely appropriate (unless you&#x27;re 13).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very vibrant and shimmery colors.</li>
            <li>although they bluff about the approximated shipping (being waaay slower than it really is), Amazon always gets them to me in about 2-3 weeks tops.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very affordable</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think a couple of the colors really go with my skin color.</li>
            <li>The colors in this palette are very pigmented and go well together.</li>
            <li>Really orange.  </li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s so very usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s so very usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sleek (just like it&#x27;s name), simple, and travel friendly.</li>
            <li>This is no complaint though!</li>
            <li>I got the palette with the shimmer colors because most of my other eyeshadows are matte.</li>
            <li>The palette is mostly satins and one matte (black).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>As well as, they have good blend-ability with each other and other brands of eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I needed new shadow but didn&#x27;t want to pay a hefty price.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the only downfall is that the photos (official and not)  don&#x27;t really show the real colours of the palette.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased several eyeshadow sets and they are all very pigmented and wear really well.</li>
            <li>and I think this can be used pretty much universally</li>

            <li>and not only is delivery much faster than anticipated,  but the palettes are well packaged</li>
            <li>and I have to say they stand their ground right next to urban decay shadows.</li>
            <li>These eye shadows are super pigmented and last a long time with and without primer for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Matte black is a nice black,  but it&#x27;s not as pigmented as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>Use it with the other copper-tinted shades and I promise you the result will be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use it with the other copper-tinted shades and I promise you the result will be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is probably the weakest in terms of pigmentation (other than the black),  but it makes a fantastic transition colour.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally,  another of my favourites - it&#x27;s the softest,  most subtle  pink</li>

            <li> I find this to be probably the most versatile out of the whole bunch.  </li>

            <li> Sleek is beautiful long lasting the product is amazing</li>
            <li> I love them and will be purchasing more sets in the future.</li>
            <li> This is another red,  but this time it&#x27;s got a definite tinge of copper and it borrows from the pink-toned shades delightfully.  </li>
            <li> I buy from an Amazon seller (called Lucky Girl</li>

            <li> The colors are super pigmented, I recommended to everybody.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very,  very wearable and the shimmer is just light</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very,  very wearable and the shimmer is just light</li>
            <li> /&gt;Moving on,  the next shade  is simply beautiful -  despite how it looks in photos,  it&#x27;s actually a very pigmented darker rose red with a bit of shimmer.  </li>
            <li> Stay long and bright I never thought it works</li>
            <li> I got my package in within a week and a half :) love it!</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking to buy,  search for swatches instead - they&#x27;ll be far more true to the palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore it!!</li>
            <li> I expected the colors to be deeper, but the consistency is great, and the shadows are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> The colors on this palette are really pigmented and apply so smoothly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian with fair skin and these eyeshadows are so pigmented that you do not need too much.</li>
            <li> Overall nice but revlon,</li>
            <li> The colors are much darker and more vibrant than the picture shows, it does them no justice.</li>
            <li> pallet is SO fall forward right now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely pigmented and after blending it becomes more soft as a result - perfect for a more subtle look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipped much faster than the date given too!</li>
            <li> All the colors are really pretty and shimmery.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t wear shimmery eyeshadows all that often, I had to have this one because the colors were too pretty to pass up.</li>
            <li> Very affordable!</li>
            <li> instead I&#x27;ll just start at the top left and go from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely teal-ish blue</li>

            <li> /&gt;So,  &amp;#34;Sunset&amp;#34;  is a palette of beautiful fiery autumnal shades and unlike some of the other Sleek palettes,  this one has decided to remain incognito by not actually naming each colour,  so</li>
            <li> and  it&#x27;s more sheer  than the other shades which I find is absolutely appropriate (unless you&#x27;re 13).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Very vibrant and shimmery colors.</li>
            <li> although they bluff about the approximated shipping (being waaay slower than it really is), Amazon always gets them to me in about 2-3 weeks tops.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think a couple of the colors really go with my skin color.</li>
            <li> The colors in this palette are very pigmented and go well together.</li>
            <li> Really orange.  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s so very usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s so very usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This is no complaint though!</li>
            <li> I got the palette with the shimmer colors because most of my other eyeshadows are matte.</li>
            <li> The palette is mostly satins and one matte (black).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>

            <li> Perhaps the only downfall is that the photos (official and not)  don&#x27;t really show the real colours of the palette.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased several eyeshadow sets and they are all very pigmented and wear really well.</li>

            <li> These eye shadows are super pigmented and last a long time with and without primer for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Matte black is a nice black,  but it&#x27;s not as pigmented as I&#x27;d like.  </li>

            <li> I went into my purchase a little skeptical, but upon receiving the palett and swatching different colors I was amazed at how vibrant and striking they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> If you want to make them pop even more, put a creamy white base underneath them, like NYX pencil in Milk.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Urban Decay but it can get pricey.  </li>

            <li> I only gave it 3 stars because 2 of the eyeshadows were broken up ...</li>
            <li> They do not last all day even with using a couple different primers, fall out is bad, I even applied wet and still not good, and they do not blend well.  </li>
            <li> The eye shadows are long wearing, especially when an eye shadow primer or base is worn.  </li>
            <li> product is from across the pond, therefore the shipping can be slow.</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s ORANGE.  </li>
            <li> Chalky, low color payoff, fades throughout the day even with an eyeshadow primer and base</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian with fair skin and these eyeshadows are so pigmented that you do not need too much. The quality of the eyeshadows are great because they&#x27;re easy to blend, buttery, and bright. I love the packaging as well. It&#x27;s sleek (just like it&#x27;s name), simple, and travel friendly.</li>
            <li> Love the colors. And last all day even without my primer on.</li>
            <li> Chalky, low color payoff, fades throughout the day even with an eyeshadow primer and base</li>
            <li> I have the biggest OBSESSION with Sleek eyeshadow pallets!! This pallet is not spared! I absolutely adore it!! This pallet is all very &amp;#34;Maroon&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Burgundy&amp;#34; and warm. I have brown eyes and all of the colors in here just make my eyes look POP and look AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently have 6 of the Sleek pallets (comment if you want to know them) and I just love these pallets. The formula for these is sooo creamy without being a cream shadow. They also are very pigmented with an amazing color pay off. As well as, they have good blend-ability with each other and other brands of eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pallet is SO fall forward right now. The colors are much darker and more vibrant than the picture shows, it does them no justice. You can see them better if you visit the Sleek make-up website or Youtube some pallet swatches. I always purchase them on Amazon just because I am very loyal (lol), and they seem to ship quicker than the Sleek website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is from across the pond, therefore the shipping can be slow. Amazon ships them to you waaay faster...although they bluff about the approximated shipping (being waaay slower than it really is), Amazon always gets them to me in about 2-3 weeks tops. They always promise them out about 4 weeks. This is no complaint though! I absolutely love Amazon&#x27;s great service and fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this review was lengthy I apologize about that, but I hope it helps in your future make-up collecting hauls!</li>
            <li> Bought this based on a Temptalia review, super happy with it! Lots of warm colors, blends smoothly. Shipped much faster than the date given too! Many more stars should be given for this palette :-)</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!!!! Love this Palette, beautifull &amp; pigmented eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I expected the colors to be deeper, but the consistency is great, and the shadows are very pigmented. The palette is mostly satins and one matte (black). If I had seen it in person, I would not have bought it, but overall, it&#x27;s a good palette. Just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen you tube videos about this makeup so I decided to try it ... the colors are great ...I only gave it 3 stars because 2 of the eyeshadows were broken up ... luckily, I was able to fix them.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best pigmented eye shadows I have purchased from low end cosmetic companies and I have to say they stand their ground right next to urban decay shadows. I love them and will be purchasing more sets in the future.</li>
            <li> These eye shadows are super pigmented and last a long time with and without primer for me. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Urban Decay but it can get pricey.  I took a chance on this eye shadow set after reading reviews.  I&#x27;m glad I did. I love the colors and how the shadow stays in place.  I went to my works Xmas party last night, dancing and sweating, and it still looked great.  The sparkle of the shadow is sexy.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Stay long and bright I never thought it works but it&#x27;s amazing I love it I absolutely recommended great price too</li>
            <li> The shadow quality is very good. The color does fade throughout the day, and because the colors are so similar you don&#x27;t get a great contrast or gradient. Overall, the palettes are inexpensive and for what you pay I think it is a good purchase.</li>
            <li> AMAZING quality product for the price!  I went into my purchase a little skeptical, but upon receiving the palett and swatching different colors I was amazed at how vibrant and striking they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying this product again!</li>
            <li> This palette exceeded my expectations. All the colors are really pretty and shimmery. I got the palette with the shimmer colors because most of my other eyeshadows are matte. It&#x27;s also a good price for a good eyeshadow palette!</li>
            <li> The colors on this palette are really pigmented and apply so smoothly. Although I don&#x27;t wear shimmery eyeshadows all that often, I had to have this one because the colors were too pretty to pass up. They work so well for the summer.</li>
            <li> Love love love the colors!</li>
            <li> These colors are beautiful and work any time of the year.  They blend wonderfully and the price can&#x27;t be beat. If you want to make them pop even more, put a creamy white base underneath them, like NYX pencil in Milk. LOVE!</li>
            <li> Love love love this pallete it&#x27;s beautiful color payoff is amazing! And it&#x27;s very affordable I got my package in within a week and a half :) love it!</li>
            <li> Much better than my expectation!</li>
            <li> I love these shadows!  The staying power with or without a primer is amazing to me.  I own all the UD shadows and they don&#x27;t even hold this long (Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I LOVE UD!) I&#x27;m really excited I purchased these :)</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful. I don&#x27;t think a couple of the colors really go with my skin color. I&#x27;m an 8 in Mac&#x27;s Match Master Foundation.</li>
            <li> Great pallet for thee price love mine... Recommend...</li>
            <li> love this  eye pallette as the name is sleek pigmentation  and quality of the shadows is excellent its beautiful colors I&#x27;m very happy</li>
            <li> I saw this palette being reviewed on temptalia.com. I had to  buy one for myself to check it out. Very affordable! This palette is of great quality. The colors in this palette are very pigmented and go well together.</li>
            <li> These shadows are beautifully pigmented and easy enough to blend out. I just wish the staying power was there, but for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> liked all these colors</li>
            <li> (Long review warning!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sleek Cosmetics is a UK company,  and they&#x27;re known for selling incredibly pigmented eyeshadows at a ridiculously cheap price.  Perhaps the only downfall is that the photos (official and not)  don&#x27;t really show the real colours of the palette.  I&#x27;ve found this to be true in most Sleek palettes.  So if you&#x27;re looking to buy,  search for swatches instead - they&#x27;ll be far more true to the palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So,  &amp;#34;Sunset&amp;#34;  is a palette of beautiful fiery autumnal shades and unlike some of the other Sleek palettes,  this one has decided to remain incognito by not actually naming each colour,  so instead I&#x27;ll just start at the top left and go from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matte black is a nice black,  but it&#x27;s not as pigmented as I&#x27;d like.  It&#x27;s not the worst black though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on,  the next shade  is simply beautiful -  despite how it looks in photos,  it&#x27;s actually a very pigmented darker rose red with a bit of shimmer.  If it seems too bright,  just blend,  blend,  blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next we have a shade that almost defies description.  This is another red,  but this time it&#x27;s got a definite tinge of copper and it borrows from the pink-toned shades delightfully.  It&#x27;s extremely pigmented and after blending it becomes more soft as a result - perfect for a more subtle look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orange:  Well,  it&#x27;s orange.  I mean it&#x27;s ORANGE.  Really orange.  But it&#x27;s also metallic and this is a very nice example of how orange doesn&#x27;t have to scare you.  Once again there is excellent pigmentation  and perhaps because of that you&#x27;ll want to keep it for after hours.  Or you can be a rebel like me and wear it out in the daytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Time for some Gold!  This one is probably the weakest in terms of pigmentation (other than the black),  but it makes a fantastic transition colour.  It&#x27;s a yellow-based gold and it&#x27;s a little more sheer than the others,  and this one I like to wear as an eyeliner (truly).&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Blue:  I didn&#x27;t expect this colour to be present at all - surprise!  It&#x27;s a lovely teal-ish blue and  it&#x27;s more sheer  than the other shades which I find is absolutely appropriate (unless you&#x27;re 13).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next row!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First we have a  somewhat cooler aubergine red with some shimmer.  Plum shades are not really my cup of tea,  but this one again seems to be a perfect fit for the rest of the palette.  It&#x27;s surprisingly adaptable,  too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next is a brown-based red  with a definite copper shimmer.  Use it with the other copper-tinted shades and I promise you the result will be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we have a peachy reddish shade –  it&#x27;s not the best colour for me,  but it&#x27;s very,  very wearable and the shimmer is just light enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next one is almost muted,  a sort of a pinkish gold with some bronze-ish added.  Despite the sheer-ness (is that even a word?)  I find this to be probably the most versatile out of the whole bunch.  Pair it with...well,  any of the others,  really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following that is a marigold-pinkish lighter red.  My favourite way to wear this is right under my waterline - it makes you look twice just to make sure you&#x27;re seeing what you&#x27;re seeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally,  another of my favourites - it&#x27;s the softest,  most subtle  pink and I think this can be used pretty much universally - it&#x27;s so very usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,  this is another home run for Sleek.  I buy from an Amazon seller (called Lucky Girl - I don&#x27;t mind name-dropping!) and not only is delivery much faster than anticipated,  but the palettes are well packaged and I haven&#x27;t had a single problem at all.t expect this colour to be present at all - surprise!

            <li> Great! The colors Are super good.  The quality is so good. I love it! The colors are super pigmented, I recommended to everybody.</li>
            <li> Very cool arrived intact</li>
            <li> Very vibrant and shimmery colors. I don&#x27;t care for the very bright blue, although I see how it can be used in conjunction with the rest of the colors to create pop. The majority of the shades tend to have a fair bit of orange or gold in them, so if that is not your thing, def do not get this palette. The orange is not a problem for me, and I find that I can blend these in well. The bottom two colors on the right are very beautiful goldy-pinky colors, which are very popular this fall. None of the shades are sparkly or glittery, but they are for sure shimmery. They are lighter than they appear in the picture.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this eye palette.It looks good on and the colors are rich. I needed new shadow but didn&#x27;t want to pay a hefty price.</li>
            <li> Sleek products are pretty amazing.  I have purchased several eyeshadow sets and they are all very pigmented and wear really well. The color in this palette are great for Fall and Winter</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this palette.  Really nice colors.  The colors apply well.  The eye shadows are long wearing, especially when an eye shadow primer or base is worn.  Great price and minimal shipping fee.  All was purchased for about $10, including shipping. Would purchase other palettes.</li>
            <li> Sleek is beautiful long lasting the product is amazing I don&#x27;t know what hey did, all I know is that I what more!</li>
            <li> Pros.  Got the pallets I ordered fast,  nice colors, pretty good pigments.&lt;br /&gt;Cons.  They do not last all day even with using a couple different primers, fall out is bad, I even applied wet and still not good, and they do not blend well.  Overall nice but revlon, cover girl way better</li>
            <li> I love this product.. i use a primer for my eyes the put it on top and it stays all day.. if i ran out i think i would repurchase</li>
            <li> I love Sleek&#x27;s makeup....</li>
