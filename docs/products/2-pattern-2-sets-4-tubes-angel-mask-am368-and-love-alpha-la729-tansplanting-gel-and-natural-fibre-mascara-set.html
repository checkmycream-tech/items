            <li>I think the mascara by itself without the fiber is also a good product.</li>
            <li>Both were good</li>
            <li>Tried this instead of my Younique - and it&#x27;s just as good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not tried the more expenses brands, so I can&#x27;t compare, but for the money this seems like a great deal.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used Younique, but I sure get great results with this product.</li>
            <li>Really love this product!</li>

            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>Not as amazing as i thought.</li>
            <li>It has amazing results and does not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>affordable and looks amazing</li>
            <li>The price is also amazing for what it does.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and I love to use.</li>
            <li>I love it works really good</li>
            <li>Love love love!!</li>
            <li>Followed the directions to the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;... looked great at first</li>
            <li>super easy to remove!!</li>
            <li>Love love LOVE</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>I find it looks a lot better on my lower lashes then my top.</li>
            <li>Okay purchase.</li>
            <li>*seal* it with my favorite mascara</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the top selling brand of 3D mascara, this works just as well.  </li>
            <li>I love it ...</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara volume and length galore.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way more inexpensive &amp; shows better in camera.</li>
            <li>love it..</li>
            <li>I love this product it makes my lashes look fuller and longer</li>
            <li>So glad I gave this a shot before paying $30+ on Younique.</li>
            <li>and I could say that I&#x27;m 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>love love</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>it keeps them on better.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I rather pay more for a product than end up with a product that ls not going to work.</li>
            <li>Not the best formula for fiber lashes, I also didn&#x27;t receive the 2 separate sets as stated, I received the 2 same sets.</li>
            <li>Finished with another coat of my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>but the price is better</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good buy for the price.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly for special occasions and night outs!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the brush for the gel tube, but I would strongly strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love how easy it was to figure out.</li>
            <li>both good quality thanks i would be ordering again</li>
            <li>This mascara is easy to use 2 step product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Its easy to apply and comes off easily.</li>
            <li>When I first put this on my lashes looked amazing.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I would suggest is that you use your own mascara to start with because my regular mascara has a better lash brush to separate the lashes the fiber brush and mascara brush on these sets arent very good</li>
            <li>For my eyebrows, I apply a light coat of mascara...</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>Since then I feel like I&#x27;m wearing nothing and have beautiful long lashes.</li>
            <li>Super easy to layer</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is far most my favorite fiber mascara &amp; I just love how this product looks more natural .</li>
            <li>Definitely not the good stuff</li>
            <li>I love this product it really works</li>
            <li>Love it does make your lashes look much longer</li>
            <li>Thank you so much :)</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price I paid</li>
            <li>I first bought it for my wedding, it stayed on all day without smearing and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>It works great and is a lot cheaper than other brands.</li>
            <li>Both sets are very pretty on the lashes.</li>
            <li>Really works and comes off easily</li>
            <li>it literally took 20 seconds per eye with instant and incredibly beautiful and natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li>Possibly even better!  </li>
            <li>The product itself works very well and makes my eyes look beautiful and its just as good as the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li>I recommend to anyone trying it for first time!</li>
            <li>As advertised and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>The gel mascara is great, but the fibers are super messy.</li>
            <li>and wow it&#x27;s amazing saw instant results I really love</li>
            <li>no irritations &amp; looks more natural than the competitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>This product is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Best mascara I have ever try so far 🙌🙌, love them both , &amp; I got them earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>Gel on first then quickly brush the fibers on.</li>
            <li>right but would recommend.</li>
            <li>I was just trying something new and the price was good enough to warrant a test.</li>
            <li>This is a good product as you get 2 of the sets for half the price of the stuff people are selling around the internet or on FB.</li>
            <li>This works so good just like the expensive younique kind</li>
            <li>My regular mascara works better.  </li>
            <li>Regular drug store mascara works better (for me).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m personally a makeup artist &amp; love seeing the difference.</li>
            <li>I have received multiple compliments on my mascara and even ordered more to share with my friends.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using any of these 3D mascaras</li>
            <li>Buy the real thing, spend the money, how embarrassing!</li>
            <li>fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>I just wasn&#x27;t willing to pay $30+ for the fiber mascara that everyone is selling through Multi level marketing companies.</li>
            <li>I had considered lash extensions but wasn&#x27;t willing to do the upkeep.</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>First I curled my lashes.</li>
            <li>Good delivery time, don&#x27;t apply too heavy or it will flake</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>Second coat made them look bigger and darker and I loved it.</li>
            <li>I would warn that the first time I had a lot of clumping but after a little more practice it looks much more natural..</li>
            <li>The first time I wore I only applied two coats of each and by the first coat I was already seeing a huge difference on eye lash size.</li>
            <li>, I love it and use it everyday, it&#x27;s just as good as Younique 3D mascara,it is a little more goopy but still does the same thing!</li>
            <li>Terrific product, and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>You need to gently wipe the fibers off under your eyes</li>
            <li>The Love Alpha fibers came practically empty</li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>I have very skinny lashes</li>
            <li>and these didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>one was the real thing</li>
            <li>That alone really extends the length and width of my lashes.</li>
            <li>I really have skimpy lashes and this makes them fuller, longer, darker.  </li>
            <li>Wish it lasted longer... Runs out to fast, have to keep buying it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if i need to just practice, but my eyelashes get really clumpy and they flake</li>
            <li>and I really like the results.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t want to buy the more expensive product and this was a good buy for more than half the price!</li>
            <li>I found this and originally planned on using it to show that knock-off brands weren&#x27;t as good as the expensive</li>
            <li>The price is way better then other brands I have looked at.</li>
            <li>but this just takes it on a whole new level!</li>
            <li>One coat is nice for an everyday look, 2 coats gives me the length I like!</li>
            <li>Flakes and not as easy to use as expected</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Works as well as the high priced stuff.</li>
            <li>Great alternative to fake lashes.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money and will be buying again in the future!</li>
            <li>This makes my lashes so long and full.</li>
            <li>My lashes look just as good as my friends who wear false lashes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping took almost a month, but luckily it came with two sets of tubes so when the first set is gone I can use the second set while the next order ships.</li>
            <li>First day a bit of fiber went inside my left eye</li>
            <li>At first I was confused on how to use it but with practice I love it.</li>
            <li>(I have sensitive eyes, so this is a must)</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well this product works.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting much as the price was low and the product comes from China</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>Next I applied a very light coat of my usual mascara.  </li>
            <li>The price compared to other sellers is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Myself as trying this product out as a cutomer: Straight, short, resistant, Asian Lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I barely have any lashes...</li>
            <li>I barely got one use out of it</li>
            <li>One of the tubes of fiber seems to have run out after only one use which is strange but otherwise,  the other container seems full</li>
            <li>I like this product but when I got it one set was damaged but still worked, the Love alpha set was the one that was messed up and the fibers to that set was very hard to open but again useable!</li>
            <li>As good as the expensive ones!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Price is very inexpensive, It applies thinner, doesn&#x27;t get thick, doesn&#x27;t flakes off as much as Younique version, it lasts me all day, feels as if it&#x27;s also water resistant,</li>
            <li>the only down side is it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the 24 hour mascaras I am used to, but the effects are worth it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I find it looks a lot better on my lower lashes then my top.</li>
            <li> Okay purchase.</li>
            <li> *seal* it with my favorite mascara</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the top selling brand of 3D mascara, this works just as well.  </li>
            <li> I love it ...</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara volume and length galore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way more inexpensive &amp; shows better in camera.</li>
            <li> love it..</li>
            <li> I love this product it makes my lashes look fuller and longer</li>
            <li> So glad I gave this a shot before paying $30+ on Younique.</li>
            <li> and I could say that I&#x27;m 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> love love</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> it keeps them on better.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I rather pay more for a product than end up with a product that ls not going to work.</li>
            <li> Not the best formula for fiber lashes, I also didn&#x27;t receive the 2 separate sets as stated, I received the 2 same sets.</li>
            <li> Finished with another coat of my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li> but the price is better</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly for special occasions and night outs!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the brush for the gel tube, but I would strongly strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love how easy it was to figure out.</li>
            <li> both good quality thanks i would be ordering again</li>
            <li> This mascara is easy to use 2 step product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Its easy to apply and comes off easily.</li>
            <li> When I first put this on my lashes looked amazing.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I would suggest is that you use your own mascara to start with because my regular mascara has a better lash brush to separate the lashes the fiber brush and mascara brush on these sets arent very good</li>
            <li> For my eyebrows, I apply a light coat of mascara...</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> Since then I feel like I&#x27;m wearing nothing and have beautiful long lashes.</li>
            <li> Super easy to layer</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is far most my favorite fiber mascara &amp; I just love how this product looks more natural .</li>
            <li> Definitely not the good stuff</li>
            <li> I love this product it really works</li>
            <li> Love it does make your lashes look much longer</li>
            <li> Thank you so much :)</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price I paid</li>
            <li> I first bought it for my wedding, it stayed on all day without smearing and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> It works great and is a lot cheaper than other brands.</li>
            <li> Both sets are very pretty on the lashes.</li>
            <li> Really works and comes off easily</li>
            <li> it literally took 20 seconds per eye with instant and incredibly beautiful and natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li> Possibly even better!  </li>
            <li> The product itself works very well and makes my eyes look beautiful and its just as good as the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> I recommend to anyone trying it for first time!</li>
            <li> As advertised and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> The gel mascara is great, but the fibers are super messy.</li>
            <li> and wow it&#x27;s amazing saw instant results I really love</li>
            <li> no irritations &amp; looks more natural than the competitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> This product is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever try so far 🙌🙌, love them both , &amp; I got them earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Gel on first then quickly brush the fibers on.</li>
            <li> right but would recommend.</li>
            <li> I was just trying something new and the price was good enough to warrant a test.</li>
            <li> This is a good product as you get 2 of the sets for half the price of the stuff people are selling around the internet or on FB.</li>
            <li> This works so good just like the expensive younique kind</li>
            <li> My regular mascara works better.  </li>
            <li> Regular drug store mascara works better (for me).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m personally a makeup artist &amp; love seeing the difference.</li>
            <li> I have received multiple compliments on my mascara and even ordered more to share with my friends.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using any of these 3D mascaras</li>
            <li> Buy the real thing, spend the money, how embarrassing!</li>
            <li> fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> I just wasn&#x27;t willing to pay $30+ for the fiber mascara that everyone is selling through Multi level marketing companies.</li>
            <li> I had considered lash extensions but wasn&#x27;t willing to do the upkeep.</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> First I curled my lashes.</li>
            <li> Good delivery time, don&#x27;t apply too heavy or it will flake</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> Second coat made them look bigger and darker and I loved it.</li>
            <li> I would warn that the first time I had a lot of clumping but after a little more practice it looks much more natural..</li>
            <li> The first time I wore I only applied two coats of each and by the first coat I was already seeing a huge difference on eye lash size.</li>
            <li> , I love it and use it everyday, it&#x27;s just as good as Younique 3D mascara,it is a little more goopy but still does the same thing!</li>
            <li> Terrific product, and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> You need to gently wipe the fibers off under your eyes</li>
            <li> The Love Alpha fibers came practically empty</li>
            <li> so I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I have very skinny lashes</li>
            <li> and these didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> one was the real thing</li>
            <li> That alone really extends the length and width of my lashes.</li>
            <li> I really have skimpy lashes and this makes them fuller, longer, darker.  </li>
            <li> Wish it lasted longer... Runs out to fast, have to keep buying it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if i need to just practice, but my eyelashes get really clumpy and they flake</li>
            <li> and I really like the results.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t want to buy the more expensive product and this was a good buy for more than half the price!</li>
            <li> I found this and originally planned on using it to show that knock-off brands weren&#x27;t as good as the expensive</li>
            <li> The price is way better then other brands I have looked at.</li>
            <li> but this just takes it on a whole new level!</li>
            <li> One coat is nice for an everyday look, 2 coats gives me the length I like!</li>
            <li> Flakes and not as easy to use as expected</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the high priced stuff.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to fake lashes.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money and will be buying again in the future!</li>
            <li> This makes my lashes so long and full.</li>
            <li> My lashes look just as good as my friends who wear false lashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping took almost a month, but luckily it came with two sets of tubes so when the first set is gone I can use the second set while the next order ships.</li>
            <li> First day a bit of fiber went inside my left eye</li>
            <li> At first I was confused on how to use it but with practice I love it.</li>
            <li> (I have sensitive eyes, so this is a must)</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well this product works.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much as the price was low and the product comes from China</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> Next I applied a very light coat of my usual mascara.  </li>
            <li> The price compared to other sellers is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Myself as trying this product out as a cutomer: Straight, short, resistant, Asian Lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I barely have any lashes...</li>
            <li> I barely got one use out of it</li>
            <li> One of the tubes of fiber seems to have run out after only one use which is strange but otherwise,  the other container seems full</li>
            <li> I like this product but when I got it one set was damaged but still worked, the Love alpha set was the one that was messed up and the fibers to that set was very hard to open but again useable!</li>
            <li> As good as the expensive ones!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Price is very inexpensive, It applies thinner, doesn&#x27;t get thick, doesn&#x27;t flakes off as much as Younique version, it lasts me all day, feels as if it&#x27;s also water resistant,</li>
            <li> the only down side is it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the 24 hour mascaras I am used to, but the effects are worth it.</li>
            <li> Was delivered when expected,  and quality was exactly what was expected!!</li>
            <li> My friend sells the $30 brand - these are twice as much product for half the price!</li>
            <li> I have very short eye lashes and this stuff makes them so long with out looking like I have on falsies.</li>
            <li> The order took about a month, actually 2 weeks earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my lashes so long &amp; everyone notice that my eyes look brighter</li>
            <li> They only lost a star because of the almost empty fiber tube, I&#x27;d probably buy this again though.</li>
            <li> I like how long they make my lashes, but does nothing for thickness.</li>
            <li> I wear contacts and had no problem, as long as you let the gel dry thoroughly!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , cant even wear my glasses because my lashes are too long!</li>
            <li> But, on the other hand, the price for 4 tubes is really low, indicative for the quality.</li>
            <li> If it was supposed to be applied any differently than other fiber mascara&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I already have very long eye lashes</li>
            <li> It lasted for about 5 applications and then went dry.  </li>
            <li> A little hard to get the hang of, but pretty results.</li>
            <li> my fiber lashes big lashes in less than 60 seconds.</li>
            <li> about a half hour later I went to the bathroom and voila</li>
            <li> You can get same results for half the price at a drug store.</li>
            <li> Instructions were in Chinese, and I was pretty disappointed, because I was expecting the pretty other black mascara tubes.....</li>
            <li> this is my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product for ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend testing a very small amount of the glue and fibers on your lashes to ensure your eyelids don&#x27;t burn, sting, or allergic.</li>
            <li> It does take some getting use to as you have to build up the fiber on the wet lash.</li>
            <li> fiber tubes were actually empty of all fibers, there were none.  </li>
            <li> It came when expected and met expectations.</li>
            <li> Also, be careful, you&#x27;ll get fiber in your eyes.</li>
            <li> It took over 30 days to get the product and then one of the tubes of mink fibers were empty.</li>
            <li> but the other was a cheaper brand from China.</li>
            <li> I wear contacts about 50% of the time and eyeglasses the other 50%.</li>
            <li> I will try the other set and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I let that dry for a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> This product works just as well, if not better for less than a third of the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the mascara base mostly.  </li>
            <li> ill never go back to regular mascara again.</li>
            <li> , black specks all over my face.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin, short lashes, and every mascara product I have ever used either clumped or gotten smeared on the upper lid lash line.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes look so long and thick.</li>
            <li> fibers are always all over my cheeks, the gel wand the smell is a little funky.</li>
            <li> The little fibers it contains  went in my eye as i was applying it, and my eye was irritated for 2 days.</li>
            <li> The little fibers got in my eyes and I kept having to try and get them out.  </li>
            <li> The tubes were a little dried out.</li>
            <li> It takes a few times to get use to.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> It does take a few times to get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> Then I applied the transplant gel in a wiggling side to Sid e motion starting at the base and worked up ,trying not to put too much on the ends of lashes.  </li>
            <li> I was super skeptical because it&#x27;s the less expensive</li>
            <li> When I use this mascara I get little fibers in my eyes and it is irritating all day long.  </li>
            <li> Makes my lashes really long but the fibers fall into my eyes irritating them.</li>
            <li> My neighbor told me about the fiber lashes because I am clumsy with false eyelashes and the individual eyelashes are way too time consuming to put on.  </li>
            <li> I then quickly brushed the fibers on ; again starting at the base and using less on the ends.  </li>
            <li> my lids stung the least little bit about 20 minutes after use of the product, but it was temporary.</li>
            <li> Very little to NO clumping.  </li>
            <li> but I was shocked at how much I like this mascara.  </li>
            <li> my eyes are small...</li>
            <li> not sure how the regulations are,</li>
            <li> I received two sets of flamingo mascara, NOT love alpha mascara as stated in the discretion and picture.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s suppose to be.  </li>
            <li> Some of the fibers does flake on my cheeks a little bit but nothing to dramatic</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d look and see if I can find sonething less expensive...</li>
            <li> Not a good feeling at all.</li>
            <li> I have thin lashes and heard about 3d mascara but refused to pay $40.00-$50.00 to purchase.</li>
            <li> but this makes me look like I am wearing false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I even converted on of my friends to use this product in place of her false lashes.</li>
            <li> Not a good buy, Sorry.  </li>
            <li> Mascara was dried out when I received it :(</li>
            <li> but I was sooo wrong.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with skeptical expectations.</li>
            <li> and maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong.  </li>
            <li> False advertisement!!</li>
            <li> The gel is not so bad which I use now as mascara.  </li>
            <li> this product was very disappointing as it didn&#x27;t have any fibers.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> It extends your lashes but the fibers are annoying and aggravates your eyes</li>
            <li> The fibers tend to come off and cause eye irritation; very bad if you wear contacts.  </li>
            <li> Fibers are nasty in this mascara.</li>
            <li> It is not the worst product but</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love love LOVE my fiber lashes big lashes in less than 60 seconds.</li>
            <li> Was delivered when expected,  and quality was exactly what was expected!!</li>
            <li> This is a good product as you get 2 of the sets for half the price of the stuff people are selling around the internet or on FB. This is a good product and I love to use. It does take some getting use to as you have to build up the fiber on the wet lash. The only thing that I would suggest is that you use your own mascara to start with because my regular mascara has a better lash brush to separate the lashes the fiber brush and mascara brush on these sets arent very good but if I mix the three it turns out great, cant even wear my glasses because my lashes are too long!</li>
            <li> Very happy with product</li>
            <li> These are great.  Th  instructions were in Japanese or something but I got the jest of it. This mascara makes my lashes so long &amp; everyone notice that my eyes look brighter but they dont look fake,clumpy or freaky</li>
            <li> It was okay. Not as amazing as i thought. I find it looks a lot better on my lower lashes then my top. So i think ill stick to my falsies on top. And this on my bottom lashes. Okay purchase.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to wear extensions anymore. Really love this product!</li>
            <li> The best with this product are the nicely designed Tubes. What&#x27;s IN the tubes not so much.&lt;br /&gt;My fiber tubes were actually empty of all fibers, there were none.  I think I got 2 empty ones, old, already used ones, that is.The gel is not so bad which I use now as mascara.  Not a good buy, Sorry.  But, on the other hand, the price for 4 tubes is really low, indicative for the quality.</li>
            <li> When I first put this on my lashes looked amazing. As the day went on, my eyes started to itch and always felt like I had something in them. I later looked in the mirror and noticed that all the fibers had started to fall off my lashed and they were all under my eyes and on my face. I wanted to like this mascara, but it just didn&#x27;t work out. I returned this item.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I was just trying something new and the price was good enough to warrant a test. This mascara is easy to use 2 step product. It has amazing results and does not irritate my eyes. (I have sensitive eyes, so this is a must) the only down side is it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the 24 hour mascaras I am used to, but the effects are worth it.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes really long but the fibers fall into my eyes irritating them. I like the product but wish the fibers wouldn&#x27;t fall off my lashes.</li>
            <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li> Fibers are nasty in this mascara. Definitely not the good stuff</li>
            <li> Of course as we age, our eyelashes AND brows get skimpy.  This product is WONDERFUL!  I apply three coats of the gel and fibers (alternating eyes with each application) and *seal* it with my favorite mascara so the fibers do not fall off.  You need to gently wipe the fibers off under your eyes but this makes me look like I am wearing false eyelashes. For matronly women like myself, eyeliner and these gems make for younger looking eyes.  Very little to NO clumping.  Cannot beat the price.  For my eyebrows, I apply a light coat of mascara...a trick I learned from reading about brow solutions.</li>
            <li> Soooo.... a couple days ago I came across 3D lash product on craigslist for $20 or $30 I think...I never used this before, but in my quest to enhance and upgrade my look  &amp; thought this maybe something great. Being the Amazon junkie that I am I figured I&#x27;d look and see if I can find sonething less expensive... After coming thru products &amp; reading reviews I bought this and read the best way to apply it with a coat of mascara first.... Got it today... tried it today.... OMGoodness!!!! My eyes loook soooooo much better!!! I barely have any lashes... my eyes are small... I&#x27;m soooo happy I tried this... I didnt experience any of the flaking that some people say they have. Absolutely love... will order again!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money and will be buying again in the future!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the top selling brand of 3D mascara, this works just as well.  Possibly even better!  For a fraction of the cost too!!(2 sets for a third of the cost of the Y* brand)</li>
            <li> Looks awesome, easy to apply. As good as the expensive ones!</li>
            <li> I love it ...it make my eye lashes longer</li>
            <li> This stuff works so good. I have very short eye lashes and this stuff makes them so long with out looking like I have on falsies. I highly recommend this product. And way cheaper than Younique!</li>
            <li> The Love Alpha fibers came practically empty (I got two uses from it and it seemed to be gone after that) but I am STILL using the Angel Mask fibers because they seem to be bottomless! The product itself works very well and makes my eyes look beautiful and its just as good as the expensive stuff. Not bad for the price I paid so I really can&#x27;t complain. They only lost a star because of the almost empty fiber tube, I&#x27;d probably buy this again though.</li>
            <li> this product was very disappointing as it didn&#x27;t have any fibers. I barely got one use out of it</li>
            <li> Mascara was dried out when I received it :(</li>
            <li> I love this product. I was super skeptical because it&#x27;s the less expensive but it works great!</li>
            <li> affordable and looks amazing</li>
            <li> One of the tubes of fiber seems to have run out after only one use which is strange but otherwise,  the other container seems full and I do quite like the quality,  especially I&#x27;ll for the price.</li>
            <li> My regular mascara works better.  I have very skinny lashes and these didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever &amp; looks great!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  Regular drug store mascara works better (for me).</li>
            <li> Love this mascara volume and length galore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spend hundreds on mascara over the years and nothing has worked for fullness and length. Until I found this! I honestly will never buy anything else ever!!!! I don&#x27;t love the brush for the gel tube, but I would strongly strongly recommend it. The price is also amazing for what it does.</li>
            <li> Its great!!! It works really good trust me makes you lashes longer just don&#x27;t curl them because the fibers come off</li>
            <li> Myself as trying this product out as a cutomer: Straight, short, resistant, Asian Lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve compared the Younique to this product and I personally prefer using this brand instead. I&#x27;m personally a makeup artist &amp; love seeing the difference. Also my friend who is also a celebrity makeup artist have put this to the test. This is comparing to Younique Vs. these brands. I&#x27;m not affiliated with any company so I&#x27;m just giving you ladies an idea what this product is like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Price is very inexpensive, It applies thinner, doesn&#x27;t get thick, doesn&#x27;t flakes off as much as Younique version, it lasts me all day, feels as if it&#x27;s also water resistant, no irritations &amp; looks more natural than the competitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s from Asia and not sure how the regulations are, But hey it works terrific!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;This is far most my favorite fiber mascara &amp; I just love how this product looks more natural . It&#x27;s way more inexpensive &amp; shows better in camera.</li>
            <li> This mascara is awesome every bit as good as the multi level marketing competitors item. I love how easy it was to figure out. Gel on first then quickly brush the fibers on. I have received multiple compliments on my mascara and even ordered more to share with my friends. I recommend the seller and the product. I would warn that the first time I had a lot of clumping but after a little more practice it looks much more natural.. My lashes come up to my eyebrows now..</li>
            <li> love it..need some practice to &#x27;get the hang of it&#x27;...  super easy to remove!!</li>
            <li> Good delivery time, don&#x27;t apply too heavy or it will flake</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat it !!! I like them both good quality thanks i would be ordering again</li>
            <li> It came when expected and met expectations.</li>
            <li> it is the perfect mascara ! I loved</li>
            <li> Works great had no problems with it!!</li>
            <li> Really good. At first I was confused on how to use it but with practice I love it. My eye lashes look so long and thick.</li>
            <li> I love this!! Both sets are very pretty on the lashes. it&#x27;s so affordable and I don&#x27;t have to put glue on my lashes anymore. Great buy!!!!</li>
            <li> I used to sell Younique products (the company that sells Fiber Lash Mascara for $29 a tube). I found this and originally planned on using it to show that knock-off brands weren&#x27;t as good as the expensive brand- but I was sooo wrong. This product works just as well, if not better for less than a third of the price. I used the product according to the directions and have had no problems with the fibers falling off or being clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took almost a month, but luckily it came with two sets of tubes so when the first set is gone I can use the second set while the next order ships.</li>
            <li> These were awesome.  Just as good as the ones you pay $35.00 for.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t feel like the finer extensions worked well for me</li>
            <li> The tubes of mascara weren&#x27;t what they said they were....one was the real thing but the other was a cheaper brand from China. Instructions were in Chinese, and I was pretty disappointed, because I was expecting the pretty other black mascara tubes.....</li>
            <li> Love these!! Both work well and don&#x27;t leave fibers all over your face.  ill never go back to regular mascara again.</li>
            <li> Instead of 2 tubes of transplanting gel and 2 tubes of fibers, I received one tube of liquid eyeliner. 👎</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Speedy delivery-all the way from China. And two for the price of one?! Fantastic. I think the mascara by itself without the fiber is also a good product. Never bleeds or ends up on my face, stays put all day when applied correctly. Cheaper than regular mascara at the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;Price cannot be beat. I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I love this product it makes my lashes look fuller and longer</li>
            <li> False advertisement!! I received two sets of flamingo mascara, NOT love alpha mascara as stated in the discretion and picture. I will not purchase AGAIN.</li>
            <li> If I could give this no stars I would. Makes your lashes look clumpy and the fibers would fall all over my face and into my eyes. I would save your money on this one.</li>
            <li> my eyelashes are sparse, and this is the only thing for me! I am so happy I discovered it.</li>
            <li> Love love love!! So glad I gave this a shot before paying $30+ on Younique. Try it!</li>
            <li> Product was great wife loved it</li>
            <li> It extends your lashes but the fibers are annoying and aggravates your eyes</li>
            <li> This is my first time using any of these 3D mascaras and I could say that I&#x27;m 100% satisfied. The first time I wore I only applied two coats of each and by the first coat I was already seeing a huge difference on eye lash size. Second coat made them look bigger and darker and I loved it. First day a bit of fiber went inside my left eye but it wasn&#x27;t like a burning pain or anything I just rubbed the edge of my eye a bit and was gone! Since then I feel like I&#x27;m wearing nothing and have beautiful long lashes. The price compared to other sellers is totally worth it. I recommend to anyone trying it for first time! I&#x27;m very happy with mine.. 😄👍</li>
            <li> The tubes were a little dried out. Had to apply a lot of product to see results. Also, the fibers kept falling in my eyes all day. Not a good feeling at all. 2 are for presentation and packaging. Both were good</li>
            <li> Really works and comes off easily</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty awesome.  I&#x27;ve not tried the more expenses brands, so I can&#x27;t compare, but for the money this seems like a great deal.  It takes a bit longer to apply my make up, so I need to set aside time, but I&#x27;m getting used to it.</li>
            <li> Always wanted to try a fiber mascara. I took a chance and bought this. It works, makes lashes appear fuller and longer. The order took about a month, actually 2 weeks earlier than I expected. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I like how long they make my lashes, but does nothing for thickness. Also, be careful, you&#x27;ll get fiber in your eyes.</li>
            <li> I have thin lashes and heard about 3d mascara but refused to pay $40.00-$50.00 to purchase. I did some research on the product and then searched amazon to see what they had to offer. I took a chance and ordered this product not once but twice. I love it. My lashes look just as good as my friends who wear false lashes. It&#x27;s easy to apply and easy to remove. I wear contacts about 50% of the time and eyeglasses the other 50%. I have had no issues and will continue to use this product. I even converted on of my friends to use this product in place of her false lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the mascara base mostly.  The fibers tend to come off and cause eye irritation; very bad if you wear contacts.  Very good quality mascara, though.  That alone really extends the length and width of my lashes.</li>
            <li> As advertised and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> Nice product! Only issue is some fibers fall off under eye a while after application..</li>
            <li> I bought this &amp;#34;cheaper version&amp;#34; because of the reviews.  Followed the directions to the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;... looked great at first but I got to my destination meeting, about a half hour later I went to the bathroom and voila, black specks all over my face.  Buy the real thing, spend the money, how embarrassing!</li>
            <li> fast shipping!  love love</li>
            <li> Love this product. I was surprised at how well this product works.</li>
            <li> A little hard to get the hang of, but pretty results.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much as the price was low and the product comes from China but I was shocked at how much I like this mascara.  I just wasn&#x27;t willing to pay $30+ for the fiber mascara that everyone is selling through Multi level marketing companies. This mascara is amazing and works great.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> Great mascara! One coat is nice for an everyday look, 2 coats gives me the length I like! I use it mostly for special occasions and night outs!</li>
            <li> Flakes and not as easy to use as expected</li>
            <li> Love this!  Works as well as the high priced stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product it really works</li>
            <li> WOW!!!! just.....WOW. I have very thin, short lashes, and every mascara product I have ever used either clumped or gotten smeared on the upper lid lash line. I had marginal results with using a mascara primer. I had considered lash extensions but wasn&#x27;t willing to do the upkeep. I ordered this product with skeptical expectations. it literally took 20 seconds per eye with instant and incredibly beautiful and natural looking lashes. this is my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product for ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend testing a very small amount of the glue and fibers on your lashes to ensure your eyelids don&#x27;t burn, sting, or allergic. my lids stung the least little bit about 20 minutes after use of the product, but it was temporary.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty cool. It does make a difference in the length of my lashes. I recommended this to several friends and family. It takes a few times to get use to. The price is way better then other brands I have looked at.</li>
            <li> When I use this mascara I get little fibers in my eyes and it is irritating all day long.  I can&#x27;t say I would order again.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product! I haven&#x27;t used Younique, but I sure get great results with this product.</li>
            <li> I really have skimpy lashes and this makes them fuller, longer, darker.  It takes some getting used to so don&#x27;t give up.  Watch the videos and practice.  I recommend two coats after the fibers - it keeps them on better.  My friend sells the $30 brand - these are twice as much product for half the price!</li>
            <li> It took over 30 days to get the product and then one of the tubes of mink fibers were empty. Would not recommend to friends and family</li>
            <li> Wish it lasted longer... Runs out to fast, have to keep buying it</li>
            <li> Works very well! Some of the fibers does flake on my cheeks a little bit but nothing to dramatic</li>
            <li> Love this product. Lashes are longer and fuller and it doesn&#x27;t flake or smear. The trick to using the fiber is to tap or blow on the wand before applying after using a coat of mascara. Since I can&#x27;t get eyelash extensions anymore this is the best alternative.  2 mascara and 2 fiber at a great price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Speedy delivery! AA++</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price! Needs some perfecting to get the technique right but would recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if i need to just practice, but my eyelashes get really clumpy and they flake alot.&lt;br /&gt;The fibers are always all over my cheeks, the gel wand the smell is a little funky. It is not the worst product but&lt;br /&gt;its not the best.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara. It gives my eyelash length and thickness.</li>
            <li> Awesome, recommended it to others</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday. Great alternative to fake lashes. I first bought it for my wedding, it stayed on all day without smearing and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> I like this product but when I got it one set was damaged but still worked, the Love alpha set was the one that was messed up and the fibers to that set was very hard to open but again useable! The Angel Mask brand works great, I love it and use it everyday, it&#x27;s just as good as Younique 3D mascara,it is a little more goopy but still does the same thing! Overall I would recommend the product because you can&#x27;t beat it for that price!!</li>
            <li> Love it does make your lashes look much longer</li>
            <li> The BEST mascara I have ever used! I already have very long eye lashes but this just takes it on a whole new level! I totally recommend !!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good buy for the price. The fibers do fall off but not in excess. Its easy to apply and comes off easily.</li>
            <li> Tried this instead of my Younique - and it&#x27;s just as good.</li>
            <li> does not make a difference wont buy ever again</li>
            <li> Second time ordering this product. I love it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the fiber. The little fibers it contains  went in my eye as i was applying it, and my eye was irritated for 2 days. I was told it&#x27;s not supposed to do that from others that have used a similar product. I rather pay more for a product than end up with a product that ls not going to work. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! This makes my lashes so long and full. Super easy to layer and you get two sets for the price of one!</li>
            <li> Not the best formula for fiber lashes, I also didn&#x27;t receive the 2 separate sets as stated, I received the 2 same sets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving three stars because I only have used it twice and maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong.  The little fibers got in my eyes and I kept having to try and get them out.  It came out in big clumps from the tube. Not sure if that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s suppose to be.  I will try the other set and see what happens.</li>
            <li> My neighbor told me about the fiber lashes because I am clumsy with false eyelashes and the individual eyelashes are way too time consuming to put on.  I did not want to spend a great deal of money.  I tried these fiber lashes and they are really great. It does take a few times to get the hang of it.  The following steps worked for me.  First I curled my lashes. Next I applied a very light coat of my usual mascara.  I let that dry for a few seconds.  Then I applied the transplant gel in a wiggling side to Sid e motion starting at the base and worked up ,trying not to put too much on the ends of lashes.  I then quickly brushed the fibers on ; again starting at the base and using less on the ends.  Finished with another coat of my favorite mascara.  You can apply another layer for evening. This is a great value and I really like the results.</li>
            <li> It lasted for about 5 applications and then went dry.  Very disappointing.  You can get same results for half the price at a drug store.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes don&#x27;t look that different and the fibers flake off all day.  If it was supposed to be applied any differently than other fiber mascara&#x27;s I wouldn&#x27;t know because the instructions only come in Japanese.</li>
            <li> Just got the product in yesterday used it this morning and wow it&#x27;s amazing saw instant results I really love it will definitely buy this again !!!!!!</li>
            <li> This works so good just like the expensive younique kind but the price is better</li>
            <li> Terrific product, and easy to apply.  Definitely  gives my lashes that extra &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than extensions. Work well, but be patient. Always apply gel after every layer.</li>
            <li> Works really well. My lashes were fuller and longer. I wear contacts and had no problem, as long as you let the gel dry thoroughly!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to buy the more expensive product and this was a good buy for more than half the price!</li>
            <li> Great works like it suppose to came on time no complaints</li>
            <li> I love it works really good</li>
            <li> Love this!  It works great and is a lot cheaper than other brands.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever try so far 🙌🙌, love them both , &amp; I got them earlier than expected. Thank you so much :)</li>
            <li> The gel mascara is great, but the fibers are super messy. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
