            <li>importantly, I can tell you that Phillips Norelco has excellent customer service.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting a nose trimmer that had a better beard trimmer than my phillips shaver and the nose trimmer is great.</li>
            <li>Best thing to do is to shave the unwanted area first with a razor, then trim it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That is amazing for a product that is so affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What you get for the price is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The cloth pouch is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything fits together nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, I liked this product, rating it 3.5 stars, rounding up to 4.</li>
            <li>the pouch is nice and convenient and keeps everything together.</li>
            <li>I have my own tremors, and use the rotary trimmer to finish off my shaving under my nose.</li>

            <li>I have my own tremors, and use the rotary trimmer to finish off my shaving under my nose.</li>
            <li>best part is the cleaning is easier because this doesn&#x27;t have the rotary blades which get a whole lot of micro-hair and gunk in it.</li>
            <li>He really liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>The travel bag is a nice touch for our RV trips.</li>
            <li>Nice job, Norelco.</li>
            <li>While this trimmer&#x27;s design is novel, I didn&#x27;t find it very effective for the primary task - trimming and removing nose/ear/eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The precision trimmer is a gem and very easy to hold and manipulate in your hand.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smallest comb attachment is suitable for trimming eyebrows to a uniform length.</li>
            <li>work good, just not as smooth as I would like</li>
            <li>The most popular nose-hair trimmer design today is probably the rotary-blade</li>
            <li>I did find it very safe and comfortable to use in the nostrils and ears as well as on the eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Nice that it can be easily cleaned by rinsing under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes with more accessories than I&#x27;ve have the chance to use (or might ever use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the core mission of being able to use the included trimmer to take off the excess hair around the nose, ears, neck, etc.. is a success.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me a bit of time to confidently stick this in either my ear or my nose, and both still take a bit of practice.</li>
            <li>How many things can you say that about?</li>
            <li>It has an interesting feature.</li>
            <li>This one though seems tougher and with the attachments, is a lot more versatile, I can even trim my hair with it.</li>
            <li>And I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it was a portability decision or something but man...</li>
            <li>are my findings in more detail:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This works much better than the plunge type trimmer for me.  </li>
            <li>Still love it though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using it just once - I can say that it is way better than Panasonic on the nose and ear trimmer function.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve returned many trimmers because they yanked out my beard hairs while trimming along my jaw.  </li>
            <li>Better than anything tried before this product.  </li>
            <li>I like this one better than the rotary ones</li>
            <li>I love the way it trims my moustache.</li>
            <li>This unit not only allows you to trim your nose, ears and eyebrows but also provides excellent trimming for beards and sideburns.  </li>
            <li>Works better</li>
            <li>I am glad I took the chance to make the purchase.</li>
            <li>I really like this trim and shape kit, it has all the essentials and is a great value.  </li>
            <li>Considering the low price of the item, that is excellent service.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Wahl lithium ion trimmer is much better for that</li>
            <li>From a functionality point of view, this is the best nose trimmer I had, fit is excellent for nose, eyebrows and ears, it&#x27;s completely painless and does its job as expected.</li>
            <li>the motor is very powerful which makes sure you will get the best trim possible.  </li>
            <li>attachments fit nicely in the cheap plastic tray that is used for shipping.</li>
            <li>and it is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>With regard to the original function, it is outstanding.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning is easy because you can just rinse the trimmer under the tap.  </li>
            <li>all of the attachments go on and off easily once you get them lined</li>
            <li>No pain, easy to use.</li>
            <li>though I think works just fine.</li>
            <li>but it did a fine job keeping my eyebrows uniform</li>
            <li>With the comb, it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Motor runs smooth and with the Philips Lithium battery it runs strong.</li>
            <li>It has a nice carrying case that should make it easy to bring on trips and with all the attachments I feel pretty covered when it comes to clean up</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and seems well put together.</li>
            <li>to use, easy to clean, quiet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use this primarily to keep my wayward eyebrows in check.</li>
            <li>easy to clean and can be used with water in the cleaning process.</li>
            <li>Three Phillips Norelco Trimmers were available for review.</li>
            <li>Three Phillips Norelco Trimmers were available for review.</li>
            <li>Not a deal-breaker, but mighty nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The NT5175/42 is fantastic trimmer.</li>
            <li>I also think the 5175 is a bit more powerful.</li>
            <li>This trimmer makes daily maintenance a joy.  </li>
            <li>My old trimmer worked good but every once in a while when trimming my nose it would nick the outer edge of my nose.  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;Tube Shave&amp;#34; trimmer it trims well, is comfortable, easy to clean, and comes with some very useful attachments.</li>
            <li>Attachments are included for trimming other parts of the face and for that it works very good</li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s been a recent overgrowth on the eyebrows and the eyebrows are growing together the attached combs are also very handy.  </li>
            <li>But I haven&#x27;t a lot of time these days, I&#x27;m also getting older and the nasal hairs are upping their proliferation, and I really liked the idea that this trimmer had a blunt end</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that it came with the first battery</li>
            <li>I have had my original for a couple  years now, and this one appears idnentical.  </li>
            <li>It seems to cut clean without pulling .</li>
            <li>I am also weirded out by the fact that to clean it</li>
            <li>It comes with a cleaning brush and can be run under water, so clean up is a snap.</li>
            <li>(Yes, you can rinse them in the sink and clean them)  </li>
            <li>The carrying pouch tops it all off to help keep everything together and clean.</li>
            <li>This device is pleasant to use overall, and true to the marketing, I did not experience any pulling sensations.</li>
            <li>it comes with a special nonrechargeable lithium type battery</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life seems to be pretty good so far</li>
            <li>but honestly I can&#x27;t see a difference between this and my old Panasonic.</li>
            <li>~ they&#x27;re fast, they&#x27;re safe, and the results are</li>
            <li>Since it is constantly being borrowed by the wife, and now the teenager in my house, I thought another would be a good idea.  </li>
            <li>Norelco stays true to their history of quality products.  </li>
            <li>It is worthy of consideration.</li>
            <li>Plus with all its accessories, it just adds to the getting the job done efficiently and in quick time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>adapters are adequate.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apart from the tray, the materials, fit, and finish appear to be first rate.</li>
            <li>Oh, and I threw the prior excuse of a trimmer away, happily!!</li>
            <li>Very portable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d used another Norelco in the past and found that it really does the best job.  </li>
            <li>Wonderfully, it is fully washable, and I let it air dry outside the bathroom and away from germs, so I like the hygienic value.</li>
            <li>Just wish it was rechargeable.ring on trips and with all the attachments I feel pretty covered when it comes to clean up grooming.  </li>
            <li>Great little trimmer for scaredy cats like me.</li>
            <li>This is a great little trimmer kit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only does it do a fantastic job with nose hairs but the attachments make it easy to clean up eyebrows and sideburns or edging up a beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have liked to have an attachment that cut to a slightly smaller length.</li>
            <li>&amp; Commentary:&lt;br /&gt;► A third trimmer head that allows trimming finer hairs close to the skin would be nice (the ones that are shaped like razor</li>
            <li>Powerful motor and waterproof.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll just have to continue to use the pop-up trimmer on my electric razor for this stuff, as this device just isn&#x27;t worth the effort.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>the other features work good but not as well as the noes hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now of the age where nose and ear hair are becoming more of a reality than I&#x27;d ever really thought possible.  </li>
            <li>so I could use it right away.</li>
            <li>And then there is a beard trimmer, that is fantastic on sideburns, neck hair, or pretty much anywhere else</li>
            <li>▲ Appears to be made of decent quality materials (primarily plastic with some metal)&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Because it cuts better, when I use the bare blade</li>
            <li>Hence, it is clear that their whole plan is to provide a useful tool that a customer will rely on, make it very cheap and brittle so that it will soon break, then leave the customer with no alternative but to replace the whole unit!</li>
            <li>I never get it right unless I look first.  </li>
            <li>Have only tried the nose trimmer so far, but that seems to work good.  </li>
            <li>The long comb was much more effective for my eyebrows than the short.</li>

            <li>The long comb was much more effective for my eyebrows than the short.</li>
            <li>The blades, however are pretty fine and using it to cut edges without the comb can irritate the skin more than other options I have for that purpose.</li>
            <li>Lastly and very important to note</li>
            <li>Philips does not specify a part number to re-order new blades or tips ~ sure, the price is modest and buying a new unit after a few years is certainly economically feasible for most people, but this kind of practice is quite wasteful.&lt;br</li>

            <li>but it&#x27;s been fine so far.</li>
            <li>It’s not short and rounded like most trimmers.</li>
            <li>At first I thought maybe it was because it doesn&#x27;t trim as close</li>
            <li>first Phillips Norelco Trimmer up for review is the Philips Norelco</li>
            <li>first Phillips Norelco Trimmer up for review is the Philips Norelco</li>
            <li>pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it one star, but the more standard trimmer/shaver attachments are functional to an extent.</li>
            <li>First one that has worked well.</li>
            <li>this one is a better value, if you think you might use only one or two of the attachments.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that it&#x27;s got to be standard practice.  </li>
            <li>We have the more basic version of this without the interchangeable heads and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>Much more importantly, the blades on both the nose/ear and detail attachments are very sharp but do not pull, tug or scrape in any way.  </li>
            <li>The more I used it, though, the less comfortable it became to use.</li>
            <li>This item has decreased my morning bathroom routine time by a good ten minutes while taking up minimal space, so I&#x27;m pleased, and the package is so compact and well designed that, overall, it would make a marvelous gift</li>
            <li>Four stars because has difficulty removing some of the nose hairs...have to really work to get the right angle.</li>
            <li>I tried a manual one (didn’t work, only caused pain), an electric one by Panasonic (inconsistent speed), another cheap one (quickly quit working), and one made by Toilet Tree Products (my favorite).</li>
            <li>The short comb works well (though I&#x27;d love it to be slightly shorter), then I use it with no comb to tidy up the tops.</li>
            <li>But what makes this trimmer even more useful are the additional attachments that expands its clipping ability to other hirsute regions of your body.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is an attachment that is suitable for sideburns and other top-of-head tasks and it is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I estimate that single alkaline battery should be good for ~2 hours while a lithium cell should last between 5-6 hours.</li>
            <li>I estimate that single alkaline battery should be good for ~2 hours while a lithium cell should last between 5-6 hours.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes a bit of getting used to and at first I couldn&#x27;t get a decent trim with it</li>
            <li>The blades move at a very high speed and it cuts well.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little trimmer.</li>
            <li>Better quality than I expected.</li>
            <li>No thin or brittle parts.</li>
            <li>I really like this trimmer and will be keeping it with me.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this product.  </li>
            <li>The design and implementation really work for me</li>
            <li>it trims nose hair very well and doesn&#x27;t pinch.</li>
            <li>I said as much to the customer service rep, who could not disagree.  </li>
            <li>As nose hairs go, electric trimmers really are the way to go</li>
            <li>You can really get up in there and prune the thicket.  </li>
            <li>Beyond that, it really does the job.</li>
            <li>It works very well in the nose and on the eyebrows with the included combs.</li>
            <li>This personal trimmer is light but sturdy, and the rubberized surface allows for a steady grip.  </li>
            <li>This gadget includes several attachments that are suitable for use on nose, eyebrows, beard, moustache, and possibly ears.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&gt;▲ Has a nice heft to it, considering how small it is, and  has</li>
            <li>so for nose trimming, it works in less than 10-15 seconds while the Panasonic took more than 45 secs to 1 min&lt;br</li>
            <li>The main attachment (slender tube) is of a design that I have not seen before.</li>
            <li>I use it for ear hair mainly.</li>
            <li>I received an &amp;#34;Norelco NT5175 Trimmer/Shaper&amp;#34; via the Vine Program to evaluate, and found it to be well thought out, of decent construction and easy to use...with some areas that could be improved upon (but certainly not deal-breakers!)&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, as my husband loves it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My nose and ears are lean ans mean and super clean!</li>
            <li>This design keeps the blades away from your skin (although if you really try hard, you can cause some abrasion, but that really only occurs from over doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The angled tip, and overall design is simply the best for nose trimming and works well for ears too.  </li>
            <li>It does not include as many attachments, though there are quite a few.</li>
            <li>I have to insert, then move the trimmer to touch my inner nose edges, and kind of push the trimmer around the inner perimeter of my nose, which is somewhat like using two mirrors to trim hair on the back of your neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall for all hairy guys, this is worth your money for all those pesky places that hair grows out of.</li>
            <li>I tested this new baby with both alkaline and rechargable AA&#x27;s and found it works well with them.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, it&#x27;s a solid competitor to the Remington, the only other trimmer I&#x27;ve liked this much.</li>
            <li>decent product so far</li>
            <li>Does the job pretty thoroughly and quietly.  </li>
            <li>Overall - this is why I would rate this higher than a panasonic:&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>
            <li>It definitely makes a higher pitched whirring noise than does the 9110.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about the battery.</li>
            <li>, petite, everything fits neatly into a little bag that&#x27;s easy to store.</li>
            <li>I ignore reviews about being too loud, as when you are trimming hair around or in your ears, the sound is naturally louder due to proximity.  </li>
            <li>It works exactly the same as the other version, and it might even cut a little better as it seems to move the blades at a higher speed.</li>
            <li>The trimmer certainly does not pull or cut as advertised when you are able to get it to trim a hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to replicate the drawn instructions for the nose is frustrating.</li>
            <li>but I guess for how little I use it a battery is probably better, since it would just sit on the charger all the time and possibly wear out the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for something a little more \\&quot;robust\\&quot; and especially if you want a beard trimmer, then I would recommend the Wahl 5537-1801 shown below.  </li>
            <li>So the clean up is easier and less</li>
            <li>and I needed a trimmer to help with it since pulling it out with tweezers hurt why to much and spent too much time to get done.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was pleasantly surprised that the included battery is of the lithium type.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d choose it heads and tails over the old spinning blade nose and ear trimmers.</li>
            <li>I use Eneloop rechargeable batteries with my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>as well as cut any \\&quot;wild</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with \\&quot;pulls\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Used it for ear, nose, and eyebrows so far.</li>
            <li>, it is very convenient and simple to use.  </li>
            <li>It does as good a job as my tedious manual approach did, and in a tenth of the time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seriously not going back to those.</li>
            <li>It still works great on the ears, but this version seems to be louder with a higher pitch to the tone that is a bit annoying.  </li>
            <li>I just hope the new model has resolved the issue with the old model stop working after a short while.</li>
            <li>The instructions were very complete and written in clear English.</li>
            <li>~ that particular model didn&#x27;t work well because it had to be flat against the skin to cut anything and</li>
            <li>(as I age, I&#x27;m trying to avoid getting those crazy brows that Larry Hagman seemed so proud of in his later years).&lt;br</li>
            <li>The buzzing noise is loud enough to bother a user with sensitive hearing when using the trimmer for ear hair</li>
            <li>I find that cutting a full ear of hair isn&#x27;t a problem, but a touch up during the week - just to get that one stray hair - is not as easy as I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>like that the Norelco comes with a little bag to store everything and a brush that not only helps clean the device and attachments, but also can push eyebrows up</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the detail trimmer doesn&#x27;t seem quite as precise as the Remington NE3560, or perhaps the blade isn&#x27;t positioned as close to the edge, thus forcing the user to compensate by going slightly past the line.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still too young to need this for trimming facial hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely the complete shebang and</li>
            <li>also have tried a different design, with a circular head, but that one frequently gave me abrasion.  </li>
            <li>Philips Norelco’s nose trimmer does an effective job trimming this unsightly, and often uncomfortable, hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look nice and it&#x27;s uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t trim a beard as close as the Wahl, but neither is really good at cutting the beard hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Batteries do not last very long - I&#x27;d certainly prefer an LI rechargeable</li>
            <li>I found the extra head for beard trimming to be less useful.</li>
            <li>Very solid built, strong motor that doesn&#x27;t slow when it nears hair out of fear and the accessories are all well designed.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it should, and for half the price of another brand I tried that would not even turn on.  </li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s lightweight and small dimensions make for economical shipping.</li>
            <li>main attachment is a slender tube that you can use for nose hair, among other things.</li>
            <li>only complaint about this unit is that it&#x27;s not designed for the long haul ~ while the replaceable batteries are nice, once the blades wear down, you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>only complaint about this unit is that it&#x27;s not designed for the long haul ~ while the replaceable batteries are nice, once the blades wear down, you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>Same company, same general purpose...</li>
            <li>~ they&#x27;re great for cutting nose hair, but due to the design, you generally won&#x27;t find attachments for doing other kinds of trimming such as sideburns, etc.&lt;br</li>

            <li> importantly, I can tell you that Phillips Norelco has excellent customer service.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a nose trimmer that had a better beard trimmer than my phillips shaver and the nose trimmer is great.</li>
            <li> Best thing to do is to shave the unwanted area first with a razor, then trim it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That is amazing for a product that is so affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What you get for the price is amazing.  </li>
            <li> The cloth pouch is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything fits together nicely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, I liked this product, rating it 3.5 stars, rounding up to 4.</li>
            <li> the pouch is nice and convenient and keeps everything together.</li>
            <li> I have my own tremors, and use the rotary trimmer to finish off my shaving under my nose.</li>

            <li> I have my own tremors, and use the rotary trimmer to finish off my shaving under my nose.</li>
            <li> best part is the cleaning is easier because this doesn&#x27;t have the rotary blades which get a whole lot of micro-hair and gunk in it.</li>
            <li> He really liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> The travel bag is a nice touch for our RV trips.</li>
            <li> Nice job, Norelco.</li>
            <li> While this trimmer&#x27;s design is novel, I didn&#x27;t find it very effective for the primary task - trimming and removing nose/ear/eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The precision trimmer is a gem and very easy to hold and manipulate in your hand.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smallest comb attachment is suitable for trimming eyebrows to a uniform length.</li>
            <li> work good, just not as smooth as I would like</li>
            <li> The most popular nose-hair trimmer design today is probably the rotary-blade</li>
            <li> I did find it very safe and comfortable to use in the nostrils and ears as well as on the eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Nice that it can be easily cleaned by rinsing under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes with more accessories than I&#x27;ve have the chance to use (or might ever use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the core mission of being able to use the included trimmer to take off the excess hair around the nose, ears, neck, etc.. is a success.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me a bit of time to confidently stick this in either my ear or my nose, and both still take a bit of practice.</li>
            <li> How many things can you say that about?</li>
            <li> It has an interesting feature.</li>
            <li> This one though seems tougher and with the attachments, is a lot more versatile, I can even trim my hair with it.</li>
            <li> And I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it was a portability decision or something but man...</li>
            <li> are my findings in more detail:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This works much better than the plunge type trimmer for me.  </li>
            <li> Still love it though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it just once - I can say that it is way better than Panasonic on the nose and ear trimmer function.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve returned many trimmers because they yanked out my beard hairs while trimming along my jaw.  </li>
            <li> Better than anything tried before this product.  </li>
            <li> I like this one better than the rotary ones</li>
            <li> I love the way it trims my moustache.</li>
            <li> This unit not only allows you to trim your nose, ears and eyebrows but also provides excellent trimming for beards and sideburns.  </li>
            <li> Works better</li>
            <li> I am glad I took the chance to make the purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like this trim and shape kit, it has all the essentials and is a great value.  </li>
            <li> Considering the low price of the item, that is excellent service.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Wahl lithium ion trimmer is much better for that</li>
            <li> From a functionality point of view, this is the best nose trimmer I had, fit is excellent for nose, eyebrows and ears, it&#x27;s completely painless and does its job as expected.</li>
            <li> the motor is very powerful which makes sure you will get the best trim possible.  </li>
            <li> attachments fit nicely in the cheap plastic tray that is used for shipping.</li>
            <li> and it is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> With regard to the original function, it is outstanding.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning is easy because you can just rinse the trimmer under the tap.  </li>
            <li> all of the attachments go on and off easily once you get them lined</li>
            <li> No pain, easy to use.</li>
            <li> though I think works just fine.</li>
            <li> but it did a fine job keeping my eyebrows uniform</li>
            <li> With the comb, it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Motor runs smooth and with the Philips Lithium battery it runs strong.</li>
            <li> It has a nice carrying case that should make it easy to bring on trips and with all the attachments I feel pretty covered when it comes to clean up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and seems well put together.</li>
            <li> to use, easy to clean, quiet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use this primarily to keep my wayward eyebrows in check.</li>
            <li> easy to clean and can be used with water in the cleaning process.</li>
            <li> Three Phillips Norelco Trimmers were available for review.</li>
            <li> Three Phillips Norelco Trimmers were available for review.</li>
            <li> Not a deal-breaker, but mighty nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The NT5175/42 is fantastic trimmer.</li>
            <li> I also think the 5175 is a bit more powerful.</li>
            <li> This trimmer makes daily maintenance a joy.  </li>
            <li> My old trimmer worked good but every once in a while when trimming my nose it would nick the outer edge of my nose.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;Tube Shave&amp;#34; trimmer it trims well, is comfortable, easy to clean, and comes with some very useful attachments.</li>
            <li> Attachments are included for trimming other parts of the face and for that it works very good</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s been a recent overgrowth on the eyebrows and the eyebrows are growing together the attached combs are also very handy.  </li>
            <li> But I haven&#x27;t a lot of time these days, I&#x27;m also getting older and the nasal hairs are upping their proliferation, and I really liked the idea that this trimmer had a blunt end</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that it came with the first battery</li>
            <li> I have had my original for a couple  years now, and this one appears idnentical.  </li>
            <li> It seems to cut clean without pulling .</li>
            <li> I am also weirded out by the fact that to clean it</li>
            <li> It comes with a cleaning brush and can be run under water, so clean up is a snap.</li>
            <li> (Yes, you can rinse them in the sink and clean them)  </li>
            <li> The carrying pouch tops it all off to help keep everything together and clean.</li>
            <li> This device is pleasant to use overall, and true to the marketing, I did not experience any pulling sensations.</li>
            <li> it comes with a special nonrechargeable lithium type battery</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life seems to be pretty good so far</li>
            <li> but honestly I can&#x27;t see a difference between this and my old Panasonic.</li>
            <li> ~ they&#x27;re fast, they&#x27;re safe, and the results are</li>
            <li> Since it is constantly being borrowed by the wife, and now the teenager in my house, I thought another would be a good idea.  </li>
            <li> Norelco stays true to their history of quality products.  </li>
            <li> It is worthy of consideration.</li>
            <li> Plus with all its accessories, it just adds to the getting the job done efficiently and in quick time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> adapters are adequate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apart from the tray, the materials, fit, and finish appear to be first rate.</li>
            <li> Oh, and I threw the prior excuse of a trimmer away, happily!!</li>
            <li> Very portable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d used another Norelco in the past and found that it really does the best job.  </li>
            <li> Wonderfully, it is fully washable, and I let it air dry outside the bathroom and away from germs, so I like the hygienic value.</li>
            <li> Just wish it was rechargeable.ring on trips and with all the attachments I feel pretty covered when it comes to clean up grooming.  </li>
            <li> Great little trimmer for scaredy cats like me.</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer kit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only does it do a fantastic job with nose hairs but the attachments make it easy to clean up eyebrows and sideburns or edging up a beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have liked to have an attachment that cut to a slightly smaller length.</li>
            <li> &amp; Commentary:&lt;br /&gt;► A third trimmer head that allows trimming finer hairs close to the skin would be nice (the ones that are shaped like razor</li>
            <li> Powerful motor and waterproof.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll just have to continue to use the pop-up trimmer on my electric razor for this stuff, as this device just isn&#x27;t worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> the other features work good but not as well as the noes hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now of the age where nose and ear hair are becoming more of a reality than I&#x27;d ever really thought possible.  </li>
            <li> so I could use it right away.</li>
            <li> And then there is a beard trimmer, that is fantastic on sideburns, neck hair, or pretty much anywhere else</li>
            <li> ▲ Appears to be made of decent quality materials (primarily plastic with some metal)&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Because it cuts better, when I use the bare blade</li>
            <li> Hence, it is clear that their whole plan is to provide a useful tool that a customer will rely on, make it very cheap and brittle so that it will soon break, then leave the customer with no alternative but to replace the whole unit!</li>
            <li> I never get it right unless I look first.  </li>
            <li> Have only tried the nose trimmer so far, but that seems to work good.  </li>
            <li> The long comb was much more effective for my eyebrows than the short.</li>

            <li> The long comb was much more effective for my eyebrows than the short.</li>
            <li> The blades, however are pretty fine and using it to cut edges without the comb can irritate the skin more than other options I have for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Lastly and very important to note</li>
            <li> Philips does not specify a part number to re-order new blades or tips ~ sure, the price is modest and buying a new unit after a few years is certainly economically feasible for most people, but this kind of practice is quite wasteful.&lt;br</li>

            <li> but it&#x27;s been fine so far.</li>
            <li> It’s not short and rounded like most trimmers.</li>
            <li> At first I thought maybe it was because it doesn&#x27;t trim as close</li>
            <li> first Phillips Norelco Trimmer up for review is the Philips Norelco</li>
            <li> first Phillips Norelco Trimmer up for review is the Philips Norelco</li>
            <li> pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it one star, but the more standard trimmer/shaver attachments are functional to an extent.</li>
            <li> First one that has worked well.</li>
            <li> this one is a better value, if you think you might use only one or two of the attachments.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure that it&#x27;s got to be standard practice.  </li>
            <li> We have the more basic version of this without the interchangeable heads and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Much more importantly, the blades on both the nose/ear and detail attachments are very sharp but do not pull, tug or scrape in any way.  </li>
            <li> The more I used it, though, the less comfortable it became to use.</li>
            <li> This item has decreased my morning bathroom routine time by a good ten minutes while taking up minimal space, so I&#x27;m pleased, and the package is so compact and well designed that, overall, it would make a marvelous gift</li>
            <li> Four stars because has difficulty removing some of the nose hairs...have to really work to get the right angle.</li>
            <li> I tried a manual one (didn’t work, only caused pain), an electric one by Panasonic (inconsistent speed), another cheap one (quickly quit working), and one made by Toilet Tree Products (my favorite).</li>
            <li> The short comb works well (though I&#x27;d love it to be slightly shorter), then I use it with no comb to tidy up the tops.</li>
            <li> But what makes this trimmer even more useful are the additional attachments that expands its clipping ability to other hirsute regions of your body.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is an attachment that is suitable for sideburns and other top-of-head tasks and it is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I estimate that single alkaline battery should be good for ~2 hours while a lithium cell should last between 5-6 hours.</li>
            <li> I estimate that single alkaline battery should be good for ~2 hours while a lithium cell should last between 5-6 hours.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a bit of getting used to and at first I couldn&#x27;t get a decent trim with it</li>
            <li> The blades move at a very high speed and it cuts well.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little trimmer.</li>
            <li> Better quality than I expected.</li>
            <li> No thin or brittle parts.</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer and will be keeping it with me.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this product.  </li>
            <li> The design and implementation really work for me</li>
            <li> it trims nose hair very well and doesn&#x27;t pinch.</li>
            <li> I said as much to the customer service rep, who could not disagree.  </li>
            <li> As nose hairs go, electric trimmers really are the way to go</li>
            <li> You can really get up in there and prune the thicket.  </li>
            <li> Beyond that, it really does the job.</li>
            <li> It works very well in the nose and on the eyebrows with the included combs.</li>
            <li> This personal trimmer is light but sturdy, and the rubberized surface allows for a steady grip.  </li>
            <li> This gadget includes several attachments that are suitable for use on nose, eyebrows, beard, moustache, and possibly ears.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &gt;▲ Has a nice heft to it, considering how small it is, and  has</li>
            <li> so for nose trimming, it works in less than 10-15 seconds while the Panasonic took more than 45 secs to 1 min&lt;br</li>
            <li> The main attachment (slender tube) is of a design that I have not seen before.</li>
            <li> I use it for ear hair mainly.</li>
            <li> I received an &amp;#34;Norelco NT5175 Trimmer/Shaper&amp;#34; via the Vine Program to evaluate, and found it to be well thought out, of decent construction and easy to use...with some areas that could be improved upon (but certainly not deal-breakers!)&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, as my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My nose and ears are lean ans mean and super clean!</li>
            <li> This design keeps the blades away from your skin (although if you really try hard, you can cause some abrasion, but that really only occurs from over doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The angled tip, and overall design is simply the best for nose trimming and works well for ears too.  </li>
            <li> It does not include as many attachments, though there are quite a few.</li>
            <li> I have to insert, then move the trimmer to touch my inner nose edges, and kind of push the trimmer around the inner perimeter of my nose, which is somewhat like using two mirrors to trim hair on the back of your neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall for all hairy guys, this is worth your money for all those pesky places that hair grows out of.</li>
            <li> I tested this new baby with both alkaline and rechargable AA&#x27;s and found it works well with them.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, it&#x27;s a solid competitor to the Remington, the only other trimmer I&#x27;ve liked this much.</li>
            <li> decent product so far</li>
            <li> Does the job pretty thoroughly and quietly.  </li>
            <li> Overall - this is why I would rate this higher than a panasonic:&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>
            <li> It definitely makes a higher pitched whirring noise than does the 9110.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about the battery.</li>
            <li> , petite, everything fits neatly into a little bag that&#x27;s easy to store.</li>
            <li> I ignore reviews about being too loud, as when you are trimming hair around or in your ears, the sound is naturally louder due to proximity.  </li>
            <li> It works exactly the same as the other version, and it might even cut a little better as it seems to move the blades at a higher speed.</li>
            <li> The trimmer certainly does not pull or cut as advertised when you are able to get it to trim a hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to replicate the drawn instructions for the nose is frustrating.</li>
            <li> but I guess for how little I use it a battery is probably better, since it would just sit on the charger all the time and possibly wear out the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for something a little more \\&quot;robust\\&quot; and especially if you want a beard trimmer, then I would recommend the Wahl 5537-1801 shown below.  </li>
            <li> So the clean up is easier and less</li>
            <li> and I needed a trimmer to help with it since pulling it out with tweezers hurt why to much and spent too much time to get done.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised that the included battery is of the lithium type.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d choose it heads and tails over the old spinning blade nose and ear trimmers.</li>
            <li> I use Eneloop rechargeable batteries with my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> as well as cut any \\&quot;wild</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with \\&quot;pulls\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Used it for ear, nose, and eyebrows so far.</li>
            <li> , it is very convenient and simple to use.  </li>
            <li> It does as good a job as my tedious manual approach did, and in a tenth of the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously not going back to those.</li>
            <li> It still works great on the ears, but this version seems to be louder with a higher pitch to the tone that is a bit annoying.  </li>
            <li> I just hope the new model has resolved the issue with the old model stop working after a short while.</li>
            <li> The instructions were very complete and written in clear English.</li>
            <li> ~ that particular model didn&#x27;t work well because it had to be flat against the skin to cut anything and</li>
            <li> (as I age, I&#x27;m trying to avoid getting those crazy brows that Larry Hagman seemed so proud of in his later years).&lt;br</li>
            <li> The buzzing noise is loud enough to bother a user with sensitive hearing when using the trimmer for ear hair</li>
            <li> I find that cutting a full ear of hair isn&#x27;t a problem, but a touch up during the week - just to get that one stray hair - is not as easy as I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> like that the Norelco comes with a little bag to store everything and a brush that not only helps clean the device and attachments, but also can push eyebrows up</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the detail trimmer doesn&#x27;t seem quite as precise as the Remington NE3560, or perhaps the blade isn&#x27;t positioned as close to the edge, thus forcing the user to compensate by going slightly past the line.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still too young to need this for trimming facial hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely the complete shebang and</li>
            <li> also have tried a different design, with a circular head, but that one frequently gave me abrasion.  </li>
            <li> Philips Norelco’s nose trimmer does an effective job trimming this unsightly, and often uncomfortable, hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look nice and it&#x27;s uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t trim a beard as close as the Wahl, but neither is really good at cutting the beard hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Batteries do not last very long - I&#x27;d certainly prefer an LI rechargeable</li>
            <li> I found the extra head for beard trimming to be less useful.</li>
            <li> Very solid built, strong motor that doesn&#x27;t slow when it nears hair out of fear and the accessories are all well designed.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it should, and for half the price of another brand I tried that would not even turn on.  </li>
            <li> ; it&#x27;s lightweight and small dimensions make for economical shipping.</li>
            <li> main attachment is a slender tube that you can use for nose hair, among other things.</li>
            <li> only complaint about this unit is that it&#x27;s not designed for the long haul ~ while the replaceable batteries are nice, once the blades wear down, you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> only complaint about this unit is that it&#x27;s not designed for the long haul ~ while the replaceable batteries are nice, once the blades wear down, you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> Same company, same general purpose...</li>
            <li> ~ they&#x27;re great for cutting nose hair, but due to the design, you generally won&#x27;t find attachments for doing other kinds of trimming such as sideburns, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The two trimmer heads (ear/nose and beard) are oriented completely the opposite of each other; ie, they curve 180 degrees away from each other...which is counter-intuitive and can lead to improper installation when switching heads on the fly.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> As long as you use it correctly (rotate it around the inside and make several passes)</li>
            <li> It also comes with a AA lithium battery--lithium technology, long and short eyebrow combs, plus a beard comb, cleaning brush, and a carrying pouch.</li>

            <li> ~ it&#x27;s an obsolete, flat oscillating-blade design</li>
            <li> In use, the trimming experience is nearly as convenient as a dedicated rotary-blade trimmer, though it still takes longer and requires some practice to get the movements down.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I have encountered damage from every major brand of alkaline cells, including Energizer and Duracell.</li>
            <li> Due to the design, the same hair can be cut multiple times, leaving tiny dust-sized hair particles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not have a beard and so could not test the beard comb, but having had a beard and having gone through a number of beard trimmers, I find it hard to believe this attachment is of much use.</li>

            <li> This thing is comfortable and reaches all those weird spots in nose and ears (wash before entering each!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; on nose hairs like other units and gets every last one...painlessly.</li>
            <li> You twist one way to turn it on and the other way to open the case to change the battery.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, solid product.</li>
            <li> I’ve had a hard time finding a decent nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have bought several smaller trimmers and they always break within a few months.</li>
            <li> heavy duty batteries will not damage this device, they might only last half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> heavy duty batteries will not damage this device, they might only last half an hour.</li>
            <li> like that it runs on just a single battery, but not confident that it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> but here&#x27;s the thing, since it doesn&#x27;t have the standard spinning blades inside a little compartment</li>
            <li> &#x27;s is cheaper, equally sturdy and cuts a little closer.</li>
            <li> a result, I will not only forego replacing a unit that otherwise works very well, but am unlikely to purchase another philips product.</li>
            <li> The blades appear to be exposed, but they are really not.</li>

            <li> then I expected.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old nose and ear trimmer is slowly dying and what we have here is a Norelco product that promises to do it all and</li>
            <li> It could be a little quieter - sounds just like a man&#x27;s razor, but it&#x27;s not on for long while using, so it&#x27;s not really</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d always been reluctant to try a motorized nose trimmer, instead spending long sessions in front of the mirror with little scissors and a tweezer (ouch) to make the nasal passages presentable.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t collect all the hair and... shmutz like other trimmers do.</li>
            <li> have 3 other trimmers, all rechargeable, waterproof, etc.</li>
            <li> (that didn&#x27;t work out well at all), and I later graduated to using small, sharp scissors (though I always felt a bit nervous using them).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read other reviews where someone had not rinsed this post usage</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it for other hair areas, so</li>
            <li> I refer you to other reviews for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This version adds a small trimmer head that can be used for slightly larger jobs.  </li>
            <li> I contacted them and they sent me a new one, together with packaging to return the broken one.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the plastic eyebrow combs (which regulate the length you trim your eyebrows to) are very brittle and within a dozen or so uses, the teeth were breaking off, forcing me to be careful, lest I shave a part of an eyebrow</li>
            <li> Interestingly enough, this acquisition began seeing a late night TV ad for The &amp;#34;Micro Touch Max&amp;#34; hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> He has disliked similar devices in the past because they tickle.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve discovered the unpleasant fact that my once well-behaved nose hairs now require regular trimming...</li>
            <li> It will have paid for itself in less than two months.  </li>
            <li> I got this after having issues with the previous model, breaking up after a couple months use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Norelco&#x27;s is gentler, so there&#x27;s less irritation and tugging.</li>
            <li> like that it is battery operated and has no cords to mess with and that it came with a pouch to hold all the parts in.</li>
            <li> It will trim ear and nose hair like a champ, plus with the small attachments it will weed whack those out of control eyebrows and other pesky hairs down to a manageable length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d look like a tufted bobcat without this little tool.  </li>

            <li> The Philips Norelco NT5175/42 5100 Nose Trimmer is different in that the trimmer part is long with an exposed cutting component.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it to trim my moustache, but it also does well at cutting my nose hairs.</li>
            <li> The part that took the longest was cleaning the little pieces of cut hair in my nose!</li>
            <li> so it would be unlikely for me to hurt myself way up in the passages.&lt;br /&gt;The unit is solid</li>
            <li> Philips has a small separate instructional leaflet that explicitly instructs users to rotate the device wile trimming nose/ear hairs, and to rinse the blades out when the device is in the on-position.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the cap allows the blade to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 7 years ago, I purchased an earlier version of this trimmer, and it failed soon after purchase.  </li>
            <li> you are in the need for one of these, and lets face it, EVERYONE needs one of these at least occasionally, then you cant go wrong here.</li>
            <li> This battery formulation is relatively dry and is unlikely to leak and foul up the trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a little bit less expensive than the Norelco 5100 and comes with a nose / ear trimmer as well, though it is the rotary</li>
            <li> The cutter blades are not replaceable, so you to discard the product when the blades get dull.</li>
            <li> The blade is well protected from nicking delicate areas.</li>
            <li> My one negative is the fact that it takes both hands to turn it on and off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they made it that inconvenient when a simple slide switch would have been a lot easier.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked online for replacement parts, as this must be a common experience, but found none.  </li>
            <li> , I find myself using the sideburn trimmer at least once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re serious.  </li>
            <li> useless, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Nothing is worse than an abundance of nasal or ear hair.  </li>
            <li> I really hate such marketing practices and the companies that use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m not happy with the Lithium lifespan I will feed it Eneloops.</li>
            <li> After years of owning poorly built trimmers that feel like they are held together with rubber bands, I wish I would have found this sooner.</li>
            <li> There is nothing worse than finding a nose hair hanging out during a conversation with coworkers and customers.  </li>
            <li> It was not incredibly durable, though, eventually stopped working.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised, but quality is mediocre and durability is questionable.</li>
            <li> I was using this horrible excuse of a trimmer that my wife got for me</li>
            <li> Longer cutting area -</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco NT5175 utilizes an oscillating blade, though the nose trimmer&#x27;s tube-structure allows between 90-180 degrees of cutting freedom.</li>

            <li> There is a plastic shield for the base nose hair trimmer, and a cloth sack for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Better quality than I expected. I haven&#x27;t entertained using the attachments (yet) so I can&#x27;t comment on those. I was using this horrible excuse of a trimmer that my wife got for me (I think it was honestly from the dollar store!) and it always snagged, made me cry and sneeze, very uncomfortable! This thing is comfortable and reaches all those weird spots in nose and ears (wash before entering each!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kinda wish it had a charger but I guess for how little I use it a battery is probably better, since it would just sit on the charger all the time and possibly wear out the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a couple times now, no complaints yet! Oh, and I threw the prior excuse of a trimmer away, happily!!</li>
            <li> Nothing is worse than an abundance of nasal or ear hair.  Philips Norelco’s nose trimmer does an effective job trimming this unsightly, and often uncomfortable, hair.  But what makes this trimmer even more useful are the additional attachments that expands its clipping ability to other hirsute regions of your body.  Problems with a monobrow, or overgrown eyebrows?  There are 2 different eyebrow combs.  And then there is a beard trimmer, that is fantastic on sideburns, neck hair, or pretty much anywhere else that needs a clipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy because you can just rinse the trimmer under the tap.  There is a plastic shield for the base nose hair trimmer, and a cloth sack for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer does a great job of taming your hirsute needs.</li>
            <li> I’ve had a hard time finding a decent nose hair trimmer. I tried a manual one (didn’t work, only caused pain), an electric one by Panasonic (inconsistent speed), another cheap one (quickly quit working), and one made by Toilet Tree Products (my favorite). The Philips Norelco NT5175/42 5100 Nose Trimmer is different in that the trimmer part is long with an exposed cutting component. It’s not short and rounded like most trimmers. This design works great for trimming everything but the nose hairs. Attachments are included for trimming other parts of the face and for that it works very good but I wanted a nose hair trimmer and in that regard it’s not as good as the one I’ve been using.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever tried. Although I do not have a beard so I can&#x27;t testify to that I did find it very safe and comfortable to use in the nostrils and ears as well as on the eyebrows. It seems to cut clean without pulling . The blade is well protected from nicking delicate areas. The two sizes of combs let you choose how close you want to trim. My one negative is the fact that it takes both hands to turn it on and off. I don&#x27;t know why they made it that inconvenient when a simple slide switch would have been a lot easier. With this one caveat I would recommend it for anyone wanting a nose, ear, eyebrow trimmer.</li>
            <li> Interestingly enough, this acquisition began seeing a late night TV ad for The &amp;#34;Micro Touch Max&amp;#34; hair trimmer. This one though I think works just fine. It comes with more accessories than I&#x27;ve have the chance to use (or might ever use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the core mission of being able to use the included trimmer to take off the excess hair around the nose, ears, neck, etc.. is a success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me a bit of time to confidently stick this in either my ear or my nose, and both still take a bit of practice. I find that cutting a full ear of hair isn&#x27;t a problem, but a touch up during the week - just to get that one stray hair - is not as easy as I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it runs on just a single battery, but not confident that it will last a long time. I am also weirded out by the fact that to clean it I&#x27;m jsut supposed to put it underneath running water... but it&#x27;s been fine so far. We&#x27;ll see if it lasts 8 years like my last trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works GREAT!  Got it to trim the hair on the ears and on the collar between haircuts.  This allows me to stay looking decent and reduce the number of haircuts in half to every 8 weeks rather than four.  Have already used it twice.  It will have paid for itself in less than two months.  How many things can you say that about?</li>
            <li> This gadget includes several attachments that are suitable for use on nose, eyebrows, beard, moustache, and possibly ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main attachment is a slender tube that you can use for nose hair, among other things. It has an interesting feature. The blades appear to be exposed, but they are really not. I made skin contact with these blades a lot, and I am not injured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smallest comb attachment is suitable for trimming eyebrows to a uniform length. This worked well for me. I would have liked to have an attachment that cut to a slightly smaller length. The comb that is provided is so close to optimal that I am not going to take off a star for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an attachment that is suitable for sideburns and other top-of-head tasks and it is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised that the included battery is of the lithium type. This battery formulation is relatively dry and is unlikely to leak and foul up the trimmer. I have never had a damage problem with lithium cells. On the other hand, I have encountered damage from every major brand of alkaline cells, including Energizer and Duracell. THANK YOU PHILIPS for not bundling an alkaline battery with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All attachments fit nicely in the cheap plastic tray that is used for shipping. This will keep your drawer neat. The cloth pouch is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from the tray, the materials, fit, and finish appear to be first rate. No thin or brittle parts. Everything fits together nicely. I have used several products of this sort and they all lose effectiveness after one to three years. I cannot predict the fate of this gadget. The main attachment (slender tube) is of a design that I have not seen before. Perhaps this one will endure.</li>
            <li> I have bought several smaller trimmers and they always break within a few months. This one though seems tougher and with the attachments, is a lot more versatile, I can even trim my hair with it. It&#x27;s easy to clean and seems well put together.</li>
            <li> This is a Vine review ...&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, easy to clean, quiet.&lt;br /&gt;I use this primarily for &amp;#34;nose&amp;#34; hairs and for this it is perfect. unlike some rotary head units it actually gets them quite easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing you should know: It does not &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; on nose hairs like other units and gets every last one...painlessly.</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer for scaredy cats like me. I&#x27;d always been reluctant to try a motorized nose trimmer, instead spending long sessions in front of the mirror with little scissors and a tweezer (ouch) to make the nasal passages presentable. But I haven&#x27;t a lot of time these days, I&#x27;m also getting older and the nasal hairs are upping their proliferation, and I really liked the idea that this trimmer had a blunt end so it would be unlikely for me to hurt myself way up in the passages.&lt;br /&gt;The unit is solid, petite, everything fits neatly into a little bag that&#x27;s easy to store. Wonderfully, it is fully washable, and I let it air dry outside the bathroom and away from germs, so I like the hygienic value. It does as good a job as my tedious manual approach did, and in a tenth of the time. It could be a little quieter - sounds just like a man&#x27;s razor, but it&#x27;s not on for long while using, so it&#x27;s not really an issue.&lt;br /&gt;The eyebrow attachments aren&#x27;t as necessary as I grow older and less growth is happening there, and sorry but I&#x27;m still too young to need this for trimming facial hair. We&#x27;ll have to wait and see on that issue. I&#x27;m glad that it came with the first battery so I could use it right away. This item has decreased my morning bathroom routine time by a good ten minutes while taking up minimal space, so I&#x27;m pleased, and the package is so compact and well designed that, overall, it would make a marvelous gift; it&#x27;s lightweight and small dimensions make for economical shipping.</li>
            <li> like it might will order another one</li>
            <li> I use this primarily to keep my wayward eyebrows in check. The short comb works well (though I&#x27;d love it to be slightly shorter), then I use it with no comb to tidy up the tops. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it should, and for half the price of another brand I tried that would not even turn on.  I ignore reviews about being too loud, as when you are trimming hair around or in your ears, the sound is naturally louder due to proximity.  I highly recommend this product, as my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Does the job pretty thoroughly and quietly.  Four stars because has difficulty removing some of the nose hairs...have to really work to get the right angle.</li>
            <li> Let me say that I&#x27;ve been using this for what... 3 weeks now? And I love it. I&#x27;d choose it heads and tails over the old spinning blade nose and ear trimmers. I&#x27;m seriously not going back to those. I threw my Panasonic in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a bit of getting used to and at first I couldn&#x27;t get a decent trim with it but I&#x27;ve figured it out and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it do a fantastic job with nose hairs but the attachments make it easy to clean up eyebrows and sideburns or edging up a beard.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely the complete shebang and all of the attachments go on and off easily once you get them lined up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its also water proof so you can wash it off after use but here&#x27;s the thing, since it doesn&#x27;t have the standard spinning blades inside a little compartment it doesn&#x27;t collect all the hair and... shmutz like other trimmers do. So the clean up is easier and less dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to have a pulled hair and while I&#x27;ve been nervous about it slicing the inside of my nose it hasn&#x27;t happened yet. At first I thought maybe it was because it doesn&#x27;t trim as close but honestly I can&#x27;t see a difference between this and my old Panasonic. As long as you use it correctly (rotate it around the inside and make several passes) it does a great job of cleaning things up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life seems to be pretty good so far but that leads me to my only hang up.&lt;br /&gt;Why is this thing not rechargeable? It makes absolutely no sense.&lt;br /&gt;I have 3 other trimmers, all rechargeable, waterproof, etc. I just don&#x27;t understand the need for me to keep buying AA batteries for these things. And yes i know i can buy rechargeable batteries but wouldn&#x27;t a plug be easier? I even have the Phillips Norelco Bodygroom trimmer and guess what, rechargeable! Same company, same general purpose... I&#x27;m sure it was a portability decision or something but man... sigh. end rant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I have no gripes. I really like this trimmer and will be keeping it with me. It has a nice carrying case that should make it easy to bring on trips and with all the attachments I feel pretty covered when it comes to clean up grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely happy with this product. Just wish it was rechargeable.ring on trips and with all the attachments I feel pretty covered when it comes to clean up grooming.  Definitely happy with this product.

            <li> I received an &amp;#34;Norelco NT5175 Trimmer/Shaper&amp;#34; via the Vine Program to evaluate, and found it to be well thought out, of decent construction and easy to use...with some areas that could be improved upon (but certainly not deal-breakers!)&lt;br /&gt;Here are my findings in more detail:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses (▲):&lt;br /&gt;▲ Appears to be made of decent quality materials (primarily plastic with some metal)&lt;br /&gt;▲ Has a nice heft to it, considering how small it is, and  has a rubber grip&lt;br /&gt;▲ Includes two trimmer heads (ear/nose &amp; beard shaper); the ear/nose has a cover...they neglected one for the beard attachment&lt;br /&gt;▲ Has 2 different sized attachments for eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;▲ Comes with a Philips lithium AA battery...better than a standard alkaline&lt;br /&gt;▲ Fully washable&lt;br /&gt;▲ Includes a gray storage bag and a cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minuses (▼):&lt;br /&gt;▼ I tested the beard trimmer on finer hairs on my arm and found it tended to nick the skin and it hurt...be careful!&lt;br /&gt;▼ The beard trimmer blade would benefit from a protective cover (like the one provided for the ear/nose trimmer)&lt;br /&gt;▼ The two trimmer heads (ear/nose and beard) are oriented completely the opposite of each other; ie, they curve 180 degrees away from each other...which is counter-intuitive and can lead to improper installation when switching heads on the fly.&lt;br /&gt;▼ The buzzing noise is loud enough to bother a user with sensitive hearing when using the trimmer for ear hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrals &amp; Commentary:&lt;br /&gt;► A third trimmer head that allows trimming finer hairs close to the skin would be nice (the ones that are shaped like razor clams)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I liked this product, rating it 3.5 stars, rounding up to 4. It is worthy of consideration.</li>
            <li> All good. I&#x27;ve used all the attachments and they work well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so groomed.  This works much better than the plunge type trimmer for me.  I&#x27;d look like a tufted bobcat without this little tool.  Before, I was using a razor and a plunge type groomer and neither did as well as this does and in a short amount of time.  I&#x27;d like to see this in a rechargeable version and with a different way to turn it on besides a twist.  You twist one way to turn it on and the other way to open the case to change the battery.  I never get it right unless I look first.  Still love it though.</li>
            <li> Best nose trimmer ever used. Finish and quality is premium. Powerful motor and waterproof. Recommend to all.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this product.  It works just great with the forest of ear hair.  Says he wishes I had gotten him one sooner.</li>
            <li> very nice. good quality.</li>
            <li> Only 1 beard trimmer length.  Other than that, solid product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I got this after having issues with the previous model, breaking up after a couple months use. From a functionality point of view, this is the best nose trimmer I had, fit is excellent for nose, eyebrows and ears, it&#x27;s completely painless and does its job as expected. The design and implementation really work for me (of course experience may differ in different persons). I am really happy with it. I just hope the new model has resolved the issue with the old model stop working after a short while.</li>
            <li> decent product so far</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with nose hair for a while and I needed a trimmer to help with it since pulling it out with tweezers hurt why to much and spent too much time to get done. This product is perfect for what i need and more. I would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> This is perfect. it trims nose hair very well and doesn&#x27;t pinch. easy to clean and can be used with water in the cleaning process. the other features work good but not as well as the noes hair trimmer. the pouch is nice and convenient and keeps everything together.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a nose trimmer that had a better beard trimmer than my phillips shaver and the nose trimmer is great. I&#x27;m getting another one for my father.</li>
            <li> work good, just not as smooth as I would like</li>
            <li> useless, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> This would have been a 5 star review, were it not for a deliberate gouge by the manufacturer. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself is well designed and functions nearly flawlessly for nose hair, ear hair, and eyebrow trimming.  I was really happy to find it.  Unfortunately, the plastic eyebrow combs (which regulate the length you trim your eyebrows to) are very brittle and within a dozen or so uses, the teeth were breaking off, forcing me to be careful, lest I shave a part of an eyebrow off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked online for replacement parts, as this must be a common experience, but found none.  I contacted Philips Norelco&#x27;s customer service to find out how to replace them and learned that while Philips provides many expensive replacement parts, they do not replace these simple plastic combs, which undoubtedly cost virtually nothing to produce.  Hence, it is clear that their whole plan is to provide a useful tool that a customer will rely on, make it very cheap and brittle so that it will soon break, then leave the customer with no alternative but to replace the whole unit! I said as much to the customer service rep, who could not disagree.  I really hate such marketing practices and the companies that use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result, I will not only forego replacing a unit that otherwise works very well, but am unlikely to purchase another philips product.</li>
            <li> Three Phillips Norelco Trimmers were available for review. So I decided to compare them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current trimmer is a Panasonic ER-GN30, a trimmer using rotary blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first Phillips Norelco Trimmer up for review is the Philips Norelco NT3155/60 3100 Nose Trimmer, $11.99. This is dual blade trimmer and advertised as No Pulling Guaranteed. I have used this style of trimmer before. It works, but IMHO, not as well as a rotary trimmer. I have my own tremors, and use the rotary trimmer to finish off my shaving under my nose. The &amp;#34;DualCut&amp;#34; technology is not as efficient. This comes with a AA battery and a &amp;#34;short&amp;#34; eyebrow comb. This eyebrow trimmer was not very efficient, either. Overall, this trimmer works, but it is not the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next is the Philips Norelco NT3355/60 Nose Trimmer, $13.99. Different body color, but same trimmer. This advertises &amp;#34;Lithium Technology.&amp;#34; This translates to a AA lithium battery. Comes with a &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; eyebrow comb and &amp;#34;short&amp;#34; eyebrow comb. The long comb was much more effective for my eyebrows than the short. Were I to choose between the two, I would definitely purchase this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the Philips Norelco NT5175/42 5100 Nose Trimmer, $19.87. This is the identical body to the NT3355/60. It also comes with a AA lithium battery--lithium technology, long and short eyebrow combs, plus a beard comb, cleaning brush, and a carrying pouch. I do not have a beard and so could not test the beard comb, but having had a beard and having gone through a number of beard trimmers, I find it hard to believe this attachment is of much use.Three Phillips Norelco Trimmers were available for review.

            <li> [[VIDEOID:b8f3d1c9ba9551e15d7790cf3312f6a2]] I have been a big fan of Panasonic trimmers for over 10 years now and did not have any reason to switch until I saw this on Amazon.  I thought i will try this out only for the trimmer attachment that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it just once - I can say that it is way better than Panasonic on the nose and ear trimmer function.  Overall - this is why I would rate this higher than a panasonic:&lt;br /&gt;(1) Longer cutting area - so for nose trimming, it works in less than 10-15 seconds while the Panasonic took more than 45 secs to 1 min&lt;br /&gt;(2) Versatile - comes with a trimmer for beard/mustache which works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a battery to get you started immediately.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, ears and nose get fuzzier. It doesn&#x27;t look nice and it&#x27;s uncomfortable. I had already purchased the Wahl 5545-400 Wahl Ear Nose &amp; Brow Trimmer, so let&#x27;s compare, shall we?&lt;br /&gt;Wahl&#x27;s is cheaper, equally sturdy and cuts a little closer. It does not include as many attachments, though there are quite a few. Because it cuts better, when I use the bare blade it&#x27;s tuggy on my eyebrows (as I age, I&#x27;m trying to avoid getting those crazy brows that Larry Hagman seemed so proud of in his later years).&lt;br /&gt;Norelco&#x27;s is gentler, so there&#x27;s less irritation and tugging. It doesn&#x27;t trim a beard as close as the Wahl, but neither is really good at cutting the beard hair. Best thing to do is to shave the unwanted area first with a razor, then trim it.&lt;br /&gt;I like that the Norelco comes with a little bag to store everything and a brush that not only helps clean the device and attachments, but also can push eyebrows up so I can trim them. Not a deal-breaker, but mighty nice.&lt;br /&gt;Please note that the battery goes in backward to the way you might expect it to. I didn&#x27;t realize it for several minutes. But then that&#x27;s me.</li>
            <li> This personal trimmer is light but sturdy, and the rubberized surface allows for a steady grip.  Much more importantly, the blades on both the nose/ear and detail attachments are very sharp but do not pull, tug or scrape in any way.  I&#x27;ve returned many trimmers because they yanked out my beard hairs while trimming along my jaw.  The only downside is that the detail trimmer doesn&#x27;t seem quite as precise as the Remington NE3560, or perhaps the blade isn&#x27;t positioned as close to the edge, thus forcing the user to compensate by going slightly past the line.  Nevertheless, it&#x27;s a solid competitor to the Remington, the only other trimmer I&#x27;ve liked this much.</li>
            <li> While this trimmer&#x27;s design is novel, I didn&#x27;t find it very effective for the primary task - trimming and removing nose/ear/eyebrow hair. The trimmer certainly does not pull or cut as advertised when you are able to get it to trim a hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to replicate the drawn instructions for the nose is frustrating. Maybe I&#x27;m the freak, but if I put the trimmer in my nose and try to twist it around, it will not touch my nose. I have to insert, then move the trimmer to touch my inner nose edges, and kind of push the trimmer around the inner perimeter of my nose, which is somewhat like using two mirrors to trim hair on the back of your neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batteries do not last very long - I&#x27;d certainly prefer an LI rechargeable system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just have to continue to use the pop-up trimmer on my electric razor for this stuff, as this device just isn&#x27;t worth the effort. I&#x27;d give it one star, but the more standard trimmer/shaver attachments are functional to an extent.</li>
            <li> Have only tried the nose trimmer so far, but that seems to work good.  Easier to use than a tip one.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I had for detailing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;easy to use with precision!&lt;br /&gt;Gets the job done&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t leave anything behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;There is no case to keep them organized. (but for 15 bucks, this is already too awesome!)&lt;br /&gt;The battery is not rechargeable (again! for 15 bucks, this is the best shaver ever!)</li>
            <li> The NT5175/42 is fantastic trimmer. It trims close (but not too close). Because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;Tube Shave&amp;#34; trimmer it trims well, is comfortable, easy to clean, and comes with some very useful attachments. It does a great job on eyebrows and sideburns. I entered the wonderful world of nose hair trimmers with a Wahl rotary trimmer that did a good job. The more I used it, though, the less comfortable it became to use. It was not incredibly durable, though, eventually stopped working. After that, I moved to the Philips Norelco NT9110. It was and is a great trimmer. It&#x27;s very similar to the 5175 except it does not come with a lithium AA battery and does not inclued the sideburn trimmer. It&#x27;s a great option if you&#x27;re not worried about trimming your sideburns with your nose hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have the 5175, though, I find myself using the sideburn trimmer at least once or twice a week. It does require twisting off the Tube Shave head and twisting on the trimmer. That only takes a couple of seconds, though. I also think the 5175 is a bit more powerful. It definitely makes a higher pitched whirring noise than does the 9110.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about the battery. I like the AA Litihium battery that ships with 5175. I&#x27;m hoping it lasts longer than an AA alkaline would. I use Eneloop rechargeable batteries with my old Norelco. I tested this new baby with both alkaline and rechargable AA&#x27;s and found it works well with them. If I&#x27;m not happy with the Lithium lifespan I will feed it Eneloops.</li>
            <li> This is a wonder product, for me this was a terrific thing because it allowed me to trim ear and nose hair without any hassles. Plus with all its accessories, it just adds to the getting the job done efficiently and in quick time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is the cleaning is easier because this doesn&#x27;t have the rotary blades which get a whole lot of micro-hair and gunk in it.Overall for all hairy guys, this is worth your money for all those pesky places that hair grows out of. Which you can&#x27;t wait to take care of.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco NT5175 is a battery-powered trimmer/shaper for facial hair ~ it includes attachments for trimming nose/ear hairs, shaping beards/sideburns, and trimming eyebrows. As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve discovered the unpleasant fact that my once well-behaved nose hairs now require regular trimming...I started by pulling them out (that didn&#x27;t work out well at all), and I later graduated to using small, sharp scissors (though I always felt a bit nervous using them). As nose hairs go, electric trimmers really are the way to go ~ they&#x27;re fast, they&#x27;re safe, and the results are good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only owned one electric trimmer prior to this ~ it&#x27;s an obsolete, flat oscillating-blade design that&#x27;s reminiscent of a miniaturized electric hair trimmer ~ that particular model didn&#x27;t work well because it had to be flat against the skin to cut anything and the narrow blade required multiple passes to get the job done. The most popular nose-hair trimmer design today is probably the rotary-blade ~ they&#x27;re great for cutting nose hair, but due to the design, you generally won&#x27;t find attachments for doing other kinds of trimming such as sideburns, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco NT5175 utilizes an oscillating blade, though the nose trimmer&#x27;s tube-structure allows between 90-180 degrees of cutting freedom. In use, the trimming experience is nearly as convenient as a dedicated rotary-blade trimmer, though it still takes longer and requires some practice to get the movements down. Philips has a small separate instructional leaflet that explicitly instructs users to rotate the device wile trimming nose/ear hairs, and to rinse the blades out when the device is in the on-position. This device is pleasant to use overall, and true to the marketing, I did not experience any pulling sensations. The part that took the longest was cleaning the little pieces of cut hair in my nose! Due to the design, the same hair can be cut multiple times, leaving tiny dust-sized hair particles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this unit is that it&#x27;s not designed for the long haul ~ while the replaceable batteries are nice, once the blades wear down, you&#x27;re done. Philips does not specify a part number to re-order new blades or tips ~ sure, the price is modest and buying a new unit after a few years is certainly economically feasible for most people, but this kind of practice is quite wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note about batteries: being a motorized device, this nose trimmer can be considered to be a relatively high-drain ~ using my multimeter, I did an unscientific test and measured current consumption to be in the ~500mA range. I estimate that single alkaline battery should be good for ~2 hours while a lithium cell should last between 5-6 hours. While using zinc aka. heavy duty batteries will not damage this device, they might only last half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this unit is that it&#x27;s not designed for the long haul ~ while the replaceable batteries are nice, once the blades wear down, you&#x27;re done.

            <li> this is really a good product.... actually works quite well.... very nice design.... good ergonomics.....I only wish they had a rechargeable battery/base.... but the battery seems to last quite longtime..... it comes with a special nonrechargeable lithium type battery</li>
            <li> Better than anything tried before this product.  Very nice, AA battery, does not &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; wihen trimming, etc.  Way to go Noelco.</li>
            <li> First one that has worked well. The design is good, doesn&#x27;t pull or snag for me. I use it for ear hair mainly. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My husband tried this out on his sideburns and his nostrils. He really liked it a lot. He has disliked similar devices in the past because they tickle. This one didn&#x27;t tickle.&lt;br /&gt;We did have an issue with the battery cap not lining up, but he figured it out.&lt;br /&gt;It came with a AA lithium ultra battery (FR6), which might require future Amazon shopping to replace with RadioShack closing.</li>
            <li> No problems with item</li>
            <li> This is the same as the 3100 model, but has all of the extra attachments.  I this one is a better value, if you think you might use only one or two of the attachments.  I like this one better than the rotary ones simply because I like to \\&quot;clean-up\\&quot; around my nose and sideburns. . . as well as cut any \\&quot;wild hairs\\&quot; here-and-there. So far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with \\&quot;pulls\\&quot;. The device feels heavy enough, and not \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;. Nice that it can be easily cleaned by rinsing under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something a little more \\&quot;robust\\&quot; and especially if you want a beard trimmer, then I would recommend the Wahl 5537-1801 shown below.  It&#x27;s actually a little bit less expensive than the Norelco 5100 and comes with a nose / ear trimmer as well, though it is the rotary type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0015KHMRS Wahl 5537-1801 Cordless Battery Operated Beard Trimmer with Bonus Ear, Nose and Brow Trimmer]]</li>
            <li> Used it for ear, nose, and eyebrows so far. The trimmer is very easy to use. As advertised, I don&#x27;t feel any yanking or pulling. The guards for the eyebrows were a bit tricky for me to get on, but once I did, they worked well. The trimmer also works well with just a simple comb. It comes with a cleaning brush and can be run under water, so clean up is a snap.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little trimmer. I mainly use it to trim my moustache, but it also does well at cutting my nose hairs. I love the way it trims my moustache. Now I don&#x27;t have to use scissors to shape my moustache. I just wish it was rechargeable instead of using a regular battery.</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised, but quality is mediocre and durability is questionable. The cutter blades are not replaceable, so you to discard the product when the blades get dull. The various attachments are made of low quality plastic. The carrying case is a simple cloth bag with no compartments to keep the attachments separate and protected.</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer kit.  It will trim ear and nose hair like a champ, plus with the small attachments it will weed whack those out of control eyebrows and other pesky hairs down to a manageable length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have another one of these that did not come as a kit, and it is still running great.  Since it is constantly being borrowed by the wife, and now the teenager in my house, I thought another would be a good idea.  (Yes, you can rinse them in the sink and clean them)  I have had my original for a couple  years now, and this one appears idnentical.  That is amazing for a product that is so affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the need for one of these, and lets face it, EVERYONE needs one of these at least occasionally, then you cant go wrong here.</li>
            <li> After years of owning poorly built trimmers that feel like they are held together with rubber bands, I wish I would have found this sooner. Very solid built, strong motor that doesn&#x27;t slow when it nears hair out of fear and the accessories are all well designed. The carrying pouch tops it all off to help keep everything together and clean.</li>
            <li> My nose and ears are lean ans mean and super clean! Its built so much sturdier than the green nose trimmer you see on television.</li>
            <li> Very portable and easy to use. Good affordable price. The twist to change battery can be annoying: to turn on, you turn one way, but if you turn the wrong way the battery compartment opens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adapters are adequate. Not sure if the cap allows the blade to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effective product, so good to recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent timing for me to get this product.  My 5 year old nose and ear trimmer is slowly dying and what we have here is a Norelco product that promises to do it all and the great thing is it truly delivers.  This unit not only allows you to trim your nose, ears and eyebrows but also provides excellent trimming for beards and sideburns.  The precision trimmer is a gem and very easy to hold and manipulate in your hand.  Enclosed is a dualcut trimmer attachment, 2 eyebrow combs and a beard comb.  My old trimmer worked good but every once in a while when trimming my nose it would nick the outer edge of my nose.  This trimmer indeed does not nick, pull or cut.  It helps that it is water resistant and it is very easy to clean.  There is also enclosed a cleaning brush.  This trimmer makes daily maintenance a joy.  Lastly and very important to note the motor is very powerful which makes sure you will get the best trim possible.  What you get for the price is amazing.  Norelco stays true to their history of quality products.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works better then I expected. Motor runs smooth and with the Philips Lithium battery it runs strong. I have used it for trimming body and facial hair. I am glad I took the chance to make the purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like this trim and shape kit, it has all the essentials and is a great value.  It felt like they thought of everything with this kit, it is very convenient and simple to use.  It works great and I experienced no pulling or pain when trimming my ears and nose hairs, not once.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is battery operated and has no cords to mess with and that it came with a pouch to hold all the parts in.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband who with age has begun to sprout unseemly hairs. The set comes with a lithium AA battery. The travel bag and instructions are under the plastic container ( don&#x27;t throw them out accidentally). The instructions were very complete and written in clear English. Within 2 minutes, the nose and ear hairs were history. No pain, easy to use. This set also has a sideburns trimmer and beard groomer. Both worked flawlessly. The travel bag is a nice touch for our RV trips. The husband was very impressed with the set, the attachments and how well this worked, cleaned and easily stowed away. Nice job, Norelco.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing that I&#x27;m proud of.  I&#x27;m now of the age where nose and ear hair are becoming more of a reality than I&#x27;d ever really thought possible.  There is nothing worse than finding a nose hair hanging out during a conversation with coworkers and customers.  So on to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d used another Norelco in the past and found that it really does the best job.  You can really get up in there and prune the thicket.  If there&#x27;s been a recent overgrowth on the eyebrows and the eyebrows are growing together the attached combs are also very handy.  I was a little nervous using it but it did a fine job keeping my eyebrows uniform length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do tell you to rinse this in water and they&#x27;re serious.  I&#x27;d read other reviews where someone had not rinsed this post usage and it stopped working.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that it&#x27;s got to be standard practice.  Beyond that, it really does the job.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent nose trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have tried a different design, with a circular head, but that one frequently gave me abrasion.  This design keeps the blades away from your skin (although if you really try hard, you can cause some abrasion, but that really only occurs from over doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The angled tip, and overall design is simply the best for nose trimming and works well for ears too.  I don&#x27;t use it for other hair areas, so I refer you to other reviews for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, I can tell you that Phillips Norelco has excellent customer service.  7 years ago, I purchased an earlier version of this trimmer, and it failed soon after purchase.  I contacted them and they sent me a new one, together with packaging to return the broken one.  Considering the low price of the item, that is excellent service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I can definitely recommend this for nose and ear trimming.</li>
            <li> We have the more basic version of this without the interchangeable heads and have been using it for years. This version adds a small trimmer head that can be used for slightly larger jobs.  With regard to the original function, it is outstanding. It works exactly the same as the other version, and it might even cut a little better as it seems to move the blades at a higher speed. It works very well in the nose and on the eyebrows with the included combs. It still works great on the ears, but this version seems to be louder with a higher pitch to the tone that is a bit annoying.  I found the extra head for beard trimming to be less useful. With the comb, it works just fine. The blades move at a very high speed and it cuts well. The blades, however are pretty fine and using it to cut edges without the comb can irritate the skin more than other options I have for that purpose. The Wahl lithium ion trimmer is much better for that (but I wouldn&#x27;t try to stuff it in my nose).</li>
