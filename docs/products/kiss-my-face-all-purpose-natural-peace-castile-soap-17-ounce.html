            <li>The scent was delightful, even the hubby used it.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t impressed with it for body use.</li>

            <li>so I think it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>The two fragrances I like best - Lavender Mandarin and Clary Sage Lemongrass - are just heavenly.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a fan of Bronner&#x27;s but are looking for the perfect scent, give Kiss My Face a try.</li>

            <li>The smell is just wonderful</li>

            <li>Works great!  </li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful, a lot milder than Everybody Soap.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>Castile soap is great as hand wash too.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap!!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice soap.</li>
            <li>The one thing that I&#x27;ve never been hugely impressed with in Bronner&#x27;s - aside from the entertainingly kooky writing - is the scents.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent soap and I&#x27;m enjoying using it.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think this soap did a good job rinsing off the my sweat.  </li>
            <li>This soap smells so good.</li>
            <li>that monies go to a good cause.</li>
            <li>kinda yucky- but to be fair</li>
            <li>Cleans well, feels good.</li>
            <li>In addition to cleaning, KMF does some good with this soap by donating a portion of its proceeds to a camp uniting Palestinian and Israeli teens.</li>
            <li>I love using this soap!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this soap!</li>
            <li>(I love lavender!)</li>
            <li>But to each their own! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>Add to that the pleasant smell making this an enjoyable product to use</li>
            <li>It smells amazing.</li>
            <li>smells amazing</li>
            <li>But the scent was nice</li>
            <li>being said, it does smell nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sort of like a squeaky-clean kind of feeling.</li>
            <li>My skin is healing nicely.</li>
            <li>use too much just because it didn&#x27;t foam, it still cleans perfectly!</li>
            <li>Nice smell and lather.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s kind of a bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice for people who are trying to find a nice vegan liquid soap to avoid the messes associated with bar soaps.</li>
            <li>The lavender mandarin has a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I found it on a clearance shelf while I was pregnant &amp; was so happy to know I was not putting harmful chemicals on my body.</li>
            <li>best part is that it&#x27;s completely natural.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s probably more cost effective too.</li>
            <li>I bought this soap to see if I liked it better than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap.  </li>
            <li>the grease and everything came off so easily!  </li>
            <li>This soap clean well and smells really good, so my family loves it!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Smells good, cleans, rinses off cleanly and I can use with no allergic or &amp;#34;sensitivity&amp;#34; problems.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle for hands and doing dishes is great</li>
            <li>I have allergies to most soaps.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of room on my bathroom counter top.</li>
            <li>And I love it.</li>
            <li>It smells heavenly, refreshing</li>
            <li>I also love that it is rated &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; on ewg.  </li>
            <li>So many items can be done much better with fewer chemicals.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of my skin after I use this product.  </li>
            <li>and I love the idea of Castile soap with a pump.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more slimy when you are working a lather.  </li>
            <li>Also, impressive that you can read and actually know what the ingredients are.</li>
            <li>I need a more moisturizing soap.</li>
            <li>I do LOVE that it doesnt have tons of chemcials in it and</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>It smells lovely and doesn&#x27;t leave my body dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and have been using it for quite a while now.</li>
            <li>Seriously LOVE this soap.</li>
            <li>I love Castile soap</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product - will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>Also it smells fabulous!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love  this soap and use it for a ton of things.</li>
            <li>This is much better hand soap than anything you&#x27;ll find in the store.</li>
            <li>I love the brand.</li>
            <li>Love the scent of this soap.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>So many uses, and it&#x27;s not harmful to the environment or water pipes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rated amazingly well by the Environmental Working Group (a 0, the lowest &amp;#34;hazard&amp;#34; rating possible), it smells good, and is a particularly slippery soap which is great for shaving!  </li>
            <li>But it is a pretty good laundry degreaser.</li>
            <li>the scent is fresh and nice without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of lavender and this stuff really smells good.  </li>
            <li>It has a great smell and it&#x27;s a nice large size without being really bulky</li>
            <li>I feel great letting my toddler use it knowing it is all natural.</li>
            <li>I just wish this stuff was easier to find and more retailers made it available online.  </li>
            <li>It is important to me that my family uses safe products.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant scent, fairly large bottle, no harmful ingredients, and environmentally friendly.  </li>
            <li>One of the best things about it is that it contains no sodium lauryl or other toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>Does not leave a film and washes of easily.</li>
            <li>I am not fond of the strong lavender scent, however.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very much into making my own products.</li>
            <li>My Face is a great brand generally</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>If you use a full pump straight on a sponge it works OK for those purposes, but that kind of defeats the value of the product as an &amp;#34;all in one&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>this soap is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, doesn&#x27;t foam very well but get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy it, even though it doesn&#x27;t lather, as someone else pointed out.</li>
            <li>the price, it&#x27;s a great deal, but I think we may stick with Everybody for the sheer size of bottle and bubbles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried any number of them, and rose is the only one I&#x27;ve truly liked - and no one around here sells it.    </li>
            <li>This soap has a good lather and is made of all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel clean using the soap.  </li>
            <li>I use it to clean the house as well as in the shower.</li>
            <li>LEAVES THE SKIN SO CLEAN</li>
            <li>The soap gives me a squeaky clean feeling.</li>
            <li>When I use this soap, I csn tell a deifference right away!</li>
            <li>Love the soap, its scent, and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>this is the best soap ever, i will not use any other  ,  EVER!!!!  </li>
            <li>and you get that fresh and clean feeling after showering.</li>
            <li>This is a great hand soap for the bathroom as the fragrance is not really strong but smells so clean.</li>
            <li>Love this all natural soap!</li>
            <li>I used it for laundry with success.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s 100% worth it.    </li>
            <li>but whatever makes it feel soft, I love it.  </li>
            <li>I always have to make sure it&#x27;s clear before we have guests over</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of liquid soaps for use in the shower and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this as a hand soap right now and nothing else.</li>
            <li>YES, you read that right.</li>
            <li>Overall, I like this soap, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>This soap isn&#x27;t exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It has a different feel to it compared to most of the soaps I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for in a hand soap.  </li>
            <li>I use only 1/3 to 1/2 pump at the most each time.</li>
            <li>However, the first time I ordered the bottle was cracked and leaking, I asked for a replacement which also arrived cracked and leaking...</li>
            <li>I love that there&#x27;s no gross chemicals in it as well.</li>
            <li>The lavender scent smells lovely - they use real essential oils, not synthetic fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is rated a &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep website!  </li>
            <li>Natural, gentle, chemical free soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It kind of gives you the feeling like it&#x27;s going to be a bit difficult to rinse off, but it rinses off easily and leaves you with clean hands without the endocrine disruptors.</li>
            <li>My hands have a tendency to dry out in the winter months and using a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; soap like this helps a bunch.</li>
            <li>Castile is a pure soap without all the added chemicals that some manufacturers think are needed.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s purely preference!)&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Smells nice but is a little drying.</li>
            <li>This is a great choice for green cleaning, especially in the kitchen.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the texture of this soap.</li>
            <li>haha.  </li>
            <li>I probably wont buy this again, as my skin doesnt seem to like it that much.</li>
            <li>I have heard so much praise about castile soap</li>
            <li>I only wish they had a bigger size to use as a refill, since I have my own soap dispensers.</li>
            <li>Great soap - a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>word of advice: one doesn&#x27;t need an entire pump to receive a suitable quantity of soap from this container - seems downright wasteful to use an entire pump each time.  </li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>As a shampoo or hand wash, it gives you the clean of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s with the coniditoning of coconut oil, without caking as long as you wash it all out.</li>
            <li>only takes a tiny amount ,lathers very well, rinses off easily and no harsh fragrence.</li>
            <li>It is mild and goes a long way.</li>
            <li>fragrance doesn&#x27;t &#x27;cling&#x27; like many other soaps (mainly the &#x27;regular&#x27; kind)&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell like bleach or ammonia.  </li>
            <li>As it&#x27;s Castile soap, I expected it to suds up similar to the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, but I&#x27;ve found that I have to use a lot more to get those kinds of suds.</li>
            <li>No residue, very soft on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find the castile soap is working just as well on my kids&#x27; stained clothing!    </li>
            <li>Originally bought a small bottle to try and after first use upgraded.</li>
            <li>I recommend for anyone who wants to clean the green way.</li>
            <li>I purchased pomegranate &amp; acai scent from my local Whole Foods a couple weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so gentle and seems to last forever..</li>
            <li>cause it&#x27;s all natural and whatnot</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>The pump frequently gets clogged, there is virtually no lather, and when I wash my hands they just feel sort of slippery afterwards, not</li>
            <li>that its natural.</li>
            <li>softly scented, cleans well.  </li>
            <li>I prefer to use Dr Bronner&#x27;s All One used in an old foaming soap dispenser (with water to dilute of</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really foam up enough.</li>
            <li>This will not stop me from using the product, the skin around my eyes is incredibly sensitive as it is</li>
            <li>I have started using it as shampoo and body wash - for myself and my 3 year old.</li>
            <li>it  makes my hands soft,  doesn&#x27;t irritate my son or husband&#x27;s eczema...</li>
            <li>Simply dilute 2 Tbsp in a gallon of water, add a few drops of essential oil or fresh lemon, and use to clean countertops and floors.  </li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s washed off, it leaves the skin a little dry, but I like being able to use it for anything.</li>
            <li>More like a gel, and not great for shaving unless you are completely out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it has been wonderful over these last few dry winter months - usually my skin is very dry during the winter but has not been this year.</li>
            <li>Normally, I only use it on my face or as hand soap, because of the naturally healing qualities of lavender and mandarin for acne, acne scars, etc.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural and safe without all the unnecessary chemicals that are in regular soaps.</li>
            <li>AND NEVER DRY.</li>
            <li>Wanting to avoid the creepy labeling on Dr. B&#x27;s castile soap products, I bought this six months ago thinking I&#x27;d totally make my own cleaning products from scratch.</li>
            <li>Gets really foamy like other soaps, but loses the foam pretty quickly as it turns into that typical castille soap texture.</li>
            <li>My Face donates part of its profits to the Seeds of Peace organization, which is apparently a camp for kids to learn tolerance and understanding of others from different backgrounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my dry forehead feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>Other soaps dry my skin terribly; so much so that I have actual scabs from scratching.</li>

            <li> The one thing that I&#x27;ve never been hugely impressed with in Bronner&#x27;s - aside from the entertainingly kooky writing - is the scents.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent soap and I&#x27;m enjoying using it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think this soap did a good job rinsing off the my sweat.  </li>
            <li> This soap smells so good.</li>
            <li> that monies go to a good cause.</li>
            <li> kinda yucky- but to be fair</li>
            <li> Cleans well, feels good.</li>
            <li> In addition to cleaning, KMF does some good with this soap by donating a portion of its proceeds to a camp uniting Palestinian and Israeli teens.</li>
            <li> I love using this soap!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap!</li>
            <li> (I love lavender!)</li>
            <li> But to each their own! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Add to that the pleasant smell making this an enjoyable product to use</li>
            <li> It smells amazing.</li>
            <li> smells amazing</li>
            <li> But the scent was nice</li>
            <li> being said, it does smell nice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sort of like a squeaky-clean kind of feeling.</li>
            <li> My skin is healing nicely.</li>
            <li> use too much just because it didn&#x27;t foam, it still cleans perfectly!</li>
            <li> Nice smell and lather.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s kind of a bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice for people who are trying to find a nice vegan liquid soap to avoid the messes associated with bar soaps.</li>
            <li> The lavender mandarin has a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I found it on a clearance shelf while I was pregnant &amp; was so happy to know I was not putting harmful chemicals on my body.</li>
            <li> best part is that it&#x27;s completely natural.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s probably more cost effective too.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap to see if I liked it better than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap.  </li>
            <li> the grease and everything came off so easily!  </li>
            <li> This soap clean well and smells really good, so my family loves it!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Smells good, cleans, rinses off cleanly and I can use with no allergic or &amp;#34;sensitivity&amp;#34; problems.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle for hands and doing dishes is great</li>
            <li> I have allergies to most soaps.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of room on my bathroom counter top.</li>
            <li> And I love it.</li>
            <li> It smells heavenly, refreshing</li>
            <li> I also love that it is rated &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; on ewg.  </li>
            <li> So many items can be done much better with fewer chemicals.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of my skin after I use this product.  </li>
            <li> and I love the idea of Castile soap with a pump.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more slimy when you are working a lather.  </li>
            <li> Also, impressive that you can read and actually know what the ingredients are.</li>
            <li> I need a more moisturizing soap.</li>
            <li> I do LOVE that it doesnt have tons of chemcials in it and</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> It smells lovely and doesn&#x27;t leave my body dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and have been using it for quite a while now.</li>
            <li> Seriously LOVE this soap.</li>
            <li> I love Castile soap</li>
            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product - will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  </li>
            <li> Also it smells fabulous!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love  this soap and use it for a ton of things.</li>
            <li> This is much better hand soap than anything you&#x27;ll find in the store.</li>
            <li> I love the brand.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this soap.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> So many uses, and it&#x27;s not harmful to the environment or water pipes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rated amazingly well by the Environmental Working Group (a 0, the lowest &amp;#34;hazard&amp;#34; rating possible), it smells good, and is a particularly slippery soap which is great for shaving!  </li>
            <li> But it is a pretty good laundry degreaser.</li>
            <li> the scent is fresh and nice without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of lavender and this stuff really smells good.  </li>
            <li> It has a great smell and it&#x27;s a nice large size without being really bulky</li>
            <li> I feel great letting my toddler use it knowing it is all natural.</li>
            <li> I just wish this stuff was easier to find and more retailers made it available online.  </li>
            <li> It is important to me that my family uses safe products.  </li>
            <li> Pleasant scent, fairly large bottle, no harmful ingredients, and environmentally friendly.  </li>
            <li> One of the best things about it is that it contains no sodium lauryl or other toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> Does not leave a film and washes of easily.</li>
            <li> I am not fond of the strong lavender scent, however.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very much into making my own products.</li>
            <li> My Face is a great brand generally</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> If you use a full pump straight on a sponge it works OK for those purposes, but that kind of defeats the value of the product as an &amp;#34;all in one&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> this soap is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, doesn&#x27;t foam very well but get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy it, even though it doesn&#x27;t lather, as someone else pointed out.</li>
            <li> the price, it&#x27;s a great deal, but I think we may stick with Everybody for the sheer size of bottle and bubbles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried any number of them, and rose is the only one I&#x27;ve truly liked - and no one around here sells it.    </li>
            <li> This soap has a good lather and is made of all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel clean using the soap.  </li>
            <li> I use it to clean the house as well as in the shower.</li>
            <li> LEAVES THE SKIN SO CLEAN</li>
            <li> The soap gives me a squeaky clean feeling.</li>
            <li> When I use this soap, I csn tell a deifference right away!</li>
            <li> Love the soap, its scent, and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> this is the best soap ever, i will not use any other  ,  EVER!!!!  </li>
            <li> and you get that fresh and clean feeling after showering.</li>
            <li> This is a great hand soap for the bathroom as the fragrance is not really strong but smells so clean.</li>
            <li> Love this all natural soap!</li>
            <li> I used it for laundry with success.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s 100% worth it.    </li>
            <li> but whatever makes it feel soft, I love it.  </li>
            <li> I always have to make sure it&#x27;s clear before we have guests over</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of liquid soaps for use in the shower and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this as a hand soap right now and nothing else.</li>
            <li> YES, you read that right.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like this soap, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> This soap isn&#x27;t exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It has a different feel to it compared to most of the soaps I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for in a hand soap.  </li>
            <li> I use only 1/3 to 1/2 pump at the most each time.</li>
            <li> However, the first time I ordered the bottle was cracked and leaking, I asked for a replacement which also arrived cracked and leaking...</li>
            <li> I love that there&#x27;s no gross chemicals in it as well.</li>
            <li> The lavender scent smells lovely - they use real essential oils, not synthetic fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Love that it is rated a &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep website!  </li>
            <li> Natural, gentle, chemical free soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It kind of gives you the feeling like it&#x27;s going to be a bit difficult to rinse off, but it rinses off easily and leaves you with clean hands without the endocrine disruptors.</li>
            <li> My hands have a tendency to dry out in the winter months and using a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; soap like this helps a bunch.</li>
            <li> Castile is a pure soap without all the added chemicals that some manufacturers think are needed.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s purely preference!)&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Smells nice but is a little drying.</li>
            <li> This is a great choice for green cleaning, especially in the kitchen.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the texture of this soap.</li>
            <li> haha.  </li>
            <li> I probably wont buy this again, as my skin doesnt seem to like it that much.</li>
            <li> I have heard so much praise about castile soap</li>
            <li> I only wish they had a bigger size to use as a refill, since I have my own soap dispensers.</li>
            <li> Great soap - a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> word of advice: one doesn&#x27;t need an entire pump to receive a suitable quantity of soap from this container - seems downright wasteful to use an entire pump each time.  </li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> As a shampoo or hand wash, it gives you the clean of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s with the coniditoning of coconut oil, without caking as long as you wash it all out.</li>
            <li> only takes a tiny amount ,lathers very well, rinses off easily and no harsh fragrence.</li>
            <li> It is mild and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> fragrance doesn&#x27;t &#x27;cling&#x27; like many other soaps (mainly the &#x27;regular&#x27; kind)&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell like bleach or ammonia.  </li>
            <li> As it&#x27;s Castile soap, I expected it to suds up similar to the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, but I&#x27;ve found that I have to use a lot more to get those kinds of suds.</li>
            <li> No residue, very soft on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find the castile soap is working just as well on my kids&#x27; stained clothing!    </li>
            <li> Originally bought a small bottle to try and after first use upgraded.</li>
            <li> I recommend for anyone who wants to clean the green way.</li>
            <li> I purchased pomegranate &amp; acai scent from my local Whole Foods a couple weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gentle and seems to last forever..</li>
            <li> cause it&#x27;s all natural and whatnot</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> The pump frequently gets clogged, there is virtually no lather, and when I wash my hands they just feel sort of slippery afterwards, not</li>
            <li> that its natural.</li>
            <li> softly scented, cleans well.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to use Dr Bronner&#x27;s All One used in an old foaming soap dispenser (with water to dilute of</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really foam up enough.</li>
            <li> This will not stop me from using the product, the skin around my eyes is incredibly sensitive as it is</li>
            <li> I have started using it as shampoo and body wash - for myself and my 3 year old.</li>
            <li> it  makes my hands soft,  doesn&#x27;t irritate my son or husband&#x27;s eczema...</li>
            <li> Simply dilute 2 Tbsp in a gallon of water, add a few drops of essential oil or fresh lemon, and use to clean countertops and floors.  </li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s washed off, it leaves the skin a little dry, but I like being able to use it for anything.</li>
            <li> More like a gel, and not great for shaving unless you are completely out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it has been wonderful over these last few dry winter months - usually my skin is very dry during the winter but has not been this year.</li>
            <li> Normally, I only use it on my face or as hand soap, because of the naturally healing qualities of lavender and mandarin for acne, acne scars, etc.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural and safe without all the unnecessary chemicals that are in regular soaps.</li>
            <li> AND NEVER DRY.</li>
            <li> Wanting to avoid the creepy labeling on Dr. B&#x27;s castile soap products, I bought this six months ago thinking I&#x27;d totally make my own cleaning products from scratch.</li>
            <li> Gets really foamy like other soaps, but loses the foam pretty quickly as it turns into that typical castille soap texture.</li>
            <li> My Face donates part of its profits to the Seeds of Peace organization, which is apparently a camp for kids to learn tolerance and understanding of others from different backgrounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my dry forehead feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> Other soaps dry my skin terribly; so much so that I have actual scabs from scratching.</li>
            <li> The soap coagulates in the pump and after a few uses, when you push it down, it&#x27;ll spray out pretty far.</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my cetaphil face wash as I have sensitive skin and looking for a product without parabens and other harmful products.</li>
            <li> i was pleasantly surprised that with the little amount I put in my hands thoroughly washed MY ENTIRE body!</li>
            <li> I think, even with the multitude of things I use it for, that a single bottle will last anywhere from two weeks to a month.</li>
            <li> I now only use it as a hand soap, but notice that my hands are very dry after I wash them.</li>
            <li> So, this bottle has lasted me a long time</li>
            <li> and I did have a minor reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I use Castile soap for a lot of purposes (not this brand) and the consistency of this soap is very different than other ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I saw one other poster&#x27;s reviews saying that they used these castile soaps for not only their hands, but for their bodies in the shower and for washing their hair.  </li>
            <li> Makes hands feel dry if you use every time you wash hands.</li>
            <li> I was worried that this type of soap would dry out my skin</li>
            <li> I think it the only down side.</li>
            <li> However, the soap left a little to be desired.  </li>
            <li> I put a couple squirts in an empty spray bottle and then fill with water.</li>
            <li> (I always use moisturizer after washing anyway due to very dry</li>
            <li> I got this soap to avoid other commercial soaps with lots of harsh chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> minus 1 for the fact like other Castile soaps the spout eventually gets clogged which requires intervention (cleaning).  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I accidentally splashed some on my face the other day while showering - it hit just below my eyebrow over one eye -</li>
            <li> I tried other brands of soap and they didn&#x27;t compare.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend on the other hand is not a fan of lavender, but he likes how the soap feels.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money if I have to fix the pump to get the soap to work correctly.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try it out on other things!</li>
            <li> I had a soap in there previously</li>
            <li> When I consider that I&#x27;ve rid myself of most household cleaners, shampoos and soaps - and all the nasty chemicals that come with these products, the price isn&#x27;t actually a deterrent.</li>
            <li> I oOrdered  for a gift off of a registry, product came with half bottle leaked out.</li>
            <li> If any of the soap drips down onto label the inks on it run and it looks messy.</li>
            <li> A little drying for me</li>
            <li> When the baby toys need a little scrub, this is the soap I chose.</li>
            <li> Bought this to try and save a little as compared to the Eveybody Soap/Dr.</li>
            <li> It works nicely but doesn&#x27;t contain the horrible chemicals.</li>
            <li> No apparrent damage to tge bottle itself, just messy.</li>
            <li> at least not when its diluted in a sink of water like you would use any other dish soap.</li>
            <li> The little bit that I could smell from the box seemed heavenly though!</li>
            <li> I really like the smell and initially got this soap as a body wash, but I noticed my skin was drying out very badly when I used it.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair with this soap, use it as a body wash, add a little to a water/vinegar mix and mop the floor with it, use it for hand soap, hand-washing delicate clothing...   </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the olive or the coconut oil that does it,</li>
            <li> I think my hard water has something to do with that.</li>
            <li> This is the main reason I purchase their products, but I have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> that smelled awful but this scent doesn&#x27;t stand out as much to me</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is a really weak bottle, or bad packing twice in a row.</li>
            <li> but I feel like its too expensive to just be used as a hand soap so I will probably not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to change over from the dangerous chemicals in the house to safer ones.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for a number of years, and have yet to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t hate it,</li>
            <li> I had a brutal workout before using the soap</li>
            <li> It has a lavender scent, which my kids associate with lice repellent, but I don&#x27;t mind the scent.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave a film.</li>
            <li> I purchased pomegranate &amp; acai scent from my local Whole Foods a couple weeks ago.  The scent was delightful, even the hubby used it. However, the soap left a little to be desired.  I didn&#x27;t feel clean using the soap.  I had a brutal workout before using the soap and I don&#x27;t think this soap did a good job rinsing off the my sweat.  I&#x27;ve tried  several times to use this soap and I wasn&#x27;t impressed with it for body use. I used it for laundry with success.  Overall, I like this soap, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> This soap smells so good. I have allergies to most soaps. I like that monies go to a good cause. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!! It&#x27;s so gentle and seems to last forever.. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Castile soap is a must have! I use it to clean the house as well as in the shower. This one has a great scent!</li>
            <li> I received Kiss My Face as a gift.  I used it for washing my hands, washing clothes, cleaning the sink, and scrubbing dishes.  I had a pan that had cooked on crud on it, and the dishsoap and scrub brush wasn&#x27;t working.  I put some Kiss My Face on it, and I couldn&#x27;t believe it - the grease and everything came off so easily!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It has a great smell and it&#x27;s a nice large size without being really bulky so it doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of room on my bathroom counter top. I had a soap in there previously that smelled awful but this scent doesn&#x27;t stand out as much to me so I think it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> We had been using Bronner&#x27;s soaps because they are made of simple ingredients, are easy-to-find, and are low-toxicity, vegan castile soaps. The one thing that I&#x27;ve never been hugely impressed with in Bronner&#x27;s - aside from the entertainingly kooky writing - is the scents. I&#x27;ve tried any number of them, and rose is the only one I&#x27;ve truly liked - and no one around here sells it.    So, when Kiss My Face released their castile soap, I decided to give it a shot. And I love it. The two fragrances I like best - Lavender Mandarin and Clary Sage Lemongrass - are just heavenly. Since i can&#x27;t choose between them, I often keep a bottle of each around. I wash my hair with this soap, use it as a body wash, add a little to a water/vinegar mix and mop the floor with it, use it for hand soap, hand-washing delicate clothing...   I&#x27;ve even used it to replace our Ecover Stain Treater that may be contaminated with dioxin. I was surprised to find the castile soap is working just as well on my kids&#x27; stained clothing!    It is pricey. Fortunately, a small amount goes a long way. I think, even with the multitude of things I use it for, that a single bottle will last anywhere from two weeks to a month. When I consider that I&#x27;ve rid myself of most household cleaners, shampoos and soaps - and all the nasty chemicals that come with these products, the price isn&#x27;t actually a deterrent. Add to that the pleasant smell making this an enjoyable product to use and it&#x27;s 100% worth it.    If you&#x27;re a fan of Bronner&#x27;s but are looking for the perfect scent, give Kiss My Face a try. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the texture of this soap. It feels slippery and slimy. But the scent was nice</li>
            <li> This soap clean well and smells really good, so my family loves it!&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that it&#x27;s completely natural.</li>
            <li> Did great for cleaning not for hair though leaves residue.  It is very gentle for hands and doing dishes is great</li>
            <li> I love using this soap!  It smells heavenly, refreshing and I look forward to washing my hands haha.  I also love that it is rated &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; on ewg.  I feel great letting my toddler use it knowing it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Smells like I&#x27;m in a field of weeds. It leaves my skin feeling kinda yucky- but to be fair I think my hard water has something to do with that. I wanted to try it cause it&#x27;s all natural and whatnot but its just not for me.</li>
            <li> I only wish they had a bigger size to use as a refill, since I have my own soap dispensers.</li>
            <li> Great soap - a little goes a long way.  Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t have unnecessary ingredients!  Now to research lotions, dish soap, shampoo...  So many items can be done much better with fewer chemicals.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap! It has the best scent EVER and is good for the environment and humanity. Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent soap and I&#x27;m enjoying using it. It has a very pleasant scent and I feel good knowing it&#x27;s natural and safe without all the unnecessary chemicals that are in regular soaps. I recommend this!</li>
            <li> I love the feel of my skin after I use this product.  I use it on my face as well.  It leaves my dry forehead feeling soft.  Not sure if it&#x27;s the olive or the coconut oil that does it, but whatever makes it feel soft, I love it.  It makes my eyes glasses look foggy... so I have learned not to use it for that purpose, but for my body it is perfect.</li>
            <li> This soap isn&#x27;t exactly what I thought it would be. I use Castile soap for a lot of purposes (not this brand) and the consistency of this soap is very different than other ones I&#x27;ve used. The pump frequently gets clogged, there is virtually no lather, and when I wash my hands they just feel sort of slippery afterwards, not clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it does smell nice and I love the idea of Castile soap with a pump. I&#x27;m using this as a hand soap right now and nothing else. It&#x27;s fine and I don&#x27;t hate it, but I feel like its too expensive to just be used as a hand soap so I will probably not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> If I was just rating the soap itself and what is in it, it&#x27;s 5 stars. However, I am on my 2nd bottle and am having the same issue. The soap coagulates in the pump and after a few uses, when you push it down, it&#x27;ll spray out pretty far. It has even hit me, the shower curtain and floor. It&#x27;s like a low powered water jet. I continuously have to shove a toothpick up there and scoop out the coagulated soap. I always have to make sure it&#x27;s clear before we have guests over so they don&#x27;t get it all over themselves. So, this is probably my last bottle. It&#x27;s not worth the money if I have to fix the pump to get the soap to work correctly.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent, fairly large bottle, no harmful ingredients, and environmentally friendly.  I just wish this stuff was easier to find and more retailers made it available online.  It has a different feel to it compared to most of the soaps I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s more slimy when you are working a lather.  It kind of gives you the feeling like it&#x27;s going to be a bit difficult to rinse off, but it rinses off easily and leaves you with clean hands without the endocrine disruptors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very much into making my own products. But, I read up on this company and like what I saw. Not only do they not test on animals,  but, they send some of their profits to a great program. Also, impressive that you can read and actually know what the ingredients are.</li>
            <li> Love this all natural soap!</li>
            <li> I got this soap to avoid other commercial soaps with lots of harsh chemicals in it. I really like the smell and initially got this soap as a body wash, but I noticed my skin was drying out very badly when I used it. I now only use it as a hand soap, but notice that my hands are very dry after I wash them. I probably wont buy this again, as my skin doesnt seem to like it that much. I need a more moisturizing soap. I do LOVE that it doesnt have tons of chemcials in it and that its natural.</li>
            <li> Best product for cleaning make up brushes I have ever found!</li>
            <li> Smells good, cleans, rinses off cleanly and I can use with no allergic or &amp;#34;sensitivity&amp;#34; problems. A little drying for me but I just use my Kiss My Face moisturizer and problem solved!  (I always use moisturizer after washing anyway due to very dry skin)&lt;br /&gt;Yay Kiss My Face products!</li>
            <li> As a shampoo or hand wash, it gives you the clean of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s with the coniditoning of coconut oil, without caking as long as you wash it all out. I&#x27;m a repeat purchaser.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for in a hand soap.  Smells wonderful.  I plan to keep stocked in this soap.</li>
            <li> softly scented, cleans well.  fragrance doesn&#x27;t &#x27;cling&#x27; like many other soaps (mainly the &#x27;regular&#x27; kind)&amp;#34;. minus 1 for the fact like other Castile soaps the spout eventually gets clogged which requires intervention (cleaning).  word of advice: one doesn&#x27;t need an entire pump to receive a suitable quantity of soap from this container - seems downright wasteful to use an entire pump each time.  I use only 1/3 to 1/2 pump at the most each time.</li>
            <li> Kiss My Face is an excellent product line.  I&#x27;ve been using them for a number of years, and have yet to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Kiss My Face supposedly does not test on animals. This is the main reason I purchase their products, but I have never been disappointed. This is a very nice soap. Cleans well, feels good. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great hand soap for the bathroom as the fragrance is not really strong but smells so clean. It is mild and goes a long way. One of the best things about it is that it contains no sodium lauryl or other toxic ingredients. It is a keeper at my house!</li>
            <li> This soap smells delicious and there is nothing like castile soap for squeaky clean...everything! Kiss My Face is a great brand generally and I suspect this soap was excellent as well. However, the first time I ordered the bottle was cracked and leaking, I asked for a replacement which also arrived cracked and leaking...so I gave up. The little bit that I could smell from the box seemed heavenly though! Not sure if this is a really weak bottle, or bad packing twice in a row.</li>
            <li> this soap is fantastic. only takes a tiny amount ,lathers very well, rinses off easily and no harsh fragrence. love it</li>
            <li> Smells awesome. Gets really foamy like other soaps, but loses the foam pretty quickly as it turns into that typical castille soap texture. It&#x27;s sort of like a squeaky-clean kind of feeling. Either way, I like it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my cetaphil face wash as I have sensitive skin and looking for a product without parabens and other harmful products. i was pleasantly surprised that with the little amount I put in my hands thoroughly washed MY ENTIRE body! So, this bottle has lasted me a long time and I still have a lot left. It smells lovely and doesn&#x27;t leave my body dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will def stick with this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading about it on ewg&#x27;s site. Other soaps dry my skin terribly; so much so that I have actual scabs from scratching. When I use this soap, I csn tell a deifference right away! My skin is healing nicely. I love that there&#x27;s no gross chemicals in it as well. Can&#x27;t wait to try it out on other things!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and have been using it for quite a while now. My hands have a tendency to dry out in the winter months and using a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; soap like this helps a bunch.</li>
            <li> Seriously LOVE this soap. I found it on a clearance shelf while I was pregnant &amp; was so happy to know I was not putting harmful chemicals on my body. We use it for everything. I wash my veggies/fruits with it. When the baby toys need a little scrub, this is the soap I chose. We use it as body wash, hand soap &amp; I have even brushed my teeth with it! YES, you read that right. (Sometimes I do not want to have a minty taste left in my mouth after brushing, so I will use it either after a thorough brushing to get rid of that or in place of toothpaste all together.)</li>
            <li> I love Castile soap and I love Kiss My Face products because they are not tested on animals.  Castile is a pure soap without all the added chemicals that some manufacturers think are needed.</li>
            <li> This is an all purpose soap that says it can be used for everything including dishes. I have found that this does not work well on my dishes as it doesn&#x27;t figh the &amp;#34;slime&amp;#34;, like the residue that is left on the inside of bottles from my pumped breastmilk or the fat residue from cooking hamburger....at least not when its diluted in a sink of water like you would use any other dish soap. If you use a full pump straight on a sponge it works OK for those purposes, but that kind of defeats the value of the product as an &amp;#34;all in one&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, doesn&#x27;t foam very well but get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use too much just because it didn&#x27;t foam, it still cleans perfectly!</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It&#x27;s rated amazingly well by the Environmental Working Group (a 0, the lowest &amp;#34;hazard&amp;#34; rating possible), it smells good, and is a particularly slippery soap which is great for shaving!  I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of liquid soaps for use in the shower and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Nice smell and lather. Makes hands feel dry if you use every time you wash hands. If any of the soap drips down onto label the inks on it run and it looks messy.</li>
            <li> It does the job. Smells nice but is a little drying. I prefer to use Dr Bronner&#x27;s All One used in an old foaming soap dispenser (with water to dilute of course)....that way I can perfect the solution so it&#x27;s not so drying. I think it&#x27;s probably more cost effective too.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and cleans wonderfully. I put a couple squirts in an empty spray bottle and then fill with water. It smells amazing. You can also use it as hand soap. It does not work well as dish detergent- it doesn&#x27;t really foam up enough. But it is a pretty good laundry degreaser.</li>
            <li> this is the best soap ever, i will not use any other  ,  EVER!!!!  LEAVES THE SKIN SO CLEAN AND NEVER DRY.</li>
            <li> Family loves it. Nice fragrance, gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I use this soap for washing practically everything: body, hands, hair, dog, dishes, kitchen &amp; bathroom counters, floor, etc.  I love that it&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell like bleach or ammonia.  The lavender scent smells lovely - they use real essential oils, not synthetic fragrance.  In addition to cleaning, KMF does some good with this soap by donating a portion of its proceeds to a camp uniting Palestinian and Israeli teens.</li>
            <li> Wanting to avoid the creepy labeling on Dr. B&#x27;s castile soap products, I bought this six months ago thinking I&#x27;d totally make my own cleaning products from scratch. It smells good, but I still haven&#x27;t used it!</li>
            <li> I adore this soap. I have been using it for a couple months now as my regular body wash and I love it. The smell is just wonderful (I love lavender!) and I use it along with Kiss My Face&#x27;s lavender shave lotion. I was worried that this type of soap would dry out my skin but it has been wonderful over these last few dry winter months - usually my skin is very dry during the winter but has not been this year. I would not recommend using this soap on your face though. I accidentally splashed some on my face the other day while showering - it hit just below my eyebrow over one eye - and I did have a minor reaction to it. This will not stop me from using the product, the skin around my eyes is incredibly sensitive as it is and I wouldn&#x27;t use this product on my face to begin with, just take it as a precaution. Overall, great product - will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after scrutinizing ingredients and cross checking at Environmental Working Group&#x27;s consumer database. Love the soap, its scent, and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  I tried other brands of soap and they didn&#x27;t compare.  It is important to me that my family uses safe products.  Also it smells fabulous!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I have started using it as shampoo and body wash - for myself and my 3 year old. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I love  this soap and use it for a ton of things. it  makes my hands soft,  doesn&#x27;t irritate my son or husband&#x27;s eczema... I  even use it in my carpet cleaner!  the scent is fresh and nice without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to change over from the dangerous chemicals in the house to safer ones.  I have heard so much praise about castile soap and I figured to try this out as part of my cleaning regiment.  I saw one other poster&#x27;s reviews saying that they used these castile soaps for not only their hands, but for their bodies in the shower and for washing their hair.  So I decided to give it a shot with this one for my body wash and it works wonderfully.  I love the smell of lavender and this stuff really smells good.  My boyfriend on the other hand is not a fan of lavender, but he likes how the soap feels.  We got the lemongrass scented one for use as a hand soap and that is wonderful too.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap to see if I liked it better than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap.  Here&#x27;s my thoughts on it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-  Natural, gentle, chemical free soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  Kiss My Face donates part of its profits to the Seeds of Peace organization, which is apparently a camp for kids to learn tolerance and understanding of others from different backgrounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  Smells great!  (Although I only smell the lavender, no mandarin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  This soap does not lather!  That&#x27;s kind of a bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  More like a gel, and not great for shaving unless you are completely out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you don&#x27;t mind not getting your lather on in the shower and just want a simple, easygoing soap, this one&#x27;s for you!  I think I will go back to my Dr. Bronner&#x27;s though.</li>
            <li> The soap gives me a squeaky clean feeling. Literally. Which I think it the only down side. Once it&#x27;s washed off, it leaves the skin a little dry, but I like being able to use it for anything. Normally, I only use it on my face or as hand soap, because of the naturally healing qualities of lavender and mandarin for acne, acne scars, etc. But occasionally I use it for my bod, or for cleaning. I really enjoy it, even though it doesn&#x27;t lather, as someone else pointed out. I don&#x27;t mind the non-lathering quality. But to each their own! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> This is much better hand soap than anything you&#x27;ll find in the store. It works nicely but doesn&#x27;t contain the horrible chemicals. It&#x27;s pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I oOrdered  for a gift off of a registry, product came with half bottle leaked out. No apparrent damage to tge bottle itself, just messy.</li>
            <li> Nice for people who are trying to find a nice vegan liquid soap to avoid the messes associated with bar soaps.</li>
            <li> smells amazing and you get that fresh and clean feeling after showering.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Lathers well!  A little goes a long way!  Love that it is rated a &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep website!  I am not fond of the strong lavender scent, however.</li>
            <li> Bought this to try and save a little as compared to the Eveybody Soap/Dr. Bronner&#x27;s. As it&#x27;s Castile soap, I expected it to suds up similar to the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, but I&#x27;ve found that I have to use a lot more to get those kinds of suds. The smell is wonderful, a lot milder than Everybody Soap. No residue, very soft on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it&#x27;s a great deal, but I think we may stick with Everybody for the sheer size of bottle and bubbles. We like bubbles. (It&#x27;s purely preference!)&lt;br /&gt;The soap works great, though!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great gentile soap for your face and body and it smells great! Worth every penny! I love the brand.</li>
            <li> This soap has a good lather and is made of all natural ingredients.  It has a lavender scent, which my kids associate with lice repellent, but I don&#x27;t mind the scent.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this soap. Originally bought a small bottle to try and after first use upgraded. Does not leave a film and washes of easily. Especially great to take camping.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Works great.  I keep adding water to it and it&#x27;s lasting forever.</li>
            <li> I care about the environment and I use eco-friendly products when possible.  This is a great choice for green cleaning, especially in the kitchen.  Simply dilute 2 Tbsp in a gallon of water, add a few drops of essential oil or fresh lemon, and use to clean countertops and floors.  Castile soap is great as hand wash too.  So many uses, and it&#x27;s not harmful to the environment or water pipes.  The lavender mandarin has a nice fragrance.  I recommend for anyone who wants to clean the green way.</li>
