            <li>My face is very oily so this product is perfect for not adding greasiness to it.</li>
            <li>YOUR FACE ALSO KIND OF BECOMES IMMUNE TO IT</li>

            <li>I love this product on my face.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find this product that I have used for quite a while at in a money-saving form (5 travel bottles).  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still using it and love it.</li>
            <li>Love this antioxidant serum</li>

            <li>IT GETS RID OF FINE LINES</li>
            <li>My pores still look huge.  </li>
            <li>but i dont think i will purchase something that should be given out as free samples.</li>
            <li>these travel size vials are the most economical way to purchase it..</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth, no sticky at all</li>
            <li>love it so much!</li>
            <li>This is really a great value vs. the full size bottle, and it is nice to have the small size bottle for traveling.</li>
            <li>But on top, I do not think it is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Took these on a recent trip and really loved them.  </li>
            <li>So far, when I remember to apply in the evening, the skin feels really nice in the morning.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this to give to my sister, but decided to try it first ad kept to myself.</li>
            <li>I leave the unopened vials in the fridge to keep them fresh.</li>
            <li>However, this product is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Skinceuticals Phloretin CF is recommended highly by dermatologists everywhere as it is not only excellent for prevention of sun damage (when used in the AM prior to sunscreen products) but also for reversing damage that has already taken place.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been waiting for this new product to be available in trial sizes just like CE Ferulic has been for years.</li>
            <li>The Wal-Mart purchase worked far better and lasted much longer.</li>
            <li>The price of the small bottles compared to the large is a great value.  </li>
            <li>which means I still feel like I want to try it just to be sure - its possible</li>
            <li>I put this on as first layer each morning after washing my face.</li>
            <li>RETAILERS BUY THESE SAMPLE PACKS STRAIGHT FROM SKINCEUTICALS FOR $7.50 A BOX!</li>
            <li>I could feel the difference the first time I applied it.</li>
            <li>After the first hour my skin was tighter.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it leave my skin feeling soft and smooth, I can tell a difference in the reduction of fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I am very suspicious and stopped using it after I finished the first bottle.</li>
            <li>The large bottle would become compromised at some point</li>
            <li>Not only did I get a great purchase, but the sellers \\&quot;A perfume to love\\&quot; also gave me a few lipgloss/makeup samples.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it just doesnt do much for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks.    </li>

            <li>I really like and recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It is not too greasy for my oily skin and my skin tone is much more even and clear since I began using this product several weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>Firstly, I was surprised to find out that the product I purchased was a sample box that should not have been sold on the Amazon market or elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Even my dark circles have diminished significantly!  </li>
            <li>A great opportunity to try the product without paying the expensive cost of a retail-sized bottle.</li>
            <li>Is this normal?  </li>
            <li>The six sample size is the same amount in the $140 size bottle, but these stay fresh because you&#x27;re not exposing them to air all at once.</li>
            <li>Upon getting my package I checked the bottles and it was new and hadn&#x27;t been exposed to air.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this seller by far for CE ferulic.</li>
            <li>It made my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>It is marked &amp;#34;Sample&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>might as well start now, if young, saving your skin.  </li>
            <li>This way they were protected from air and light which are both deadly to vitamin c, causing it to de-stablize and discolor hence losing it&#x27;s effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>Even if it is not exactly equivalent, the discount is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend the product for normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>This product is unlike no other.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only on my second day and feel my skin is less oily and more tight.  </li>
            <li>The small containers are easy for travel and help the product oxidize less.</li>

            <li> i am a 48 yr young black women.</li>
            <li> The product is costly, and has a slight offensive odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found another product with similar chemical combination on the market at a fraction of the price that does the same thing with \\&quot;NO ODOR\\</li>
            <li> I kept mine in the box in the frig and only removed the ampule I was using for a few minutes then</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but its worth it</li>
            <li> Would appreciate feedback from other users.  </li>
            <li> The small travel size bottles last a long time because it takes just a few drops of the serum per application.</li>
            <li> in my experience very few anti-aging products actually work.  </li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d try it for the lightening of dark skin spots on my hands and complexion.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered from others in the past and they were a dark orange color which means it was not new and/or exposed to air.  </li>
            <li> The serum has an odd odor and is making my skin itchy.</li>
            <li> This is typical skinceutical product--</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks smoother and less damaged.</li>
            <li> Frustrating because since these are samples labeled \\&quot;not for resale\\&quot; I have to question whether this is actually skinceuticals Phloretin CF.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.  </li>
            <li> THERE IS A TINY UNIMPORTANT DOWNSIDE</li>
            <li> AFTER A FEW MONTHS YOU DONT NEED TO USE THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> Been using this product for at least a year on recommendation of my determatologist</li>
            <li> Shortly I&#x27;m addicted to Phloretin.</li>
            <li> I am a researcher by trade and can assure you that I do my homework before buying anything this expensive.  </li>
            <li> but it is very expensive  and</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this because it was cheaper than the rest.  I should have listened to the reviews.  It is marked &amp;#34;Sample&amp;#34;.  This company should have never sold this product.  But on top, I do not think it is the real thing.  The consistency, color, and even smell is completely different than the product I have gotten from the actual manufacturer.  I am very suspicious and stopped using it after I finished the first bottle.</li>
            <li> This serum is excellent, it change the texture of your skin and you will get a better complexion.  My boyfriend noticed the change in my skin.  Definitely i recommend it.</li>
            <li> VERRY GOOD! my skin got awesome and because of the size it doesn&#x27;t oxidate! love it so much! i surly recommend</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d rec this to anyone of any age.  might as well start now, if young, saving your skin.  i,m 65 and can see a difference!  wow!</li>
            <li> Skinceuticals Phloretin Cf is an effective serum to lighten age spots and give over-all clarity to the skin.  I started seeing the diminishing of some severe age spots within a week.  I especially like these travel size containers as they enable keeping the Vitamin C protected and stable.  I kept mine in the box in the frig and only removed the ampule I was using for a few minutes then replaced it back in the box. This way they were protected from air and light which are both deadly to vitamin c, causing it to de-stablize and discolor hence losing it&#x27;s effectiveness.  The large bottle would become compromised at some point so I prefer this packaging.  Skinceuticals Phloretin CF is recommended highly by dermatologists everywhere as it is not only excellent for prevention of sun damage (when used in the AM prior to sunscreen products) but also for reversing damage that has already taken place.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It makes me wonder - all the reviews I read for this product are outstanding.  this does nothing for me and might even be making me break out.  My pores still look huge.  No difference in fine lines. Nothing.  Frustrating because since these are samples labeled \\&quot;not for resale\\&quot; I have to question whether this is actually skinceuticals Phloretin CF.  which means I still feel like I want to try it just to be sure - its possible it just doesnt do much for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product on my face. Great price. The small containers are easy for travel and help the product oxidize less.</li>
            <li> I ordered the sample sizes to save money, and give it a try before I purchase the regular size.  I just put some on my face, neck and chest but had to use 2 dropperfuls; although the instructions on this site states to use 4-5 drops (perhaps that is referring to the regular size bottle and dropper).  The serum has an odd odor and is making my skin itchy. Is this normal?  Would appreciate feedback from other users.  Thanks.    UPDATE:  I found out from a local day spa that this product is for oily skin; I have dry skin so now it makes sense that it makes my skin itchy. They gave me a sample of same product without the Phloretin for normal/dry skin which I haven&#x27;t yet tried. Will update later.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find this product that I have used for quite a while at in a money-saving form (5 travel bottles).  Easier to use and cheaper !</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. I think it  also tightens and keeps my complexion very bright and clear. I always follow it with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I put this on as first layer each morning after washing my face. Moisturizers go on next. I have seen improvement in skin tone, and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting for this new product to be available in trial sizes just like CE Ferulic has been for years. A great opportunity to try the product without paying the expensive cost of a retail-sized bottle.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. Product is of good quality and would recommend this brand to everybody. Item came at promise time and in good conditions.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my dermatologist over 8 years ago and I&#x27;m still using it and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It is not too greasy for my oily skin and my skin tone is much more even and clear since I began using this product several weeks ago.  Even my dark circles have diminished significantly!  I use this every morning followed by the B5 serum on drier spots (cheeks, around lips, neck)and then finish with an spf 70 sunscreen.  That&#x27;s it.      The sample sizes are a great bargain.  I leave the unopened vials in the fridge to keep them fresh.</li>
            <li> on the box,as others have noted,it says SAMPLE:NOT FOR SALE..Someone is making money off of samples.It is a good product but i dont think i will purchase something that should be given out as free samples.</li>
            <li> This is typical skinceutical product--Great!  My skin feels and looks smoother and less damaged.</li>
            <li> RETAILERS BUY THESE SAMPLE PACKS STRAIGHT FROM SKINCEUTICALS FOR $7.50 A BOX! GO TO YOUR LOCAL ESTHETICIAN WHO SELLS THIS PRODUCT LINE &amp; GET A FREE SAMPLE</li>
            <li> Saw this product demonstrated on Dr. Oz&#x27;s TV show.  Thought I&#x27;d try it for the lightening of dark skin spots on my hands and complexion.  After \\&quot;many\\&quot; applications the spots did lighten, but found as soon as you skip a day, the spots begin to surface.  The product is costly, and has a slight offensive odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found another product with similar chemical combination on the market at a fraction of the price that does the same thing with \\&quot;NO ODOR\\&quot; in the form of a creme at Wal-Mart.  Honestly, don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.  The Wal-Mart purchase worked far better and lasted much longer.</li>
            <li> This seller is by far the best I have purchased my CE Ferulic travel sizes. Upon getting my package I checked the bottles and it was new and hadn&#x27;t been exposed to air.  I have ordered from others in the past and they were a dark orange color which means it was not new and/or exposed to air.  Not only did I get a great purchase, but the sellers \\&quot;A perfume to love\\&quot; also gave me a few lipgloss/makeup samples. I also got a wonderful perfume sample, which I am thinking of purchasing.  I highly recommend this seller by far for CE ferulic. The six sample size is the same amount in the $140 size bottle, but these stay fresh because you&#x27;re not exposing them to air all at once. No oxidized product here.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I was surprised to find out that the product I purchased was a sample box that should not have been sold on the Amazon market or elsewhere. Secondly, I later learned from my dermatologist that the manufacturer of this product asks it&#x27;s physicians only to provide this product through their practices. I consider this Amazon vendor to be unethical.</li>
            <li> Took these on a recent trip and really loved them.  Been using this product for at least a year on recommendation of my determatologist</li>
            <li> Love this antioxidant serum but it is very expensive  and these travel size vials are the most economical way to purchase it..plus if you break one you do not lose it all.</li>
            <li> Great product. Have been using it for years!  Give it a couple of weeks and you will see the results!</li>
            <li> This is really a great value vs. the full size bottle, and it is nice to have the small size bottle for traveling. Love this product! I wouldn&#x27;t be without it! My skin is glowing!</li>
            <li> Great product although it dries VERY quickly because of the alcohol so you have to use quite a bit.  My face is very oily so this product is perfect for not adding greasiness to it.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this to give to my sister, but decided to try it first ad kept to myself. I really like and recommend this product. It made my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> in my experience very few anti-aging products actually work.  However, this product is worth every penny.  Not only does it leave my skin feeling soft and smooth, I can tell a difference in the reduction of fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and cheeks.  The small travel size bottles last a long time because it takes just a few drops of the serum per application.</li>
            <li> This product is the best.  It goes on so smooth, no sticky at all and it makes a big difference in the quality of your skin.  The fine lines seem to disappear and you can tell when you don&#x27;t use it.  It&#x27;s expensive but its worth it and these trial sizes are great for if you travel a lot.</li>
            <li> i am a 48 yr young black women. this product is making my skin look 5 years younger.</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T KNOW WHAT THEY SENT ME - BUT IT WASN&#x27;T THE SAME THING MY DERMATOLOGIST GAVE ME!!!  IT HAD THE CONSISTENCY OF WATER.</li>
            <li> I have used this serum for almost 2 months. I felt in love with it. My skin looks so much better, the toner as well. Shortly I&#x27;m addicted to Phloretin. I definitely recommend the product for normal to oily skin. No doubts about skinceuticals line.</li>
            <li> ALOT OF SKINCARE PRODUCTS CLAIM TO GIVE YOU THAT GLOW BUT LEMME TELL YOU THEY DONT EVEN COME CLOSE TO THIS!!! YOUR SKIN WILL IMMEDIATELY START TO TRANSFORM AFTER ONE USE OF THIS PRODUCT IT GETS RID OF FINE LINES IT GIVES YOUR SKIN AN AMAZIN GLOW !!! IT SOOTHES CALMS AND RESTORES THE ESSENTIAL NEEDS YOUR SKIN CRAVES! THERE IS A TINY UNIMPORTANT DOWNSIDE ITS A STINKY PRODUCT BUT IT DOESNT MAKE YOUR FACE STINK IT LEAVES A SAMLL SMELL ON YOUR HANDS A SORTOF VITAMIN SMELL. AFTER A FEW MONTHS YOU DONT NEED TO USE THE PRODUCT EVERYDAY YOUR FACE ALSO KIND OF BECOMES IMMUNE TO IT BUT I TAKE A BREAK FROM IT AND THEN GO BACK TO IT ! WILL PROBABLY BUY THIS PRODUCT FOR LIFE ALONG WITH THE B5GEL</li>
            <li> great stuff for the skin and great collagen building formula. product arrived on time and in perfect condition.  amazon has great prices. I buy the travel package because it&#x27;s easier to pack.</li>
            <li> So far, when I remember to apply in the evening, the skin feels really nice in the morning. Just have to REMEMBER!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I see a huge difference, but I like the product and the price was great so I will continue using it and will likely buy it again.  The price of the small bottles compared to the large is a great value.  Even if it is not exactly equivalent, the discount is totally worth it. Very glad I found this option.</li>
            <li> This product is unlike no other.  I am a researcher by trade and can assure you that I do my homework before buying anything this expensive.  I could feel the difference the first time I applied it. After the first hour my skin was tighter.  I&#x27;m only on my second day and feel my skin is less oily and more tight.  I can&#x27;t imagine what two weeks will do!</li>
