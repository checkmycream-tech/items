            <li>Excellent turn around and delivery and glad we were able to find just the right price.</li>
            <li>hair is soft and perfect.</li>
            <li>It makes your soft and silky and keeps your highlights and hair coloring looking great for a longer length of time!</li>
            <li>but I used to use and love this shampoo</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but I won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
            <li>I ordered this online because the price is so much better than in a salon.</li>
            <li>I love the way this shampoo feels when washing my hair.  </li>
            <li>Since the chroma riche line is more of a cosmetic line (meaning it isnt meant to strengten hair or moistuirize or anything), i will not be using it again.</li>
            <li>just order it online :)</li>
            <li>My hair is shinier, healthier, and looks all around better.  </li>
            <li>Love how my hair looks - so much more healthier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about a month now, and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair shine more and my chemically-treated strands retain haircolor longer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>After using Karatase for several days I could not believe how wonderful my hair still felt.  </li>
            <li>keeps my hair looking healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I just love them.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to match your hair type to the product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>There are better Kerastase shampoo/conditioners.  </li>
            <li>Oh and this particular kerastase shampoo also smells amazing :)</li>
            <li>However we communicated for a wonderful new hair style and a fabulous new shampoo.</li>
            <li>She recommended the Chroma Riche because I have color treated, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice,but I did fine</li>
            <li>item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
            <li>I also notice a huge difference in the healthiness of my hair.</li>
            <li>It does not make my hair &amp;#34;squeaky clean.&amp;#34;  Instead it is a gentle lather that keeps my hair shiny and healthy and most importantly maintains my color treated locks.  </li>
            <li>It costs more but it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li>It is still a great product overall!</li>
            <li>And, a bonus, no conditioner is needed on a daily basis, just a good conditioning once a week will keep my hair easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the price!</li>
            <li>However sometimes I forget to bring some with me to the stylist and there, they use Kerastaste and it is my second most favorite!</li>
            <li>It also didnâ€™t clean as well or leave my hair shiny.</li>
            <li>I would much prefer using the masquintense or oleorelax in combination with the elixir, these are top notch.  </li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t pay full price and didn&#x27;t want to pay full price, so I found it on Amazon for cheaper</li>
            <li>I love lathering up with this shampoo because it is so gentle on my color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>I hoped this product would eliminate the need for conditioner - it didn&#x27;t-- which is why I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this online as my stylist gave me samples and they were selling it much more expensive at the salon, let me tell you that this is the best shampoo i used the smell and the state it leaves my hair in</li>
            <li>I am used to buying it at a high end salon for more money</li>
            <li>It is not bad, but I am asking myself if it is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I,</li>
            <li>Good shampoo for dry hair.</li>
            <li>The price seems high at first, but you only need a dime size amount to get a great shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair use worth.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>so I thought the splurge for this brand would be worth it.</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo for mature color treated hair that has a tendency to be fragile.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>SO soft and easy to manage and brush even without conditioner it definetly strengthed my hair.</li>
            <li>It might be nice for extremely dry and damaged or curly hair.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Great product, arrived late.</li>
            <li>This product makes it feel like real hair!</li>
            <li>My hairs looks very shine!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used these products.</li>
            <li>Use nioxin for first shampoo, then kerastase bain chroma riche.</li>
            <li>Really, my hair is super healthy, shiny, and growing thicker and prettier than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li>I use this shampoo to keep my color treated hair looking fresh and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thick shampoo with a pleasant scent; it cleans hair well.  </li>
            <li>I have straight hair and still have body using this product line.</li>
            <li>very watery and nonprotective.</li>
            <li>however, really like conditioner chroma riche.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is very sudsy when applied.</li>
            <li>This is NOT the real Kerastase shampoo.</li>
            <li>My high end hair salon gave me some samples of this!</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair very silky.  </li>
            <li>They really do what they say they will.</li>
            <li>I have been going blond over the last year (highlights) and felt I should try the chroma rich line since it is meant for highlighted hair and shine, which i could use.</li>
            <li>So I will look for other shampoo with better smell or price.</li>
            <li>I have to use too much of this product to get a decent lather.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>So if you need to use shampoo, or you have not tried the WEN LINE,then I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>so was happy to find it on Amazon as less expensive and with free delivery!</li>
            <li>I found this product to be the best so far for my very dry scalp and thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have normal type hair that I wash twice a week and use this shampoo and the matching masque.  </li>
            <li>the TRUE Kerastase PURE product.&lt;br /&gt;I am EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>with Keratase, I have not been able to see even a slight color tint in my rinse!</li>
            <li>A small amount goes a long way, and my hair is very clean and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Kerastase products for several years but this is my first purchase of the Chroma Riche shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Totally transformed my dry, color treated hair from coarse to smooth, shiny and very healthy-looking!</li>
            <li>I have very normal hair: not oily, not dry, wavy and lots of body.  </li>
            <li>This Shampoo keep my hair clean, undamaged and doesn&#x27;t weight it down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear, not creamy.  </li>
            <li>and it still makes the texture of my hair really soft and protects my hair in the sun.  </li>
            <li>This cleans very well, just not the same feeling of softness to my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft &amp; shiny.  </li>
            <li>Hair is so much stronger and silky since useing Kerastase, it&#x27;s  made a big difference!</li>
            <li>Good but expensive product.</li>
            <li>The price is somehow high for the tiny quantity of shampoo.</li>
            <li>Its kind of expensive</li>
            <li>I have used this a few times, and after the first time I used Kerastase..</li>
            <li>Inevitably, much of my color has been washed down the drain with these products.</li>
            <li>Need less than a dime size for each application because it lathers up so much.</li>
            <li>Left my hair dry, overly soft and unmanageable.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair.  </li>

            <li> so was happy to find it on Amazon as less expensive and with free delivery!</li>
            <li> I found this product to be the best so far for my very dry scalp and thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have normal type hair that I wash twice a week and use this shampoo and the matching masque.  </li>
            <li> the TRUE Kerastase PURE product.&lt;br /&gt;I am EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> with Keratase, I have not been able to see even a slight color tint in my rinse!</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way, and my hair is very clean and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Kerastase products for several years but this is my first purchase of the Chroma Riche shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Totally transformed my dry, color treated hair from coarse to smooth, shiny and very healthy-looking!</li>
            <li> I have very normal hair: not oily, not dry, wavy and lots of body.  </li>
            <li> This Shampoo keep my hair clean, undamaged and doesn&#x27;t weight it down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear, not creamy.  </li>
            <li> and it still makes the texture of my hair really soft and protects my hair in the sun.  </li>
            <li> This cleans very well, just not the same feeling of softness to my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair soft &amp; shiny.  </li>
            <li> Hair is so much stronger and silky since useing Kerastase, it&#x27;s  made a big difference!</li>
            <li> Good but expensive product.</li>
            <li> The price is somehow high for the tiny quantity of shampoo.</li>
            <li> Its kind of expensive</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times, and after the first time I used Kerastase..</li>
            <li> Inevitably, much of my color has been washed down the drain with these products.</li>
            <li> Need less than a dime size for each application because it lathers up so much.</li>
            <li> Left my hair dry, overly soft and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li> This is not the same formula i ordered before, this shampoo is clear and the other was white.</li>
            <li> I am an avid WEN girl and hardly ever use shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I speak limited French and the stylist spoke no English.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, it&#x27;s not a good choice for color protection and easily just goes down the drain.</li>
            <li> Conditioners make my hair too flat but always felt hair needed something else.  </li>
            <li> It does not make your hair flat either.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was worthless because my hair still felt dry and frazzled, but as I continued using it, it got much better.</li>
            <li> think its a cheap fake from China.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not the same stuff I buy from my beauty</li>
            <li> Now i am a fan of Kerastase and use mainly their Green and orange line as my hair tends to be dry.  </li>
            <li> Itâ€™s a clear gel whereas the product Iâ€™ve used in the past was a white cream.</li>
            <li> Therefore the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair is not soft and is tangled.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but as long as I can afford this luxury, i&#x27;ll treat myself by keeping a bottle in the shower.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and shelled out the big bucks on quality shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I got a very short hair cut recently due to thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> I no longer have to use other hair products with my shampoo such as masks, conditioners, etc.  </li>
            <li> but if you have dry hair and its colored</li>
            <li> However, my hair was dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> It feels dry</li>
            <li> I have hair that is dry because it has gray and is highlighted.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin and fine hair that I have to be careful with.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair usually once every 4-5 days but this left such a greasy residue</li>
            <li> but it will last you a long time if you don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday.</li>
            <li> Use a small amount to make it last long</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy the masque to go with or your hair may feel dried out</li>
            <li> I spent $32 in a shampoo.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount because a little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t let the price scare you away or be the reason you don&#x27;t pamper yourself.  </li>
            <li> this did not coat as the other Keratase shampoos do.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this over the pink bottle that is for long hair because it actually makes blonde hair shiny which is difficult fro processed hair.</li>
            <li> I have long and thin hair and and use this shampoo daily.  </li>
            <li> I only need to use a small amount, for my thick, shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> In deed give me a little bit of a shine hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened</li>
            <li> As usually, Kerastase products are efficient, keep hair protected and moist.</li>
            <li> Thats about half of what I used to use with the less expensive products.  </li>
            <li> duh</li>
            <li> I only use L&#x27;Oreal products and i was very disappointed in my purchase.</li>
            <li> I just want to know if the product was fake or not.</li>
            <li> I agree with the comments that state this product is a FAKE.</li>
            <li> I would use the conditioner too, but it&#x27;s so expensive!</li>
            <li> Now, It&#x27;s just a very expensive blah...</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed because I use all Kerastase products</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the 2 bottles</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to learn Kerastase Bain Mirror 2 was discontinued.</li>
            <li> Horrible product--</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product but if you have dry hair and its colored I would definitely buy the masque to go with or your hair may feel dried out</li>
            <li> I found this product to be the best so far for my very dry scalp and thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair.  This product makes my hair fuller and has shine.  It also helps retain the color on my hair.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the 2 bottles I received.&lt;br /&gt;It appears they have been tampered with and &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34; and NOTTTTT the TRUE Kerastase PURE product.&lt;br /&gt;I am EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T. Kelley</li>
            <li> I read reviews before a I spent $32 in a shampoo. The reviews were good. So I bought it. My hair use worth. In deed give me a little bit of a shine hair. However, my hair was dry and tangled. I contact Kerestase to see if they can send me a sample so I can compare.I just want to know if the product was fake or not. Kerestase respond saying that AMAZON is not authorized to sell they&#x27;re product.I contact Amazon back they refund the amount and the shampoo I threw away.</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened but I used to use and love this shampoo and it was great. Now, It&#x27;s just a very expensive blah...I&#x27;d recommend trying something different.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I use on my color treated hair.  It&#x27;s the only shampoo I have ever used for years on end without thinking about switching.  I would use the conditioner too, but it&#x27;s so expensive!</li>
            <li> My hair colorist who is a friend uses this and recomended it to me.  I have normal type hair that I wash twice a week and use this shampoo and the matching masque.  I can go 12 weeks in between coloring my hair.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I do not have to use this every time I shampoo.  I use it once a month and it still makes the texture of my hair really soft and protects my hair in the sun.  Best shampoo I ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I have to use too much of this product to get a decent lather. It&#x27;s okay, but I won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this online because the price is so much better than in a salon. Great product for over treated hair. I have straight hair and still have body using this product line.</li>
            <li> I love the way this shampoo feels when washing my hair.  A small amount goes a long way, and my hair is very clean and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> Now i am a fan of Kerastase and use mainly their Green and orange line as my hair tends to be dry.  I have been going blond over the last year (highlights) and felt I should try the chroma rich line since it is meant for highlighted hair and shine, which i could use. So there I went and got the shampoo, mask and leave on fluid. None of these products did anything for my hair, I have not noticed color improvement or added shine . I would much prefer using the masquintense or oleorelax in combination with the elixir, these are top notch.  Since the chroma riche line is more of a cosmetic line (meaning it isnt meant to strengten hair or moistuirize or anything), i will not be using it again. Hope this helps</li>
            <li> Wish I would have gotten the creme instead.  This cleans very well, just not the same feeling of softness to my hair.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever.  Leaves hair soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have very thin and fine hair that I have to be careful with. This Shampoo keep my hair clean, undamaged and doesn&#x27;t weight it down. When I moved to Alaska I didn&#x27;t know where to find it...duh just order it online :) Still my go to Shampoo</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to learn Kerastase Bain Mirror 2 was discontinued. This is no substitute. Left my hair dry, overly soft and unmanageable. I wouldn&#x27;t order this again, especially when considering the price.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this over the pink bottle that is for long hair because it actually makes blonde hair shiny which is difficult fro processed hair. Expensive but worth it. Use a small amount to make it last long and it lathers great!</li>
            <li> Perfect condition. Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Horrible product-- very watery and nonprotective. In my opinion, it&#x27;s not a good choice for color protection and easily just goes down the drain.</li>
            <li> The price seems high at first, but you only need a dime size amount to get a great shampoo. Thats about half of what I used to use with the less expensive products.  Therefore the bottle lasts a long time. I use it alone and sometimes with conditioner &amp; my hair always feels good to the touch.</li>
            <li> I received a sample from Birchbox and ordered this from Birchbox. My hair was amazingly soft. But I didn&#x27;t pay full price and didn&#x27;t want to pay full price, so I found it on Amazon for cheaper so I ordered it. My hair is not soft and is tangled. It feels dry and like I didn&#x27;t even wash it. I think this product is not the same as what it should be.</li>
            <li> It is not bad, but I am asking myself if it is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I, however, really like conditioner chroma riche. So I will look for other shampoo with better smell or price.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and shelled out the big bucks on quality shampoo.  After repeatedly loving how my hair felt from my stylist washing it with Kerastase for years, I was a fan.  She recommended the Chroma Riche because I have color treated, fine hair.  I have not been disappointed with my purchase.  My hair is shinier, healthier, and looks all around better.  I love lathering up with this shampoo because it is so gentle on my color treated hair.  It does not make my hair &amp;#34;squeaky clean.&amp;#34;  Instead it is a gentle lather that keeps my hair shiny and healthy and most importantly maintains my color treated locks.  My hair loves Kerastase and so do I!  I highly recommend this product. You only need a small amount because a little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t let the price scare you away or be the reason you don&#x27;t pamper yourself.  You deserve to have beautiful hair!  Treat yourself!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the  product yet I&#x27;m still waiting for the conditioner. I received the oil yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;  The you&lt;br /&gt;  Donna Louaillier</li>
            <li> Great product and great service</li>
            <li> Great product, arrived late.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Rucci came thru perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!!  Totally transformed my dry, color treated hair from coarse to smooth, shiny and very healthy-looking!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is awesome.</li>
            <li> This product changed my hair. It&#x27;s smoother, shinier and easier to manage. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Great product for fine and colored hair.</li>
            <li> My hair does not respond well to this shampoo. Disappointed because I use all Kerastase products</li>
            <li> This is not the same formula i ordered before, this shampoo is clear and the other was white.I only use L&#x27;Oreal products and i was very disappointed in my purchase.</li>
            <li> best shampoo i&#x27;ve ever used.  I have very normal hair: not oily, not dry, wavy and lots of body.  all my life i&#x27;ve used shampoo and conditioner.  with this all i use is the shampoo!  hair is soft and perfect.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for people who color their hair.</li>
            <li> Love how my hair looks - so much more healthier. Kerastase has great products.</li>
            <li> For highlights hair excellent</li>
            <li> I have hair that is dry because it has gray and is highlighted.  This product makes it feel like real hair! It&#x27;s very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have a constant waxy feeling on my scalp after using this product 2X.&lt;br /&gt;I think its a cheap fake from China.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not the same stuff I buy from my beauty salon.&lt;br /&gt;Beware!</li>
            <li> Everything is perfect in Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very sudsy when applied.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair usually once every 4-5 days but this left such a greasy residue I could only go 3 days. Skip this.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years at the recommendation of my hair stylist. I have now ordered for a friend and she also is very pleased with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo, I don&#x27;t even need a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I agree with the comments that state this product is a FAKE. This is NOT the real Kerastase shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product is not what I thought it would be. Itâ€™s a clear gel whereas the product Iâ€™ve used in the past was a white cream. It also didnâ€™t clean as well or leave my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I have ordered it several times.</li>
            <li> I got a very short hair cut recently due to thinning hair.  I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about a month now, and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair shine more and my chemically-treated strands retain haircolor longer.  I&#x27;m definitely pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I think I read somewhere this did not coat as the other Keratase shampoos do. At first I thought it was worthless because my hair still felt dry and frazzled, but as I continued using it, it got much better. I feel the coating on it after washing.</li>
            <li> I have long and thin hair and and use this shampoo daily.  It cleans well and never seems to build up. I use this product along with Kerastase&#x27;s conditioners.</li>
            <li> My high end hair salon gave me some samples of this! It makes your soft and silky and keeps your highlights and hair coloring looking great for a longer length of time! It is worth the price!</li>
            <li> On a recent trip to Paris I wandered into a tiny hair salon.  I speak limited French and the stylist spoke no English.  However we communicated for a wonderful new hair style and a fabulous new shampoo. After using Karatase for several days I could not believe how wonderful my hair still felt.  I just knew I would never find it once I was home, but should have known I could count on Amazon!  Great to be able to order online.  I will continue to order this great shampoo for hair with color, which leaves my hair shiny and silky with each washing.  And, a bonus, no conditioner is needed on a daily basis, just a good conditioning once a week will keep my hair easy to manage.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So happy with this!!! I have used this a few times, and after the first time I used Kerastase.. I felt like rushing to my computer to leave 5 star feedback!! It lathers up great, so you don&#x27;t need a lot during each use. I also notice a huge difference in the healthiness of my hair. I would recommend to anyone! Oh and this particular kerastase shampoo also smells amazing :)</li>
            <li> As usually, Kerastase products are efficient, keep hair protected and moist.</li>
            <li> I have used a multitude of shampoos labeled for use with color treated / processed hair. Inevitably, much of my color has been washed down the drain with these products. with Keratase, I have not been able to see even a slight color tint in my rinse! Expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Amazing finish. keeps my hair looking healthy and shiny. Need less than a dime size for each application because it lathers up so much. Its kind of expensive but it will last you a long time if you don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I am an avid WEN girl and hardly ever use shampoo.  However sometimes I forget to bring some with me to the stylist and there, they use Kerastaste and it is my second most favorite! So if you need to use shampoo, or you have not tried the WEN LINE,then I highly recommend this product.  Smells nice,but I did fine it stripped some of my color out in the wash which it is NOT supposed to do but used with its partnering conditioning treatment and leave in conditioner your hair will look and feel great!</li>
            <li> Truly amazing shampoo. It leaves your hair soft &amp; shiny.  Unlike any I have used before.  Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> My hairs looks very shine!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I only need to use a small amount, for my thick, shoulder length hair.  It&#x27;s clear, not creamy.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t smell like a perfume factory.  It&#x27;s pricey, but as long as I can afford this luxury, i&#x27;ll treat myself by keeping a bottle in the shower.</li>
            <li> I ordered this online as my stylist gave me samples and they were selling it much more expensive at the salon, let me tell you that this is the best shampoo i used the smell and the state it leaves my hair in is unreal... SO soft and easy to manage and brush even without conditioner it definetly strengthed my hair.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to use other hair products with my shampoo such as masks, conditioners, etc.  Conditioners make my hair too flat but always felt hair needed something else.  I love this shampoo!  It costs more but it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I have an oily scalp and this shampoo makes it even greasier. I bought this because my hair is short so I thought the splurge for this brand would be worth it. The quality is great--nice packaging, consistency and scent but I would not recommend this shampoo for oily scalps. It might be nice for extremely dry and damaged or curly hair.</li>
            <li> Really, my hair is super healthy, shiny, and growing thicker and prettier than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo to keep my color treated hair looking fresh and vibrant.  It makes the time between coloring last longer.</li>
            <li> Very good product for colored hair.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! I am used to buying it at a high end salon for more money so was happy to find it on Amazon as less expensive and with free delivery! My husband does not care what he washes his hair with and sometimes just goes with bar soap. UGH. I bought one of these for him and he has to admit he loves it.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair very silky.  Good shampoo for dry hair.</li>
            <li> item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used these products. I just love them. They really do what they say they will. This shamoo has a wonderful fragrance too. It does not make your hair flat either.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo for mature color treated hair that has a tendency to be fragile. I also use nioxin. I shampoo 2-3x a week. Im 54 and color my hair. Use nioxin for first shampoo, then kerastase bain chroma riche. Hair is so much stronger and silky since useing Kerastase, it&#x27;s  made a big difference!</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo. It&#x27;s making my  hair manageable and shiny . The price is somehow high for the tiny quantity of shampoo.</li>
            <li> Good but expensive product.</li>
            <li> Excellent turn around and delivery and glad we were able to find just the right price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Kerastase products for several years but this is my first purchase of the Chroma Riche shampoo.  It&#x27;s a thick shampoo with a pleasant scent; it cleans hair well.  My tinted hair tends to frizz unless I also use a conditioner.  I hoped this product would eliminate the need for conditioner - it didn&#x27;t-- which is why I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars.  But the price couldn&#x27;t be beat.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is the best line of hair products ever. This type of hair shampoo is perfect for my hair. In my mid-forties and I spend a fortune on hair and skin products. This is absolutely worth every penny. Just be sure to match your hair type to the product. They have it. Will definitely re-order. Love it.</li>
            <li> There are better Kerastase shampoo/conditioners.  I use volume and Bain Satin 2 as well weekly and prefer them over this one.  It is still a great product overall!</li>
