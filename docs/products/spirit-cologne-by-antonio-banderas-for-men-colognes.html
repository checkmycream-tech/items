            <li>WORTH $50 BUT GREAT FOR $25</li>
            <li>If your are into a mild, sweetish smell its good.</li>
            <li>I found this scent for my husband many years ago.  </li>
            <li>This scent costs a fracture of what I used to spend, and I love it on my husband.  </li>
            <li>What more do you want from a cologne?</li>
            <li>Now, does he love or does he love it?  </li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an overbearing scent like most colognes and tends to stay around for most of the day.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne</li>
            <li>So I did what I thought was the next best thing - tried another Antonio Banderas product.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love th scent, and so does my girlfriend.  </li>
            <li>(That my girlfriend loves :)</li>
            <li>get MANY compliments on this cologne.</li>
            <li>As I recall, it must have been 2 years or more ago that I bought it</li>
            <li>ever so i had to buy him another supply of it :-).</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cologne,  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very unique smell, and the closest fragrances I can think of that</li>
            <li>Now I have a full bottle that will just sit there looking nice, but will never be used on me.  </li>
            <li>Incredible value for the price wasn&#x27;t sure at first it was the real thing because of the price</li>
            <li>Spirit offers a nice mild sent at a great price.  </li>
            <li>I found it is quite easy to order from Amazon</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a lighter more fresh scent, I also got \\&quot;Chrome\\&quot; by Azzaro and \\&quot;Diesel&#x27;s \\&quot;Fuel for Men\\&quot; cologne.</li>
            <li>I bought about 7 different colognes from amazon at one time, and all but this one smelled great to me.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>Because of how helpful pchans review has been I will be certian to add my comments and reviews to more products I purchase at Amazom, be it positive or negitive.   </li>
            <li>Something that might be a mix of woods, leather, whiskey, tobacco, maybe a touch of orange and a hint of sweet.  </li>
            <li>haha :)  </li>
            <li>this shouts &amp;#34;I am a sophisticated confident man,&amp;#34; and the women seam to think the same.</li>
            <li>Very sexy and unique, and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying it, it&#x27;s worth the $20.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of compliments on Spirit, and for the money, it&#x27;s absolutely worth</li>
            <li>Most other products are double the price for this size, so it is a great value as well.</li>
            <li>It is not as sweet or pungent as something like Old Spice but seems to have a lighter semi sweet aroma.</li>
            <li>This is my first product review on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I can only hope this helps others to be more knowlagable about this product.   </li>
            <li>The first time I bought Spirit by Antonio Banderas</li>
            <li>Upon first spraying, it opens with notes of coffee and tobacco.  </li>
            <li>First off, this is not the first time I purchased Spirit.  </li>
            <li>fast s&amp;h!</li>
            <li>and iv already got comps about it on the first day.</li>
            <li>Because, the smell from the store is more concentrated and last a whole lot longer.</li>
            <li>While good, it was not enough to keep up with Spirit, not by a long shot.</li>
            <li>It seems to last almsot all day, and isnt too strong.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>which are much lighter fragrances.</li>
            <li>fast delivery and product has described</li>
            <li>This is the real McCoy and the atomizer</li>
            <li>This one was actually the one I was looking forward to the most, as it had such interesting ingredients and such.  </li>
            <li>Just as described fast delivery</li>
            <li>Before that, my boyfriend and I were never able to agree on a good cologne for him (he likes old Spice, I&#x27;m not so much a fan).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not detect the aroma minutes after applying but the wife can detect it barely when up close many hours later.  </li>
            <li>I have worn Spirit for the last 5 years and I have to say that what pchan stated about this product is true.  </li>
            <li>Its a deep scent with sweet spices in the smell</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd different Antonio Banderas cologne they are outstanding</li>
            <li>It has decent staying power--eight hours</li>
            <li>Obviously we all have different smells that we like, but this one for me is a no no smell. :-)  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Been looking for this since I graduated high school.</li>
            <li>It is a decent masculine men&#x27;s fragrance for the price.  </li>
            <li>No more department store shopping for me when Amazon gives me much better prices and no leg work,parking etc.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I am really pleased to be able to buy Spirit again and at such a bargain as this&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hot chicks simply throw themselves at me when i wear this stuff!</li>
            <li>It is fresh-smelling and is neither strong nor heavy.</li>
            <li>I certainly know everyone has different tastes and preferences</li>
            <li>If you like \\&quot;Tim McGraw&#x27;s Southern Blend\\&quot; or David Beckham \\&quot;Intimately Beckhem\\</li>
            <li>Its not over powering like some are, Its more subtle so someone has to be with in 3  or 4 feet to smell you</li>
            <li>During the drydown, it gets a little sweeter, but not too sweet.  </li>
            <li>My husband was so surprised to see such a big bottle for the price.  </li>
            <li>My only disagreement with the following quote is that I think Spirit is not exceptionally long lasting.   </li>

            <li> My only disagreement with the following quote is that I think Spirit is not exceptionally long lasting.   </li>
            <li> Now, I can say with high degree of certainty that the product I got from Amazon online must has watered down with some other ingredient.</li>
            <li> In his review he mentions that this is not the same as previously purchased from a local department store.  </li>
            <li> As it dries down, the cinnamon (which I smell the entire time) mingles with musk, amber, patchouli, and incense.</li>
            <li> If it was anymore expensive, it would not be worth it.</li>
            <li> So I bought a gift sampler with a few of the antonio banderas fragrances (\\&quot;Blue Seduction\\&quot;, \\&quot;Spirit\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Antonio\\&quot;)  and \\&quot;Spirit\\</li>
            <li> I used to buy him Eau du Savage by Christian Dior, which cost close to $100 a bottle and was hard to find.  </li>
            <li> so I had to get a few other colognes to wear around her.  </li>
            <li> She said the scent was too heavy for her taste,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Spirit for quite a few years and intend to keep doing so.</li>
            <li> so unless you take a couple of hits every few hours.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it is so hard to find...</li>
            <li> Wife loves the smell of this product---even after a hard day at work she can still smell it on my chest</li>
            <li> This cologne is next to impossible to find in department stores anymore.  </li>

            <li> The cologne smells good and is noticeable when being around women. I would recommend buying it, it&#x27;s worth the $20.</li>
            <li> I found this scent for my husband many years ago.  I used to buy him Eau du Savage by Christian Dior, which cost close to $100 a bottle and was hard to find.  This scent costs a fracture of what I used to spend, and I love it on my husband.  It is fresh-smelling and is neither strong nor heavy.</li>
            <li> Well, it smells great and it&#x27;s inexpensive. What more do you want from a cologne?</li>
            <li> My husband hates Antonio Banderas - but he insists on having this cologne. Now, does he love or does he love it?  No complaints from me; smells great!  Ayyyy Antonio.....sigh....</li>
            <li> Antonio hit it on the nose!  Makes a woman, want to smell it, on her man!</li>
            <li> I buy all my guy&#x27;s fragrances and this is one of my favorites!  I like men&#x27;s fragances that are warm.  Something that might be a mix of woods, leather, whiskey, tobacco, maybe a touch of orange and a hint of sweet.  If you like \\&quot;Tim McGraw&#x27;s Southern Blend\\&quot; or David Beckham \\&quot;Intimately Beckhem\\&quot; you might like \\&quot;Spirit\\&quot; by Antonio Banderas.</li>
            <li> I had this product for awhile and had tested it with the same product form the store. Now, I can say with high degree of certainty that the product I got from Amazon online must has watered down with some other ingredient. Because, the smell from the store is more concentrated and last a whole lot longer. I dont think I will buy anymore colonge online.</li>
            <li> GREAT SERVICES NICE AND FASTER SHIPPING, WE RECOMENT ALLWAYS, FIVE STARS +++++A+A+A+A+A+A+A</li>
            <li> I agree with \\&quot;pchan\\&quot;.  In his review he mentions that this is not the same as previously purchased from a local department store.  I have worn Spirit for the last 5 years and I have to say that what pchan stated about this product is true.  This is my first product review on Amazon. Because of how helpful pchans review has been I will be certian to add my comments and reviews to more products I purchase at Amazom, be it positive or negitive.   I can only hope this helps others to be more knowlagable about this product.   TimBo</li>
            <li> This cologne is next to impossible to find in department stores anymore.  Their loss!  It smells AMAZING!  I bought this as a gift for my husband and the entire experience was terrific.  The price, the product - everything.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> SMELLS GREAT CANT COMPLAIN LADIES LOVE IT BUDDYS WANT TO SPRAY THEM SELVES WITH IT WORTH $50 BUT GREAT FOR $25</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne my wife allows me to wear. It&#x27;s not an overbearing scent like most colognes and tends to stay around for most of the day. Women always compliment me on the smell and want to know where they can get it for their husband or boyfriend.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne. My only disagreement with the following quote is that I think Spirit is not exceptionally long lasting.   \\&quot;It&#x27;s a very warm and spicy scent with hints of tobacco, incense, cinnamon, and spices. It&#x27;s a very unique smell, and the closest fragrances I can think of that come to this are Allure Homme by Chanel, Carlos Santana for Men, and Burberry London for Men. The fragrance has a nice spicy quality to it. As it dries down, the cinnamon (which I smell the entire time) mingles with musk, amber, patchouli, and incense. Very sexy and unique, and lasts a long time! I get a lot of compliments on Spirit, and for the money, it&#x27;s absolutely worth a purchase.\\&quot;  (The quote is from a user at basenotes.net because it is an excellent summary, written better than I could.)</li>
            <li> Spirit offers a nice mild sent at a great price.  Most other products are double the price for this size, so it is a great value as well.</li>
            <li> I love made me relive Good Times</li>
            <li> Discount perfumes don&#x27;t trust them they are some petty thieves if you need help with your business you should have just ask to borrow the 25.00 lol...ha ha discount perfumes are  trash</li>
            <li> I love this cologne it is one of the best out there with a really swagged out smell!!!! All the ladies will love it!!</li>
            <li> The first time I bought Spirit by Antonio Banderas I found it at a local grocery store. But they only carry it at Christmas. So I did what I thought was the next best thing - tried another Antonio Banderas product. While good, it was not enough to keep up with Spirit, not by a long shot. I found it is quite easy to order from Amazon and I&#x27;m happy again.</li>
            <li> Like this cologne glad i found again get awesome compliment</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my husband before. He ran out and I decided to order from Amazon as I always get good prices. No more department store shopping for me when Amazon gives me much better prices and no leg work,parking etc. I always compare before I order any product. Thank you for a better way!</li>
            <li> My mother gave my boyfriend a 1 oz sample of this for christmas and I absolutely love it. Before that, my boyfriend and I were never able to agree on a good cologne for him (he likes old Spice, I&#x27;m not so much a fan).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Big Lots.  Other than tech gadgets, I am crazy about colognes.  This is a warm cologne and it is suitable for romatic evening or some heated bedroom passion.  Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> Upon first spraying, it opens with notes of coffee and tobacco.  During the drydown, it gets a little sweeter, but not too sweet.  It is a decent masculine men&#x27;s fragrance for the price.  If it was anymore expensive, it would not be worth it.</li>
            <li> I love th scent, and so does my girlfriend.  It seems to last almsot all day, and isnt too strong.</li>
            <li> So I bought a gift sampler with a few of the antonio banderas fragrances (\\&quot;Blue Seduction\\&quot;, \\&quot;Spirit\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Antonio\\&quot;)  and \\&quot;Spirit\\&quot; was the one that instantly grabbed my attention. Its a deep scent with sweet spices in the smell and I couldn&#x27;t help from loving it. I have received nothing but good compliments for this cologne with one exeption....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend! haha :)  She said the scent was too heavy for her taste, so I had to get a few other colognes to wear around her.  If you are looking for a lighter more fresh scent, I also got \\&quot;Chrome\\&quot; by Azzaro and \\&quot;Diesel&#x27;s \\&quot;Fuel for Men\\&quot; cologne. which are much lighter fragrances. (That my girlfriend loves :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this a 5/5 in my personal opinion, it is without a doubt the best fragrance by Antonio Banderas that I have tried.</li>
            <li> fast delivery and product has described</li>
            <li> Been looking for this since I graduated high school. I love it!</li>
            <li> get MANY compliments on this cologne.</li>
            <li> First off, this is not the first time I purchased Spirit.  As I recall, it must have been 2 years or more ago that I bought it but a much&lt;br /&gt;smaller amount.  Believe it was about $22 for 50 ml bottle with no pump sprayer.  This is the real McCoy and the atomizer will prevent&lt;br /&gt;me from wasting the product.  Needless to say, I am really pleased to be able to buy Spirit again and at such a bargain as this&lt;br /&gt;over 2 times larger (100 ml) than I was buying at close to the same price. I certainly know everyone has different tastes and preferences but Spirit was made for me.</li>
            <li> The best smelling mens colonge ever!!! I got this for my boyfriend for christmas, he has has this colonge before and i thought it was the best smelling colonge ever so i had to buy him another supply of it :-).</li>
            <li> Excellent price - fast service!  Buy from these guys - you will be pleased!</li>
            <li> Incredible value for the price wasn&#x27;t sure at first it was the real thing because of the price but I&#x27;m pretty sure now it&#x27;s legit, will call manufacturer and check the bar code, great fragrance!!    Tom</li>
            <li> muy buen producto, fue entregado muy rapido. espero volver hacer compras a este vendedor. el perfume es exactamente lo que esperaba</li>
            <li> my husbands favorite !!!! We cannot find it in the stores any more, it is wonderful I don&#x27;t know why it is so hard to find...Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> best stuff iv every smelled in my life will buy again! fast s&amp;h! packaged great and iv already got comps about it on the first day.</li>
            <li> Hot chicks simply throw themselves at me when i wear this stuff!</li>
            <li> Its a good cologne what can I say. If your are into a mild, sweetish smell its good.</li>
            <li> Amazon makes you leave a heading and a comment so I am typing this up to say its a good product and does what it says. If you are reading this, buy it. I don&#x27;t leave 5 stars unless the product exceeds my demanding expectations. If it falls short of doing 100% of what it says, I leave 1 star.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Spirit for quite a few years and intend to keep doing so. Obviously I like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cologne,  Its not over powering like some are, Its more subtle so someone has to be with in 3  or 4 feet to smell you but when they do, they only want to get closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me this shouts &amp;#34;I am a sophisticated confident man,&amp;#34; and the women seam to think the same. I have never had a girl tell me she didn&#x27;t like how I smelt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will use this for the rest of my life (or until production is stopped pray that never happen.)</li>
            <li> I use one spray on the upper chest area and that lasts all day without being over bearing.  I do not detect the aroma minutes after applying but the wife can detect it barely when up close many hours later.  It is not as sweet or pungent as something like Old Spice but seems to have a lighter semi sweet aroma.</li>
            <li> This was given as a Xmas present to a known lover of this cologne. I tried it and I DID like it too.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd different Antonio Banderas cologne they are outstanding</li>
            <li> nice... parfum, like it, thank you so much, i want to buy another for a friend, good purchasing :D very good.</li>
            <li> My husband was so surprised to see such a big bottle for the price.  Great value and loves the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Wife loves the smell of this product---even after a hard day at work she can still smell it on my chest</li>
            <li> Fragrance stays with you</li>
            <li> For the price AB Spirit gives you a good bang for the buck. It has decent staying power--eight hours but projection is so-so unless you take a couple of hits every few hours. The bottom line, however, is that for a celebrity fragrance it comes off like a scent two or three times it&#x27;s cost. Think Gautier&#x27;s Le Male.</li>
            <li> I bought about 7 different colognes from amazon at one time, and all but this one smelled great to me.  This one was actually the one I was looking forward to the most, as it had such interesting ingredients and such.  However, I can&#x27;t stand the smell.  It smells like cigarette or cigar smoke to me.  I sprayed it on, and almost choked from the smell.  Now I have a full bottle that will just sit there looking nice, but will never be used on me.  It seems like others like it, so maybe it&#x27;s just my nose.  Obviously we all have different smells that we like, but this one for me is a no no smell. :-)  You might like it however.</li>
            <li> Just as described fast delivery</li>
            <li> Buy this for my boyfriend it&#x27;s smells great</li>
