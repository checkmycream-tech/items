    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is an excellent copy of Drakkar Noir.</li>
            <li>Say you are already wearing Drakkar, and you just get out of the gym, or done working, and want to freshen up thats the perfect use for this body spray.</li>
            <li>It think NY nights is one of their best products</li>
            <li>Still smells great!</li>
            <li>I was so impressed with its fragrance.</li>
            <li>I met him almost 6 years ago and every day he still smells so good!</li>
            <li>the smell is good, the price is great, and the smell &amp;#34;lasts,&amp;#34; as some people have been wondering.  </li>
            <li>My kind of deal!  </li>
            <li>It is also quite good as a stand alone fragrance.</li>
            <li>received some good comments on this.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to see it available at amazon.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s my favorite fragrance from Designer Imposters, but it&#x27;s great nonetheless.  </li>
            <li>Once we had a contractor working on our house and even HE asked what my husband uses to consistently smell so great!  </li>
            <li>Bought this because I bought another product from this company and liked it.</li>
            <li>scene is addicting and the girls are loving it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really awesome - and I highly recommend his seller !</li>
            <li>Nice deo,,, cheap price and smells great.....</li>
            <li>I own Drakkar Noir, and this does not smell like it to me.</li>
            <li>People often comment to my husband that he consistently smells amazingly good!  </li>
            <li>I hope they NEVER ever stop making this cologne because it&#x27;s really fantastic!  </li>
            <li>no further, these things are an awesome deal.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper and smells way better to me.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect compliment to the real thing or my favorites Classic Match Drakkar Noir, or Al Rehab Dakar.</li>
            <li>NY Nights smells very good and very similar to Drakkar Noir.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never smelled Drakkar Noir before, but this stuff is a huge step up from any body spray that I&#x27;ve ever worn before trying Designer Imposters.  </li>
            <li>Got the body sprays for 2.99 and the colognes for 5.84ish a piece with free shipping when they ran a Labor Day sale.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended if you want designer fragrances for cheap.</li>
            <li>Pay less and get great smell....</li>
            <li>One of the few colognes I ever owned before these cans of body spray was the real Drakkar Noir, which I liked, and this emulation is pretty good;</li>
            <li>This is my most fav deo so far.</li>
            <li>New York Nights smells so masculine, clean, refreshing and compelling!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Deodorant body spray is fine thanks very much……</li>
            <li>I was sooo excited when I found the New York Nights fragrance</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I am very impressed with the stuff.  </li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li>I love everything about this deodarant, except the part where it&#x27;s actually stronger than Axe</li>
            <li>The first time I got this deo in 2011 at walmart.</li>
            <li>I can smell it on my shirt the next day, and people can smell it on me pretty easily for 12+ hours.  </li>
            <li>The drakkar and blue de chanel ones are really good, curve and fierce copies are very similar and good too and last a long time.</li>
            <li>My son loved the smell and wears this everyday!</li>
            <li>A sophisticated nose may be able to sniff out the subtle differences if a wrist-to-wrist comparison is done but for all practical purposes it is just like Drakkar.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to buy this stuff straight from Parfums Decour&#x27;s main website, fragrancerebel dot com, since it&#x27;s cheaper especially when they run sales.  </li>
            <li>but it still is a good reproduction but doesn&#x27;t last as long as the others.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rather musky body spray, making it a very manly fragrance.  </li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t much care for that one</li>
            <li>You could say I am allergic to body sprays but never had that reaction to the REAL THING</li>
            <li>Such a great alternative to the real thing!&lt;br /&gt;Smells just like it, and at a small fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>The smell is strong at first but settles down as the day goes on.</li>
            <li>I would much rather the old pray cologne rather than the body spray, but this is much easier to obtain.</li>
            <li>husband used to wear it all the time when we were first married, our local store stopped&lt;br /&gt;selling</li>
            <li>I have bought this Designer Imposters Fragrance Deodorant, Body Spray, New York Nights for years, at kmart, walmart, target.. then poof..</li>
            <li>i need the key first ,,&lt;br</li>
            <li>reasonably priced, smells similar to Drakkar, but way stronger</li>
            <li>so when applied directly to your underarms-</li>
            <li>I even put cologne on directly and have had no issues, so I can&#x27;t imagine why this is stronger..</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I will probably buy more of this scent in the distant future if I ever run out, but now that I found these impostors, I have enough body spray to last me years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li>When I say different I also mean better, because I haven&#x27;t worn Drakkar since I got this stuff.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve never smelled Drakkar Noir before, but this stuff is a huge step up from any body spray that I&#x27;ve ever worn before trying Designer Imposters.  It&#x27;s a rather musky body spray, making it a very manly fragrance.  In fact, I&#x27;ve tried all of Designer Imposter&#x27;s fragrances, and I mean every last one of them.  This one is definitely the manliest.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s my favorite fragrance from Designer Imposters, but it&#x27;s great nonetheless.  Also, this stuff lasts forever and ever.  I can smell it on my shirt the next day, and people can smell it on me pretty easily for 12+ hours.  Needless to say, I am very impressed with the stuff.  Just make sure to buy this stuff straight from Parfums Decour&#x27;s main website, fragrancerebel dot com, since it&#x27;s cheaper especially when they run sales.  Got the body sprays for 2.99 and the colognes for 5.84ish a piece with free shipping when they ran a Labor Day sale.</li>
            <li> Such a great alternative to the real thing!&lt;br /&gt;Smells just like it, and at a small fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;Will never buy the name brands again.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this.  We will order this item again and again. I wish I could find it in stores. thank you</li>
            <li> This is an excellent copy of Drakkar Noir. It is the perfect compliment to the real thing or my favorites Classic Match Drakkar Noir, or Al Rehab Dakar. Say you are already wearing Drakkar, and you just get out of the gym, or done working, and want to freshen up thats the perfect use for this body spray. It is also quite good as a stand alone fragrance.</li>
            <li> NY Nights smells very good and very similar to Drakkar Noir. A sophisticated nose may be able to sniff out the subtle differences if a wrist-to-wrist comparison is done but for all practical purposes it is just like Drakkar. And it lasts !!! I sprayed some on my skin and one spray on my shirt, it lasted all day on my skin and after 3 days I can still smell it on my shirt. And this is not a cologne, just a body spray !!!!  I got a 5-in-one gift set for a steal that had the imposters versions of drakkarnoir, curve, chanel blue, a&amp;f fierce and aqua di gio. The drakkar and blue de chanel ones are really good, curve and fierce copies are very similar and good too and last a long time. I&#x27;ve never really liked aqua di gio (the real one) so i don&#x27;t much care for that one but it still is a good reproduction but doesn&#x27;t last as long as the others.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended if you want designer fragrances for cheap.</li>
            <li> Scent did not last and caused a rash to break oh wherever it came in contact with skin. You could say I am allergic to body sprays but never had that reaction to the REAL THING the six or so years I have been using it.</li>
            <li> reasonably priced, smells similar to Drakkar, but way stronger</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s signature cologne!  Every time he puts it on, I want to lock on to him! I met him almost 6 years ago and every day he still smells so good! New York Nights smells so masculine, clean, refreshing and compelling!  People often comment to my husband that he consistently smells amazingly good!  Once we had a contractor working on our house and even HE asked what my husband uses to consistently smell so great!  I hope they NEVER ever stop making this cologne because it&#x27;s really fantastic!  I can&#x27;t find it any other place these days except on Amazon so I hope they will continue to provide it!</li>
            <li> Bought this because I bought another product from this company and liked it. The smell is strong at first but settles down as the day goes on. You really can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> It think NY nights is one of their best products made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scene is addicting and the girls are loving it. The smell lasts about 10-12 hours depending on your activity and you&#x27;ll never get tired of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you trying this one.</li>
            <li> I would much rather the old pray cologne rather than the body spray, but this is much easier to obtain. Still smells great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really awesome - and I highly recommend his seller !</li>
            <li> the key is short i need to return it .i need address for return ….&lt;br /&gt;the Rubber key guard is fine but its useless for me i need the key first ,,&lt;br /&gt;Deodorant body spray is fine thanks very much……&lt;br /&gt;Vahag nazarians…</li>
            <li> Nice deo,,, cheap price and smells great..... I recommend this product.... received some good comments on this. Pay less and get great smell....</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness!!! I was sooo excited when I found the New York Nights fragrance again!&lt;br /&gt;My husband used to wear it all the time when we were first married, our local store stopped&lt;br /&gt;selling it and broke my heart. He opened it Christmas day and put a little on...WHEW!!! Took me&lt;br /&gt;back about 20 years!!! THANK YOU!!!! Please don&#x27;t stop making it!</li>
            <li> the smell is good, the price is great, and the smell &amp;#34;lasts,&amp;#34; as some people have been wondering.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this deodarant, except the part where it&#x27;s actually stronger than Axe so when applied directly to your underarms- it&#x27;ll actually burn.&lt;br /&gt;Tried it twice and both times my armpits were on fire. I even put cologne on directly and have had no issues, so I can&#x27;t imagine why this is stronger..</li>
            <li> The first time I got this deo in 2011 at walmart. I was so impressed with its fragrance. I got lot of compliments from my friends and colleagues. I tried to get this deo at walmart again but no luck. I was very happy to see it available at amazon. This is my most fav deo so far. You get the fragrance for 4-6 hrs. Also I would suggest to try masculino from the same brand.</li>
            <li> I have bought this Designer Imposters Fragrance Deodorant, Body Spray, New York Nights for years, at kmart, walmart, target.. then poof.. No one is carrying this smell that i can find.. Oh i take that back. I did find 3 cans at shopko this last week and bought all 3.. I usually always bought 2 to 3 cans at a time..&lt;br /&gt;Whered it go... Why cant i find a local merchant so I dont have to pay for shipping aresols? :(</li>
            <li> Smells like Drakkar, but at a lower price!  My kind of deal!  My son loved the smell and wears this everyday!</li>
            <li> I was looking for this cologne for my sweetheart could not find it in stores so I looked on Amazon and of course found it in minutes!</li>
            <li> One of the few colognes I ever owned before these cans of body spray was the real Drakkar Noir, which I liked, and this emulation is pretty good; almost exact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I will probably buy more of this scent in the distant future if I ever run out, but now that I found these impostors, I have enough body spray to last me years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look no further, these things are an awesome deal.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff. I own Drakkar Noir, and this does not smell like it to me. It smells somewhat like it, but different. When I say different I also mean better, because I haven&#x27;t worn Drakkar since I got this stuff. It&#x27;s cheaper and smells way better to me.</li>
