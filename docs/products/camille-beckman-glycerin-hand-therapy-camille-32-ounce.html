            <li>Love the scent!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hand cream and an excellent bargain in the large size.</li>
            <li>It is very rich, and I&#x27;ve always thought it felt kind of slimy going on...or</li>
            <li>It has a very strong perfume smell, feels greasy rather than moisturizing, and is mostly petroleum.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Beautiful smelling &amp; creamy and leaves your hands feeling very soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li>It is simply the best on the market.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and how have been ordering it by the tub for years.</li>
            <li>I really cannot understand how it could get so many great reviews.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for years.  </li>
            <li>LOVE  </li>
            <li>but I love the smell of it</li>
            <li>This is simply the best hand lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have paid a lot more for a jar of hand lotion, but I have never had these results.</li>
            <li>This makes a great gift, and I have converted a lot of new customers for this product.</li>
            <li>always buy the 4 lbs tub as it is a great buy and last me for up to 8 months.</li>
            <li>We always know what to give the girls on special occasions.</li>
            <li>It is addictive, in a good way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>I have used this cream for many years and it is definitely the best I have ever used as far as keeping my hands soft.</li>
            <li>Talk about super moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is perfect especially for dry skin.</li>
            <li>BUT you get your monies worth because it don&#x27;t take much so</li>
            <li>I have been buying this lotion for my wife ever since we first met.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s far from great: it&#x27;s definitely worse than most hand creams I have used (including Neutrogena, Burt&#x27;s Bees, Eucerine, Crabtree and Evelyn, etc.).</li>
            <li>Exactly what we were looking for, and it arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;Ron</li>
            <li>It came exactly when the seller said it would and was packed well.</li>
            <li>Has a mild rose fragrance that is never overwhelming!</li>
            <li>Family Doc Recommended it &amp; it is better than expected.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>It has absolutely saved my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only kind I like for dry winter hands.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Other than the broken lid, I am very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>I am using this lotion continually which is why I like this large size to refill my smaller containers upstairs, downstairs, in the car...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker than regular lotion and moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li>I love that it isn&#x27;t greasy, and I can actually see the difference in my hands when used a few times a week.</li>
            <li>my wife stands by this stuff and uses it daily her skin is as soft as a baby ,like the product and size.</li>
            <li>Especially when you live in a dry climate!</li>
            <li>this particular cream is NOT heavy on scent and after a few minutes you cant even smell it but keeps your skin hydrated for hours!</li>

            <li> this particular cream is NOT heavy on scent and after a few minutes you cant even smell it but keeps your skin hydrated for hours!</li>
            <li> You can buy this large container, fill your small container and keep the rest in the fridge (got that tip from Camille Beckman company, and it saves me money.)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it, and it is not available in my area any more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> will definitely not buy again - there is absolutely no reason for me to chose this cream over any comparably priced hand creams.</li>
            <li> I started using this lotion when I was a teenager, and it has totally ruined me for any other lotions.  </li>
            <li> lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> It had done wonders for my dry, cracked feet.</li>
            <li> This is old ladies cream, or at least that is what I used to think.</li>
            <li> This is such a delicate fragrance and the size is big.</li>
            <li> This lotion is incredibly thick, and when you put it on, your hands stay soft for hours.  </li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way on dry hands &amp; feet during the winter.  </li>
            <li> and after a few moments it sinks in</li>
            <li> I have been using Camille Beckman Glycirine Hand Therapy for the past 6 years and will not settle for any other.</li>
            <li> It was obviously either packaged with the broken lid</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money on expensive department store lotions.  </li>
            <li> They all feel so watery and thin to me.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the lid was broken and hope that doesn&#x27;t cause the product to dry out.  </li>
            <li> Expensive</li>

            <li> great product I am hooked on this stuff!!!  I have everyone in my family&lt;br /&gt;using this.  We always know what to give the girls on special occasions.</li>
            <li> I have been using Camille Beckman Glycirine Hand Therapy for the past 6 years and will not settle for any other. It is simply the best on the market. And the fragrance \\&quot;Camille\\&quot; is my favourite! &lt;br /&gt;I always buy the 4 lbs tub as it is a great buy and last me for up to 8 months. And my husband likes it too...! &lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the ease of purchasing this wonderful product here!</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way on dry hands &amp; feet during the winter.  Don&#x27;t waste you money on expensive department store lotions.  Love the scent!</li>
            <li> This is a great all around product.  I have been using it for years.  I use it on hands/feet/elbows.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Family Doc Recommended it &amp; it is better than expected. Expensive BUT you get your monies worth because it don&#x27;t take much so lasts a very long time. {excluding those who grab &amp; goop it on}</li>
            <li> I started using this lotion when I was a teenager, and it has totally ruined me for any other lotions.  They all feel so watery and thin to me.  This lotion is incredibly thick, and when you put it on, your hands stay soft for hours.  I brought some into my work and all my co-workers were wanting some, it&#x27;s so decadent!  I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is old ladies cream, or at least that is what I used to think. I was introduced to it at my grandmother&#x27;s house.  I was there and without hand cream, so gave it a try. Talk about super moisturizer. I love this stuff and how have been ordering it by the tub for years.</li>
            <li> Especially when you live in a dry climate! I am using this lotion continually which is why I like this large size to refill my smaller containers upstairs, downstairs, in the car... It&#x27;s thicker than regular lotion and moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hand cream and an excellent bargain in the large size. It&#x27;s the only kind I like for dry winter hands.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this lotion for my wife ever since we first met. that was over 20 yrs. ago in fact im ordering some now. maybe I can get a discount.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream based on the good reviews. Having used it I really cannot understand how it could get so many great reviews. It&#x27;s not bad but it&#x27;s far from great: it&#x27;s definitely worse than most hand creams I have used (including Neutrogena, Burt&#x27;s Bees, Eucerine, Crabtree and Evelyn, etc.). It has a very strong perfume smell, feels greasy rather than moisturizing, and is mostly petroleum.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely not buy again - there is absolutely no reason for me to chose this cream over any comparably priced hand creams.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for years.  I was disappointed that the lid was broken and hope that doesn&#x27;t cause the product to dry out.  Other than the broken lid, I am very happy with the product.  It was obviously either packaged with the broken lid or it was not packaged securely enough to prevent breakage during shipment.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years... best Hand/ body  lotion on the market for me.have recommended to others - the glycerin is key!</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for many years and it is definitely the best I have ever used as far as keeping my hands soft.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were looking for, and it arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;Ron</li>
            <li> I SWEAR THIS PRODUCT HELPS MY ARTHRITIS.!!! and its not slimy...absolutely wonderful everyone should give this a shot...this particular cream is NOT heavy on scent and after a few minutes you cant even smell it but keeps your skin hydrated for hours!</li>
            <li> Very good quality. I use the cream on my feet as well. Works great!</li>
            <li> my wife stands by this stuff and uses it daily her skin is as soft as a baby ,like the product and size.</li>
            <li> Been using Camille Beckman Hand Therapy for YEARS! LOVE  this stuff. And when I found I could get it in the 32 oz. size jar I was very happy. I am using it to refill all the smaller Camille Beckman jars that I&#x27;ve accumulated over the years. It is never greasy. Has a mild rose fragrance that is never overwhelming!</li>
            <li> I can not say enough about this glycerine hand therapy product.  I was given some as a gift several years ago.  As a harpist dealing with split fingers (in the winter time especially) it seemed like a miracle.  I rub it into my elbows and knees every night, and my hands of course.  It is very rich, and I&#x27;ve always thought it felt kind of slimy going on...or something...but I love the smell of it (I only ever buy the Camille scent) and after a few moments it sinks in and I forget about it.  It has absolutely saved my skin.  You can buy this large container, fill your small container and keep the rest in the fridge (got that tip from Camille Beckman company, and it saves me money.)</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years not only as a hand cream but also a body cream.  It is perfect especially for dry skin.</li>
            <li> excellent product. Have used it for 50 years. recommended by pharmacist in 1964.</li>
            <li> Beautiful smelling &amp; creamy and leaves your hands feeling very soft and hydrated! Got this in my birch box &amp; I am very pleased</li>
            <li> this is the only hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used that fully prevents chapping during the winter months.  have never found another product to match it.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best hand lotion I have ever used. I love that it isn&#x27;t greasy, and I can actually see the difference in my hands when used a few times a week. The scent is not overpowering either. I have paid a lot more for a jar of hand lotion, but I have never had these results. I have a smaller size tube in my purse at all times, too. This makes a great gift, and I have converted a lot of new customers for this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is such a delicate fragrance and the size is big. Great value.</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to all my family and my doctor is the one that told me about it. it is great</li>
            <li> Great product. It came exactly when the seller said it would and was packed well. Camille Beckman has a wonderful line. It had done wonders for my dry, cracked feet. NOW I can wear sandals!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it, and it is not available in my area any more.&lt;br /&gt; It is addictive, in a good way.</li>
