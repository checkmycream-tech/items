    <ol>
            <li>Perfect curls every time.</li>
            <li>I have another brand curling wand that works wonderfully</li>
            <li>Great curls with volume.  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great wand.</li>
            <li>And the product works fabulously!!</li>
            <li>and i liked it tried to use again</li>
            <li>As much as I love the orange Bed Head one-inch curling wand, this one is basically garbage.</li>
            <li>This curling wand is awesome, my hair will still have curl the next day after styling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Good quality, heats up quickly, offers a nice curl or wave with the width of the barrel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>our curls do not look smooth.</li>
            <li>You can see the plastic around the buttons looks really cheap as well.</li>
            <li>Seems really cheap.</li>
            <li>Good enough for the cash</li>
            <li>Doesnt feel as great of quality as some of my other ceramic curlers ive had.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>I used the glove when I first started using the wand, but now that I am comfortable with it, I don&#x27;t feel as though I need to use the glove.</li>
            <li>(the light indicator was on and the setting was on high).  </li>
            <li>I have 2 other wands, both of the tapered variety, but I use this one far more because I enjoy the look of the non-tapered curls much better.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Works exactly the way it should.</li>
            <li>The curls hold fairly well, and even on the high setting, it doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair the way my other wands do.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really keep the curl as well as i though it would.</li>
            <li>Really like this wand.</li>
            <li>I did reviewed this product on my channel check it out along with a live first impression</li>
            <li>I chose this particular curling wand because I like the barrel size</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t believe this gets hot enough because my curl will not hold after I remove the curling wand from my hair.</li>
            <li>I can use this one to make super loose waves, but definitely not for the curls I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing a different one.</li>

            <li> Great curls with volume.  Heats up quickly.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  Gave me the &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; look I was going for.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really keep the curl as well as i though it would. Had to keep re-doing the curls before leaving the house.</li>
            <li> I got a defective item. It did not heat up at all even after I waited 10 minutes (the light indicator was on and the setting was on high).  My problem was that I threw the box and am trapped with this defective item.  Tried sending it back but it was outside of the 30 day return window.  I should have opened the item sooner.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! And the product works fabulously!!</li>
            <li> Perfect curls every time. Works great.</li>
            <li> used it once and i liked it tried to use again does not work anymore</li>
            <li> Heats up well however our curls do not look smooth. Should have purchased one with a tapered wand.</li>
            <li> It never even worked! I had to send it back immediately. It&#x27;s junk</li>
            <li> Good enough for the cash</li>
            <li> As much as I love the orange Bed Head one-inch curling wand, this one is basically garbage.

            <li> Really like this wand. I have 2 other wands, both of the tapered variety, but I use this one far more because I enjoy the look of the non-tapered curls much better. The curls hold fairly well, and even on the high setting, it doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair the way my other wands do. I wish the heated part was a tad bit longer because I have long hair long and sometimes I run out of room, but I suppose that comes with the long hair territory.</li>
            <li> Works exactly the way it should.</li>
            <li> I did reviewed this product on my channel check it out along with a live first impression demo:&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;FEoN3zH9_xs</li>
            <li> This is a great wand. I have almost shoulder length hair and the wand helps to give my hair beachy waves. The tip of the wand is helpful so that you don&#x27;t burn your fingers holding the wand while in use. I used the glove when I first started using the wand, but now that I am comfortable with it, I don&#x27;t feel as though I need to use the glove.</li>
            <li> I chose this particular curling wand because I like the barrel size and I like that the barrel is even all the way, not tapered. However, I don&#x27;t believe this gets hot enough because my curl will not hold after I remove the curling wand from my hair. I have it on the highest setting. Also, I don&#x27;t find a need to use the glove because it has never even come close to burning my skin. I have another brand curling wand that works wonderfully and my hair will hold the curl for days, but it&#x27;s tapered and the barrel is much smaller.  I can use this one to make super loose waves, but definitely not for the curls I was hoping for. And after a few hours, even they don&#x27;t hang around. They should call it the MEDIOCRE Volume WAVY Wand.</li>
            <li> My hair is impossible to curl - or rather hold a curl. This curling wand is awesome, my hair will still have curl the next day after styling. There is no clip to leave weird indents on my hair either. I even use it to curl my clip in hair extensions. They hold the curl for MULTIPLE uses, even after brushing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Doesnt feel as great of quality as some of my other ceramic curlers ive had. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Good quality, heats up quickly, offers a nice curl or wave with the width of the barrel.</li>
            <li> Seems really cheap. Doesn&#x27;t curl as well as my other wands.</li>
