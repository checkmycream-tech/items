            <li>For dolls it worked great too!</li>
            <li>But the style and look of it are perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>very happy with purchase</li>
            <li>Best wig ever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great wig.</li>
            <li>This wig is amazing!</li>
            <li>I thought that adding hair to the head would be perfect and display the hats much better to promote the sales.</li>
            <li>I love the style of this wig and the bangs are perfect.</li>
            <li>Not a lot of hair, but still a good wig.</li>
            <li>and I even used it for Halloween and it still looked good.</li>
            <li>For the price good wig.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d work great.</li>
            <li>but I actually liked it.  </li>
            <li>The quality is good, but it sheds a pretty good amount.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Color is more orange-y than shown here.</li>
            <li>But they threw in some cute purple socks</li>
            <li>I could not stop touching it.</li>
            <li>but the hair quality is great, It acts like real hair most of the time, And tends to untangle easily with just a mist of water and a quick combing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so the color of the wig was okay on me, but I don&#x27;t care this wig is fabulous.</li>
            <li>This is a nice looking wig for the price but the color is much darker than what is pictured.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just a cheap one that won&#x27;t hold up to lots of use.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a light reddish brown.</li>
            <li>color is more of a warm brown then a blonde, also it was about 1/2 the length I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>cause the color actually looks really good</li>
            <li>Lastly, it&#x27;s not the greatest quality, so it doesn&#x27;t exactly pass the &#x27;real hair test&#x27; very well.</li>
            <li>I purchased this wig just for fun.</li>
            <li>First off, the color is very accurate to the picture, it&#x27;s not blonde</li>
            <li>wig color was good, would be a little darker than i</li>
            <li>The wig seems to be just one grade higher then</li>
            <li>And it lost a lot of strands when I first took it out of the box and put it on....</li>
            <li>not the color I really wanted</li>
            <li>I would say its a very nice costume wig for the price, but it won&#x27;t likely pass as a wig for everyday normal wear.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t meet expectations for everyday use or even moderate use, not the same as picture, only good for cheap Halloween prop!</li>
            <li>The curls fade after a few months, but still looks cute.</li>
            <li>When I brush this wig the curls snap right back into place.</li>
            <li>The wig is very nice but they sent the wrong color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft to the touch</li>
            <li>(but is so soft).</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much more thin than it was.</li>
            <li>Very short and hardly blond.it is more red and short than long and blond.feels soft though.shipping was okay.not as described.</li>

            <li> This isn&#x27;t a common thing wigs like this are bought for, I&#x27;m a toy/doll collector, I just  recently got my first Japanese Obitsu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, the cap is black, and despite the fact that there is tons of hair in this wig, don&#x27;t expect that black wig cap to hide very well.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could get the long one</li>
            <li> The color wig i got was dark brown instead of the blonde it showed</li>
            <li> I was expecting a long wig due to the picture</li>
            <li> Second, it&#x27;s at least three inches shorter than the pic, and the bangs are several inches longer than pictured.</li>
            <li> Shipping was longer than expected but still within the estimated shipping dates.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality, falling apart right after arrival.</li>
            <li> I have dark skin tone</li>
            <li> but I got a shoulder length slightly wavy wig.</li>
            <li> I think i wasted my money buying it...</li>
            <li> I did adtempt to try it on before dismantling, And it was too small for my head.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll order another one.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit afraid the my big head would stretch the wig cap out of shape, but it didn&#x27;t, it fits on my head so well.</li>
            <li> that doesn&#x27;t mean I can&#x27;t comment on it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was just so unhappy when I took this out and tried it on, it wasn&#x27;t at all like its pictured, the color is off, the curls do not hang and the bangs are way too long.  </li>
            <li> I am thoroughly disappointed in this purchase and wish I never wasted the money on it.</li>
            <li> The look and feel is fake and rough.. not a happy camper!</li>
            <li> its too small for me : (</li>
            <li> , so i won&#x27;t take stars away for the color being wrong.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t look bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with it. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> The wig is shedding very badly for just being removed from the box.</li>

            <li> Not a lot of hair, but still a good wig. I used it for wearing around once in a while and I even used it for Halloween and it still looked good. The curls fade after a few months, but still looks cute.</li>
            <li> This is a nice looking wig for the price but the color is much darker than what is pictured. Shipping was longer than expected but still within the estimated shipping dates.</li>
            <li> I was just so unhappy when I took this out and tried it on, it wasn&#x27;t at all like its pictured, the color is off, the curls do not hang and the bangs are way too long.  The look and feel is fake and rough.. not a happy camper!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a common thing wigs like this are bought for, I&#x27;m a toy/doll collector, I just  recently got my first Japanese Obitsu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually dismantled this wig and made it into doll wigs.&lt;br /&gt;But that doesn&#x27;t mean I can&#x27;t comment on it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great wig. I did adtempt to try it on before dismantling, And it was too small for my head. but the hair quality is great, It acts like real hair most of the time, And tends to untangle easily with just a mist of water and a quick combing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you want this for yourself. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d work great. For dolls it worked great too!</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig just for fun. This wig was for my 7 year-old granddaughter-- she loves playing dress-up with it.</li>
            <li> wig color was good, would be a little darker than i thought.&lt;br /&gt;but its too small for me : (</li>
            <li> The color wig i got was dark brown instead of the blonde it showed but the style is the same as in picture.  But that&#x27;s ok cause the color actually looks really good, so i won&#x27;t take stars away for the color being wrong.  The wig fits well and i would actually go out wearing it.  It&#x27;s too bad it&#x27;s just a cheap one that won&#x27;t hold up to lots of use.  But the style and look of it are perfect for me.  From reading these reviews though, i think each person who orders this product is being sent a different wig, and the one i am reviewing is not the same one as some people got.</li>
            <li> First off, the color is very accurate to the picture, it&#x27;s not blonde it&#x27;s a light reddish brown. Second, it&#x27;s at least three inches shorter than the pic, and the bangs are several inches longer than pictured. Lastly, it&#x27;s not the greatest quality, so it doesn&#x27;t exactly pass the &#x27;real hair test&#x27; very well. But hey, it was eight bucks. I doubt I&#x27;ll ever wear it as the color is totally off for me. Also, the cap is black, and despite the fact that there is tons of hair in this wig, don&#x27;t expect that black wig cap to hide very well.  I would say its a very nice costume wig for the price, but it won&#x27;t likely pass as a wig for everyday normal wear.</li>
            <li> Wig is short  (above shoulders) not the length shown here. Color is more orange-y than shown here. I wish I could get the long one but if I re-order who know what they will send!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t meet expectations for everyday use or even moderate use, not the same as picture, only good for cheap Halloween prop!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality, falling apart right after arrival. Length is also not like shown on picture. And color is different. I think i wasted my money buying it...</li>
            <li> The color was slightly different than picture but I actually liked it.  For the price good wig.  very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> Very short and hardly blond.it is more red and short than long and blond.feels soft though.shipping was okay.not as described.</li>
            <li> The quality is good, but it sheds a pretty good amount. I&#x27;ve had it a while now and it&#x27;s much more thin than it was. I also got this for a cosplay but instead of a blonde wig it was brown. But they threw in some cute purple socks and I did like the wig overall.</li>
            <li> I just received this wig in the mail today and there are several problems with it. 1. I looks nothing like the picture, not the same color or even style. 2. The wig is shedding very badly for just being removed from the box. I am thoroughly disappointed in this purchase and wish I never wasted the money on it.</li>
            <li> I currently make hats for craft fairs and use the foam heads to display the hats.  I thought that adding hair to the head would be perfect and display the hats much better to promote the sales.</li>
            <li> The wig seems to be just one grade higher then the crappy straw ones you can buy from costume stores.&lt;br /&gt;The color is more of a warm brown then a blonde, also it was about 1/2 the length I thought it would be. And it lost a lot of strands when I first took it out of the box and put it on....I&#x27;m very disappointed with it. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> This wig is amazing! It&#x27;s so soft to the touch, I can&#x27;t believe this is synthetic hair. I could not stop touching it. It feels like human hair. I was a little bit afraid the my big head would stretch the wig cap out of shape, but it didn&#x27;t, it fits on my head so well. I love the style of this wig and the bangs are perfect. You can&#x27;t see my hairline, when I push the bangs to the side. I have dark skin tone so the color of the wig was okay on me, but I don&#x27;t care this wig is fabulous. When I brush this wig the curls snap right back into place. It&#x27;s very ful with lots of volume and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my head. I am wondering if the have this same wig but in another color for my skin tone? I am keeping this wig and definitely wear it occasionally, just have to learn to keep my hands out of it (but is so soft). Best wig ever.</li>
            <li> The wig is very nice but they sent the wrong color. I recieved a reddish brown colored wig. Not sure if I&#x27;ll order another one.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a long wig due to the picture but I got a shoulder length slightly wavy wig. not the color I really wanted but it doesn&#x27;t look bad. sheds a bit though.</li>
