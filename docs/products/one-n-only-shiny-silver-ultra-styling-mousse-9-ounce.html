            <li> it keeps grey and silver hair from getting that &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; look.</li>

            <li> Other mousses or gels require daily washing.</li>
            <li> Just use this - either on wet or dry hair - which sets everything - holds -  and makes hair shine</li>
            <li> Some people complained about the Shiny Silver shampoo leaving their hair too soft.  </li>
            <li> I just blow dry using my fingers and a round brush: Voila!</li>
            <li> It gives my hair a little bit of body and also makes it shiny.</li>
            <li> That said, it still does what I want it to do - gives my roots a little lift.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to purchase in the local store I had been going to for years.  </li>
            <li> So sorry we´ve heard the product will be discontinued</li>
            <li> I was desperate!  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

            <li> Works well brings the silver out in your hair.</li>
            <li> Lets me style my hair after washing, leaving it soft and not greasy</li>
            <li> Have been using this for several years, but can no longer get in stores locally. I find that it helps keep the &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34;  out of gray/white hair. Also use the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mom.  She has a  beautiful grey healthy hair.  So sorry we´ve heard the product will be discontinued</li>
            <li> This is a great mousse. Covers any yellow on my white streaks of hair. Nice body and control for hair.</li>
            <li> This product is for my husband.  He was using the gel and just discovered it is now discontinued.  I ordered this for him to try and he likes it very much.  It controls his hair and makes the gray look silver and shiny and very attractive!</li>
            <li> I like this mousse a lot.  My gray is brighter but best of all my hair is softer and more manageable.  I have short hair and usually need to blow dry and then use a hot brush to get the control I need for volume in the right places and to hide my cowlick.  Using this mousse I just blow dry using my fingers and a round brush: Voila!</li>
            <li> This mousse isn&#x27;t available locally anymore so I knew to try Amazon to find it.  I have been using it since I let my hair go gray back about 4 years ago.  It&#x27;s great because it keeps the yellow away and gives my hair some extra body.</li>
            <li> Some people complained about the Shiny Silver shampoo leaving their hair too soft.  Just use this - either on wet or dry hair - which sets everything - holds -  and makes hair shine</li>
            <li> Tones yellow down in my hair, which was my objective. Also adds body to my hair. Will purchase again.</li>

            <li> I was unable to purchase in the local store I had been going to for years.  I was desperate!  So happy to find this product........it keeps grey and silver hair from getting that &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm taking away the yellow in my gray hair!</li>
            <li> This mousse gives nice volume to my white hair and causes no discoloration.</li>
            <li> I thought this worked really well. It gives my hair a little bit of body and also makes it shiny.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest for eliminating yellow and bring out the platinum in your hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for gray hair</li>
            <li> I like the mousse that goes along with the gel is this particular brand.  Now I find out that th e beauty supply store no longer can get this item.  Been discontinued.  Thanks a shame</li>
            <li> Almost looks to yummy for your hair. Leaves hair silky and shiny. Love it!</li>
            <li> It does the job of styling, but it does NOT give shine to the hair. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> This mousse works wonderful on graying hair and gives it a beautiful look.</li>
            <li> I love it..  Can&#x27;t find in supply stores around me anymore.  It works great to keep the yellow out of my totally while hair. A very good product, I recommend to many</li>
            <li> I liked it but like the gel better. It does a good job. I mainly wanted it because I needed control while keeping my hair white. A good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice but so far, I do like it. It isn&#x27;t too sticky...nice, light mousse.</li>
            <li> Great light mousse. I can go two days without needed to wash. Other mousses or gels require daily washing.</li>
            <li> BEST mousse ever for blondes!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a problem with the delivery mechanism, but it doesn&#x27;t foam, just sort of spits out.  That said, it still does what I want it to do - gives my roots a little lift.  I just rub the liquid that comes out in my hands and apply it to my silver roots.  I use a lot of silver enhancing products as I grow out my hair and will probably use this again and order from this supplier - shipping was fast.</li>
