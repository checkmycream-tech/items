            <li>Also great for camping/backpacking.</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>But as a person that likes to bite my nails and chew on stuff this is pretty awesome!</li>
            <li>Now I think that&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Consider: Why does it cost more, ratio wise, when you buy more?</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s been an interesting adventure.</li>

            <li>product is interesting.  </li>
            <li>They arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s really smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Miswak is a far superior brushing tool than the toothbrush/toothpaste.</li>
            <li>it feels like a clean that I have never received before.</li>
            <li>Flavor not bad like a mild pepper flavor.</li>
            <li>I would tell anyone who wants to get rid of cavities, have clean teeth, and have strong teeth to use this product.</li>
            <li>Feels much better on the teeth and offers a much deeper clean.</li>
            <li>Very moist and fresh!</li>
            <li>still haven&#x27;t tried it, it smells funny.</li>

            <li>Really didn&#x27;t expect what I was getting when I ordered these.  </li>
            <li>It took only 2 days to get comfortable, using the Miswak.</li>
            <li>, how this can help so much.</li>
            <li>Really like the miswak, one that I like was the feeling in my tongue</li>
            <li>and I like being able to sit down and do something else (read or watch TV) while doing my teeth.</li>
            <li>Only problem though is brushing the inside of teeth, can&#x27;t seemed to be able to place it in the back so you can brush it.</li>
            <li>I believe I&#x27;ve found a new way if brushing.  </li>
            <li>ALL the stain from my tea drinking was completely gone!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how white my teeth are, and I&#x27;ve been trying to find something natural for a LONG time.</li>

            <li> These are strange and we are keeping them as backup to our regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Not natural ones.</li>
            <li> once you get it down, you will never want to go back to using regular plastic synthetic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I actually dabbed a little Doterra essential oil on there and that helped</li>
            <li> Other than that, the outside with no problem.</li>
            <li> Say if you buy single item 3x, it would be cheaper than buy item as a three pack and so on...</li>
            <li> I had an extreme tooth ache and this knocked it out permanently within minutes.</li>
            <li> Not really sure what exactly to do with them, as there is no way to get them in behind the teeth.</li>
            <li> Also, removed subtle yellowing on my teeth and now I can wear red lipstick.  </li>
            <li> my saliva production increased at least 60%.</li>
            <li> It is tasteless to me</li>
            <li> threw away my sonic care brushes and toothpaste, my senstive to cold and bleeding gums were gone after 3 days of use.</li>
            <li> Weird smell and taste!</li>
            <li> We were very skeptical about this product, but after watching utube info videos, decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> My wife tried it and the flavor is AWFUL</li>

            <li> great alternative to toothbrush</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how white my teeth are, and I&#x27;ve been trying to find something natural for a LONG time. It is tasteless to me and I like being able to sit down and do something else (read or watch TV) while doing my teeth.</li>
            <li> If you get the fatter ones, they work great!  The skinny ones - not so great.  Really didn&#x27;t expect what I was getting when I ordered these.  It&#x27;s been an interesting adventure.</li>
            <li> Miswak is a far superior brushing tool than the toothbrush/toothpaste. Feels much better on the teeth and offers a much deeper clean. Also great for camping/backpacking. However, in the 10packs, I find that about 1/2 to 1/3 are simply too big to actually use. Not really sure what exactly to do with them, as there is no way to get them in behind the teeth.</li>
            <li> i love miswak as a toothbrush alternative. There is definitely a learning curve when getting used to it as a toothbrush, but please please dont give up. once you get it down, you will never want to go back to using regular plastic synthetic toothbrushes. the shipping was also great on this product. got here in 3 days</li>
            <li> Perfect! I had an extreme tooth ache and this knocked it out permanently within minutes.</li>
            <li> Just got these in the mail! Weird smell and taste! But I got used to it. I actually dabbed a little Doterra essential oil on there and that helped and then I put some Doterra toothpaste on there and cant stop chewing on it.I love it! Can&#x27;t wait to notice changes in my dental health. I will write another review for that when I notice changes. But as a person that likes to bite my nails and chew on stuff this is pretty awesome!</li>
            <li> Just as described, happy with purchase</li>
            <li> threw away my sonic care brushes and toothpaste, my senstive to cold and bleeding gums were gone after 3 days of use. gums feels and looks very healthy. my saliva production increased at least 60%. food taste better.</li>
            <li> I would tell anyone who wants to get rid of cavities, have clean teeth, and have strong teeth to use this product. I got all ten Miswaks and I am grateful. I have enough to last me for a while now.</li>
            <li> I did some research -- looking for items to replace the plastic in my life, starting with my toothbrush. Found a lot of positive comments/articles on the Miswak stick. So I ordered a package. They arrived very quickly. I opened one today, followed the instructions: trimmed the end, rinsed it, then chewed it for a minute or two to turn the end into a brush (quite literally.) After cleaning my teeth with the stick (no toothpaste, just water) ALL the stain from my tea drinking was completely gone! Now I think that&#x27;s amazing. And I will be giving these to everyone else in the family. My highest recommendation!</li>
            <li> These are so great.  Three days after I started using, my gums no longer bleed when I floss.  Also, removed subtle yellowing on my teeth and now I can wear red lipstick.  Package arrived quickly and product works great.  I will definitely reorder from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> It took only 2 days to get comfortable, using the Miswak. I have already seen a difference, in my teeth and gums. We were very skeptical about this product, but after watching utube info videos, decided to give it a try. It works and I am still amazed, how this can help so much. We give 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Not natural ones. Processed.</li>
            <li> This is THE way to Brush your teeth!!</li>
            <li> Very moist and fresh!</li>
            <li> Really like the miswak, one that I like was the feeling in my tongue that&#x27;s really smooth and shiny. Only problem though is brushing the inside of teeth, can&#x27;t seemed to be able to place it in the back so you can brush it. Other than that, the outside with no problem.</li>
            <li> product is interesting.  I believe I&#x27;ve found a new way if brushing.  it feels like a clean that I have never received before.</li>
            <li> Took time to get use to. Flavor not bad like a mild pepper flavor. When I am done I rinse and store in a travel toothbrush holder. Will continue to use</li>
