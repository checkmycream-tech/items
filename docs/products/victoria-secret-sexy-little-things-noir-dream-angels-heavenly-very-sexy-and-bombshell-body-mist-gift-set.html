            <li> I looked on amazon for this product and saw that it was sold out but a few days later it came back in stock so i ordered it right away. I received the product within 4 days!!! Not only was the timing great (i was worried it wouldn&#x27;t arrive before Christmas) but the condition was great and the money i saved compared to the in store price was great!</li>
            <li> The scents which were included were all great.  I love that the bottles are plastic; easy to travel with and I don&#x27;t have to worry about them breaking.  Great product!</li>
            <li> You are selling this for 48 dollars and it says 40 in that round pink sticker in the picture. Do you not realise that??</li>
            <li> This is an amazing gift set. I bought it to sample the different scents, after already having the Dream Angels Heavenly. So worth the money! I would definitely recommend this!</li>

            <li> La presentación en la caja es muy bonita tal como se apreciaba en el anuncio, llegó muy rápido y bien. Para repetir</li>
            <li> My hubby knows I love Victoria&#x27;s but can never keep up with what my favorite scent is at the moment.... That made this the perfect gift for him (and me)! He didn&#x27;t have to worry as much about getting something I didn&#x27;t like &amp; I got at least 2 or 3 of my favorites! Bombshell is one of my least favorite but my sister loves it so she&#x27;ll be getting that mist in with her birthday present! :-)</li>
