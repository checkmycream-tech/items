    <ol>
            <li>Best of luck to those who try it!</li>
            <li>Its perfect for these!</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my daughter,she is very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Zeno for about 3 months, and it is wonderful!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with my results.</li>
            <li>Is it perfect?  </li>
            <li>Even when it is perfectly working fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with mine and wish I had known about the zeno months ago!  </li>
            <li>Zeno Acne Clearing Device with 60-Count Cartridge  very good!</li>
            <li>Very good concept!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome stuff.    </li>
            <li>(That was a very happy surprise.)</li>
            <li>this product is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, but not a miracle cure!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!!</li>
            <li>After using Zeno for about 6 months, I wanted to write in to let others know that I have had incredible results using it on my cystic type pimples too.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy-</li>
            <li>I was happy, and no longer felt that sense of dread when I felt a pimple coming -</li>
            <li>Bottom line is, it would be great -</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t THAT great.</li>
            <li>Great for those monthly flare ups on the chin and forehead.  </li>
            <li>He also puchased the Zeno Acne Cleaning Device &amp; has been happy with his results.</li>
            <li>and I have to say it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Side effects are not that great.</li>
            <li>Great product..</li>
            <li>I almost wept with joy.    </li>
            <li>Tomy great surprise</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product, it makes a great gift for anyone!</li>
            <li>When I started using Zeno it worked great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen anything work so great for me.  </li>
            <li>Think about that for a nice change!</li>
            <li>I really love my Zeno and wanted everyone to know how wonderful it is.  </li>
            <li>Took it to Florida for my brother&#x27;s wedding, the bride used it the night before and had good things to say also.</li>
            <li>My daughter used this on Christmas day and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Really good for boils too.</li>
            <li>All I know is they don&#x27;t make a good product.</li>
            <li>and I still want to give it a fair chance.</li>
            <li>good luck</li>
            <li>This seems like it could be a good product</li>
            <li>I gave it a good shot and used it on upcoming pimples for a week.</li>
            <li>This is the best I have ever found and recommend it highly to everyone!!!</li>
            <li>Very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>My husband also has the Mini ( which he was very pleased with &amp; uses when he travels ).</li>
            <li>So, this is my first try and things are great!  </li>
            <li>but now I doubt I will even see it for two more days!  </li>
            <li>And it works out magically!</li>
            <li>but that is way better than weeks!   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better not to have to pop a pimple and risk infection and scarring!  </li>
            <li>I have this one, the Pro, the Hot Spot, and the Heat Treat-- they all work, and this one is probably the best!</li>
            <li>We called the company and they offered amazing support.</li>
            <li>Amazing.    </li>
            <li>This thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Also I think it depends on the kind of acne you have because it didn&#x27;t work on mine.  </li>
            <li>I have tried literally every acne-prevention product and any kind of home remedy you can think of (at one point I even tried to use toothpaste to burn off the zits).</li>
            <li>But it is absolutely the best thing out there for those monsters under the skin.  </li>
            <li>When you read the instructions, they give you a list of the kind of pimples it DOESN&#x27;T work on.  </li>
            <li>When it worked, I liked using it.      </li>
            <li>How can they sell this kind of product?</li>
            <li>The Zeno feels warm when it touches your skin.  </li>
            <li>This product has worked for me, although it hasn&#x27;t been 100% effective.</li>
            <li>Worth the $$$$$!!!</li>
            <li>It works best on new pimples.  </li>
            <li>Better yet, it is so comforting knowing that I can effectively fight any zit that begins to form on my face.</li>
            <li>This product has a nice believable concept, but doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that it was most effective in immediately reducing the swelling.  </li>
            <li>Wow I can&#x27;t believe how great Zeno works!  </li>
            <li>I always use the product 3 times on a blemish, and I have found that the most effective treatments have been when I have been able to use Zeno every four hours during the course of a day.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for someone with skin that&#x27;s even slightly sensitive -- you probably won&#x27;t have a very pleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>well...it seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Hope this helps! :)</li>
            <li>Works okay on some blemishes</li>
            <li>Just make sure you get the pimple ASAP.</li>
            <li>But most people I know who have had a zeno end up getting rid of it.  </li>
            <li>,it&#x27;s not some magic device,i think if you have acne problems skip it and go to a doctor</li>
            <li>and it is on top of my nose</li>
            <li>I was so pleased.</li>
            <li>My skin didn&#x27;t look any better.  </li>
            <li>I dislike the protective timer that prevents you from using it for more three times in a row.</li>
            <li>Either way I love it</li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>Most of bumps would go away over night.</li>
            <li>If you have tried everything, and aren&#x27;t ready to spend the money on a doctor, this is a great choice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This will force you to buy more cartridge to use the product because it has in memory how many times you used it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>5 or more</li>
            <li>Will I buy more?</li>
            <li>it most send a \\&quot;specific\\&quot; amount of heat etc.\\</li>
            <li>Also my Zeno product no longer will charge and I made sure a lamp worked in the outlet just to make sure my outlet was not the problem.</li>
            <li>Stick with creams, they seem to do the job much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I have used many products, - if not all of them -.</li>
            <li>With this product you can give your skin some more time to heal and regenerates itself.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.   </li>
            <li>Well I question if many of the glowing reviews are legitimate.  </li>
            <li>This works more efficiently, basically).</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve been hanging around HP ink-jet printer marketeers it seems :-)</li>
            <li>I guess for most people.  </li>
            <li>But about a week ago, after feeling the telltale signs of two more developing blemishes, I decided to take the plunge.</li>
            <li>iam glad this product worked for some people!&lt;br /&gt;no</li>
            <li>is a fact of life for many teenagers as a result of hormone changes taking place in their bodies as they become adults.  </li>
            <li>so glad I got this product.</li>
            <li>I took a risk, as the product is not inexpensive, but I am more than satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>No improvement on any of my acne after many attempts.</li>
            <li>and it kept the charge for more than two weeks of usage (at which time I returned</li>
            <li>Overall, this isn&#x27;t a perfect solution, but it has helped!</li>
            <li>Somebody needs to take this electric pimple heating idea and execute it better.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s my Zeno substitute which I have found works even better than Zeno itself.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Zeno.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out a better method to \\&quot;heat\\&quot; the pimple to kill the germs inside.</li>
            <li>After trying so many products like proactive etc.</li>
            <li>The sooner I ice it, the better the chance of prevention.</li>
            <li>I had) and does a semi okay job at those stubborn surface pimples.</li>
            <li>since retin-a thins the top layer of your skin.  </li>
            <li>I say \\&quot;usually\\&quot; because it&#x27;s not some magical miracle product that makes ALL of your pimples disappear David Copperfield style.  </li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s a better option than tearing up your face with a needle or your fingers.</li>
            <li>I wonder though if maybe heating some water up to a certain temperature, dipping a metal spoon in it and then resting the very warm spoon over your zit wouldn&#x27;t save me money in the end...</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews about the Zeno and was very excited to get it.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Proactive as a teenager and it works out pretty good</li>
            <li>I would recommend that if you are interested in buying this device, to consider trying a good clay mask instead.  </li>
            <li>Nice idea, nice advertising, good delivery, but it did not function beyond the initial use.</li>
            <li>It was quite funny, but they loved it and some have gone out to purchase one.  </li>
            <li>The confidence gained by having a clear face is great.  </li>
            <li>And after reading all the fabulous reviews, I was even more convinced.  </li>
            <li>The product clearly states that it works best at the first signs of a pimple.</li>
            <li>So far the Zeno has been great.</li>
            <li>I have had my Zeno awhile, and it has always worked great with my adult acne--</li>
            <li>I rarely get the kind of acne that Zeno caters to, but when I do, they NEVER go away.</li>
            <li>She has very fair skin and red hair and breaks out easily.</li>
            <li>What a great, chemical free way to keep your skin clear!  </li>
            <li>and yes it really has done a good job with quickly clearing up my acne!  </li>
            <li>It works for me, and I find it so easy to use too.  </li>
            <li>so it wasn&#x27;t easy to do in the morning when you have a hectic schedule.  </li>
            <li>After reading reviews, many people stated that it did help with their more severe acne, so I thought it would be worth to try.  </li>
            <li>1-5 pimples would be easy to do.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use, and I always take it with me when I travel.  </li>
            <li>but it was too strong &amp;</li>
            <li>strongly advise anyone who purchases a Zeno to begin using it as soon as it arrives.  </li>
            <li>I own this Zeno product and all it does is get hot.</li>
            <li>but thats fine because it worked (supposedly) on the exact kind of acne</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get a lot of pimples, and they aren&#x27;t huge, but when I do, this thing makes them go away very quickly.</li>
            <li>I was told it worked fine.</li>
            <li>Instead of heat, I have found what works better for me and my mild acne is to ice my pimples.</li>
            <li>Zeno seems to work fairly well, but you have to be very diligent about catching newly emerging zits.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I was able to sell it for close to what I originally paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>now that is a huge \\&quot;wow\\&quot; factor in my book.</li>
            <li>I bought Zeno before my wedding, and that day I was acne free.</li>
            <li>I rarely have more than 3 pimples on my face at once.  </li>
            <li>worth the money for sure.</li>
            <li>My wife and I guarded against placebo effect and if anything, were biased against believing the device would work.</li>
            <li>this has produced such a great turn-around in his complexion.</li>
            <li>One important thing is the time of applying Zeno.</li>
            <li>The price would suggest a better than 50% success rate and for that reason I would stay away from the Zeno Acne.</li>
            <li>10 Watt \\&quot;candelabra base\\&quot; incandescent light bulb ($2)  3.</li>
            <li>Night light with replaceable bulb ($2)  4.</li>
            <li>Everyone is responsible for their own actions.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides that, there was no reason for me to even mod it to make me able to use it more than the amount allowed because after using it for awhile, it has never worked or done a thing for me.</li>
            <li>However, the Zeno is more \\&quot;safe\\&quot; because it is controlled on how the temperature is, though, it wouldn&#x27;t even matter since it doesn&#x27;t do much anything to most</li>
            <li>Warm compresses with a washcloth are nice but this actually targets it with a timed treatment.</li>
            <li>As long as you catch it in the first couple of days, Zeno works perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is a very useful adjunct to acne therapy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how excited I was to learn about this product.  </li>
            <li>It is no more. :D    </li>
            <li>and I am pretty sure this zit would have still been</li>
            <li>Got it yesterday and was so excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited about trying out this product.</li>
            <li>I was so excited that I brought my Zeno and some alochol swabs with me to my tennis lunch</li>
            <li>You have to hold this device for awhile and your hand would started to get tried and it would slip away from the pimple you originally wanted to target.</li>
            <li>They work just as well as the original heads.  </li>
            <li>(The original cartridge worked as described.)&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>Then I had another one on my nose, a large red spot just under the surface, an ideal situation for what was described in the instructions.</li>
            <li>- so perhaps it would make a difference if I were able to use it more frequently.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and defenitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>How did they diminish right away?!</li>
            <li>Using the Zeno machine is done at bedtime right along with brushing her teeth and her skin once again looks like peaches and cream!</li>
            <li>Works great while it works, but after 2 years of very limited use, it crapped out.  </li>
            <li>I have used the product at the first signs of moderate acne and the product works great.</li>
            <li>While I was happy with the one I had that worked and would rate it higher, I&#x27;m not going to try a third time.</li>
            <li>I can testify that it is true, as the manufacturer states,</li>
            <li>The good news is that those zits didn&#x27;t become big and didn&#x27;t scar when they healed.  </li>
            <li>pimples that would take a full week or 10 days for me are gone in 2 or 3 days.  </li>
            <li>After my second cartridge, it didn&#x27;t seem to work as good.  </li>
            <li>it is a dream come true.    </li>
            <li>Now with Zeno, it prevents that growth and heals it to good extent that you can try your topical for boosting the removal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cool device and a cool concept.  </li>
            <li>have used it over the last month in conjunction with Clearzine and have good results with fewer zits.</li>
            <li>This product might only be good for a 2 or 3 pimple.  </li>
            <li>The cool thing about the Zeno is that it feels like you&#x27;re shooting a laser at your face.  </li>
            <li>All it really did for me was bring most of my pimples to head, which of course led to me messing with them.</li>
            <li>Although Amazon customer service indicated I would have to pay for return shipping, I received a full refund (and was not charged for shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course this is used in addition to good daily hygiene of washing and cleaning my face twice a day.</li>
            <li>After trying it numorous times and multiple times on the same pimple all I got was a nice warm feeling and nothing more.  </li>
            <li>Everyone should be so lucky.    </li>
            <li>\\&quot;more than one controlled study\\&quot; but not regulated by the FDA or anyone else unless specified, and therefore worth, as I see it, about as much as a zit on my face.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;The light indicators illuminate in a nice indiglo blue color- the heating button and the treatment button</li>
            <li>After the second use, the pimple was even with my skin and reducing in size more and more.  </li>
            <li>Definitely the perfect tool to add to your daily regiment.</li>
            <li>To be honest I really can&#x27;t see someone using this for their whole face either.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s helped tremendously.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used a Zeno, you should know the tip is very hot.</li>
            <li>If it feels very hot but tolerable, you can hold it on your pimple for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>The price may seem high, but it could be more than worth it for you too.</li>
            <li>All the great reviews, FDA approval and the high price led me to buy this device thinking \\&quot;finally something that will work\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>And no creepy chemicals!</li>
            <li>This is not anything high tech...AVOID!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>I was willing to spend anything if it worked!  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who does not have many pimples any more and would like something less evasive on their face but still want pimple free.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, the (painless) burn faded more quickly and completely than the zit would have, so I would probably do it again if I had to.    </li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>I stayed clear and confident.  </li>
            <li>whatever... we feel it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li>However, for me, that wasn&#x27;t worth $100 and a two-and-a-half-minute wait.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really speak to how good the product actually works.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t worth the expense.  </li>
            <li>From our experience it is definitly worth trying.  </li>
            <li>they allowed you to use it longer, then maybe I would say go for it, but don&#x27;t be surprised if it didn&#x27;t do more than heat a piece of skin</li>
            <li>Costly, but worth it in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I feel improved self-esteem is worth $80.</li>
            <li>when it actually works, it seems to be effective.  </li>
            <li>While not the miracle fix suggested by the brochure, it does clearly help most of the time in our family.</li>
            <li>I am still struggling to figure out what kind are left.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s success rate, it came out to about $5 a blemish.  </li>
            <li>Having had perfectly clear skin through my teens, 20s, and most of my 30s, I now have post-pregnancy adult-onset cystic acne that began at age 36.</li>
            <li>My experience: cystic acne goes through its normal cycle (rising to surface, becoming a hideous scab, etc.)</li>
            <li>That has made it worth the money for me.      </li>
            <li>Since the time that I have had and used this device, I haven&#x27;t had success on any problem area that was treated.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t think it was worth it and returned it.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it, return it within 30 days.  </li>
            <li>[..]  Don&#x27;t get Zeno happy your first day of getting it (you have to let it charge for like 4 or 6 hours) and don&#x27;t decide to target all your pimples in one day, because the next day you might have a bunch of white heads instead of easy to cover (with makeup) pimples.  </li>
            <li>My 14 year old daughter was very excited to receive the Zeno for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Get to it early, maybe double up on the treatments and continue good hygiene, and it will go away, or be significantly reduced in size and pain.  </li>
            <li>If you got the pimple at just the right time you had some success and it sped up the healing process,</li>
            <li>The other reviewer here points out that it says \\&quot;for most people\\&quot; or \\&quot;for most acne\\&quot;, as if this is a loop hole.  </li>
            <li>What I did was check my face twice a day for suspicious bumps to treat them right away.</li>
            <li>The size of the pimple diminishes right after the use and disappears at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work on all kinds of acne and you have to use it at just the right time before the pimple forms in order for it to work.</li>
            <li>It feels so good when applying heat to a pimple knowing that you are destroying it, it is just sweet.</li>
            <li>Pros: works sometimes on certain pimples; cool tech device    </li>
            <li>Thus, you can actually walk outside your home feeling a bit more confident in your appearance!</li>
            <li>The best thing is that the only thing needing replacment are the cheap bulbs and they last a very long time because they&#x27;re not running at full voltage.    </li>
            <li>is MUCH smaller and goes away much more quickly.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ll gladly put up with the price tag because ultimately my social life is worth it.  </li>
            <li>But it is worth it if you&#x27;re willing to put the time and money into it.  </li>
            <li>Any device like this, most devices/tools in general don&#x27;t work for everyone.  </li>
            <li>The only type of zits it had a significant effects on were zits that could have easily been -- pardon me -- dealt with manually.</li>
            <li>You must follow directions exactly or you won&#x27;t see the right results</li>
            <li>It is surprising to see anything other than positive comments.</li>
            <li>It kind of feels like touching a sunburn as first (to me at least), but you do get used to it.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t work well on mature zits though, which is fine because that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s intended for and from experience</li>
            <li>Here are my skin stats, to help others make a best guess about whether Zeno will work for them: I&#x27;m in my late 20s and have combination skin and mild to moderate acne.  </li>
            <li>Well, I was so excited about my new toy that I thought \\&quot;what the heck\\</li>
            <li>It looks like it&#x27;s working at first, and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure everyone responds to this treatment differently, but I received mine 4 days ago and have used it on 2 cystic acne formations on my face, and within 36 hours the cyst did not hurt anymore.</li>
            <li>The effect wasn&#x27;t as effective as I expected.</li>
            <li>If used correctly, at the first sign of a pimple, this device eliminates  pimples within 24-48 hours.</li>
            <li>The first one we received wouldn&#x27;t charge.  </li>
            <li>It does work,k better than creams and such.</li>
            <li>Wait until you hear the first beep.</li>
            <li>Mystery surrounding some magic degree of Fahrenheit in which \\&quot;acne-bacteria\\&quot; decides to go packing like the mucus cartoon in that cough medicine commercial.   </li>
            <li>and the heat eased the pain at first.</li>
            <li>It did seem to make my pimples go away faster at first.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m perfectly aware that this device doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
            <li>I let the battery charge for about 8 hours before my first use.  </li>
            <li>You need to be consistent on treatment.  </li>
            <li>First sign of acne and I am on it.  </li>
            <li>So many products claim to do something and this one actually does.  </li>
            <li>it really works!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like placing a spoon under really hot water and holding it to your face.</li>
            <li>&quot; this product only works in ironing the pimple and doesn&#x27;t seem to kill bacteria any better than benzyol peroxide.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even get me started on all the replacement heads I bought with my initial Zeno purchase in hopes I found something innovative.</li>
            <li>Products that contain benzyol peroxide as a lotion and sulfur as a mask to spot treat has worked pretty well for me.</li>
            <li>it AT LEAST shrinks it to a great extent.</li>
            <li>It is hot so</li>
            <li>at first, you may be a bit worried if it&#x27;s supposed to be THAT HOT.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, if I don&#x27;t treat a pimple within the first day, then the Zeno is useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But even then, it&#x27;s better than leaving it to the next day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the device when I first notice</li>
            <li>I would never have bought this in the first place</li>
            <li>Simply put, this is a device that people should be confident in investing in.</li>
            <li>It really does!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it does this exactly, but you can feel it working.  </li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s so much more convenient than running back &amp; forth heating up a wash cloth that never makes it disappear anyway.</li>
            <li>the only purpose for this so called website is to get your email nothing more.</li>
            <li>On some more sevsitive pimples it can feel hot for the initial contact and then you cannot feel the heat at all.  </li>
            <li>and I was pretty disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was told that the difference between the first two is the number of uses (90 versus 60).  </li>
            <li>My Zeno turned off once within the first 30 seconds, so I charged it for 24 hours</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I was able to return it and get all my money back.</li>
            <li>I have found this works great because it stays hot for as long as I want to treat the zit, and there&#x27;s no waiting in between times if I have a second area that needs treatment.</li>
            <li>I was given credit for the first one and am hoping that I will be given credit for the one that just arrived today.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still giving it 3 stars though, because you can return it if it doesn&#x27;t work in the first month, so</li>
            <li>It works pretty well for them.  </li>
            <li>When I tried to charge it for the first time, it never took a charge, despite trying several times and even for more than the amount of time recommended.</li>
            <li>One fault is the hot spot is located towards one side of the device, so that cap was always popping off when I held it against a pimple.</li>
            <li>And on top of that the tip did not last 60 treatments</li>
            <li>After the first time I charged it something happened and the alarm signal did not go off in time.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so I was ready to try something new and something that I felt like would be safe with minimal side-effects</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I&#x27;ve tried a couple other similar products on the market, but this one is the most consistently effective.</li>
            <li>Place the bulb on the zit and SLOWLY increase the dimmer until very warm.</li>
            <li>What is has done for me is bring the blemish up more quickly, decrease the time I have to deal with the embarrassment, and it keeps the problem from spreading to other pores nearby.  </li>
            <li>It works much better if applied as early as pimple has developed.</li>
            <li>The zit would seem to get better, only to come back really huge.    </li>
            <li>Wait until another cycle is ready and re-use until you hear the first beep.)</li>
            <li>I was very skeptic of this product at first.</li>
            <li>You do really need to use it at the first sign though.  </li>
            <li>And, you can use the clay mask on your whole face to help prevent zits from forming in the first place.        </li>
            <li>This is the first product I have used that really works.  </li>
            <li>No sign of life whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller who was very responsive, but suggested I try to rectify things with Zeno customer service first.</li>
            <li>but I honestly didn&#x27;t realize how long that would feel if you stay true to the instructions and do multiple applications on one zit in a day.    </li>
            <li>If this device worked as advertised I would not mind paying the high cost, but unfortunately, its just another excellently marketed scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no problem posting positive remarks for products that work as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m curious how the product would have worked if I would have been able to use it at the first signs of the pimple.</li>
            <li>Cheap way of doing the exact same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nowadays people are more cost-consious than ever when it comes down to buying something that&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Until they justify the need for replacement tips, or eliminate the counter in the tip that causes it to stop working after a certain number of uses, I cannot recommend this device to anyone.</li>
            <li>, however I can certainly caution (without hesitation) about my experience and about the supposed guarantee:  </li>
            <li>I have large under the skin pimples, so maybe it&#x27;s not for my type of acne.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it would work on acne or cystic type blemishes, but for the every day, average variety pimple, this works better than any other kind of treatment I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>&quot;, it can&#x27;t make these huge zits any bigger</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s ready, put it on the spot.</li>
            <li>Just as much inconvenience as holding this thing up for 2 minutes.    </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research before purchasing this product and all the while I just wanted to know what it really does.</li>
            <li>The chin spot never came to a head but didn&#x27;t do much anything else either.  </li>
            <li>What works, really works, for me?</li>
            <li>no problems with refund thanks to amazon</li>
            <li>which is a absolute No-No for scarring reasons and contamination reasons.</li>
            <li>I do not have to use it as much as I used to..</li>
            <li>This method worked very well for me.     </li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t notice any results.  </li>
            <li>This really is a ripoff...   </li>
            <li>I have used the Zeno and have not really seen anything magical.  </li>
            <li>I have used this many years ago for which I just tossed it after the \\&quot;cartridge\\&quot; went empty.</li>
            <li>Your skin is an experiment when it comes to finding what work, but I whole heartidly</li>
            <li>I am very aggressive, though.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest getting a replacement head at the time you get the Zeno itself as it does run out fast</li>
            <li>had I known I would have to invest so much money in it every month.</li>
            <li>The heat absolutely works to kill the bacteria and make the zit go away faster.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to rip on this thing and call it junk, but I have to admit IT WORKED.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s cheaper than going to the dermotologist (who in my experience, really can&#x27;t do a damn thing.)  </li>
            <li>it really gives them self confidence when they need it</li>
            <li>This really did not do anythign for my pimples.</li>
            <li>If you have plenty of pimple, you used up the tip so fast.  </li>
            <li>It takes too much time waiting and zapping your pimple.</li>
            <li>, when treated very aggressively with Zeno.</li>
            <li>Be very aggressive.</li>
            <li>But everyone&#x27;s all impressed by the fact that you never have any pimples, even when you&#x27;re in the muggy heat of the North Q&#x27;uinos atmosphere.  </li>
            <li>But if you get frequent non-cystic outbreaks like I do, no matter how well you cleanse, it is worth the cost.</li>
            <li>always very diligent when it comes to acne regimens and treatments so</li>
            <li>In the product details it really should list the type of acne it can not be used for like it does in the device manual.</li>
            <li>Very upset.</li>
            <li>Really, try it for yourself.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few months now, and it honestly does work.</li>
            <li>At first I was a skeptic, I have a 12 yr old going thru the \\&quot;awkward\\&quot; stage, I could not believe it when I saw the results that she was having even after the first use.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with my Zeno that I am ready to purchase another one for my 15 year old son as he has started to struggle with teenage acne.</li>
            <li>Sure, things will break down over time but Zeno doesn&#x27;t get terribly hot and</li>
            <li>Think about it--how many other things with heaters &amp; thermostats do you have to throw away after a certain number of uses.</li>
            <li>, like the instructions told me to, I used it at the first sign of a new pimple.</li>
            <li>I love this product and wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any other \\&quot;gadget\\&quot; in the world.</li>
            <li>And this just didn&#x27;t work for me any better than other acne products do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would avoid buying any Zeno products due to the fact that they just force you to buy more cartridge tip with a memory chip to stop you using for longer than the ammo inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually get excited looking for pimples now so that I can use the Zeno to stop them in their tracks.  </li>
            <li>(I have the original version.)&lt;br /&gt;However two boxes of \\&quot;60 treatment cycle\\&quot; replacement cartridges only gave me 5-6 uses each.  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed by my new Zeno!</li>
            <li>If one were really squeamish about squeezing out burgeoning pimples, then this is a decent device.</li>
            <li>When it doesn&#x27;t, I honestly feel that with continued treatment, the blemishes tend to shrink and don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li>It does leave my fair skin a little red, so I have my concealer ready.</li>
            <li>Not only was this easy to use they are already minimized and some completely gone after 3 days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;ll ever have this kind of data.</li>
            <li>for the heat, it&#x27;s not painful but it definitely takes getting used to.</li>
            <li>and I had my new one within a week!)  </li>
            <li>At first I used it religiously and studiously according to the instructions: use at the first sign of a blemish, 2-3 treatments for each, spread out over 12-24 hours.  </li>
            <li>The replacement they sent me did the exact same thing as the first one, would never take a charge.</li>
            <li>I have only a mild acne problem-  </li>
            <li>A quick daily dose of steamy water, a washcloth, followed up with dabs of $3 store brand salicylic acid gel.    </li>
            <li>But this month, only one became fully grown visible zit and disappearing quickly.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty much, you waste your time and also your money for this to do nothing more than heat up a tip and apply to skin which you can do with another metal tip by warming it up and applying to the skin.</li>
            <li>I left a review on the 90 count device, which is the same device but more uses in the tip.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky to have been listening to the radio when I heard a Zeno commercial.</li>
            <li>I say lucky because I have never heard or seen a commercial for this product before or since.</li>
            <li>and I was starting to develop two large cystic zits right on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>the next morning is more than enough to stop the pimple from forming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to tell if this is a good product, and ordinarily I wouldn&#x27;t write a review if I wasn&#x27;t sure.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions the first few times, and when that didn&#x27;t work, I tried using it more frequently than instructed.  </li>
            <li>The cartridge still contained at least 50% more uses... and the device doesn&#x27;t charge!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product, despite the price tag.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations</li>
            <li>Itz not a magic device that you are going to have clear skin right away and won&#x27;t even be able to tell you ever had a pimple there</li>
            <li>In my opinion if you have a lot of severe acne maybe not the best,it doesn&#x27;t get rid of my pimples in 24 hrs like magic but does shrink da little bugger down so pretty good if you got a pimple and are about to go to a party,just use Zeno shrinks it down and cover the rest with make up.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous because I don&#x27;t normally get this many at once,</li>
            <li>yes you need to get them &#x27;early&#x27; but it does really work.  </li>
            <li>I am using this in conjunction with a very thorough natural skincare regime and improved nutrition, and seeing the results I have hoped for after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>For me this personally worked better when I had those huge deep pimples that you can feel under the surface, hit it once wake up and the next day its incredibly smaller.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my teenager who as the normal occassinal problem with breakouts at inoppertune times.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin.</li>
            <li>Some zits require two treatments but as long as I followed the directions and kept it on for the full time I never had problems with the zits developing..</li>
            <li>in a fraction of the normal time (4 days versus 4 weeks) when treated as directed with Zeno,</li>
            <li>An experience I had with the Zeno sometimes  was when a zit wouldn&#x27;t disappear, but rather accelerate in duration, meaning it would quickly, perhaps overnight after a pre-bedtime treatment, turn into a mature pustule and then pop and dissolve by the morning of the next day.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because I have what I would consider mild to moderate adult acne.</li>
            <li>Waiting overnight to use it a second time has been much less effective (although it&#x27;s sometimes unavoidable).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make them completely disappear overnight, however and it&#x27;s kind of a pain in the ass to hold that thing to your face for two and a half minutes if you have more than one or two red little friends hanging out.  </li>
            <li>I think for me I would only use this for traveling because it is highly convenient but doesn&#x27;t receive much consistent use at home.</li>
            <li>but it def does help,only problem is i have a new pimple every day so</li>
            <li>supposedly brand new but did not even power on after charging.</li>
            <li>It does nothing to prevent new pimples either.  </li>
            <li>But as the years went by, I just sort of accepted that acne was something I am destined to live with forever.     </li>
            <li>and that is when I started doing research on what is new out there in acne treatment</li>
            <li>I purchased a new tip</li>
            <li>My new Zeno didn&#x27;t work from the start.</li>
            <li>I used it about ten times, and though it did not always stop the pimple completely, it certainly shorted it&#x27;s life span (and size!)  </li>
            <li>Later that day the red spot was still there, sore as ever, and the spot on my lip welled up to a HUGE whitehead.</li>
            <li>When, after many attempts, that didn&#x27;t work, I tried using it all different ways -- frequent zapping versus single attempt; two zaps in a row; after cooling my skin with water, after heating it with steam, et cetera.  </li>
            <li>Tip - it is very loud.  </li>
            <li>The Zeno is reccommended for new pimples so that they can be treated at the first sign to stop them from getting any bigger.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It definitely does keep some pimples from becoming major ones and I think it does stop just-forming pimples from actually forming.</li>
            <li>Using it at first site is key.</li>
            <li>Then my husband pointed out...if it&#x27;s hot enough to kill bacteria, it ought to be hot enough to burn the skin.</li>
            <li>The first Zeno I received did not charge properly, so I had to return it through Amazon (with no problems, they don&#x27;t charge for return shipping</li>
            <li>The second one worked for about a month, and when I used it, it worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I had a really big mountian along the side of my nose, and an hour after the first use I could feel the reduction in the size of the pimple.  </li>
            <li>The trick I&#x27;ve noticed, and Zeno advocates, is to catch them when they&#x27;re first starting to arrive - before you can see them, but you feel them.  </li>
            <li>Before making a decision, check out the other versions, you will see many different reviews.  </li>
            <li>but I still get the occasional cystic acne bump,that&#x27;s lg.&amp; hurts &amp; nothing helps but the hot wash cloth.</li>
            <li>so today I went out and bought my first not-cheap replaceable cartridge, only to get it home and find that the non-replaceable battery inside the zeno will no longer charge.  </li>
            <li>I usually do not post reviews</li>
            <li>I love this product and would reccomment it to anyone with small recurrent break out areas.  </li>
            <li>I had a Zeno from a couple of years back that I recently gave to a much younger acquaintance who needed it more than I did.  </li>
            <li>Every once in a while it will actually help the zit be gone in about 12 hours (overnight), which is pretty</li>
            <li>You can see my full review under Zeno Pro Pink.</li>
            <li>I did have 2 new ones come up this week, but I treated both of them twice and one went away completely</li>
            <li>Although it did surface a bit, the size was significantly smaller than it usually would be, and it was already drying up with no scarring which is amazing.</li>
            <li>I am firstly amazed at this technology seeing how it seems so simple and natural (using heat) but yet is so brillant.  </li>
            <li>The first spot I tried it on was already two days old, 1/4 red sore spot welling up under my chin.</li>
            <li>Going outside can make you have a hot face if directly in the sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
            <li>My problem with Zeno has been  that the device is completely unreliable, and I have encountered the exact same problem not once, twice, but three times, so I am finished with Zeno.  </li>
            <li>However, the instructions tell you to use it only on certain pimples and in the very early stages, so I couldn&#x27;t use it when my zits had come to a head.  </li>
            <li>I found several sites with customer feedback, and they were all positive.  </li>
            <li>Make your own decision, but I hope this review helps you decide to keep your money, or at least keep your receipt!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had moderate acne for the past several years and decided to try this after seeing ads and good reviews.</li>
            <li>I only hope the price could be less pricy:)</li>
            <li>The fact that you have to replace the tips is just a royal waste of money and resources (thanks, planned obsolescence!), but if you keep turning the unit on after it automatically shuts off (instead of starting the treatment cycle), you should be able to get the same results and extend the life of the tip.  </li>
            <li>The product actually works on my large, takes a month to clear, cysts.  </li>
            <li>The product states clearly what kinds of acne it does and does not work on.</li>
            <li>Clear Skinned Mississippian</li>
            <li>I feel for the seller, because clearly he/</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it one star, because it did work, but only very selectively.</li>
            <li>But, if you catch it early, it will make it go away.</li>
            <li>Turn off the cycle button, then turn off the thing completely.</li>
            <li>To simulate the experience, run a metal spoon under hot water for about a minute (as long as it takes for the unit to heat up) Leave the water running and repeatedly hold the spoon to the sore spot until the spoon cools, then reheat it.</li>
            <li>I zapped it, and zapped the red, now very sore, spot on my chin again.</li>
            <li>I was ready to squeeze it last night-</li>
            <li>It beeps every 30 seconds and then continues to do so for a complete cycle of 2 1/2 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the device has completed heat up cycle the button turns to blinking Green light-</li>
            <li>it has completely stopped zits in my problem area.  </li>
            <li>I use it early and my face is clear.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a back up when I try the much lighter product Boot No7 cleanser.</li>
            <li>What this product really needs is some independent clinical research.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 years old.</li>
            <li>Additionally, this is a natural solution</li>
            <li>I keep a Zeno in my purse at all times for unexpected outbreaks.   </li>
            <li>So far I seem to have had one that qualified, and yes, it may have sped things up a bit.  </li>
            <li>Clay masks have been around for centuries and some are all natural.</li>
            <li>as for adult acne</li>
            <li>Tried to contact the company through the phone number they advertise and all I get is a busy signal....</li>
            <li>When she does use it the pimples dissappear overnight &amp; her skin doesn&#x27;t get overdried &amp; sensitive.</li>
            <li>I am a 39 year old mom of 2 that has never had a acne problem in my life.  </li>
            <li>My skin is far too delicate and sensitive to tolerate most OTC acne products.</li>
            <li>OR it disappears completely without ever having risen to the surface (after a week or so)</li>
            <li>It does not completely eliminate a pimple, even if applied at the first sign of one coming up.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this in stores a while back because I read nothing but absolute rave reviews in magazines, online, etc.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to learn that whiteheads are not pimples (and therefore, not to be treated with the Zeno).  </li>
            <li>I treated two pimples (in their early stage as instructed in the user manual) and the Zeno seemed to have no effect on either of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The beep every 30 seconds is helpful as it allows the user to keep track of how much longer the treatment will last.  </li>
            <li>so I called the manufacturer directly.  </li>
            <li>For blemishes I can feel below the surface before I can see them, this product has cleared them completely - they never surface.</li>
            <li>I am not a doctor, but I am an engineer and I can tell you that the disposable tips on zeno are a complete ripoff designed so that people have to keep spending money.</li>
            <li>Completely defective product.</li>
            <li>I was completely floored by the device, my zits were gone by the day of my date.  </li>
            <li>It really works and penetrates deep into the pore to zap bacteria away.</li>
            <li>bellagio import should be ashamed for selling old stock that doesn&#x27;t even turn on.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product via Amazon and it came completely sealed/unopened.  </li>
            <li>You must catch the zit early for it to fully work after two to three treatments.  </li>
            <li>and around the eyes is more delicate.  </li>
            <li>Nearly ALL my pimples I have treated (early) with Zeno have never ever surfaced--</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, Zeno didn&#x27;t do any good and it took about a month to clear up.  </li>
            <li>But if you can accept that it&#x27;s not perfect and are ok with the fact that it may not work with some acne, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Once done, the majority of the bacteria inside the cyst will die, causing the sequence of the cyst to stagnate and even reverse itself (often slowly, but surely).</li>
            <li>Zeno is no longer selling/supporting this product, so there are NO replacement tips available, other than at a several hundred percent markup here on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin but experienced only slight redness which didn&#x27;t last longer than a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Happily, I was wrong!      </li>
            <li>Perhaps these people who claim it works are coincidentally experiencing success because of other influences like decrease in stress, environment changes, weather changes, hormone changes, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc.    </li>
            <li>For people who have tried all the other lotions and pills and gimmicks, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>I found the device and multiple cartridges reduced by 80% at my local drug store as no one seemed to be interested in them.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to people who have moderate acne and are sensitive to topical products because I have fair, sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use benzoyl peroxide and other harsh chemicals on my face.  </li>
            <li>It only made lesions larger, more painful, and more red, now with a large ring around them!</li>
            <li>I would give it an extra .5 star for that, but 3 seems too high.</li>
            <li>I feel a little better knowing I didn&#x27;t waste too much money.</li>
            <li>but it can burn sensitive areas if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>Apparently they are selling old ones</li>
            <li>According to the owners manual the non-replaceable battery should last 3-4 years with normal use.  </li>
            <li>I usually get a few pimples at a time on my face and regular usage of this device has cleared them up much faster than they would normally clear up on their own.  </li>
            <li>but then I more or less became \\&quot;immune\\&quot; to its effects and lately it hadn&#x27;t been working quite as well, not to mention the fact that I was very weary of rubbing something like that into my skin twice a day for the rest of my life!  </li>
            <li>I usually do have to treat these type pimples a few more times than the instructions recommend for regular pimples, but the outcome is worth the time and effort since I don&#x27;t have to worry about scarring.  </li>
            <li>I have used it down to the last light and so far it has only helped prevent one pimple.</li>
            <li>The problem I have always had is that my skin gets used to my daily regiment within 2-4 months, and then I am stuck looking for new products.    </li>
            <li>, I have been to 5 different dermatologists, they all give me new medicine</li>
            <li>I thought I would just pick up a new one for the occasional pimple.  </li>
            <li>I am in my early twenties, and i have been getting moderate acne since i was 12 years old.</li>
            <li>When I remember to use the Zeno on the same day that I notice the pimple, it actually helps to reduce the inflammation and the pimple goes away much quicker.  </li>
            <li>Overnight, the blue light indicating battery life came blinking on, so I guess the battery isn&#x27;t dead.  </li>
            <li>are thinking \\&quot;but I don&#x27;t want to walk around for two days with a zit\\&quot;, but what you need to understand is that it is not like having a regular acne lesion/bump because you started treating it while it was still just that tender lump under your skin, so by the next day you only have a mildly tender almost non-existent lump under your skin, not some half-erupted red zit for everyone to see!  </li>
            <li>This was to replace one that I lost, and I liked the old one, I had to use it repeatedly and it was expensive to buy the cartridges, but it did get rid of some cystic acne.</li>
            <li>no regrets here!</li>
            <li>But I noticed a major difference in my skin overnight.  </li>
            <li>if only someone could invent a natural solution for the whiteheads around my nose!</li>
            <li>especially the large bumps you get under your skin just before a big social event.</li>
            <li>The other thing that seems to work well for me is to make sure I exfoliate a few times a week.  </li>
            <li>I treated them again the following day 2 more times and by the next day the flat skin had dried up</li>
            <li>While this doesn&#x27;t heal acne completely, it does prevent skin from becoming worse from drying out and scarring.</li>
            <li>I generally have a clear complexion but wanted this for the occasional breakout.  </li>
            <li>My complexion is so clear (FINALLY)!</li>
            <li>I am an all natural, holistic health person who avoids chemicals for my face if possible.  </li>
            <li>You activate your treatment by pressing and then it remains a solid green light during entire treatment.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE-</li>
            <li>I knew I missed the early critical stage of using this product, but I decided to use it anyway.</li>
            <li>I use one almost daily and my 11 year old son does on a weekly basis.  </li>
            <li>If you catch it early enough, it works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have moderate to severe adult acne - blackheads, pimples, cysts.  </li>
            <li>I am also a mom with all of a sudden adult acne</li>
            <li>If you use this, just be careful because 10 Watts isn&#x27;t much</li>
            <li>Apparently, I had burned myself there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it helps shorten the lifespan of about 80% of your zits, but only if you catch them early and they haven&#x27;t already surfaced.  </li>
            <li>some pimples are gone right away and some take a few days</li>
            <li>Why not just do something like heat some small smooth flat stones (like they do in spas by heating in water) and try that on problem areas?   </li>
            <li>I was aware of the two and a half minute</li>
            <li>Seriously, not to get all philosophical, but with the premium we all place on physical appearance, even if we know there&#x27;s little chance of a product actually doing what it claims we&#x27;re still willing to take the chance...</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s just a matter of keeping it charged and holding it to my face for a few minutes, that is still more time and effort than dabbing a little spot treatment on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Zeno is a great device for ONLY those who have acne consisting of cysts that: take forever to rise to the surface of the skin, are painful, are embarrasing, and take forever to perish from the skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried EVERYTHING especially being so close to 40 yrs old and this is the only thing that seems to work.  </li>
            <li>this would be OK for you, but I don&#x27;t and to have to continue to pay them is an enormous rip-off.</li>
            <li>Some might argue that a device that can bring a nasty pimple to a head and the end of its life quicker than it would on its own is better than nothing.</li>
            <li>Besides, 30 days with only 3 major blemishes?</li>
            <li>For the first few months, the BP treatments cleared my skin quite dramatically</li>
            <li>Plus the price has gone down making this very affordable.  </li>
            <li>If it gets too hot, then back off a little bit.     </li>
            <li>This has been the exact same problem for every single Zeno device I have owned, but the last one was by far the biggest joke, since the others lasted a few months.  </li>
            <li>This is that quick fix for those huge painful zits that you can get.</li>
            <li>However, I have not experienced any damage/pain, so it&#x27;s working fine for me.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is an amazing product, it makes a great gift for anyone!</li>
            <li> When I started using Zeno it worked great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen anything work so great for me.  </li>
            <li> Think about that for a nice change!</li>
            <li> I really love my Zeno and wanted everyone to know how wonderful it is.  </li>
            <li> Took it to Florida for my brother&#x27;s wedding, the bride used it the night before and had good things to say also.</li>
            <li> My daughter used this on Christmas day and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Really good for boils too.</li>
            <li> All I know is they don&#x27;t make a good product.</li>
            <li> and I still want to give it a fair chance.</li>
            <li> good luck</li>
            <li> This seems like it could be a good product</li>
            <li> I gave it a good shot and used it on upcoming pimples for a week.</li>
            <li> This is the best I have ever found and recommend it highly to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> Very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> My husband also has the Mini ( which he was very pleased with &amp; uses when he travels ).</li>
            <li> So, this is my first try and things are great!  </li>
            <li> but now I doubt I will even see it for two more days!  </li>
            <li> And it works out magically!</li>
            <li> but that is way better than weeks!   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better not to have to pop a pimple and risk infection and scarring!  </li>
            <li> I have this one, the Pro, the Hot Spot, and the Heat Treat-- they all work, and this one is probably the best!</li>
            <li> We called the company and they offered amazing support.</li>
            <li> Amazing.    </li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Also I think it depends on the kind of acne you have because it didn&#x27;t work on mine.  </li>
            <li> I have tried literally every acne-prevention product and any kind of home remedy you can think of (at one point I even tried to use toothpaste to burn off the zits).</li>
            <li> But it is absolutely the best thing out there for those monsters under the skin.  </li>
            <li> When you read the instructions, they give you a list of the kind of pimples it DOESN&#x27;T work on.  </li>
            <li> When it worked, I liked using it.      </li>
            <li> How can they sell this kind of product?</li>
            <li> The Zeno feels warm when it touches your skin.  </li>
            <li> This product has worked for me, although it hasn&#x27;t been 100% effective.</li>
            <li> Worth the $$$$$!!!</li>
            <li> It works best on new pimples.  </li>
            <li> Better yet, it is so comforting knowing that I can effectively fight any zit that begins to form on my face.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice believable concept, but doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that it was most effective in immediately reducing the swelling.  </li>
            <li> Wow I can&#x27;t believe how great Zeno works!  </li>
            <li> I always use the product 3 times on a blemish, and I have found that the most effective treatments have been when I have been able to use Zeno every four hours during the course of a day.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for someone with skin that&#x27;s even slightly sensitive -- you probably won&#x27;t have a very pleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well...it seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Hope this helps! :)</li>
            <li> Works okay on some blemishes</li>
            <li> Just make sure you get the pimple ASAP.</li>
            <li> But most people I know who have had a zeno end up getting rid of it.  </li>
            <li> ,it&#x27;s not some magic device,i think if you have acne problems skip it and go to a doctor</li>
            <li> and it is on top of my nose</li>
            <li> I was so pleased.</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t look any better.  </li>
            <li> I dislike the protective timer that prevents you from using it for more three times in a row.</li>
            <li> Either way I love it</li>
            <li> OK.  </li>
            <li> Most of bumps would go away over night.</li>
            <li> If you have tried everything, and aren&#x27;t ready to spend the money on a doctor, this is a great choice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This will force you to buy more cartridge to use the product because it has in memory how many times you used it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> 5 or more</li>
            <li> Will I buy more?</li>
            <li> it most send a \\&quot;specific\\&quot; amount of heat etc.\\</li>
            <li> Also my Zeno product no longer will charge and I made sure a lamp worked in the outlet just to make sure my outlet was not the problem.</li>
            <li> Stick with creams, they seem to do the job much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I have used many products, - if not all of them -.</li>
            <li> With this product you can give your skin some more time to heal and regenerates itself.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.   </li>
            <li> Well I question if many of the glowing reviews are legitimate.  </li>
            <li> This works more efficiently, basically).</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve been hanging around HP ink-jet printer marketeers it seems :-)</li>
            <li> I guess for most people.  </li>
            <li> But about a week ago, after feeling the telltale signs of two more developing blemishes, I decided to take the plunge.</li>
            <li> iam glad this product worked for some people!&lt;br /&gt;no</li>
            <li> is a fact of life for many teenagers as a result of hormone changes taking place in their bodies as they become adults.  </li>
            <li> so glad I got this product.</li>
            <li> I took a risk, as the product is not inexpensive, but I am more than satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> No improvement on any of my acne after many attempts.</li>
            <li> and it kept the charge for more than two weeks of usage (at which time I returned</li>
            <li> Overall, this isn&#x27;t a perfect solution, but it has helped!</li>
            <li> Somebody needs to take this electric pimple heating idea and execute it better.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my Zeno substitute which I have found works even better than Zeno itself.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Zeno.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out a better method to \\&quot;heat\\&quot; the pimple to kill the germs inside.</li>
            <li> After trying so many products like proactive etc.</li>
            <li> The sooner I ice it, the better the chance of prevention.</li>
            <li> I had) and does a semi okay job at those stubborn surface pimples.</li>
            <li> since retin-a thins the top layer of your skin.  </li>
            <li> I say \\&quot;usually\\&quot; because it&#x27;s not some magical miracle product that makes ALL of your pimples disappear David Copperfield style.  </li>
            <li> in all, it&#x27;s a better option than tearing up your face with a needle or your fingers.</li>
            <li> I wonder though if maybe heating some water up to a certain temperature, dipping a metal spoon in it and then resting the very warm spoon over your zit wouldn&#x27;t save me money in the end...</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews about the Zeno and was very excited to get it.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Proactive as a teenager and it works out pretty good</li>
            <li> I would recommend that if you are interested in buying this device, to consider trying a good clay mask instead.  </li>
            <li> Nice idea, nice advertising, good delivery, but it did not function beyond the initial use.</li>
            <li> It was quite funny, but they loved it and some have gone out to purchase one.  </li>
            <li> The confidence gained by having a clear face is great.  </li>
            <li> And after reading all the fabulous reviews, I was even more convinced.  </li>
            <li> The product clearly states that it works best at the first signs of a pimple.</li>
            <li> So far the Zeno has been great.</li>
            <li> I have had my Zeno awhile, and it has always worked great with my adult acne--</li>
            <li> I rarely get the kind of acne that Zeno caters to, but when I do, they NEVER go away.</li>
            <li> She has very fair skin and red hair and breaks out easily.</li>
            <li> What a great, chemical free way to keep your skin clear!  </li>
            <li> and yes it really has done a good job with quickly clearing up my acne!  </li>
            <li> It works for me, and I find it so easy to use too.  </li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t easy to do in the morning when you have a hectic schedule.  </li>
            <li> After reading reviews, many people stated that it did help with their more severe acne, so I thought it would be worth to try.  </li>
            <li> 1-5 pimples would be easy to do.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use, and I always take it with me when I travel.  </li>
            <li> but it was too strong &amp;</li>
            <li> strongly advise anyone who purchases a Zeno to begin using it as soon as it arrives.  </li>
            <li> I own this Zeno product and all it does is get hot.</li>
            <li> but thats fine because it worked (supposedly) on the exact kind of acne</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get a lot of pimples, and they aren&#x27;t huge, but when I do, this thing makes them go away very quickly.</li>
            <li> I was told it worked fine.</li>
            <li> Instead of heat, I have found what works better for me and my mild acne is to ice my pimples.</li>
            <li> Zeno seems to work fairly well, but you have to be very diligent about catching newly emerging zits.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I was able to sell it for close to what I originally paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> now that is a huge \\&quot;wow\\&quot; factor in my book.</li>
            <li> I bought Zeno before my wedding, and that day I was acne free.</li>
            <li> I rarely have more than 3 pimples on my face at once.  </li>
            <li> worth the money for sure.</li>
            <li> My wife and I guarded against placebo effect and if anything, were biased against believing the device would work.</li>
            <li> this has produced such a great turn-around in his complexion.</li>
            <li> One important thing is the time of applying Zeno.</li>
            <li> The price would suggest a better than 50% success rate and for that reason I would stay away from the Zeno Acne.</li>
            <li> 10 Watt \\&quot;candelabra base\\&quot; incandescent light bulb ($2)  3.</li>
            <li> Night light with replaceable bulb ($2)  4.</li>
            <li> Everyone is responsible for their own actions.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides that, there was no reason for me to even mod it to make me able to use it more than the amount allowed because after using it for awhile, it has never worked or done a thing for me.</li>
            <li> However, the Zeno is more \\&quot;safe\\&quot; because it is controlled on how the temperature is, though, it wouldn&#x27;t even matter since it doesn&#x27;t do much anything to most</li>
            <li> Warm compresses with a washcloth are nice but this actually targets it with a timed treatment.</li>
            <li> As long as you catch it in the first couple of days, Zeno works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is a very useful adjunct to acne therapy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how excited I was to learn about this product.  </li>
            <li> It is no more. :D    </li>
            <li> and I am pretty sure this zit would have still been</li>
            <li> Got it yesterday and was so excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited about trying out this product.</li>
            <li> I was so excited that I brought my Zeno and some alochol swabs with me to my tennis lunch</li>
            <li> You have to hold this device for awhile and your hand would started to get tried and it would slip away from the pimple you originally wanted to target.</li>
            <li> They work just as well as the original heads.  </li>
            <li> (The original cartridge worked as described.)&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> Then I had another one on my nose, a large red spot just under the surface, an ideal situation for what was described in the instructions.</li>
            <li> - so perhaps it would make a difference if I were able to use it more frequently.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and defenitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> How did they diminish right away?!</li>
            <li> Using the Zeno machine is done at bedtime right along with brushing her teeth and her skin once again looks like peaches and cream!</li>
            <li> Works great while it works, but after 2 years of very limited use, it crapped out.  </li>
            <li> I have used the product at the first signs of moderate acne and the product works great.</li>
            <li> While I was happy with the one I had that worked and would rate it higher, I&#x27;m not going to try a third time.</li>
            <li> I can testify that it is true, as the manufacturer states,</li>
            <li> The good news is that those zits didn&#x27;t become big and didn&#x27;t scar when they healed.  </li>
            <li> pimples that would take a full week or 10 days for me are gone in 2 or 3 days.  </li>
            <li> After my second cartridge, it didn&#x27;t seem to work as good.  </li>
            <li> it is a dream come true.    </li>
            <li> Now with Zeno, it prevents that growth and heals it to good extent that you can try your topical for boosting the removal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cool device and a cool concept.  </li>
            <li> have used it over the last month in conjunction with Clearzine and have good results with fewer zits.</li>
            <li> This product might only be good for a 2 or 3 pimple.  </li>
            <li> The cool thing about the Zeno is that it feels like you&#x27;re shooting a laser at your face.  </li>
            <li> All it really did for me was bring most of my pimples to head, which of course led to me messing with them.</li>
            <li> Although Amazon customer service indicated I would have to pay for return shipping, I received a full refund (and was not charged for shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course this is used in addition to good daily hygiene of washing and cleaning my face twice a day.</li>
            <li> After trying it numorous times and multiple times on the same pimple all I got was a nice warm feeling and nothing more.  </li>
            <li> Everyone should be so lucky.    </li>
            <li> \\&quot;more than one controlled study\\&quot; but not regulated by the FDA or anyone else unless specified, and therefore worth, as I see it, about as much as a zit on my face.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;The light indicators illuminate in a nice indiglo blue color- the heating button and the treatment button</li>
            <li> After the second use, the pimple was even with my skin and reducing in size more and more.  </li>
            <li> Definitely the perfect tool to add to your daily regiment.</li>
            <li> To be honest I really can&#x27;t see someone using this for their whole face either.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s helped tremendously.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a Zeno, you should know the tip is very hot.</li>
            <li> If it feels very hot but tolerable, you can hold it on your pimple for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> The price may seem high, but it could be more than worth it for you too.</li>
            <li> All the great reviews, FDA approval and the high price led me to buy this device thinking \\&quot;finally something that will work\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> And no creepy chemicals!</li>
            <li> This is not anything high tech...AVOID!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I was willing to spend anything if it worked!  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who does not have many pimples any more and would like something less evasive on their face but still want pimple free.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, the (painless) burn faded more quickly and completely than the zit would have, so I would probably do it again if I had to.    </li>
            <li> worth the price.</li>
            <li> I stayed clear and confident.  </li>
            <li> whatever... we feel it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li> However, for me, that wasn&#x27;t worth $100 and a two-and-a-half-minute wait.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really speak to how good the product actually works.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t worth the expense.  </li>
            <li> From our experience it is definitly worth trying.  </li>
            <li> they allowed you to use it longer, then maybe I would say go for it, but don&#x27;t be surprised if it didn&#x27;t do more than heat a piece of skin</li>
            <li> Costly, but worth it in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I feel improved self-esteem is worth $80.</li>
            <li> when it actually works, it seems to be effective.  </li>
            <li> While not the miracle fix suggested by the brochure, it does clearly help most of the time in our family.</li>
            <li> I am still struggling to figure out what kind are left.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s success rate, it came out to about $5 a blemish.  </li>
            <li> Having had perfectly clear skin through my teens, 20s, and most of my 30s, I now have post-pregnancy adult-onset cystic acne that began at age 36.</li>
            <li> My experience: cystic acne goes through its normal cycle (rising to surface, becoming a hideous scab, etc.)</li>
            <li> That has made it worth the money for me.      </li>
            <li> Since the time that I have had and used this device, I haven&#x27;t had success on any problem area that was treated.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t think it was worth it and returned it.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it, return it within 30 days.  </li>
            <li> [..]  Don&#x27;t get Zeno happy your first day of getting it (you have to let it charge for like 4 or 6 hours) and don&#x27;t decide to target all your pimples in one day, because the next day you might have a bunch of white heads instead of easy to cover (with makeup) pimples.  </li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter was very excited to receive the Zeno for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> Get to it early, maybe double up on the treatments and continue good hygiene, and it will go away, or be significantly reduced in size and pain.  </li>
            <li> If you got the pimple at just the right time you had some success and it sped up the healing process,</li>
            <li> The other reviewer here points out that it says \\&quot;for most people\\&quot; or \\&quot;for most acne\\&quot;, as if this is a loop hole.  </li>
            <li> What I did was check my face twice a day for suspicious bumps to treat them right away.</li>
            <li> The size of the pimple diminishes right after the use and disappears at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work on all kinds of acne and you have to use it at just the right time before the pimple forms in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> It feels so good when applying heat to a pimple knowing that you are destroying it, it is just sweet.</li>
            <li> Pros: works sometimes on certain pimples; cool tech device    </li>
            <li> Thus, you can actually walk outside your home feeling a bit more confident in your appearance!</li>
            <li> The best thing is that the only thing needing replacment are the cheap bulbs and they last a very long time because they&#x27;re not running at full voltage.    </li>
            <li> is MUCH smaller and goes away much more quickly.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll gladly put up with the price tag because ultimately my social life is worth it.  </li>
            <li> But it is worth it if you&#x27;re willing to put the time and money into it.  </li>
            <li> Any device like this, most devices/tools in general don&#x27;t work for everyone.  </li>
            <li> The only type of zits it had a significant effects on were zits that could have easily been -- pardon me -- dealt with manually.</li>
            <li> You must follow directions exactly or you won&#x27;t see the right results</li>
            <li> It is surprising to see anything other than positive comments.</li>
            <li> It kind of feels like touching a sunburn as first (to me at least), but you do get used to it.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work well on mature zits though, which is fine because that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s intended for and from experience</li>
            <li> Here are my skin stats, to help others make a best guess about whether Zeno will work for them: I&#x27;m in my late 20s and have combination skin and mild to moderate acne.  </li>
            <li> Well, I was so excited about my new toy that I thought \\&quot;what the heck\\</li>
            <li> It looks like it&#x27;s working at first, and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure everyone responds to this treatment differently, but I received mine 4 days ago and have used it on 2 cystic acne formations on my face, and within 36 hours the cyst did not hurt anymore.</li>
            <li> The effect wasn&#x27;t as effective as I expected.</li>
            <li> If used correctly, at the first sign of a pimple, this device eliminates  pimples within 24-48 hours.</li>
            <li> The first one we received wouldn&#x27;t charge.  </li>
            <li> It does work,k better than creams and such.</li>
            <li> Wait until you hear the first beep.</li>
            <li> Mystery surrounding some magic degree of Fahrenheit in which \\&quot;acne-bacteria\\&quot; decides to go packing like the mucus cartoon in that cough medicine commercial.   </li>
            <li> and the heat eased the pain at first.</li>
            <li> It did seem to make my pimples go away faster at first.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m perfectly aware that this device doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
            <li> I let the battery charge for about 8 hours before my first use.  </li>
            <li> You need to be consistent on treatment.  </li>
            <li> First sign of acne and I am on it.  </li>
            <li> So many products claim to do something and this one actually does.  </li>
            <li> it really works!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like placing a spoon under really hot water and holding it to your face.</li>
            <li> &quot; this product only works in ironing the pimple and doesn&#x27;t seem to kill bacteria any better than benzyol peroxide.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even get me started on all the replacement heads I bought with my initial Zeno purchase in hopes I found something innovative.</li>
            <li> Products that contain benzyol peroxide as a lotion and sulfur as a mask to spot treat has worked pretty well for me.</li>
            <li> it AT LEAST shrinks it to a great extent.</li>
            <li> It is hot so</li>
            <li> at first, you may be a bit worried if it&#x27;s supposed to be THAT HOT.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, if I don&#x27;t treat a pimple within the first day, then the Zeno is useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But even then, it&#x27;s better than leaving it to the next day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the device when I first notice</li>
            <li> I would never have bought this in the first place</li>
            <li> Simply put, this is a device that people should be confident in investing in.</li>
            <li> It really does!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it does this exactly, but you can feel it working.  </li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s so much more convenient than running back &amp; forth heating up a wash cloth that never makes it disappear anyway.</li>
            <li> the only purpose for this so called website is to get your email nothing more.</li>
            <li> On some more sevsitive pimples it can feel hot for the initial contact and then you cannot feel the heat at all.  </li>
            <li> and I was pretty disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was told that the difference between the first two is the number of uses (90 versus 60).  </li>
            <li> My Zeno turned off once within the first 30 seconds, so I charged it for 24 hours</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I was able to return it and get all my money back.</li>
            <li> I have found this works great because it stays hot for as long as I want to treat the zit, and there&#x27;s no waiting in between times if I have a second area that needs treatment.</li>
            <li> I was given credit for the first one and am hoping that I will be given credit for the one that just arrived today.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still giving it 3 stars though, because you can return it if it doesn&#x27;t work in the first month, so</li>
            <li> It works pretty well for them.  </li>
            <li> When I tried to charge it for the first time, it never took a charge, despite trying several times and even for more than the amount of time recommended.</li>
            <li> One fault is the hot spot is located towards one side of the device, so that cap was always popping off when I held it against a pimple.</li>
            <li> And on top of that the tip did not last 60 treatments</li>
            <li> After the first time I charged it something happened and the alarm signal did not go off in time.  </li>
            <li> Ok, so I was ready to try something new and something that I felt like would be safe with minimal side-effects</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I&#x27;ve tried a couple other similar products on the market, but this one is the most consistently effective.</li>
            <li> Place the bulb on the zit and SLOWLY increase the dimmer until very warm.</li>
            <li> What is has done for me is bring the blemish up more quickly, decrease the time I have to deal with the embarrassment, and it keeps the problem from spreading to other pores nearby.  </li>
            <li> It works much better if applied as early as pimple has developed.</li>
            <li> The zit would seem to get better, only to come back really huge.    </li>
            <li> Wait until another cycle is ready and re-use until you hear the first beep.)</li>
            <li> I was very skeptic of this product at first.</li>
            <li> You do really need to use it at the first sign though.  </li>
            <li> And, you can use the clay mask on your whole face to help prevent zits from forming in the first place.        </li>
            <li> This is the first product I have used that really works.  </li>
            <li> No sign of life whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller who was very responsive, but suggested I try to rectify things with Zeno customer service first.</li>
            <li> but I honestly didn&#x27;t realize how long that would feel if you stay true to the instructions and do multiple applications on one zit in a day.    </li>
            <li> If this device worked as advertised I would not mind paying the high cost, but unfortunately, its just another excellently marketed scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no problem posting positive remarks for products that work as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious how the product would have worked if I would have been able to use it at the first signs of the pimple.</li>
            <li> Cheap way of doing the exact same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nowadays people are more cost-consious than ever when it comes down to buying something that&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Until they justify the need for replacement tips, or eliminate the counter in the tip that causes it to stop working after a certain number of uses, I cannot recommend this device to anyone.</li>
            <li> , however I can certainly caution (without hesitation) about my experience and about the supposed guarantee:  </li>
            <li> I have large under the skin pimples, so maybe it&#x27;s not for my type of acne.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it would work on acne or cystic type blemishes, but for the every day, average variety pimple, this works better than any other kind of treatment I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> &quot;, it can&#x27;t make these huge zits any bigger</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s ready, put it on the spot.</li>
            <li> Just as much inconvenience as holding this thing up for 2 minutes.    </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before purchasing this product and all the while I just wanted to know what it really does.</li>
            <li> The chin spot never came to a head but didn&#x27;t do much anything else either.  </li>
            <li> What works, really works, for me?</li>
            <li> no problems with refund thanks to amazon</li>
            <li> which is a absolute No-No for scarring reasons and contamination reasons.</li>
            <li> I do not have to use it as much as I used to..</li>
            <li> This method worked very well for me.     </li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t notice any results.  </li>
            <li> This really is a ripoff...   </li>
            <li> I have used the Zeno and have not really seen anything magical.  </li>
            <li> I have used this many years ago for which I just tossed it after the \\&quot;cartridge\\&quot; went empty.</li>
            <li> Your skin is an experiment when it comes to finding what work, but I whole heartidly</li>
            <li> I am very aggressive, though.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest getting a replacement head at the time you get the Zeno itself as it does run out fast</li>
            <li> had I known I would have to invest so much money in it every month.</li>
            <li> The heat absolutely works to kill the bacteria and make the zit go away faster.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to rip on this thing and call it junk, but I have to admit IT WORKED.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s cheaper than going to the dermotologist (who in my experience, really can&#x27;t do a damn thing.)  </li>
            <li> it really gives them self confidence when they need it</li>
            <li> This really did not do anythign for my pimples.</li>
            <li> If you have plenty of pimple, you used up the tip so fast.  </li>
            <li> It takes too much time waiting and zapping your pimple.</li>
            <li> , when treated very aggressively with Zeno.</li>
            <li> Be very aggressive.</li>
            <li> But everyone&#x27;s all impressed by the fact that you never have any pimples, even when you&#x27;re in the muggy heat of the North Q&#x27;uinos atmosphere.  </li>
            <li> But if you get frequent non-cystic outbreaks like I do, no matter how well you cleanse, it is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> always very diligent when it comes to acne regimens and treatments so</li>
            <li> In the product details it really should list the type of acne it can not be used for like it does in the device manual.</li>
            <li> Very upset.</li>
            <li> Really, try it for yourself.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now, and it honestly does work.</li>
            <li> At first I was a skeptic, I have a 12 yr old going thru the \\&quot;awkward\\&quot; stage, I could not believe it when I saw the results that she was having even after the first use.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with my Zeno that I am ready to purchase another one for my 15 year old son as he has started to struggle with teenage acne.</li>
            <li> Sure, things will break down over time but Zeno doesn&#x27;t get terribly hot and</li>
            <li> Think about it--how many other things with heaters &amp; thermostats do you have to throw away after a certain number of uses.</li>
            <li> , like the instructions told me to, I used it at the first sign of a new pimple.</li>
            <li> I love this product and wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any other \\&quot;gadget\\&quot; in the world.</li>
            <li> And this just didn&#x27;t work for me any better than other acne products do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would avoid buying any Zeno products due to the fact that they just force you to buy more cartridge tip with a memory chip to stop you using for longer than the ammo inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually get excited looking for pimples now so that I can use the Zeno to stop them in their tracks.  </li>
            <li> (I have the original version.)&lt;br /&gt;However two boxes of \\&quot;60 treatment cycle\\&quot; replacement cartridges only gave me 5-6 uses each.  </li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed by my new Zeno!</li>
            <li> If one were really squeamish about squeezing out burgeoning pimples, then this is a decent device.</li>
            <li> When it doesn&#x27;t, I honestly feel that with continued treatment, the blemishes tend to shrink and don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> It does leave my fair skin a little red, so I have my concealer ready.</li>
            <li> Not only was this easy to use they are already minimized and some completely gone after 3 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;ll ever have this kind of data.</li>
            <li> for the heat, it&#x27;s not painful but it definitely takes getting used to.</li>
            <li> and I had my new one within a week!)  </li>
            <li> At first I used it religiously and studiously according to the instructions: use at the first sign of a blemish, 2-3 treatments for each, spread out over 12-24 hours.  </li>
            <li> The replacement they sent me did the exact same thing as the first one, would never take a charge.</li>
            <li> I have only a mild acne problem-  </li>
            <li> A quick daily dose of steamy water, a washcloth, followed up with dabs of $3 store brand salicylic acid gel.    </li>
            <li> But this month, only one became fully grown visible zit and disappearing quickly.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pretty much, you waste your time and also your money for this to do nothing more than heat up a tip and apply to skin which you can do with another metal tip by warming it up and applying to the skin.</li>
            <li> I left a review on the 90 count device, which is the same device but more uses in the tip.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky to have been listening to the radio when I heard a Zeno commercial.</li>
            <li> I say lucky because I have never heard or seen a commercial for this product before or since.</li>
            <li> and I was starting to develop two large cystic zits right on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> the next morning is more than enough to stop the pimple from forming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell if this is a good product, and ordinarily I wouldn&#x27;t write a review if I wasn&#x27;t sure.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions the first few times, and when that didn&#x27;t work, I tried using it more frequently than instructed.  </li>
            <li> The cartridge still contained at least 50% more uses... and the device doesn&#x27;t charge!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product, despite the price tag.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations</li>
            <li> Itz not a magic device that you are going to have clear skin right away and won&#x27;t even be able to tell you ever had a pimple there</li>
            <li> In my opinion if you have a lot of severe acne maybe not the best,it doesn&#x27;t get rid of my pimples in 24 hrs like magic but does shrink da little bugger down so pretty good if you got a pimple and are about to go to a party,just use Zeno shrinks it down and cover the rest with make up.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous because I don&#x27;t normally get this many at once,</li>
            <li> yes you need to get them &#x27;early&#x27; but it does really work.  </li>
            <li> I am using this in conjunction with a very thorough natural skincare regime and improved nutrition, and seeing the results I have hoped for after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> For me this personally worked better when I had those huge deep pimples that you can feel under the surface, hit it once wake up and the next day its incredibly smaller.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my teenager who as the normal occassinal problem with breakouts at inoppertune times.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin.</li>
            <li> Some zits require two treatments but as long as I followed the directions and kept it on for the full time I never had problems with the zits developing..</li>
            <li> in a fraction of the normal time (4 days versus 4 weeks) when treated as directed with Zeno,</li>
            <li> An experience I had with the Zeno sometimes  was when a zit wouldn&#x27;t disappear, but rather accelerate in duration, meaning it would quickly, perhaps overnight after a pre-bedtime treatment, turn into a mature pustule and then pop and dissolve by the morning of the next day.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have what I would consider mild to moderate adult acne.</li>
            <li> Waiting overnight to use it a second time has been much less effective (although it&#x27;s sometimes unavoidable).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make them completely disappear overnight, however and it&#x27;s kind of a pain in the ass to hold that thing to your face for two and a half minutes if you have more than one or two red little friends hanging out.  </li>
            <li> I think for me I would only use this for traveling because it is highly convenient but doesn&#x27;t receive much consistent use at home.</li>
            <li> but it def does help,only problem is i have a new pimple every day so</li>
            <li> supposedly brand new but did not even power on after charging.</li>
            <li> It does nothing to prevent new pimples either.  </li>
            <li> But as the years went by, I just sort of accepted that acne was something I am destined to live with forever.     </li>
            <li> and that is when I started doing research on what is new out there in acne treatment</li>
            <li> I purchased a new tip</li>
            <li> My new Zeno didn&#x27;t work from the start.</li>
            <li> I used it about ten times, and though it did not always stop the pimple completely, it certainly shorted it&#x27;s life span (and size!)  </li>
            <li> Later that day the red spot was still there, sore as ever, and the spot on my lip welled up to a HUGE whitehead.</li>
            <li> When, after many attempts, that didn&#x27;t work, I tried using it all different ways -- frequent zapping versus single attempt; two zaps in a row; after cooling my skin with water, after heating it with steam, et cetera.  </li>
            <li> Tip - it is very loud.  </li>
            <li> The Zeno is reccommended for new pimples so that they can be treated at the first sign to stop them from getting any bigger.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It definitely does keep some pimples from becoming major ones and I think it does stop just-forming pimples from actually forming.</li>
            <li> Using it at first site is key.</li>
            <li> Then my husband pointed out...if it&#x27;s hot enough to kill bacteria, it ought to be hot enough to burn the skin.</li>
            <li> The first Zeno I received did not charge properly, so I had to return it through Amazon (with no problems, they don&#x27;t charge for return shipping</li>
            <li> The second one worked for about a month, and when I used it, it worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I had a really big mountian along the side of my nose, and an hour after the first use I could feel the reduction in the size of the pimple.  </li>
            <li> The trick I&#x27;ve noticed, and Zeno advocates, is to catch them when they&#x27;re first starting to arrive - before you can see them, but you feel them.  </li>
            <li> Before making a decision, check out the other versions, you will see many different reviews.  </li>
            <li> but I still get the occasional cystic acne bump,that&#x27;s lg.&amp; hurts &amp; nothing helps but the hot wash cloth.</li>
            <li> so today I went out and bought my first not-cheap replaceable cartridge, only to get it home and find that the non-replaceable battery inside the zeno will no longer charge.  </li>
            <li> I usually do not post reviews</li>
            <li> I love this product and would reccomment it to anyone with small recurrent break out areas.  </li>
            <li> I had a Zeno from a couple of years back that I recently gave to a much younger acquaintance who needed it more than I did.  </li>
            <li> Every once in a while it will actually help the zit be gone in about 12 hours (overnight), which is pretty</li>
            <li> You can see my full review under Zeno Pro Pink.</li>
            <li> I did have 2 new ones come up this week, but I treated both of them twice and one went away completely</li>
            <li> Although it did surface a bit, the size was significantly smaller than it usually would be, and it was already drying up with no scarring which is amazing.</li>
            <li> I am firstly amazed at this technology seeing how it seems so simple and natural (using heat) but yet is so brillant.  </li>
            <li> The first spot I tried it on was already two days old, 1/4 red sore spot welling up under my chin.</li>
            <li> Going outside can make you have a hot face if directly in the sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
            <li> My problem with Zeno has been  that the device is completely unreliable, and I have encountered the exact same problem not once, twice, but three times, so I am finished with Zeno.  </li>
            <li> However, the instructions tell you to use it only on certain pimples and in the very early stages, so I couldn&#x27;t use it when my zits had come to a head.  </li>
            <li> I found several sites with customer feedback, and they were all positive.  </li>
            <li> Make your own decision, but I hope this review helps you decide to keep your money, or at least keep your receipt!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had moderate acne for the past several years and decided to try this after seeing ads and good reviews.</li>
            <li> I only hope the price could be less pricy:)</li>
            <li> The fact that you have to replace the tips is just a royal waste of money and resources (thanks, planned obsolescence!), but if you keep turning the unit on after it automatically shuts off (instead of starting the treatment cycle), you should be able to get the same results and extend the life of the tip.  </li>
            <li> The product actually works on my large, takes a month to clear, cysts.  </li>
            <li> The product states clearly what kinds of acne it does and does not work on.</li>
            <li> Clear Skinned Mississippian</li>
            <li> I feel for the seller, because clearly he/</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it one star, because it did work, but only very selectively.</li>
            <li> But, if you catch it early, it will make it go away.</li>
            <li> Turn off the cycle button, then turn off the thing completely.</li>
            <li> To simulate the experience, run a metal spoon under hot water for about a minute (as long as it takes for the unit to heat up) Leave the water running and repeatedly hold the spoon to the sore spot until the spoon cools, then reheat it.</li>
            <li> I zapped it, and zapped the red, now very sore, spot on my chin again.</li>
            <li> I was ready to squeeze it last night-</li>
            <li> It beeps every 30 seconds and then continues to do so for a complete cycle of 2 1/2 minutes.</li>
            <li> When the device has completed heat up cycle the button turns to blinking Green light-</li>
            <li> it has completely stopped zits in my problem area.  </li>
            <li> I use it early and my face is clear.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a back up when I try the much lighter product Boot No7 cleanser.</li>
            <li> What this product really needs is some independent clinical research.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old.</li>
            <li> Additionally, this is a natural solution</li>
            <li> I keep a Zeno in my purse at all times for unexpected outbreaks.   </li>
            <li> So far I seem to have had one that qualified, and yes, it may have sped things up a bit.  </li>
            <li> Clay masks have been around for centuries and some are all natural.</li>
            <li> as for adult acne</li>
            <li> Tried to contact the company through the phone number they advertise and all I get is a busy signal....</li>
            <li> When she does use it the pimples dissappear overnight &amp; her skin doesn&#x27;t get overdried &amp; sensitive.</li>
            <li> I am a 39 year old mom of 2 that has never had a acne problem in my life.  </li>
            <li> My skin is far too delicate and sensitive to tolerate most OTC acne products.</li>
            <li> OR it disappears completely without ever having risen to the surface (after a week or so)</li>
            <li> It does not completely eliminate a pimple, even if applied at the first sign of one coming up.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this in stores a while back because I read nothing but absolute rave reviews in magazines, online, etc.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to learn that whiteheads are not pimples (and therefore, not to be treated with the Zeno).  </li>
            <li> I treated two pimples (in their early stage as instructed in the user manual) and the Zeno seemed to have no effect on either of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The beep every 30 seconds is helpful as it allows the user to keep track of how much longer the treatment will last.  </li>
            <li> so I called the manufacturer directly.  </li>
            <li> For blemishes I can feel below the surface before I can see them, this product has cleared them completely - they never surface.</li>
            <li> I am not a doctor, but I am an engineer and I can tell you that the disposable tips on zeno are a complete ripoff designed so that people have to keep spending money.</li>
            <li> Completely defective product.</li>
            <li> I was completely floored by the device, my zits were gone by the day of my date.  </li>
            <li> It really works and penetrates deep into the pore to zap bacteria away.</li>
            <li> bellagio import should be ashamed for selling old stock that doesn&#x27;t even turn on.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product via Amazon and it came completely sealed/unopened.  </li>
            <li> You must catch the zit early for it to fully work after two to three treatments.  </li>
            <li> and around the eyes is more delicate.  </li>
            <li> Nearly ALL my pimples I have treated (early) with Zeno have never ever surfaced--</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Zeno didn&#x27;t do any good and it took about a month to clear up.  </li>
            <li> But if you can accept that it&#x27;s not perfect and are ok with the fact that it may not work with some acne, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Once done, the majority of the bacteria inside the cyst will die, causing the sequence of the cyst to stagnate and even reverse itself (often slowly, but surely).</li>
            <li> Zeno is no longer selling/supporting this product, so there are NO replacement tips available, other than at a several hundred percent markup here on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin but experienced only slight redness which didn&#x27;t last longer than a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Happily, I was wrong!      </li>
            <li> Perhaps these people who claim it works are coincidentally experiencing success because of other influences like decrease in stress, environment changes, weather changes, hormone changes, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc.    </li>
            <li> For people who have tried all the other lotions and pills and gimmicks, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I found the device and multiple cartridges reduced by 80% at my local drug store as no one seemed to be interested in them.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to people who have moderate acne and are sensitive to topical products because I have fair, sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use benzoyl peroxide and other harsh chemicals on my face.  </li>
            <li> It only made lesions larger, more painful, and more red, now with a large ring around them!</li>
            <li> I would give it an extra .5 star for that, but 3 seems too high.</li>
            <li> I feel a little better knowing I didn&#x27;t waste too much money.</li>
            <li> but it can burn sensitive areas if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> Apparently they are selling old ones</li>
            <li> According to the owners manual the non-replaceable battery should last 3-4 years with normal use.  </li>
            <li> I usually get a few pimples at a time on my face and regular usage of this device has cleared them up much faster than they would normally clear up on their own.  </li>
            <li> but then I more or less became \\&quot;immune\\&quot; to its effects and lately it hadn&#x27;t been working quite as well, not to mention the fact that I was very weary of rubbing something like that into my skin twice a day for the rest of my life!  </li>
            <li> I usually do have to treat these type pimples a few more times than the instructions recommend for regular pimples, but the outcome is worth the time and effort since I don&#x27;t have to worry about scarring.  </li>
            <li> I have used it down to the last light and so far it has only helped prevent one pimple.</li>
            <li> The problem I have always had is that my skin gets used to my daily regiment within 2-4 months, and then I am stuck looking for new products.    </li>
            <li> , I have been to 5 different dermatologists, they all give me new medicine</li>
            <li> I thought I would just pick up a new one for the occasional pimple.  </li>
            <li> I am in my early twenties, and i have been getting moderate acne since i was 12 years old.</li>
            <li> When I remember to use the Zeno on the same day that I notice the pimple, it actually helps to reduce the inflammation and the pimple goes away much quicker.  </li>
            <li> Overnight, the blue light indicating battery life came blinking on, so I guess the battery isn&#x27;t dead.  </li>
            <li> are thinking \\&quot;but I don&#x27;t want to walk around for two days with a zit\\&quot;, but what you need to understand is that it is not like having a regular acne lesion/bump because you started treating it while it was still just that tender lump under your skin, so by the next day you only have a mildly tender almost non-existent lump under your skin, not some half-erupted red zit for everyone to see!  </li>
            <li> This was to replace one that I lost, and I liked the old one, I had to use it repeatedly and it was expensive to buy the cartridges, but it did get rid of some cystic acne.</li>
            <li> no regrets here!</li>
            <li> But I noticed a major difference in my skin overnight.  </li>
            <li> if only someone could invent a natural solution for the whiteheads around my nose!</li>
            <li> especially the large bumps you get under your skin just before a big social event.</li>
            <li> The other thing that seems to work well for me is to make sure I exfoliate a few times a week.  </li>
            <li> I treated them again the following day 2 more times and by the next day the flat skin had dried up</li>
            <li> While this doesn&#x27;t heal acne completely, it does prevent skin from becoming worse from drying out and scarring.</li>
            <li> I generally have a clear complexion but wanted this for the occasional breakout.  </li>
            <li> My complexion is so clear (FINALLY)!</li>
            <li> I am an all natural, holistic health person who avoids chemicals for my face if possible.  </li>
            <li> You activate your treatment by pressing and then it remains a solid green light during entire treatment.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE-</li>
            <li> I knew I missed the early critical stage of using this product, but I decided to use it anyway.</li>
            <li> I use one almost daily and my 11 year old son does on a weekly basis.  </li>
            <li> If you catch it early enough, it works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have moderate to severe adult acne - blackheads, pimples, cysts.  </li>
            <li> I am also a mom with all of a sudden adult acne</li>
            <li> If you use this, just be careful because 10 Watts isn&#x27;t much</li>
            <li> Apparently, I had burned myself there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it helps shorten the lifespan of about 80% of your zits, but only if you catch them early and they haven&#x27;t already surfaced.  </li>
            <li> some pimples are gone right away and some take a few days</li>
            <li> Why not just do something like heat some small smooth flat stones (like they do in spas by heating in water) and try that on problem areas?   </li>
            <li> I was aware of the two and a half minute</li>
            <li> Seriously, not to get all philosophical, but with the premium we all place on physical appearance, even if we know there&#x27;s little chance of a product actually doing what it claims we&#x27;re still willing to take the chance...</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s just a matter of keeping it charged and holding it to my face for a few minutes, that is still more time and effort than dabbing a little spot treatment on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Zeno is a great device for ONLY those who have acne consisting of cysts that: take forever to rise to the surface of the skin, are painful, are embarrasing, and take forever to perish from the skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING especially being so close to 40 yrs old and this is the only thing that seems to work.  </li>
            <li> this would be OK for you, but I don&#x27;t and to have to continue to pay them is an enormous rip-off.</li>
            <li> Some might argue that a device that can bring a nasty pimple to a head and the end of its life quicker than it would on its own is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Besides, 30 days with only 3 major blemishes?</li>
            <li> For the first few months, the BP treatments cleared my skin quite dramatically</li>
            <li> Plus the price has gone down making this very affordable.  </li>
            <li> If it gets too hot, then back off a little bit.     </li>
            <li> This has been the exact same problem for every single Zeno device I have owned, but the last one was by far the biggest joke, since the others lasted a few months.  </li>
            <li> This is that quick fix for those huge painful zits that you can get.</li>
            <li> However, I have not experienced any damage/pain, so it&#x27;s working fine for me.  </li>
            <li> I apply ice right when I see one forming for at least 5 mins and it prevents it from forming (I figured this out by accident).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about other people, but even really early on, I can tell how \\&quot;severe\\&quot; a pimple is going to be.</li>
            <li> Even so, the battery life is given as 3-4 years, which means the device will only last you that long.      </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to fall prey when you&#x27;re desperate for clear skin but look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> but, in this case, Zeno definitely does not live up to the big promises it makes.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really worked.</li>
            <li> It just sucks that we&#x27;re all so vain and self-conscious in this country (blame society) that we&#x27;re willing to pay whatever amount of money for something like this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done this now at least 45-50 times because I just bought my first tip replacement.  </li>
            <li> (I am appearing in a play that opens in three weeks and just couldn&#x27;t face the thought of zits that might last that long - or additional ones.)</li>
            <li> I just wish the head would last twice as long.</li>
            <li> It helped a little, but nowhere near enough to justify the price.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it seems to be as long as you use the product as intended, it works!  </li>
            <li> I have had a few \\&quot;opportunities\\&quot; to use it when I have felt a new zit coming.  </li>
            <li> She used it several times on her very minor blemishes and asked me to return it because she said it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The only instance where I had trouble was when I used the Zeno near my mouth, which the booklet tells you not to do since skin there</li>
            <li> I was desperate to try something new, and having this makes me feel a little more in control of my break outs.</li>
            <li> It also becomes less visually apparent, heals faster, and has a much lesser chance of leaving a scar.</li>
            <li> Zeno has worked for me when I have put it on the sore, red spots or very early pimples and within a treatment or two, the zit is gone, usually within a day or two.  </li>
            <li> And after a year of having this, it simply stopped working, and that really makes me angry since I spent so much money on it.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m in my early 40s, my skin is dry, and topical meds are harsh.  </li>
            <li> The device seems to work for various periods of time (my last one less than two weeks, so I am shipping it back), and then just stops working.  </li>
            <li> I did the same with the other 2 and had the same result.  </li>
            <li> and the other formed a white head on it, which I think the heat from the Zeno created, so I squeezed it and it was gone the next day.  </li>
            <li> The pimple did go away much sooner than with previous experiences and with less scarring too.</li>
            <li> It is not hot enough to damage the skin and any redness it leaves behind fades quickly.    </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really had to use it lately</li>
            <li> They are red under the skin pimples that do not always get a head on them and can last for a week or more and they can be painful.  </li>
            <li> As an added bonus, it doesn&#x27;t seem nearly as long a process while you&#x27;re driving.</li>
            <li> Yes, 2 1/2 minutes is a long time to sit while you heat up each blemish, but it beats the week of waiting for the blemish to come to the surface and then the month (or 2) of skin discoloration afterwards.  </li>
            <li> In the package, there was NO rechargeable battery, and NO 60-count treatment tip, but only an empty box.  </li>
            <li> I bought zeno out of that strange mix of despiration and optimism that plauges the acne-prone.  </li>
            <li> There is no recourse, waited too long to return (GIFT).  </li>
            <li> It takes too long.</li>
            <li> - so old that the rechargeable battery is dead and will no longer charge.  </li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> If you have insurance retinol products from the dermatologist at night can help too, but can be irritating so start off with a low dose at first.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I have the wrong kind of acne for it or</li>
            <li> Worse, my super sensitive skin would transform blemishes into dark red scars no matter what I did, and the scars would last at least a year-- total nightmare.  </li>
            <li> I usually get 3-4 new pimples every week that take about 3 days cycle to go away.</li>
            <li> I used the Zeno on my new spots as soon as I noticed them forming, and while they didn&#x27;t disappear overnight, they did stay small and disappear in about 3 days.  </li>
            <li> BUT...when I figure I spent $100 last summer to have a doctor lance a single blemish that had already been there three weeks (and ended up looking hideous for another two)</li>
            <li> I expected it to be hot, and it was a little uncomfortable at first.  </li>
            <li> And the manufacturers of this junk get rich on our insecurities and nearly blind faith and optimism.</li>
            <li> So I tried to send it back and they told me that it didn&#x27;t have to be returned due to the nature of the product.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks later I had that same pain on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> : Waste of time, cost is high, forced to buy more useless item to continue using the item,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually after 3 times, example (morning, night, morning) I find that the pimple is completely gone or 90% gone.  </li>
            <li> You can do this even on those zits that are past the early stages.  </li>
            <li> I have been battling the adult on-set blemishes for a few years (I thought pimples were for teens--darn it!)</li>
            <li> If you catch it early, you can usually keep it from ever forming.  </li>
            <li> Usually with the Zeno (if you catch it early)</li>
            <li> Somewhat disappointed, not as effective as advertising would lead one to believe.</li>
            <li> Basically it is a very expensive, ok spot treatment.  </li>
            <li> The most anoying thing is that instead of just selling the product they rigged it so it only works for about 100 times and you are forced to buy another expensive refill cartridge (or whatever they call it).  </li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ll admit I was very very skeptical....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a nice feeling to finally have a clear face after all the years of having those nasty little things on my face.     </li>
            <li> I think it can work only for small pimple but not the big ones.  </li>
            <li> Do double-cycles (allow the Zeno to remain on your skin after it beeps, then press the button for a second cycle) every few hours as long as the bump is detectable in any way.</li>
            <li> I knew that the zeno doesn&#x27;t work on white heads or black heads</li>
            <li> Usually, the zit would linger for a week or more and get worse, sometimes leaving a little scar in it&#x27;s place.  </li>
            <li> My personal opinion is that the makers of Zeno are greedy and cunning since they benefit by consumers having to purchase another expensive device, and they charge sky high prices for the replacement tips.  </li>
            <li> When she feels the initial tingle of a cold sore, she treats the area two times initially and then a couple more times during the day and it completely stops her cold sores from getting bigger.  </li>
            <li> but when I woke up this morning EVERY SINGLE ONE WAS GONE!    </li>
            <li> was now a small red flat spot.  </li>
            <li> if you have something large, this will make it worse.  </li>
            <li> A little ease on the pain but definitely no shrinkage.</li>
            <li> Another tip I have learned on my regular pimples is that if it has come to a white head, then I waited to late to use my Zeno.  </li>
            <li> Although, I&#x27;m not thrilled about the idea of buying replacement cartridges, the cost is similar to a Pro-Active type product, and it works without drying out my entire face.</li>
            <li> In that case, I didn&#x27;t feel any real discomfort and didn&#x27;t notice anything was wrong until later, looking in the mirror</li>
            <li> and I never really grew out of acne.</li>
            <li> The heat is not really an issue.  </li>
            <li> A few months ago I got a stubborn cystic zit on my forehead (the type that hurts and last for weeks.)   </li>
            <li> ,i got this a few years back.</li>
            <li> Well I saw the Zeno ad on the back of a magazine a few weeks ago, and bought one online.</li>
            <li> My lawyers are taking this up with the FDA before this product tries to go to Europe.    </li>
            <li> I was really curious about the product, so I started researching it the minute I got home.  </li>
            <li> I expected it.</li>
            <li> This is really not meant to permanently treat (ward off) it either.</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing it away just like the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li> Got a package few days ago, and the crumpled box  that was labeled as \\&quot;CLEARANCE\\&quot; with yellow color.</li>
            <li> I bought my Zeno back in October of 2007, so just a few months over one year ago.  </li>
            <li> It worked like a charm, but I used up the 60 uses a few weeks back</li>
            <li> I suppose there is no real cure for acne after all.</li>
            <li> From everything I heard about the Zeno, I expected it to keep them at bay and SHRINK them.</li>
            <li> read all of the instructions carefully before using the Zeno.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been plugged in for hours with absolutely no sign of life.  </li>
            <li> Put about a cup of uncooked rice into a zip-lock bag.</li>
            <li> I would definately be careful.</li>
            <li> I used it about 20 times and that means that I spent 50 minutes of my life holding it up to my face in the hope of my acne clearing.</li>
            <li> Normally, my spots would take at least a week or two to go down, and then as I said, they would remain in scar form.  </li>
            <li> SOOOO disappointed that my only options now are to do without or buy a whole new device.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I STILL have a number of blemishes from before I bought the Zeno over two weeks ago, while the new ones that I treated are long gone, leaving no traces behind.  </li>
            <li> Unable to find much useful information, I was in a desperate situation, needing to be socially presentable and with giant welling red spots all over my face and a big meeting days away.</li>
            <li> this product is useless and a waste because you could accomplish the same thing with a spoon and hot water.  </li>
            <li> It does really help with the swelling, and accelerates the healing process, but I usually find it takes at least four treatments for one pimple.</li>
            <li> your laser cartridges are almost empty cause you&#x27;ve been zapping your face so much, so you&#x27;re forced to either hide behind a Space Rock or engage in some hand-to-hand combat, and as we all know about the Borellians, they have GIANT hands.     </li>
            <li> My daughter suffers from moderate to severe acne so after reading all of the positive reviews of the Zeno we decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I still get pimples, which usually start as sore, red spots.  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m in the other 10%.  </li>
            <li> You only need to buy replacement cartridges when treatments have no more life.</li>
            <li> I would recommend you try other methods of acne control before gambling on this one - unless you like a hassle.</li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s way too expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> The other 60%, the zeno just makes it come to a head a lot quicker</li>
            <li> uses cartridges which heat up a small metal tip to a specific temperature that you apply to your zit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, antibiotics, spironlactone, acnezine, and just about every other cream, wash, scrub out there.  </li>
            <li> small, big, cystic, non-cystic, name it....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any other side effect.   </li>
            <li> Well it doesn&#x27;t work on any other types of acne either.</li>
            <li> It may even pay off in the end because you won&#x27;t need to buy other pimple solutions.  </li>
            <li> In the past, nodes and cysts could last for weeks.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I attempted to use it for the first time after the 30 day return window.  </li>
            <li> have no web site that I can find, other than one that just invites email</li>
            <li> The Zeno works as described by the other reviews</li>
            <li> As mentioned in other posts, this product works[..]</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;ve done instead, and this has worked extremely well:</li>
            <li> I bought this product after VERY careful research and reading all the reviews and instruction tips.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about this product, despite the mostly positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I knew that a giant cystic zit was forming even though you could hardly see anything.  </li>
            <li> I found no success with it.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the fact that it&#x27;s time-consuming for the device to start up, but it&#x27;s technology...</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that I used it 40 or 50 times total, and it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> You may get very slight burning of your skin (causing a whitish film or slight peeling) and you may go through your cartridge tips quickly, but believe me, it&#x27;s worth it to avoid the horrible months-long process of cystic acne.</li>
            <li> Totally not worth it for me.</li>
            <li> Basic common sense that you would use with your cell phone applies.</li>
            <li> On a 2 day old pimple that&#x27;s red and painful, if I ice it for about 10 mins, I find that it brings it to the surface the next day.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make it worse, but it didn&#x27;t speed up the process as far as I could tell.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t count down times on the cartridge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mine for a couple of spots and the count has never gone down.</li>
            <li> but if you get a pesky pimple every so often this def helps cut down the size and helps it go away faster,it basically uses heat to kill the bacteria.</li>
            <li> a couple hundred dollars down the drain...</li>
            <li> but I am appalled that the manufacturers of such an expensive product clearly DO NOT back it...and the automated voice message that starts with \\&quot;Your call is very important to us\\</li>
            <li> They no longer had a hard spot under them and were flat.  </li>
            <li> Cons: can make some pimples worse; battery is non-replaceable; must be diligent and catch pimples in early stages; expensive; expensive replacement charges; takes more than one charge to work    </li>
            <li> When I use the Zeno, it goes away in a few days without the hard red bump (that most of the time ends up getting infected and popping into a bloody mess anyway!)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once a month, I will get the occasional breakout and every two months or so, I will get the large, painful, nodular acne.</li>
            <li> and I also sometimes get those painful deep large nodule pimples.</li>
            <li> other times it just was a waste.</li>
            <li> It is very small and always takes care of the acne that pops up when I travel to a different climate.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work as well as the all over Zeno device, the spot treatment only works for very small pimples,</li>
            <li> Would not recommend unless you have one or two pimples or less per</li>
            <li> Seven months ago I used my zeno just like the instructions stated, just like the previous time</li>
            <li> When it comes to treating and managing acne, I have tried most everything, usually being disappointed.  </li>
            <li> B001AXDAIA Zeno Mini Acne Clearing Device Black 45 Treatment Cycles]] on Amazon or on the Zeno website</li>
            <li> It did not shrink my pimple and it did not make them hurt less.  </li>
            <li> slightly--</li>
            <li> is that when the battery dies- it is a useless device forcing you into another new Zeno.&lt;br</li>
            <li> treatment lasts 2.5 minutes and while not exactly pleasant, is entirely tolerable.  </li>
            <li> I am 33 years old and have moderate acne that is very difficult to treat.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that this little device is a life saver.</li>
            <li> Zeno was no better than any other treatment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over two weeks</li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive about spending this much money on an acne \\&quot;device\\&quot;, but I was desperate..</li>
            <li> just got it a few weeks ago but works well.</li>
            <li> Seemed to actually make it worse.  </li>
            <li> I use Zeno along with my everyday routine.</li>
            <li> Though it remained a few days did not come to a head.  </li>
            <li> This product came to me with a dead cartridge.</li>
            <li> Green.</li>
            <li> You must reorder proprietary tips and it&#x27;s likely this is a rip-off.</li>
            <li> Second of all, maybe I was confused by the advertising, but it doesn&#x27;t work quite like</li>
            <li> I will admit that I have not been using it every few hours as mentioned on the package.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if you have one pimple, but even if you had 1 pimple it would be a pain in the neck to use because you&#x27;d be ironing it every few hours.   </li>
            <li> With the Zeno, it goes away in a few days without popping.  </li>
            <li> although it dried out the pimples, it also made her skin burn.</li>
            <li> This device takes care of them within a few days.</li>
            <li> every few months</li>
            <li> Extension cord ($5)    Connect it all together (putting the 10Wlight bulb in the nightlight base) and start with the light at the lowest dimmer setting.</li>
            <li> Do a few at a time, don&#x27;t rush into it.  </li>
            <li> I have this Zeno and it&#x27;s money wasted.</li>
            <li> wish I never bought this product when you can do it yourself for just a few pennies.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin</li>
            <li> However, a little over a month later, the SECOND device began malfunctioning, and Zeno corporation is impossible to get a hold of.  </li>
            <li> When I feel a slight sore red bump coming up under the skin and painful to the touch, I grab my Zeno because after two times using it, the red bump all but disappears.  </li>
            <li> that if you use the Zeno on a big zit and/or one that has already become a pustule it will make it worse and not better.    </li>
            <li> I get little small zits here</li>
            <li> It gets hot, but I don&#x27;t find it painful at all.</li>
            <li> I havn&#x27;t seen a company stand behind their product like this in a long time.</li>
            <li> but finally took the plunge and selfishly purchased a Zeno a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Not sure if time does the trick of curing.</li>
            <li> AND keep all the paperwork, box, and charger, because it&#x27;s stated in small print you do need it to get the refund.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, or time!</li>
            <li> My wife and I are critical thinkers and skeptical scientists.</li>
            <li> and theres no more pain.</li>
            <li> For the past 15 years I have been suffering from acne.</li>
            <li> I have used Zeno for the past 6 months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it does that though, just by heat?? ...</li>
            <li> Usually I keep pimples for weeks at a time.</li>
            <li> This works, but the fact that you have to buy expensive cartridges, after spending $250 on an item is total BS.</li>
            <li> For about the past year or so, I had been using 2.5% Benzoyl peroxide twice a day, every day.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how the company is getting the word out.</li>
            <li> Like if you worked on an alien spaceship and you had a laser pistol that you kept in case of Borellian attacks, and you just started shooting yourself in the face with it.  </li>
            <li> Not really satisfied about that.  </li>
            <li> I dont usually write reviews, but the Zeno definetly worked for me and I will recommend it to my friends.  </li>
            <li> Put the bag in the microwave for not more than 20 seconds.</li>
            <li> Usually within 1 day the pimple subsides and is gone within a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pleased.</li>
            <li> This means no more eruptions which means no scarring.  </li>
            <li> , I could see a small outline in the shape of the tip.  </li>
            <li> Those who are suffering from moderate to severe acne know that at times the acne starts just a very small pimple and then in couple of hours it starts to become tender, red and painful</li>
            <li> the device did not work from the beginning and after filling a complaint still i am not able to return the item.</li>
            <li> It gets a tiny bit painful towards the end when its really hot, but not so painful that I have to remove it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product but was disappointed to get no result from using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now in my late 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I figured I probably started treatment too late</li>
            <li> At least I don&#x27;t have to walk around with pimples for a month before they go away.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently, and I was afraid I would be someone who would not get results from the Zeno.  </li>
            <li> I believe there is no wearout mechanism, and it&#x27;s a ripoff to be forced to buy replacement tips.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t buy this product until a very large, painful, nodular pimple had already formed beneath the skin.</li>
            <li> It says on the package \\&quot;clinically proven\\&quot; but what does that mean?</li>
            <li> And for the record, what DOES clinically proven mean?  </li>
            <li> My blemishes generally don&#x27;t have \\&quot;heads\\&quot;; rather, they are painful areas below the surface of the skin.    </li>
            <li> I always get some pimples during, ahem, that time of the month, and it really is annoying, because I normally dont get any at all.</li>
            <li> Sometimes those deep bumps (cystic acne) can stick around for 2-3 weeks and then leave a bad scar.  </li>
            <li> I have red, painful cystic acne</li>
            <li> Frustrating to say the least.</li>
            <li> Considering its exhorbitant price, this is not a good choice.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive and need to be replaced quickly, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to spot treatments like Salicylic Acid, the Zeno doesn&#x27;t leave a hard bump that takes months (literally!)</li>
            <li> My guess is if you have random annoying pimples, but not something you&#x27;d consider and acne problem, and you catch these pimples BEFORE they really develop and show, this device is for you.</li>
            <li> I also hated all the loud beeping noises it made, and you have to stand in front of the mirror for 3 minutes at a time holding this clumsy object up to your face.</li>
            <li> what would once be a large, painful and ugly &#x27;zit&#x27; stays under the skin,</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will admit this is an expensive little contraption and the replacement cartridges are also expensive.  </li>
            <li> and if I continues peeling I will need skin graft, my skin is so thin from it</li>
            <li> PLUS, it makes the zit look much worse for hours</li>
            <li> Unfortunatly, I think my acne is worse now than when I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Proactiv refining mask and am now using the Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay mask</li>
            <li> B00016WSAI Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay - 2 lbs]]    </li>
            <li> Worse than that, the device itself cannot be charged.  </li>
            <li> but alas, no improvement.</li>
            <li> I was trying to charge it on was broken.</li>
            <li> spam.&lt;br /&gt;Either these replacement cartridges where knockoff&#x27;s or this is an enterprise that borders on criminal.  </li>
            <li> Try doing that in a public bathroom, you look like an idiot.</li>
            <li> this is the biggest rip-off I&#x27;ve ever fallen for.</li>
            <li> Last night, I used it on SEVEN pimples that were beginning to form (this is a bad breakout for me!).  </li>
            <li> otherwise this can be REALLY expensive to try to keep up on because of replacing cartridges.  </li>
            <li> Kinda expensive</li>
            <li> If this device wasn&#x27;t so expensive, I might not care - but two defective devices for $100?  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an expensive gimmick.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews of this EXPENSIVE product, I thought it had to work.</li>
            <li> I was wrong, this product did not work for me</li>
            <li> Its just an expensive placebo device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be a money making scheme.  </li>
            <li> I WILL BE RETURNING THIS USELESS DEVICE.</li>
            <li> While my skin is not perfect, the Zeno is helping.    </li>
            <li> I just wish the cartridges were not so expensive.</li>
            <li> Yeah, the thing&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> Feel sorry for the retailers.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for my teenage daughter who does not have terrible acne, but does get a pimple here &amp; there.</li>
            <li> Also this item so TOOO expensive for it not to work.</li>
            <li> I guess that I am stuck with a $180 useless device.</li>
            <li> I zapped it, felt sort of numb</li>
            <li> And the treatment heads/cartridges are way too expensive!</li>
            <li> However, I am very sad to say that Zeno did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> If you let time go, then it&#x27;s going to be very difficult for Zeno to take care of it.   </li>
            <li> Of course heat will kill a pimple, so it works, but the Zeno is very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> My doctor said it was a bad burn</li>
            <li> but when I come across a BAD product with no support, I feel obligated to let everyone know.</li>
            <li> Guess what... the painful, month-long zit never formed.  </li>
            <li> and it grows on an hourly base.</li>
            <li> my skin is annoying even if i don&#x27;t pop my pimples  </li>
            <li> I was also told by a friend of mine that gets terrible cold sores that she has been using the Zeno for a year on them and it has changed her life.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, if considering buying this, don&#x27;t let the \\&quot;30 day satisfaction guarantee\\&quot; be a factor in your decision -- it is completely WORTHLESS when service is nonexistent.</li>
            <li> I hate this thing</li>
            <li> I hate spending money on gadgets</li>
            <li> I was burned very badly on my face.  </li>
            <li> Very ugly...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This has been a LIFESAVER for those evil buggers.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Took it to Florida for my brother&#x27;s wedding, the bride used it the night before and had good things to say also. just got it a few weeks ago but works well. worth the price. five stars</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really worked. It looks like it&#x27;s working at first, and then an hour later after treating I did not notice any reduction in pimple size.  Would not recommend unless you have one or two pimples or less per week-- otherwise this can be REALLY expensive to try to keep up on because of replacing cartridges.  My acne is moderate, and I have had it for over 10 yrs. Hope this helps! :)</li>
            <li> I am firstly amazed at this technology seeing how it seems so simple and natural (using heat) but yet is so brillant.  I am an all natural, holistic health person who avoids chemicals for my face if possible.  ZENO is a solution to this problem.  It works for me, and I find it so easy to use too.  I can&#x27;t believe this has never been thought of before now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a hotspot and regular zeno model for a while.  I am continuously amazed by it&#x27;s effectiveness.  Last night, I used it on SEVEN pimples that were beginning to form (this is a bad breakout for me!).  I was a little nervous because I don&#x27;t normally get this many at once, but when I woke up this morning EVERY SINGLE ONE WAS GONE!    What a great, chemical free way to keep your skin clear!  I have to admit that I&#x27;ve tried a couple other similar products on the market, but this one is the most consistently effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure everyone responds to this treatment differently, but I received mine 4 days ago and have used it on 2 cystic acne formations on my face, and within 36 hours the cyst did not hurt anymore. Although it did surface a bit, the size was significantly smaller than it usually would be, and it was already drying up with no scarring which is amazing. An improvement from the days/weeks it would take otherwise.    The product says not to be used on whitehead, blackhead and cystic acne so buyer beware if you are prone to all of these.   But if you want to take the chance as I did, I would recommend the product. The price may seem high, but it could be more than worth it for you too.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any luck treating hormonal acne. Seemed to actually make it worse.  I am returning this back to Amazon.</li>
            <li> My daughter used this on Christmas day and loved it.  The next day the red spot was gone, no pimple!!!</li>
            <li> Kinda expensive but Ive had zits for along time and this thing is truly a miracle.  Zap a zit in one night wake up- its gone!  Really good for boils too.</li>
            <li> After using Zeno for about 6 months, I wanted to write in to let others know that I have had incredible results using it on my cystic type pimples too.  I would consider these to be the type that last forever, can scar, are deep under the skin and hurt!  I know the instructions say it is not for this type of pimple, but I tried it anyways and it has worked well for me.  I usually do have to treat these type pimples a few more times than the instructions recommend for regular pimples, but the outcome is worth the time and effort since I don&#x27;t have to worry about scarring.  Another tip I have learned on my regular pimples is that if it has come to a white head, then I waited to late to use my Zeno.  Using it at first site is key.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now in my late 20&#x27;s and I never really grew out of acne. I still get pimples, which usually start as sore, red spots.  Zeno has worked for me when I have put it on the sore, red spots or very early pimples and within a treatment or two, the zit is gone, usually within a day or two.  Usually, the zit would linger for a week or more and get worse, sometimes leaving a little scar in it&#x27;s place.  This doesn&#x27;t work well on mature zits though, which is fine because that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s intended for and from experience I can testify that it is true, as the manufacturer states, that if you use the Zeno on a big zit and/or one that has already become a pustule it will make it worse and not better.    The heat is not really an issue.  It&#x27;s a shock when you initially put the device on a sore spot, the heat amplified by the sensitivity of the inflamed skin, but your skin and the device adjust.  It is not hot enough to damage the skin and any redness it leaves behind fades quickly.    An experience I had with the Zeno sometimes  was when a zit wouldn&#x27;t disappear, but rather accelerate in duration, meaning it would quickly, perhaps overnight after a pre-bedtime treatment, turn into a mature pustule and then pop and dissolve by the morning of the next day.  The good news is that those zits didn&#x27;t become big and didn&#x27;t scar when they healed.  I would recommend this product to people who have moderate acne and are sensitive to topical products because I have fair, sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use benzoyl peroxide and other harsh chemicals on my face.  You put it on the zit for a couple of minutes and you&#x27;re done. While this doesn&#x27;t heal acne completely, it does prevent skin from becoming worse from drying out and scarring.</li>
            <li> Thank you Zeno!      A few months ago I got a stubborn cystic zit on my forehead (the type that hurts and last for weeks.)   About 3 days after it formed I started using Zeno.  Unfortunately, Zeno didn&#x27;t do any good and it took about a month to clear up.  I figured I probably started treatment too late so I decided to keep the Zeno and give it another try.      A few weeks later I had that same pain on my forehead.  I knew that a giant cystic zit was forming even though you could hardly see anything.  I grabbed my Zeno without being too hopeful and zapped away.  The next morning I treated it again.  Guess what... the painful, month-long zit never formed.  I stayed clear and confident.  This has happened the same way several times.  No zits in several months!    The confidence gained by having a clear face is great.  Better yet, it is so comforting knowing that I can effectively fight any zit that begins to form on my face. Thank you Zeno.  (Oh, and I also suggest taking a daily multi-vitamin to help fight acne)</li>
            <li> yes you need to get them &#x27;early&#x27; but it does really work.  pimples that would take a full week or 10 days for me are gone in 2 or 3 days.  what would once be a large, painful and ugly &#x27;zit&#x27; stays under the skin, is MUCH smaller and goes away much more quickly.  highly recommend this product, despite the price tag. I thought about buying one of these for months, but didn&#x27;t want to shell out the $150...i wish i had bought it sooner.  no regrets here!</li>
            <li> Works okay on some blemishes</li>
            <li> Literally left scars on my face. Burn scars actually. Doesn&#x27;t work. It just sucks that we&#x27;re all so vain and self-conscious in this country (blame society) that we&#x27;re willing to pay whatever amount of money for something like this. Seriously, not to get all philosophical, but with the premium we all place on physical appearance, even if we know there&#x27;s little chance of a product actually doing what it claims we&#x27;re still willing to take the chance... because WHAT IF? Ya know. $150, $200, whatever... we feel it&#x27;s worth a shot. And the manufacturers of this junk get rich on our insecurities and nearly blind faith and optimism. BUNK !!!!</li>
            <li> I had the Zeno for a week before I returned it. I didn&#x27;t give it one star, because it did work, but only very selectively. The only type of zits it had a significant effects on were zits that could have easily been -- pardon me -- dealt with manually. I was aware of the two and a half minute wait before I bought it, but I honestly didn&#x27;t realize how long that would feel if you stay true to the instructions and do multiple applications on one zit in a day.    If one were really squeamish about squeezing out burgeoning pimples, then this is a decent device. However, for me, that wasn&#x27;t worth $100 and a two-and-a-half-minute wait.</li>
            <li> Somewhat disappointed, not as effective as advertising would lead one to believe. Purchased for my teenager who as the normal occassinal problem with breakouts at inoppertune times.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how excited I was to learn about this product.  And after reading all the fabulous reviews, I was even more convinced.  However, I am very sad to say that Zeno did not work for me.  It didn&#x27;t alleviate the pain of blemishes, it didn&#x27;t speed recovery -- nothing.      At first I used it religiously and studiously according to the instructions: use at the first sign of a blemish, 2-3 treatments for each, spread out over 12-24 hours.  When, after many attempts, that didn&#x27;t work, I tried using it all different ways -- frequent zapping versus single attempt; two zaps in a row; after cooling my skin with water, after heating it with steam, et cetera.  Nada.      In the owner&#x27;s manual it says that Zeno worked for 90% of the people in their clinical trial.  I guess I&#x27;m in the other 10%.  Here are my skin stats, to help others make a best guess about whether Zeno will work for them: I&#x27;m in my late 20s and have combination skin and mild to moderate acne.  My blemishes generally don&#x27;t have \\&quot;heads\\&quot;; rather, they are painful areas below the surface of the skin.    Best of luck to those who try it!</li>
            <li> I use the zeno on those one or two pimples I get every month that you know days before they appear that something is brewing under the skin. Its perfect for these! I use it one time and the pimple never even shows its face. I love this product and wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any other \\&quot;gadget\\&quot; in the world.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter,she is very happy with it.I have noticed it is working on her face does take some time to get used to applications. You must follow directions exactly or you won&#x27;t see the right results</li>
            <li> The effect wasn&#x27;t as effective as I expected. Not sure if time does the trick of curing.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this little device is a life saver. I&#x27;m a person who always breaks out. I&#x27;m constantly purchasing anti acne products, and over time, it can be costly! May I also add, I have to also purchase make-up to cover up acne and blemishes. However, with this product, I must admit that it has reduced my acne!! If used correctly, at the first sign of a pimple, this device eliminates  pimples within 24-48 hours. It&#x27;s amazing!! It doesn&#x27;t work if you already have a pimple. But, if you catch it early, it will make it go away. I use Zeno along with my everyday routine. I bought Zeno before my wedding, and that day I was acne free. I&#x27;ve had Zeno for about 3 months, and it is wonderful!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my wife for Christmas.  The first one we received wouldn&#x27;t charge.  So I tried to send it back and they told me that it didn&#x27;t have to be returned due to the nature of the product.  They sent me a replacement.  The replacement they sent me did the exact same thing as the first one, would never take a charge. So I sent it back for a refund. I can&#x27;t really speak to how good the product actually works. All I know is they don&#x27;t make a good product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now, and it honestly does work. Just make sure you get the pimple ASAP. I always get some pimples during, ahem, that time of the month, and it really is annoying, because I normally dont get any at all. Even if you have a big pimple, this will reduce it. It gets a tiny bit painful towards the end when its really hot, but not so painful that I have to remove it. It does leave my fair skin a little red, so I have my concealer ready. It does work,k better than creams and such.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after VERY careful research and reading all the reviews and instruction tips. It did not work for me AT ALL. I have red, painful cystic acne and I applied the Zeno the second I noticed a bump under my skin, all it did was leave a red mark on my skin for 30-60mins. I even did multiple treatment cycles several times a day, and a week later still no response! You have to keep it charged 24/7 because the battery dies after about 2-3 uses. I regret spending almost $100 on this...</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin like I do and have breakouts, you will find that the Zeno will get rid of your pimples before they have a chance.  The minute I feel a pimple coming on I use the Zeno on that spot.  This prevents the pimple from fully developing.  Usually after 3 times, example (morning, night, morning) I find that the pimple is completely gone or 90% gone.  This is the best I have ever found and recommend it highly to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> Zeno seems to work fairly well, but you have to be very diligent about catching newly emerging zits.  The fact that you have to replace the tips is just a royal waste of money and resources (thanks, planned obsolescence!), but if you keep turning the unit on after it automatically shuts off (instead of starting the treatment cycle), you should be able to get the same results and extend the life of the tip.  I was desperate to try something new, and having this makes me feel a little more in control of my break outs.</li>
            <li> I rarely get the kind of acne that Zeno caters to, but when I do, they NEVER go away. This thing made one that&#x27;s been on my face for three months now. It is no more. :D    There&#x27;s a \\&quot;cheat\\&quot; to Zeno so it doesn&#x27;t count down times on the cartridge. Let it power up. When it&#x27;s ready, put it on the spot. Wait until you hear the first beep. Turn off the cycle button, then turn off the thing completely. Turn it back on and go back to using it on the spot. (Optional: Wait until another cycle is ready and re-use until you hear the first beep.) I&#x27;ve used mine for a couple of spots and the count has never gone down. (:</li>
            <li> But most people I know who have had a zeno end up getting rid of it.  I was one of them. All it does is heat up the pimple.  That&#x27;s it!  This isn&#x27;t worth the expense.  Also I think it depends on the kind of acne you have because it didn&#x27;t work on mine.  I have only a mild acne problem-  I rarely have more than 3 pimples on my face at once.  And this just didn&#x27;t work for me any better than other acne products do.</li>
            <li> To simulate the experience, run a metal spoon under hot water for about a minute (as long as it takes for the unit to heat up) Leave the water running and repeatedly hold the spoon to the sore spot until the spoon cools, then reheat it. Heck, hold one spoon underwater and one on your face then switch them out. Just as much inconvenience as holding this thing up for 2 minutes.    I did a lot of research before purchasing this product and all the while I just wanted to know what it really does. Unable to find much useful information, I was in a desperate situation, needing to be socially presentable and with giant welling red spots all over my face and a big meeting days away. I got the unit through amazon prime and almost immediately regretted it.    We need to educate ourselves on what a product actually is, not what it&#x27;s claiming to be. Mystery surrounding some magic degree of Fahrenheit in which \\&quot;acne-bacteria\\&quot; decides to go packing like the mucus cartoon in that cough medicine commercial.   Take into account every factor before deciding if something does or doesn&#x27;t work. Maybe the people who so fervently claim the unit works are subconsciously refraining from picking at their pimples, thus shortening their life. Or perhaps they are taking extra care with them and also applying some type of topical treatment. Perhaps these people who claim it works are coincidentally experiencing success because of other influences like decrease in stress, environment changes, weather changes, hormone changes, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc.    It says on the package \\&quot;clinically proven\\&quot; but what does that mean? I decided to clinically test it on myself, the bathroom being my clinic.  The first spot I tried it on was already two days old, 1/4 red sore spot welling up under my chin. I zapped it, felt sort of numb and the heat eased the pain at first. Then my husband pointed out...if it&#x27;s hot enough to kill bacteria, it ought to be hot enough to burn the skin. It didn&#x27;t burn the skin.  Then a day later I had another sore spot on my upper lip. I zapped it, and zapped the red, now very sore, spot on my chin again. Later that day the red spot was still there, sore as ever, and the spot on my lip welled up to a HUGE whitehead. The chin spot never came to a head but didn&#x27;t do much anything else either.  Then I had another one on my nose, a large red spot just under the surface, an ideal situation for what was described in the instructions. I zapped it. A little ease on the pain but definitely no shrinkage. Though it remained a few days did not come to a head.  Finally the 30 days were almost up and remaining unconvinced, I sent it back. Besides, 30 days with only 3 major blemishes? Everyone should be so lucky.    And for the record, what DOES clinically proven mean?  \\&quot;more than one controlled study\\&quot; but not regulated by the FDA or anyone else unless specified, and therefore worth, as I see it, about as much as a zit on my face.    What works, really works, for me? A quick daily dose of steamy water, a washcloth, followed up with dabs of $3 store brand salicylic acid gel.    Make your own decision, but I hope this review helps you decide to keep your money, or at least keep your receipt! AND keep all the paperwork, box, and charger, because it&#x27;s stated in small print you do need it to get the refund.</li>
            <li> you have to replace cartridges so thatz an extra cost,i got this a few years back. In my opinion if you have a lot of severe acne maybe not the best,it doesn&#x27;t get rid of my pimples in 24 hrs like magic but does shrink da little bugger down so pretty good if you got a pimple and are about to go to a party,just use Zeno shrinks it down and cover the rest with make up. Itz not a magic device that you are going to have clear skin right away and won&#x27;t even be able to tell you ever had a pimple there but it def does help,only problem is i have a new pimple every day so would constantly have to use the zeno so i only use it if i&#x27;m going to a party or something,it&#x27;s not some magic device,i think if you have acne problems skip it and go to a doctor but if you get a pesky pimple every so often this def helps cut down the size and helps it go away faster,it basically uses heat to kill the bacteria.</li>
            <li> I bought the zeno for my teenaged daughter. She says it works well and reduces her acne. But she had problems with her charger, that were basically consumer error. We called the company and they offered amazing support. I havn&#x27;t seen a company stand behind their product like this in a long time. Very refreshing.</li>
            <li> HELP, DOES ANYONE HAVE A SOLUTION TO MY PROBLEM?  Seven months ago I used my zeno just like the instructions stated, just like the previous time, only this time it was like a jolt and sting,I put ice on it and went to bed when I woke up the next morning I had a blister where i used my zeno it was burning and red.  It took me three weeks for the sore that formed to heal,that was 7 months ago and it is still peeling. My doctor said it was a bad burn and if I continues peeling I will need skin graft, my skin is so thin from it and it is on top of my nose so I am dreading a graft.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Has anyone else had a burn from their Zeno?</li>
            <li> supposedly brand new but did not even power on after charging. no problems with refund thanks to amazon</li>
            <li> So, this is my first try and things are great!  I can feel my zip shrinking- and it was not in the begining stages by any means!  Thank goodness I bought this thingy since I have a wedding to goto next week and I am pretty sure this zit would have still been there- but now I doubt I will even see it for two more days!  worth the money for sure. And no creepy chemicals! I am so happy- don&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
            <li> This product came to me with a dead cartridge. I replaced the cartridge, and then within a couple weeks the unit stopped powering on. I know they have a 30 day return policy on these, and suspect that I got one that had already been used and abused. This was to replace one that I lost, and I liked the old one, I had to use it repeatedly and it was expensive to buy the cartridges, but it did get rid of some cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I used this on my jaw line area for a area that was about to erupt to the skins surface. I did this last night before bed 1 time. This morning I woke up and its was about 85% gone. I was so pleased. I was ready to squeeze it last night- which is a absolute No-No for scarring reasons and contamination reasons. You squeeze- you spread the bacteria, scarring may occur, and you will cause additional breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow- That was 1 treatment. The only thing that I am dissatisfied from my understanding with- is that when the battery dies- it is a useless device forcing you into another new Zeno.&lt;br /&gt;The light indicators illuminate in a nice indiglo blue color- the heating button and the treatment button blink Amber then Green. It beeps every 30 seconds and then continues to do so for a complete cycle of 2 1/2 minutes. No need to use a clock for timing- it does it for you. When the device has completed heat up cycle the button turns to blinking Green light- You activate your treatment by pressing and then it remains a solid green light during entire treatment.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE- This is a Non-Disposable Zeno Device. You only need to buy replacement cartridges when treatments have no more life.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews about the Zeno and was very excited to get it.  It did seem to make my pimples go away faster at first.  After my second cartridge, it didn&#x27;t seem to work as good.  My skin didn&#x27;t look any better.  I have pale skin and it left red marks that would eventually fade after about an hour.  It takes a while to treat a couple of pimples so it wasn&#x27;t easy to do in the morning when you have a hectic schedule.  It does nothing to prevent new pimples either.  Basically it is a very expensive, ok spot treatment.  [...]</li>
            <li> I bought it for my son.  He used it for two days and I already see the difference.  I hope this will be the answer to his acne problem.</li>
            <li> This does not work at all. I dislike the protective timer that prevents you from using it for more three times in a row. I found no success with it. Get a chemical peel instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m perfectly aware that this device doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. I am in my early twenties, and i have been getting moderate acne since i was 12 years old. I have tried literally every acne-prevention product and any kind of home remedy you can think of (at one point I even tried to use toothpaste to burn off the zits). But as the years went by, I just sort of accepted that acne was something I am destined to live with forever.     Well I saw the Zeno ad on the back of a magazine a few weeks ago, and bought one online. I&#x27;ve only had this device two days, and every zit I have is just about faded now. I already caught one trying to form, and prevented it. It&#x27;s such a nice feeling to finally have a clear face after all the years of having those nasty little things on my face.     [...]    Either way I love it and I&#x27;m very happy with my results.</li>
            <li> I suffered with acne since I was a teen-ager, and it continued into adulthood.  As a teen-ager and 20-something, the topical meds helped because I had oily skin.  Now that I&#x27;m in my early 40s, my skin is dry, and topical meds are harsh.  Zeno helps heal the occasional bump without dehydrating my skin.</li>
            <li> I have reports and images of myself with 2nd degree burns from ZENO. A man from ZENO just quit after seeing over 100 cases of damages done. My lawyers are taking this up with the FDA before this product tries to go to Europe.    STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM IT!</li>
            <li> OK.  Is it perfect?  No.  Does it get rid of every pimple?  No.  But it is absolutely the best thing out there for those monsters under the skin.  Get to it early, maybe double up on the treatments and continue good hygiene, and it will go away, or be significantly reduced in size and pain.  This has been an issue for me for years, and I now think it can be managed.</li>
            <li> I have been using ZENO for 2 years.  I do not have to use it as much as I used to..it has completely stopped zits in my problem area.  Now if I feel a zit coming on I use it early and my face is clear.  It is the only thing I use for acne now.  My children are getting close to the teen years and they will have one to use too.</li>
            <li> I suffer hormonal acne, means I would have monster zits around my mouth once a month and they stick around for weeks.... Very ugly... But this month, only one became fully grown visible zit and disappearing quickly.     What I did was check my face twice a day for suspicious bumps to treat them right away. Most of bumps would go away over night. Those bumps that didn&#x27;t go away, I still attacked them with zeno twice a day.This method worked very well for me.     I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with pregnancy acne since August, so I decided to give the Zeno a try.  However, I have had nothing but hassles.  The first Zeno I received did not charge properly, so I had to return it through Amazon (with no problems, they don&#x27;t charge for return shipping and I had my new one within a week!)  The second one worked for about a month, and when I used it, it worked pretty well.  I used it about ten times, and though it did not always stop the pimple completely, it certainly shorted it&#x27;s life span (and size!)  I was happy, and no longer felt that sense of dread when I felt a pimple coming - I could just use the Zeno and it would be no big deal!  However, a little over a month later, the SECOND device began malfunctioning, and Zeno corporation is impossible to get a hold of.  Several calls and e-mails later, I am unable to get in touch with them and stuck with a $100 piece of plastic that I was only able to use ten times.  If this device wasn&#x27;t so expensive, I might not care - but two defective devices for $100?  I&#x27;m not letting this matter drop and WILL get my money back.  Bottom line is, it would be great - if the device would turn on for longer than 15 seconds.  I would recommend you try other methods of acne control before gambling on this one - unless you like a hassle.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, or time!</li>
            <li> I ordered a Zeno from Amazon over a year ago, I&#x27;d buy it again in a second.  It&#x27;s worked for me EVERY time I&#x27;ve used it according to the instructions.</li>
            <li> I have had acne since I was 16, and I have used every product short of going to the dermotologist.  The problem I have always had is that my skin gets used to my daily regiment within 2-4 months, and then I am stuck looking for new products.    I had never heard of Zeno and came across the product in a Bed Bath &amp; Beyond while looking for facial pads for my toner.  I was really curious about the product, so I started researching it the minute I got home.  I found several sites with customer feedback, and they were all positive.  I chose to go with the more expensive Zeno, because I wanted the rechargable battery over using 2 AA batteries.  I let the battery charge for about 8 hours before my first use.  I expected it to be hot, and it was a little uncomfortable at first.  However, with each use my skin is getting used to the heat.  It kind of feels like touching a sunburn as first (to me at least), but you do get used to it.  I had a really big mountian along the side of my nose, and an hour after the first use I could feel the reduction in the size of the pimple.  After the second use, the pimple was even with my skin and reducing in size more and more.  There is some redness after each use, but it does go away within about 10-20 minutes.    If you have tried everything, and aren&#x27;t ready to spend the money on a doctor, this is a great choice.  It is quick and easy to use.  Definitely the perfect tool to add to your daily regiment.</li>
            <li> Hi,   I bought this two years ago...  I used it about 10 times and I really didn&#x27;t notice any results.  PLUS, it makes the zit look much worse for hours so you could only use this the night before.  The most anoying thing is that instead of just selling the product they rigged it so it only works for about 100 times and you are forced to buy another expensive refill cartridge (or whatever they call it).  This really is a ripoff...   All this is is heat therapy...  The theory with heat is that elevated temperatures will kill bacteria. Why not just do something like heat some small smooth flat stones (like they do in spas by heating in water) and try that on problem areas?   This is not anything high tech...AVOID!!!</li>
            <li> I had always have acne prone skine. I used to use Proactive as a teenager and it works out pretty good but it dries my skin and starts to hurt when I gets closer to 30 with my oil glands changing. I bought this as a back up when I try the much lighter product Boot No7 cleanser. And it works out magically! 2 and 1/2 minutes morning and night. The size of the pimple diminishes right after the use and disappears at the end of the day. I recommend this to anyone who does not have many pimples any more and would like something less evasive on their face but still want pimple free. I only hope the price could be less pricy:)</li>
            <li> My wife and I are critical thinkers and skeptical scientists. Anecdotal evidence is not always trustworthy. What this product really needs is some independent clinical research. I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;ll ever have this kind of data. So, we may have to rely on anecdotal evidence. My wife and I guarded against placebo effect and if anything, were biased against believing the device would work. When I told my wife I&#x27;d ordered it, I was embarrassed, BUT, I&#x27;ll be darned, the thing seems to work. I believe the heat of the Zeno increases an immune response and may kill bacteria as well. The combination does seem to eliminate or mitigate acne. We&#x27;ve been using it for 8 months now and we believe it works. You must reorder proprietary tips and it&#x27;s likely this is a rip-off. Once you&#x27;ve purchased the unit, the tips work out to cost about 40 cents per treatment/pimple. My wife and I are adults and only have one or two pimples between the two of us a week. The Zeno seems to stop the pimples in their tracks.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t THAT great. First of all, it&#x27;s way too expensive for what it is. Second of all, maybe I was confused by the advertising, but it doesn&#x27;t work quite like I expected it. Only about 40% of the time does the pimple just \\&quot;disappear\\&quot; and heal. The other 60%, the zeno just makes it come to a head a lot quicker so it can be extracted. It does really help with the swelling, and accelerates the healing process, but I usually find it takes at least four treatments for one pimple. With a 60-count cartridge, that&#x27;s enough treatments for only 15 pimples. And the treatment heads/cartridges are way too expensive!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptic of this product at first. I bought this product because I have what I would consider mild to moderate adult acne. Once a month, I will get the occasional breakout and every two months or so, I will get the large, painful, nodular acne. The product states clearly what kinds of acne it does and does not work on. In the manual it states that it does not work on nodular or cystic acne. After reading reviews, many people stated that it did help with their more severe acne, so I thought it would be worth to try.  I don&#x27;t know about other people, but even really early on, I can tell how \\&quot;severe\\&quot; a pimple is going to be. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t buy this product until a very large, painful, nodular pimple had already formed beneath the skin. From experience, I knew this was going to be a \\&quot;big one\\&quot;. The product clearly states that it works best at the first signs of a pimple. I knew I missed the early critical stage of using this product, but I decided to use it anyway. The pimple did go away much sooner than with previous experiences and with less scarring too. I&#x27;m curious how the product would have worked if I would have been able to use it at the first signs of the pimple. I have used the product at the first signs of moderate acne and the product works great. The pimple will disappear before it even starts. Even though the product is ridiculously expensive for what it is, I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I do like this product.  Great for those monthly flare ups on the chin and forehead.  It works! You need to be consistent on treatment.  I gave it 4 stars just because there is always room for improvement with the way technology is now.  I know Zeno can up it&#x27;s performance hopefully in future models.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING especially being so close to 40 yrs old and this is the only thing that seems to work.  You do really need to use it at the first sign though.  some pimples are gone right away and some take a few days but that is way better than weeks!   The other thing that seems to work well for me is to make sure I exfoliate a few times a week.  Unfortunatly, I think my acne is worse now than when I was a teenager.  Creams, lotions and potions don&#x27;t seem to work so well either. Thank Goodness they came out with this product.  Worth the $$$$$!!!</li>
            <li> My husband also has the Mini ( which he was very pleased with &amp; uses when he travels ). He also puchased the Zeno Acne Cleaning Device &amp; has been happy with his results. It is surprising to see anything other than positive comments. He has always had problem skin &amp; this has produced such a great turn-around in his complexion. If anyone has doubts about its performance, I would recommend buying locally... You could always return if dissatisfied. From our experience it is definitly worth trying.  Clear Skinned Mississippian</li>
            <li> I use one almost daily and my 11 year old son does on a weekly basis.  First sign of acne and I am on it.  Could not be happier with the design, ease of use and effectiveness.  So many products claim to do something and this one actually does.  Thank you for creating this...it really works!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product several weeks ago.  I have had a few \\&quot;opportunities\\&quot; to use it when I have felt a new zit coming.  I have used the Zeno and have not really seen anything magical.  It seems like the zit still comes to the surface and stays for several days as they always have.  I will admit that I have not been using it every few hours as mentioned on the package.  I work all day and only have time to do treatments in the morning and evening - so perhaps it would make a difference if I were able to use it more frequently.  I will continue to try it in the future since it will not hurt anything and I still want to give it a fair chance.</li>
            <li> I have used this many years ago for which I just tossed it after the \\&quot;cartridge\\&quot; went empty. What? How can a metal tip just die? Even using it a second uses a count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will force you to buy more cartridge to use the product because it has in memory how many times you used it. Even when it is perfectly working fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, there was no reason for me to even mod it to make me able to use it more than the amount allowed because after using it for awhile, it has never worked or done a thing for me. As someone else stated, it simply heats up the creature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty much, you waste your time and also your money for this to do nothing more than heat up a tip and apply to skin which you can do with another metal tip by warming it up and applying to the skin. However, the Zeno is more \\&quot;safe\\&quot; because it is controlled on how the temperature is, though, it wouldn&#x27;t even matter since it doesn&#x27;t do much anything to most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would avoid buying any Zeno products due to the fact that they just force you to buy more cartridge tip with a memory chip to stop you using for longer than the ammo inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they allowed you to use it longer, then maybe I would say go for it, but don&#x27;t be surprised if it didn&#x27;t do more than heat a piece of skin and that&#x27;s it. Going outside can make you have a hot face if directly in the sun&#x27;s rays. Does that help you? no...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros : There&#x27;s no pros&lt;br /&gt;Cons : Waste of time, cost is high, forced to buy more useless item to continue using the item,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend? No, would not.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I found the device and multiple cartridges reduced by 80% at my local drug store as no one seemed to be interested in them. I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it otherwise as I couldn&#x27;t have seen spending the cash. This product does work. I have normal skin. I get little small zits here and I also sometimes get those painful deep large nodule pimples. This has been a LIFESAVER for those evil buggers. Warm compresses with a washcloth are nice but this actually targets it with a timed treatment. 2 treatments and theres no more pain. RELIEF! This is not meant to prevent acne in any way. This is really not meant to permanently treat (ward off) it either. This is that quick fix for those huge painful zits that you can get. To be honest I really can&#x27;t see someone using this for their whole face either. 1-5 pimples would be easy to do. 5 or more and it would seem like you&#x27;re just wasting your time and should be looking for clinical help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This uses cartridges which heat up a small metal tip to a specific temperature that you apply to your zit. It is intended to kill the bacteria deep within the the skin causing inflammation. I wonder though if maybe heating some water up to a certain temperature, dipping a metal spoon in it and then resting the very warm spoon over your zit wouldn&#x27;t save me money in the end...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now I have one unused cartridge left. Will I buy more? Maybe. I think for me I would only use this for traveling because it is highly convenient but doesn&#x27;t receive much consistent use at home.</li>
            <li> I own this Zeno product and all it does is get hot. It&#x27;s like placing a spoon under really hot water and holding it to your face. Heck maybe a silver spoon would actually help kill bacteria. I fell for the trick \\&quot;well it most send a \\&quot;specific\\&quot; amount of heat etc.\\&quot; this product only works in ironing the pimple and doesn&#x27;t seem to kill bacteria any better than benzyol peroxide. Are Zeno employees or employees at stores like Ulta and Sephora getting perks for writing reviews because there&#x27;s no way this product is helping people with moderate acne. Maybe if you have one pimple, but even if you had 1 pimple it would be a pain in the neck to use because you&#x27;d be ironing it every few hours.   Save your money it&#x27;s an expensive gimmick. Don&#x27;t even get me started on all the replacement heads I bought with my initial Zeno purchase in hopes I found something innovative. It&#x27;s easy to fall prey when you&#x27;re desperate for clear skin but look elsewhere. Products that contain benzyol peroxide as a lotion and sulfur as a mask to spot treat has worked pretty well for me. If you have insurance retinol products from the dermatologist at night can help too, but can be irritating so start off with a low dose at first. Your skin is an experiment when it comes to finding what work, but I whole heartidly this product is useless and a waste because you could accomplish the same thing with a spoon and hot water.  *Also my Zeno product no longer will charge and I made sure a lamp worked in the outlet just to make sure my outlet was not the problem.</li>
            <li> I generally have a clear complexion but wanted this for the occasional breakout.  I tried it on two different occasions and it did not do anything to decrease the breakout/zit.  After reading the reviews of this EXPENSIVE product, I thought it had to work. I was wrong, this product did not work for me and I would not recommend it.  Stick with creams, they seem to do the job much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties and have been suffering from cystic, hormonal breakouts on my chin for over ten years.  I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, antibiotics, spironlactone, acnezine, and just about every other cream, wash, scrub out there.  Then I came across this product at Target and did some online research before purchasing.  Since it had such rave reviews, I decided to make the investment.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  The product actually works on my large, takes a month to clear, cysts.  I am very aggressive, though.  I leave the unit on the spot until it warms and until it warms up again or even give it a double shot every four to five hours.  Costly, but worth it in my opinion.  I&#x27;ve only had the product a week and have already had to replace the tip (which I believe is a scam to generate a revenue stream), but if it will save me embarrassment and future scarring it is a dream come true.    Tip - it is very loud.  My husband teased me a bit because I was using the tool in the bathroom, and it sounded like I was playing video games.  Now I use it in the car on my way to work, driving to lunch and then home again. As an added bonus, it doesn&#x27;t seem nearly as long a process while you&#x27;re driving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old. For the past 15 years I have been suffering from acne. small, big, cystic, non-cystic, name it.... I have used many products, - if not all of them -. I have used Zeno for the past 6 months and I have to say it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m not sure how it does that though, just by heat?? ... Those who are suffering from moderate to severe acne know that at times the acne starts just a very small pimple and then in couple of hours it starts to become tender, red and painful and it grows on an hourly base. Now with Zeno, it prevents that growth and heals it to good extent that you can try your topical for boosting the removal. Every time I have doubt that this type Zeno is not going to work but after 2-3 times administering it on the pimple it AT LEAST shrinks it to a great extent. With this product you can give your skin some more time to heal and regenerates itself.  Side effects are not that great. Your skin in that part will become red for maybe 5-10 min but nothing to worry about, it will go away soon. I didn&#x27;t notice any other side effect.   One important thing is the time of applying Zeno. It works much better if applied as early as pimple has developed. If you let time go, then it&#x27;s going to be very difficult for Zeno to take care of it.   Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.   Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does seem like forever when you&#x27;re using this product but it does work.  Got it yesterday and was so excited to try it.  It is hot so at first, you may be a bit worried if it&#x27;s supposed to be THAT HOT.  But I noticed a major difference in my skin overnight.  I would suggest getting a replacement head at the time you get the Zeno itself as it does run out fast but if you only use it occasionally, it should last you a while.</li>
            <li> All the great reviews, FDA approval and the high price led me to buy this device thinking \\&quot;finally something that will work\\&quot;.  Well I question if many of the glowing reviews are legitimate.  This product has a nice believable concept, but doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the last 2 weeks, I used it on acne that is in the beginning stage (3 times per pimple per day) and noticed no difference whatsoever. It heats up the pimple for 2.5 minutes and gives you the impression it actually did something to make a difference - but it doesn&#x27;t actually have any affect on the growth of each pimple.  I understand this doesn&#x27;t work on cystic acne or one ingrown hair.  Well it doesn&#x27;t work on any other types of acne either. Its just an expensive placebo device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be a money making scheme.  It comes with a head that can only be used 60 times.  Then you have to buy a replacement head ($$$). Based on the head you could be spending $0.50 per use.  That adds up.  If this device worked as advertised I would not mind paying the high cost, but unfortunately, its just another excellently marketed scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no problem posting positive remarks for products that work as advertised.  Zeno does not work as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do have a 30 day return policy.  I WILL BE RETURNING THIS USELESS DEVICE.</li>
            <li> This thing actually works.  I had my doubts, but I figured a trip to the dermatologist would cost me the same amount as the zeno, plus whatever meds he prescribed; so I gave it a shot.  Yes, 2 1/2 minutes is a long time to sit while you heat up each blemish, but it beats the week of waiting for the blemish to come to the surface and then the month (or 2) of skin discoloration afterwards.  Do it while watching tv, and the time flies.  I&#x27;m happy with mine and wish I had known about the zeno months ago!  I can finally focus all my skin care regimen on anti-aging instead of anti-acne.</li>
            <li> When I remember to use the Zeno on the same day that I notice the pimple, it actually helps to reduce the inflammation and the pimple goes away much quicker.  Pimples used to stick around for over a week for me until they were ready to pop and then another few days to heal.  With the Zeno, it goes away in a few days without popping.  It&#x27;s so much better not to have to pop a pimple and risk infection and scarring!  HOWEVER, if I don&#x27;t treat a pimple within the first day, then the Zeno is useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is I don&#x27;t always remember to use it.  Even though it&#x27;s just a matter of keeping it charged and holding it to my face for a few minutes, that is still more time and effort than dabbing a little spot treatment on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to spot treatments like Salicylic Acid, the Zeno doesn&#x27;t leave a hard bump that takes months (literally!) to go away.  When I use the Zeno, it goes away in a few days without the hard red bump (that most of the time ends up getting infected and popping into a bloody mess anyway!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to use it AS SOON AS THE PIMPLE APPEARS.  I leave my Zeno at home so sometimes I don&#x27;t catch the pimple until the end of the day.  But even then, it&#x27;s better than leaving it to the next day.  If you catch it early enough, it works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit this is an expensive little contraption and the replacement cartridges are also expensive.  But it is worth it if you&#x27;re willing to put the time and money into it.  It may even pay off in the end because you won&#x27;t need to buy other pimple solutions.  Additionally, this is a natural solution so you&#x27;re not putting chemicals on your face or into the sewer system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for five years and it&#x27;s still working! I use it once or twice a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if only someone could invent a natural solution for the whiteheads around my nose!</li>
            <li> Zeno Acne Clearing Device with 60-Count Cartridge  very good! ótimo produto. cumpre o que promete. já usei e comprovei. recomendo para quem tem problemas com espinhas. pena que não vendam no Brasil!</li>
            <li> I was really excited about trying out this product. I ordered it and received it. I charged it for the 6 hours as it recommends yet it wouldn&#x27;t work. The seller did give me a refund back, but I still want to try the product. I&#x27;m thankful I did receive a refund.</li>
            <li> Great product..Some zits require two treatments but as long as I followed the directions and kept it on for the full time I never had problems with the zits developing.. Plus the price has gone down making this very affordable.  Very good concept!</li>
            <li> I had several pimples on my cheeks and under my nose. Not only was this easy to use they are already minimized and some completely gone after 3 days. Usually I keep pimples for weeks at a time. Wish I bought sooner.</li>
            <li> Both my sister in law and wife got these as gifts and their opinons were very similar.  If you got the pimple at just the right time you had some success and it sped up the healing process, other times it just was a waste. The price would suggest a better than 50% success rate and for that reason I would stay away from the Zeno Acne.</li>
            <li> I have moderate to severe adult acne - blackheads, pimples, cysts.  Currently, I can&#x27;t take any oral medication to keep things under control - just topical washes and gels.  I thought I&#x27;d give Zeno a try. While my skin is not perfect, the Zeno is helping.    I&#x27;ve been using the device when I first notice/feel a blemish developing.  I try to use it 2x a day.  In some cases, the blemish disappears overnight.  When it doesn&#x27;t, I honestly feel that with continued treatment, the blemishes tend to shrink and don&#x27;t last as long. In the past, nodes and cysts could last for weeks.  Now, some of them are diminishing in a week to 10 days - not perfect, but better.  If you have severe acne, see a dermatologist.  Over the counter treatments alone aren&#x27;t enough.  I&#x27;d recommend giving this a try in addition to your regular treatment.  I feel improved self-esteem is worth $80.</li>
            <li> I will give Zeno this...when it actually works, it seems to be effective.  My problem with Zeno has been  that the device is completely unreliable, and I have encountered the exact same problem not once, twice, but three times, so I am finished with Zeno.  The device seems to work for various periods of time (my last one less than two weeks, so I am shipping it back), and then just stops working.  The device is fully charged, but flashes and makes a noise, then shuts off.  This has been the exact same problem for every single Zeno device I have owned, but the last one was by far the biggest joke, since the others lasted a few months.  I had a replacement tip, so the issue wasn&#x27;t the tip needing replacing- it&#x27;s the device, it&#x27;s truly a hunk of junk.  My personal opinion is that the makers of Zeno are greedy and cunning since they benefit by consumers having to purchase another expensive device, and they charge sky high prices for the replacement tips.  I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s a  coincidence when the same thing happens three times.  Never again, Zeno.</li>
            <li> This works, but the fact that you have to buy expensive cartridges, after spending $250 on an item is total BS. What a greedy bunch of people they are. I would never have bought this in the first place had I known I would have to invest so much money in it every month. Maybe if you had 1 or 2 pimples per week this would be OK for you, but I don&#x27;t and to have to continue to pay them is an enormous rip-off. Someone should sue them for their enormous greed.</li>
            <li> Finally went to use the product when I had a breakout and it didn&#x27;t work.  It wouldn&#x27;t even charge when I plugged it in.  Unfortunately I attempted to use it for the first time after the 30 day return window.  If you do take a chance on this product from this seller, I would recommend using it immediately to see if it even works!!!  Or else you might be in the same boat as me...a couple hundred dollars down the drain...</li>
            <li> Bought this hoping it would work on occasional cystic ance but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  I never noticed any benefits or reduced healing time.  I ended up throwing it away just like the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li> Nowadays people are more cost-consious than ever when it comes down to buying something that&#x27;s worth every penny. Simply put, this is a device that people should be confident in investing in. The Zeno is a great device for ONLY those who have acne consisting of cysts that: take forever to rise to the surface of the skin, are painful, are embarrasing, and take forever to perish from the skin. After a double-cycle treatment on a cyst that is just beginning under the skin, the pain goes away (yes, that means breaking the rules of the directions which say only one cycle. This works more efficiently, basically). Once done, the majority of the bacteria inside the cyst will die, causing the sequence of the cyst to stagnate and even reverse itself (often slowly, but surely). It also becomes less visually apparent, heals faster, and has a much lesser chance of leaving a scar. Thus, you can actually walk outside your home feeling a bit more confident in your appearance! The only complaint I have is the fact that it&#x27;s time-consuming for the device to start up, but it&#x27;s technology...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get a lot of pimples, and they aren&#x27;t huge, but when I do, this thing makes them go away very quickly. I don&#x27;t know if it would work on acne or cystic type blemishes, but for the every day, average variety pimple, this works better than any other kind of treatment I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work on all kinds of acne and you have to use it at just the right time before the pimple forms in order for it to work. But if you can accept that it&#x27;s not perfect and are ok with the fact that it may not work with some acne, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> While not the miracle fix suggested by the brochure, it does clearly help most of the time in our family. Then again, everybody&#x27;s biology is different. I just wish the cartridges were not so expensive. They&#x27;ve been hanging around HP ink-jet printer marketeers it seems :-)</li>
            <li> I keep a Zeno in my purse at all times for unexpected outbreaks.   The heat absolutely works to kill the bacteria and make the zit go away faster.  I have this one, the Pro, the Hot Spot, and the Heat Treat-- they all work, and this one is probably the best!</li>
            <li> Bought it at a drugstore..my skin is annoying even if i don&#x27;t pop my pimples  i get scars...so i opted to try this out but no luck still gave me scars...so i returned it...it is either a hit or miss and it was a miss for me...good luck</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell if this is a good product, and ordinarily I wouldn&#x27;t write a review if I wasn&#x27;t sure. But I want to offer a caveat...  I have given it the benefit of the doubt with my three stars, but here&#x27;s the problem that I&#x27;ve found:  When you read the instructions, they give you a list of the kind of pimples it DOESN&#x27;T work on.  I am still struggling to figure out what kind are left.  So far I seem to have had one that qualified, and yes, it may have sped things up a bit.  Maybe.....</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it:  It&#x27;s a cool device and a cool concept.  When it worked, I liked using it.      However, the instructions tell you to use it only on certain pimples and in the very early stages, so I couldn&#x27;t use it when my zits had come to a head.  I also had two of the nastiest zits I&#x27;ve ever had on my chin after I used it.  And I had followed the instructions and applied it when the zit was just below the surface and starting to hurt.  The zit would seem to get better, only to come back really huge.    Just after having it a year, the device died, with 20-30 charges left.  And the battery is non-replaceable.  It seems the same thing happened to another reviewer.  I hadn&#x27;t been charging it so that might be why it died.  Even so, the battery life is given as 3-4 years, which means the device will only last you that long.      Here are the pros and cons:    Pros: works sometimes on certain pimples; cool tech device    Cons: can make some pimples worse; battery is non-replaceable; must be diligent and catch pimples in early stages; expensive; expensive replacement charges; takes more than one charge to work    I would recommend that if you are interested in buying this device, to consider trying a good clay mask instead.  Clay masks have been around for centuries and some are all natural. Dab a bit of clay on your pimple overnight, and by morning, it&#x27;s visibly reduced and receding.  You can do this even on those zits that are past the early stages.  And, you can use the clay mask on your whole face to help prevent zits from forming in the first place.        I&#x27;ve used the Proactiv refining mask and am now using the Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay mask (see the links below).  It&#x27;s awesome stuff.    The Zeno will be e-recycled.      [[ASIN:B000ZMBSPE Indian Healing Clay - 2 Lb. - Clay]]  [[ASIN:B00016WSAI Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay - 2 lbs]]    *UPDATE*  Just on a whim, I decided to try to recharge the Zeno again, even though it hadn&#x27;t lit up or turned on when Iconnected the charger before.  Overnight, the blue light indicating battery life came blinking on, so I guess the battery isn&#x27;t dead.  It just takes a while to fully charge (6 hours).  I feel a little better knowing I didn&#x27;t waste too much money. I would give it an extra .5 star for that, but 3 seems too high.</li>
            <li> I left a review on the 90 count device, which is the same device but more uses in the tip.  Zeno works for me, like a charm.  The trick I&#x27;ve noticed, and Zeno advocates, is to catch them when they&#x27;re first starting to arrive - before you can see them, but you feel them.  Be proactive and it&#x27;ll do what it says, I guess for most people.  The other reviewer here points out that it says \\&quot;for most people\\&quot; or \\&quot;for most acne\\&quot;, as if this is a loop hole.  Any device like this, most devices/tools in general don&#x27;t work for everyone.  Some straightening irons damage one persons hair while making another&#x27;s sleek and shiny.  Some hair growth therapies work for some, not for others.  So it&#x27;s a toss up.  My guess is if you have random annoying pimples, but not something you&#x27;d consider and acne problem, and you catch these pimples BEFORE they really develop and show, this device is for you.</li>
            <li> There are several listings for this item in different versions.  Before making a decision, check out the other versions, you will see many different reviews.  Overall, it seems to be as long as you use the product as intended, it works!  You can see my full review under Zeno Pro Pink.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ll admit I was very very skeptical.... but it works.....It really does! I am 33 years old and have moderate acne that is very difficult to treat.  For about the past year or so, I had been using 2.5% Benzoyl peroxide twice a day, every day.  For the first few months, the BP treatments cleared my skin quite dramatically but then I more or less became \\&quot;immune\\&quot; to its effects and lately it hadn&#x27;t been working quite as well, not to mention the fact that I was very weary of rubbing something like that into my skin twice a day for the rest of my life!  Ok, so I was ready to try something new and something that I felt like would be safe with minimal side-effects and that is when I started doing research on what is new out there in acne treatment and I ran across all the rave reviews on the Zeno.  I thought about it for a while and then decided to take the plunge since it has a 30-day money back guarantee (what did I have to lose?) I was fully expecting to be sending it back after two weeks!  Well, to my utter amazement, the thing actually works!  You will notice immediate reduction in swelling of the pimple after the first treatment and then over the next two treatments it will continue to disappear and usually by the next day sometimes two days, it is gone!    And something you might want to know if you haven&#x27;t decided to buy Zeno yet, is when we Zeno owners say that your acne bump disappears by the 2nd day... you guys out there that haven&#x27;t bought it yet are thinking \\&quot;but I don&#x27;t want to walk around for two days with a zit\\&quot;, but what you need to understand is that it is not like having a regular acne lesion/bump because you started treating it while it was still just that tender lump under your skin, so by the next day you only have a mildly tender almost non-existent lump under your skin, not some half-erupted red zit for everyone to see!  Think about that for a nice change!</li>
            <li> This thing replicates the wand that some aestheticians use in their salons. It zaps the pimple. I don&#x27;t know how it does this exactly, but you can feel it working.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It definitely does keep some pimples from becoming major ones and I think it does stop just-forming pimples from actually forming. It doesn&#x27;t make them completely disappear overnight, however and it&#x27;s kind of a pain in the ass to hold that thing to your face for two and a half minutes if you have more than one or two red little friends hanging out.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s too expensive, but I also need to spend more time with it probably. I haven&#x27;t really had to use it lately though since I got a microdermabrasion spin brush.</li>
            <li> Got a package few days ago, and the crumpled box  that was labeled as \\&quot;CLEARANCE\\&quot; with yellow color. In the package, there was NO rechargeable battery, and NO 60-count treatment tip, but only an empty box.  Worse than that, the device itself cannot be charged.  How can they sell this kind of product?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been eyeing this product at Walgreen&#x27;s for months but didn&#x27;t purchase it because...well...it seemed too good to be true. And the price - yikes! But about a week ago, after feeling the telltale signs of two more developing blemishes, I decided to take the plunge. (I am appearing in a play that opens in three weeks and just couldn&#x27;t face the thought of zits that might last that long - or additional ones.) I immediately went home and treated the spots. How did they diminish right away?! I almost wept with joy.    Yeah, the thing&#x27;s expensive. BUT...when I figure I spent $100 last summer to have a doctor lance a single blemish that had already been there three weeks (and ended up looking hideous for another two), it&#x27;s worth it. Also, if you have a flexible medical account...or itemize on your taxes...Zeno is DEDUCTIBLE. (That was a very happy surprise.) And, of course, there&#x27;s the immeasurable psychological benefit of not walking around looking like an adolescent when you&#x27;re 47.</li>
            <li> I bought zeno out of that strange mix of despiration and optimism that plauges the acne-prone.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of over the counter products, prescriptions from my dermatologist, and home remedies.  Zeno was no better than any other treatment.  It helped a little, but nowhere near enough to justify the price.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I was lucky to have been listening to the radio when I heard a Zeno commercial. I say lucky because I have never heard or seen a commercial for this product before or since. I am not sure how the company is getting the word out. From what I gather the product has been on the market for over two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, Zeno works just as advertised. As soon as I feel the signs of a pimple forming, I heat up the area with my Zeno. In about two to three treatments, the pimple disappears. It feels so good when applying heat to a pimple knowing that you are destroying it, it is just sweet.</li>
            <li> iam glad this product worked for some people!&lt;br /&gt;no one likes acne but, the truth is their is ther is no miracle cure!&lt;br /&gt;my son tried it three times w/little or no results then the 60 count tip indicator lights came on telling us the tip needed to be replaced! 60 applications?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;acne is a fact of life for many teenagers as a result of hormone changes taking place in their bodies as they become adults.  as for adult acne i believe a lot of acne problems are a result of stress. try to lower your stress level &amp; seek out the advise of a dermatologist &amp; maybe try a stress mgt. course.</li>
            <li> The device helped reduce some of my acne, but didn&#x27;t always help.  My biggest complaint is that I used it 40 or 50 times total, and it stopped working.  I purchased a new tip but it didn&#x27;t make any difference.  Given the price and it&#x27;s success rate, it came out to about $5 a blemish.  Ouch.</li>
            <li> I use Murad which has cleared up my skin but I still get the occasional cystic acne bump,that&#x27;s lg.&amp; hurts &amp; nothing helps but the hot wash cloth.Well the Zeno beats that by a mile &amp; actually gets rid of the thing.Plus it&#x27;s so much more convenient than running back &amp; forth heating up a wash cloth that never makes it disappear anyway.I&#x27;m so glad I got this product.</li>
            <li> I bought my Zeno back in October of 2007, so just a few months over one year ago.  It worked like a charm, but I used up the 60 uses a few weeks back so today I went out and bought my first not-cheap replaceable cartridge, only to get it home and find that the non-replaceable battery inside the zeno will no longer charge.  According to the owners manual the non-replaceable battery should last 3-4 years with normal use.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.  The gadget worked when it was working...but yeah, SOOOO disappointed that my only options now are to do without or buy a whole new device.  Frustrating to say the least.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter was very excited to receive the Zeno for Christmas.  She used it several times on her very minor blemishes and asked me to return it because she said it didn&#x27;t work. We were hoping it was be a \\&quot;miracle cure\\&quot; but it was not.  I suppose there is no real cure for acne after all.</li>
            <li> Product did not work, out of the box. Nice idea, nice advertising, good delivery, but it did not function beyond the initial use.</li>
            <li> My new Zeno didn&#x27;t work from the start. There is no recourse, waited too long to return (GIFT).  Tried to contact the company through the phone number they advertise and all I get is a busy signal....all day....every day!!! No way to email either, on their website they ask you for your email DON&#x27;T DO IT....the only purpose for this so called website is to get your email nothing more. I usually do not post reviews but when I come across a BAD product with no support, I feel obligated to let everyone know. Feel sorry for the retailers.</li>
            <li> This is a very useful adjunct to acne therapy.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it over the last month in conjunction with Clearzine and have good results with fewer zits.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s basically a recharable battery and a heating element.  Yes, it is expensive.  [..].    I really wanted to rip on this thing and call it junk, but I have to admit IT WORKED.  I&#x27;ve tried it about 5 times and it&#x27;s helped tremendously.  On a couple of occasions, it actually did work overnight!  Amazing.    So I&#x27;ll gladly put up with the price tag because ultimately my social life is worth it.  Plus, it&#x27;s cheaper than going to the dermotologist (who in my experience, really can&#x27;t do a damn thing.)  For people who have tried all the other lotions and pills and gimmicks, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my teenage daughter who does not have terrible acne, but does get a pimple here &amp; there. The pimples make her self-conscious. She tried Proactiv but it was too strong &amp; although it dried out the pimples, it also made her skin burn. So far the Zeno has been great. She only needs to use it on pimples when she has them. Not every day. When she does use it the pimples dissappear overnight &amp; her skin doesn&#x27;t get overdried &amp; sensitive.</li>
            <li> With 3 daughters and one son who have survived the teenage years.... this product is wonderful.  it really gives them self confidence when they need it</li>
            <li> This really did not do anythign for my pimples. My pimples just stayed the same. Also this item so TOOO expensive for it not to work.</li>
            <li> At first I was a skeptic, I have a 12 yr old going thru the \\&quot;awkward\\&quot; stage, I could not believe it when I saw the results that she was having even after the first use. She has very fair skin and red hair and breaks out easily. Using the Zeno machine is done at bedtime right along with brushing her teeth and her skin once again looks like peaches and cream! No adverse affects. I even got one for myself so now we have two in the house - one for her and one for my purse. Don&#x27;t leave home without it!!!</li>
            <li> When it comes to treating and managing acne, I have tried most everything, usually being disappointed.  This is the first product I have used that really works.  I took a risk, as the product is not inexpensive, but I am more than satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I think it can work only for small pimple but not the big ones.  If you have plenty of pimple, you used up the tip so fast.  It takes alot of time to zap the pimple.  This product might only be good for a 2 or 3 pimple.  It takes too much time waiting and zapping your pimple.</li>
            <li> I am a 39 year old mom of 2 that has never had a acne problem in my life.  I spend my days with my hair in a pony tail with a visor or hat on.  I play a lot of tennis or go to the gym during the week.  On the weekends I am again in a pony tail and hat watching my  kids sporting activites.  I began having a problem with pimples showing up on my forehead and on the sides of my nose from sweating and wearing hats or visors and sunglasses. They are red under the skin pimples that do not always get a head on them and can last for a week or more and they can be painful.  I have tried acne spot treatment products and using clarifying lotions, but they did not help reduce the number of outbreaks or the size and duration of the pimples.  I have been wanting to try the Zeno and finally got one last month when I had 3 monster zits on my face.  I came home and read the instructions and knew that treating the existing pimples I had was probably not going to help them.  The Zeno is reccommended for new pimples so that they can be treated at the first sign to stop them from getting any bigger.  Well, I was so excited about my new toy that I thought \\&quot;what the heck\\&quot;, it can&#x27;t make these huge zits any bigger so I went ahead and treated them.  When I put the Zeno on the biggest one, it felt as if it was melting it away.  I waited the 2 minutes and removed the Zeno and the big red bump on my face was now a small red flat spot.  I did the same with the other 2 and had the same result.  They no longer had a hard spot under them and were flat.  I treated them again the following day 2 more times and by the next day the flat skin had dried up and I just flaked it off.  I was so excited that I brought my Zeno and some alochol swabs with me to my tennis lunch and I was zapping my friends.  It was quite funny, but they loved it and some have gone out to purchase one.  I was actually hoping for another pimple to come up becuase they usuall re occur in the same spots every couple of weeks.  Tomy great surprise I have not had another one in the same spot.  I did have 2 new ones come up this week, but I treated both of them twice and one went away completely and the other formed a white head on it, which I think the heat from the Zeno created, so I squeezed it and it was gone the next day.  I love this product and would reccomment it to anyone with small recurrent break out areas.  The Zeno feels warm when it touches your skin.  On some more sevsitive pimples it can feel hot for the initial contact and then you cannot feel the heat at all.  It is easy to use and defenitely worth the money.  You can get rid of your topical spot treatments or use in addition to the Zeno.  I actually get excited looking for pimples now so that I can use the Zeno to stop them in their tracks.  I was also told by a friend of mine that gets terrible cold sores that she has been using the Zeno for a year on them and it has changed her life.  When she feels the initial tingle of a cold sore, she treats the area two times initially and then a couple more times during the day and it completely stops her cold sores from getting bigger.  Cant beat that!</li>
            <li> Having had perfectly clear skin through my teens, 20s, and most of my 30s, I now have post-pregnancy adult-onset cystic acne that began at age 36. My skin is far too delicate and sensitive to tolerate most OTC acne products. I bought this product out of desperation, not believing it would work. After reading hundreds of reviews and advice and testing it for 2 weeks, I have found that it works well, with some modifications. My experience: cystic acne goes through its normal cycle (rising to surface, becoming a hideous scab, etc.) in a fraction of the normal time (4 days versus 4 weeks) when treated as directed with Zeno, OR it disappears completely without ever having risen to the surface (after a week or so), when treated very aggressively with Zeno. My advice: Don&#x27;t expect it to work after 1-3 treatments and in 24 hours as advertised. Do know that with diligence and patience, it will work. Be very aggressive. Do double-cycles (allow the Zeno to remain on your skin after it beeps, then press the button for a second cycle) every few hours as long as the bump is detectable in any way. You may get very slight burning of your skin (causing a whitish film or slight peeling) and you may go through your cartridge tips quickly, but believe me, it&#x27;s worth it to avoid the horrible months-long process of cystic acne. I am using this in conjunction with a very thorough natural skincare regime and improved nutrition, and seeing the results I have hoped for after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The cool thing about the Zeno is that it feels like you&#x27;re shooting a laser at your face.  Like if you worked on an alien spaceship and you had a laser pistol that you kept in case of Borellian attacks, and you just started shooting yourself in the face with it.  Like for no reason at all.  But everyone&#x27;s all impressed by the fact that you never have any pimples, even when you&#x27;re in the muggy heat of the North Q&#x27;uinos atmosphere.  The only problem is that when the Borellians do attack (and they always attack) your laser cartridges are almost empty cause you&#x27;ve been zapping your face so much, so you&#x27;re forced to either hide behind a Space Rock or engage in some hand-to-hand combat, and as we all know about the Borellians, they have GIANT hands.     Four Borellian Stars.</li>
            <li> It simply would not work! I charged it and it still would not power up.  I had to return it and I am still waiting on my refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Zeno for a couple weeks now.  It does not completely eliminate a pimple, even if applied at the first sign of one coming up.  What is has done for me is bring the blemish up more quickly, decrease the time I have to deal with the embarrassment, and it keeps the problem from spreading to other pores nearby.  That has made it worth the money for me.      No it&#x27;s not a miracle cure and pimples won&#x27;t disappear overnight.  And you still have to deal with getting the head out of the pore.  It&#x27;s not substitute it for cleansing religiously.  And it says in the literature it isn&#x27;t for cystic acne.  But if you get frequent non-cystic outbreaks like I do, no matter how well you cleanse, it is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in stores a while back because I read nothing but absolute rave reviews in magazines, online, etc. I had high expectations and I was pretty disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always very diligent when it comes to acne regimens and treatments so, like the instructions told me to, I used it at the first sign of a new pimple. All it really did for me was bring most of my pimples to head, which of course led to me messing with them. From everything I heard about the Zeno, I expected it to keep them at bay and SHRINK them. Totally not worth it for me. Luckily, I was able to sell it for close to what I originally paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the heat, it&#x27;s not painful but it definitely takes getting used to. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for someone with skin that&#x27;s even slightly sensitive -- you probably won&#x27;t have a very pleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Zeno didn&#x27;t work for me. Some might argue that a device that can bring a nasty pimple to a head and the end of its life quicker than it would on its own is better than nothing. I don&#x27;t necessarily disagree with that but, in this case, Zeno definitely does not live up to the big promises it makes. Give it a try, though. I seem to be an anomaly and I believe there&#x27;s a money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> Thank God for a money back guarantee! I&#x27;ve had moderate acne for the past several years and decided to try this after seeing ads and good reviews. I followed the manual to the letter on what type of blemishes to use this on and everything but alas, no improvement. It only made lesions larger, more painful, and more red, now with a large ring around them! No improvement on any of my acne after many attempts. Didn&#x27;t work for me and I&#x27;d recommend NOT wasting your time and money.</li>
            <li> This device works!! I am also a mom with all of a sudden adult acne, I have been to 5 different dermatologists, they all give me new medicine but nothing had stopped the breakouts from coming back. At least I don&#x27;t have to walk around with pimples for a month before they go away. This device takes care of them within a few days. I just wish the head would last twice as long.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product but was disappointed to get no result from using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all of the instructions carefully before using the Zeno. I was surprised to learn that whiteheads are not pimples (and therefore, not to be treated with the Zeno).  I treated two pimples (in their early stage as instructed in the user manual) and the Zeno seemed to have no effect on either of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The treatment lasts 2.5 minutes and while not exactly pleasant, is entirely tolerable.  The beep every 30 seconds is helpful as it allows the user to keep track of how much longer the treatment will last.  I have sensitive skin but experienced only slight redness which didn&#x27;t last longer than a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged the unit once and it kept the charge for more than two weeks of usage (at which time I returned it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly advise anyone who purchases a Zeno to begin using it as soon as it arrives.  Amazon will honor the manufacturer&#x27;s 30 day satisfaction guarantee so you will want to know if it works or not before the deadline to return it.  Although Amazon customer service indicated I would have to pay for return shipping, I received a full refund (and was not charged for shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I couldn&#x27;t determine the difference between the [[ASIN:B000JQY2LI Zeno Pro Acne Clearing Device with 90 Count Cartridge, Teal]], [[ASIN:B000JGERAO Zeno Acne Clearing Device with 60-Count Cartridge]], and [[ASIN:B001AXDAIA Zeno Mini Acne Clearing Device Black 45 Treatment Cycles]] on Amazon or on the Zeno website so I called the manufacturer directly.  I was told that the difference between the first two is the number of uses (90 versus 60).  They both use a wall charger (rather than disposal batteries).  The mini uses two AAA batteries and has a 45 count cartridge.</li>
            <li> This seems like it could be a good product but I have cystic acne and you cannot use this device for it. And since the manufacture sent the receipt with a disclaimer that this item cannot be returned unless faulty I guess that I am stuck with a $180 useless device. Not really satisfied about that.  In the product details it really should list the type of acne it can not be used for like it does in the device manual.</li>
            <li> It takes too long. You have to hold this device for awhile and your hand would started to get tried and it would slip away from the pimple you originally wanted to target. You have to keep an eye on a mirror all the time to see if it&#x27;s still on the same spot or not. It&#x27;s quite time consuming.</li>
            <li> This product has worked for me, although it hasn&#x27;t been 100% effective. I get one or two blemishes a month. For blemishes I can feel below the surface before I can see them, this product has cleared them completely - they never surface. For blemishes that appear before I can feel them (I suppose that means I don&#x27;t get to them quickly enough), using Zeno has not stopped them from forming, but it has caused them to be smaller than they otherwise would be. I always use the product 3 times on a blemish, and I have found that the most effective treatments have been when I have been able to use Zeno every four hours during the course of a day. Waiting overnight to use it a second time has been much less effective (although it&#x27;s sometimes unavoidable). Overall, this isn&#x27;t a perfect solution, but it has helped!</li>
            <li> I really love my Zeno and wanted everyone to know how wonderful it is.  I have had my Zeno awhile, and it has always worked great with my adult acne-- especially the large bumps you get under your skin just before a big social event. It is so easy to use, and I always take it with me when I travel.  It is very small and always takes care of the acne that pops up when I travel to a different climate.  I have also used the replacement heads because I use it so often.  They work just as well as the original heads.  I am so pleased with my Zeno that I am ready to purchase another one for my 15 year old son as he has started to struggle with teenage acne. I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> A+ product that performs well on pimples.  I&#x27;ve been using mine for almost a year +.  My Zeno turned off once within the first 30 seconds, so I charged it for 24 hours and it was back in business.  Now I charge it once a week overnight.  Basic common sense that you would use with your cell phone applies.</li>
            <li> After returning the Zeno I relised my outlet I was trying to charge it on was broken. I was told it worked fine.</li>
            <li> Works great while it works, but after 2 years of very limited use, it crapped out.  Considering its exhorbitant price, this is not a good choice.  Somebody needs to take this electric pimple heating idea and execute it better.</li>
            <li> Used this for over three weeks on cystic adult acne with NO - absolutely NO - improvement - got my money back, of course -   Buy the ANSR Beam instead - that is a product that works!</li>
            <li> I bought this from Target in hopes it would help with my hormonal acne and it didn&#x27;t help me at all.  Thankfully, I was able to return it and get all my money back.</li>
            <li> This product did seem to have some effect.  (I have the original version.)&lt;br /&gt;However two boxes of \\&quot;60 treatment cycle\\&quot; replacement cartridges only gave me 5-6 uses each.  (The original cartridge worked as described.)&lt;br /&gt;They have no web site that I can find, other than one that just invites email spam.&lt;br /&gt;Either these replacement cartridges where knockoff&#x27;s or this is an enterprise that borders on criminal.  Would avoid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne where a cyst will pop up once every few months so I researched Zeno and bought one because studies show that heat actually does help acne. I am not a doctor, but I am an engineer and I can tell you that the disposable tips on zeno are a complete ripoff designed so that people have to keep spending money. Think about it--how many other things with heaters &amp; thermostats do you have to throw away after a certain number of uses. Toasters, curling irons, furnaces...the list goes on. Sure, things will break down over time but Zeno doesn&#x27;t get terribly hot and the heating/thermostat components have an actual life of thousands of cycles except that in Zeno they&#x27;re artifically \\&quot;killed\\&quot; with the microchip in the head.    Here&#x27;s my Zeno substitute which I have found works even better than Zeno itself. Get the following (Home Depot or Amazon has all this stuff):  1. Credenza lamp dimmer ($12)  2. 10 Watt \\&quot;candelabra base\\&quot; incandescent light bulb ($2)  3. Night light with replaceable bulb ($2)  4. Extension cord ($5)    Connect it all together (putting the 10Wlight bulb in the nightlight base) and start with the light at the lowest dimmer setting. Place the bulb on the zit and SLOWLY increase the dimmer until very warm. If it gets too hot, then back off a little bit.     I have found this works great because it stays hot for as long as I want to treat the zit, and there&#x27;s no waiting in between times if I have a second area that needs treatment. The best thing is that the only thing needing replacment are the cheap bulbs and they last a very long time because they&#x27;re not running at full voltage.    If you use this, just be careful because 10 Watts isn&#x27;t much but it can burn sensitive areas if you&#x27;re not careful. Everyone is responsible for their own actions.  :)</li>
            <li> I had a Zeno from a couple of years back that I recently gave to a much younger acquaintance who needed it more than I did.  I thought I would just pick up a new one for the occasional pimple.  I have now ordered two of them.  Apparently they are selling old ones - so old that the rechargeable battery is dead and will no longer charge.  I was given credit for the first one and am hoping that I will be given credit for the one that just arrived today.  It&#x27;s been plugged in for hours with absolutely no sign of life.  While I was happy with the one I had that worked and would rate it higher, I&#x27;m not going to try a third time.</li>
            <li> Completely defective product. DO NOT BUY!!! The product didn&#x27;t charge once plugged into the wall. Complete waste of money. Very upset.</li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive about spending this much money on an acne \\&quot;device\\&quot;, but I was desperate.. I had a big date in two days and I was starting to develop two large cystic zits right on my forehead.  I was completely floored by the device, my zits were gone by the day of my date.  The Zeno works as described by the other reviews, I used it about every 4 hours.  I found that it was most effective in immediately reducing the swelling.  I dont usually write reviews, but the Zeno definetly worked for me and I will recommend it to my friends.  I started out with the 60 count cartridge, but refills are only $25, about the same as a bottle of Proactiv Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I use Zeno whenever I feel the occasional pimple coming on. As long as you catch it in the first couple of days, Zeno works perfectly. It leaves a red mark for 30 minutes or so, but one or two zaps the night before and the next morning is more than enough to stop the pimple from forming. It gets hot, but I don&#x27;t find it painful at all.</li>
            <li> As mentioned in other posts, this product works[..] I only used it at night or when I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be seeing anyone that day. [..]  Don&#x27;t get Zeno happy your first day of getting it (you have to let it charge for like 4 or 6 hours) and don&#x27;t decide to target all your pimples in one day, because the next day you might have a bunch of white heads instead of easy to cover (with makeup) pimples.  Do a few at a time, don&#x27;t rush into it.  This is a great product, but not a miracle cure! (It doesn&#x27;t zap your zits away)  Don&#x27;t touch your face (skin), don&#x27;t pick at your pimples, and do NOT pop your white heads!!!!</li>
            <li> Since the time that I have had and used this device, I haven&#x27;t had success on any problem area that was treated.  As a matter of fact the pimple got just as big or bigger.  I appled the Zeno treatment at 1st sign of a problem.   I, also continued my cleansing regime that I had been doing.  I just chalk it up as another product (of the countless products that I have tried) that just doesn&#x27;t work.    Thank You  Robert C Hunt</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my neice. I returned it.</li>
            <li> I used this for about 3 weeks and it made no difference.  I followed the instructions the first few times, and when that didn&#x27;t work, I tried using it more frequently than instructed.  Still saw no difference.  I&#x27;m still giving it 3 stars though, because you can return it if it doesn&#x27;t work in the first month, so I didn&#x27;t end up wasting all that money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughters.  It works pretty well for them.  However, I object to the costly replacement tips.  I emailed Zeno asking them to explain the wearout mechanism in the tip.  No response.  I believe there is no wearout mechanism, and it&#x27;s a ripoff to be forced to buy replacement tips.  Until they justify the need for replacement tips, or eliminate the counter in the tip that causes it to stop working after a certain number of uses, I cannot recommend this device to anyone.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Zeno. It really works and penetrates deep into the pore to zap bacteria away. This is an amazing product, it makes a great gift for anyone!</li>
            <li> bellagio import should be ashamed for selling old stock that doesn&#x27;t even turn on.  i charged it for 6 hr and nothing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product via Amazon and it came completely sealed/unopened.  When I tried to charge it for the first time, it never took a charge, despite trying several times and even for more than the amount of time recommended. No sign of life whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller who was very responsive, but suggested I try to rectify things with Zeno customer service first. No problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, over the \\&quot;30-day guarantee\\&quot; period, I sent TWO e-mails to Zeno&#x27;s \\&quot;Contact Us\\&quot; address and never got a response.  I then left THREE messages on their \\&quot;Service\\&quot; hotline.  NO human response and never a call back over that entire time.  INFURIATING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, the seller agreed to return the item but I am appalled that the manufacturers of such an expensive product clearly DO NOT back it...and the automated voice message that starts with \\&quot;Your call is very important to us\\&quot; is lip service. I feel for the seller, because clearly he/she got the shaft, too, as a vendor for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if considering buying this, don&#x27;t let the \\&quot;30 day satisfaction guarantee\\&quot; be a factor in your decision -- it is completely WORTHLESS when service is nonexistent. I can&#x27;t comment on whether it works, however I can certainly caution (without hesitation) about my experience and about the supposed guarantee:  Buyer Beware.</li>
            <li> the device did not work from the beginning and after filling a complaint still i am not able to return the item.</li>
            <li> I have this Zeno and it&#x27;s money wasted. Of course heat will kill a pimple, so it works, but the Zeno is very difficult to use. One fault is the hot spot is located towards one side of the device, so that cap was always popping off when I held it against a pimple. I also hated all the loud beeping noises it made, and you have to stand in front of the mirror for 3 minutes at a time holding this clumsy object up to your face. Try doing that in a public bathroom, you look like an idiot. And after a year of having this, it simply stopped working, and that really makes me angry since I spent so much money on it. The cartridge still contained at least 50% more uses... and the device doesn&#x27;t charge! I hate this thing and I wish I never bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out a better method to \\&quot;heat\\&quot; the pimple to kill the germs inside. If you&#x27;ve never used a Zeno, you should know the tip is very hot. It&#x27;s the hottest possible temperature you can stand without burning your skin. What I&#x27;ve done instead, and this has worked extremely well: Put about a cup of uncooked rice into a zip-lock bag. Push out all the air and seal the bag. Put the bag in the microwave for not more than 20 seconds. Take it out of the microwave and shake up the bag so the heat gets distributed evenly. Wrap a towel or even a paper towel around it and test it against your face. If it feels very hot but tolerable, you can hold it on your pimple for 3 minutes. There, all done. Cheap way of doing the exact same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I never bought this product when you can do it yourself for just a few pennies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over two weeks and yes it really has done a good job with quickly clearing up my acne!  I was certainly skeptical when I bought this product, but it has mostly worked as advertised.  I usually get a few pimples at a time on my face and regular usage of this device has cleared them up much faster than they would normally clear up on their own.  Usually within 1 day the pimple subsides and is gone within a couple of days.  It beats having a pimple on your face for weeks before it fully heals.  It works best on new pimples.  Although, I&#x27;m not thrilled about the idea of buying replacement cartridges, the cost is similar to a Pro-Active type product, and it works without drying out my entire face.</li>
            <li> After doing my research I decided to splurge on the Zeno.  After trying so many products like proactive etc. I was willing to spend anything if it worked!  Going into this I knew that the zeno doesn&#x27;t work on white heads or black heads but thats fine because it worked (supposedly) on the exact kind of acne I have (key word have not had).  After trying it numorous times and multiple times on the same pimple all I got was a nice warm feeling and nothing more.  It did not shrink my pimple and it did not make them hurt less.  And on top of that the tip did not last 60 treatments so I didn&#x27;t think it was worth it and returned it.  Not recommended.</li>
            <li> When I started using Zeno it worked great.  After the first time I charged it something happened and the alarm signal did not go off in time.  I was burned very badly on my face.  It blistered and is scarred.  I would definately be careful.</li>
            <li> I think I must be the only person that the zeno doesn&#x27;t work on. I gave it a good shot and used it on upcoming pimples for a week. Nothing happened. I have large under the skin pimples, so maybe it&#x27;s not for my type of acne. I used it about 20 times and that means that I spent 50 minutes of my life holding it up to my face in the hope of my acne clearing. It didn&#x27;t make it worse, but it didn&#x27;t speed up the process as far as I could tell. I&#x27;m not pleased.</li>
            <li> Wow I can&#x27;t believe how great Zeno works!  When I feel a slight sore red bump coming up under the skin and painful to the touch, I grab my Zeno because after two times using it, the red bump all but disappears.  This means no more eruptions which means no scarring.  This thing is amazing.  You must catch the zit early for it to fully work after two to three treatments.  I&#x27;ve done this now at least 45-50 times because I just bought my first tip replacement.  I&#x27;ve never seen anything work so great for me.  Of course this is used in addition to good daily hygiene of washing and cleaning my face twice a day.</li>
            <li> My daughter suffers from moderate to severe acne so after reading all of the positive reviews of the Zeno we decided to give it a try. It did....NOTHING. At a cost of over $1.00 per zit treated (not counting the initial cost of the unit) this is the biggest rip-off I&#x27;ve ever fallen for.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help me at all. I have used it down to the last light and so far it has only helped prevent one pimple. Not sure if I have the wrong kind of acne for it or what. I found out after purchasing that I have hormonal acne. I usually get 3-4 new pimples every week that take about 3 days cycle to go away. Instead of heat, I have found what works better for me and my mild acne is to ice my pimples. I apply ice right when I see one forming for at least 5 mins and it prevents it from forming (I figured this out by accident). On a 2 day old pimple that&#x27;s red and painful, if I ice it for about 10 mins, I find that it brings it to the surface the next day. The sooner I ice it, the better the chance of prevention.</li>
            <li> For me this personally worked better when I had those huge deep pimples that you can feel under the surface, hit it once wake up and the next day its incredibly smaller. Doesn&#x27;t work well for cystic acne(which I had) and does a semi okay job at those stubborn surface pimples.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about this product, despite the mostly positive reviews.  Everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently, and I was afraid I would be someone who would not get results from the Zeno.  Happily, I was wrong!      I&#x27;ve suffered (suffered!!) from adult acne throughout my mid-twenties, with no real help from salicylic/benzoyl treatments or antibiotics.  Worse, my super sensitive skin would transform blemishes into dark red scars no matter what I did, and the scars would last at least a year-- total nightmare.  I used the Zeno on my new spots as soon as I noticed them forming, and while they didn&#x27;t disappear overnight, they did stay small and disappear in about 3 days.  Did you hear that?  DISAPPEAR.  NO RED SCAR.  Hallelujah.  Normally, my spots would take at least a week or two to go down, and then as I said, they would remain in scar form.  In fact, I STILL have a number of blemishes from before I bought the Zeno over two weeks ago, while the new ones that I treated are long gone, leaving no traces behind.  That evidence is all I need to say that this WORKS for me.    I should note that I&#x27;m using a retin-a treatment at night (for my existing scars), which I think is not recommended in combination with Zeno, since retin-a thins the top layer of your skin.  However, I have not experienced any damage/pain, so it&#x27;s working fine for me.  The only instance where I had trouble was when I used the Zeno near my mouth, which the booklet tells you not to do since skin there and around the eyes is more delicate.  In that case, I didn&#x27;t feel any real discomfort and didn&#x27;t notice anything was wrong until later, looking in the mirror, I could see a small outline in the shape of the tip.  Apparently, I had burned myself there slightly-- my fault for not following the instructions.  For what it&#x27;s worth, the (painless) burn faded more quickly and completely than the zit would have, so I would probably do it again if I had to.    Really, try it for yourself.  If you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it, return it within 30 days.  I wish I&#x27;d heard about Zeno years ago.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed by my new Zeno! I hate spending money on gadgets (took me forever to splurge on an ipod!) but finally took the plunge and selfishly purchased a Zeno a few weeks ago. I have been battling the adult on-set blemishes for a few years (I thought pimples were for teens--darn it!) and nothing has worked (tried every premium acne treatment out there). Now when I start to get that \\&quot;feeling\\&quot; of a pimple emerging I grab my Zeno. Nearly ALL my pimples I have treated (early) with Zeno have never ever surfaced--now that is a huge \\&quot;wow\\&quot; factor in my book. My complexion is so clear (FINALLY)! Thank you Zeno...I am going to check out the Mini soon to keep in my car.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work as well as the all over Zeno device, the spot treatment only works for very small pimples, if you have something large, this will make it worse.  It&#x27;s expensive and need to be replaced quickly, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> If your face is covered in acne, this is not the product for you.  This is for the occasional zit here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every one in awhile I&#x27;ll notice a deep bump starting to form and I&#x27;ll treat it about 2 times in the morning and then a 2 times before bed.  If you catch it early, you can usually keep it from ever forming.  Sometimes those deep bumps (cystic acne) can stick around for 2-3 weeks and then leave a bad scar.  Usually with the Zeno (if you catch it early) it only last 2-3 days without leaving a scar.  I say \\&quot;usually\\&quot; because it&#x27;s not some magical miracle product that makes ALL of your pimples disappear David Copperfield style.  I&#x27;d say it helps shorten the lifespan of about 80% of your zits, but only if you catch them early and they haven&#x27;t already surfaced.  Every once in a while it will actually help the zit be gone in about 12 hours (overnight), which is pretty impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a better option than tearing up your face with a needle or your fingers. Because even the strongest of topical products like Tretinoin Retin-A (which I have) aren&#x27;t going to make the slightest difference with cystic acne.</li>
            <li> Zeno is no longer selling/supporting this product, so there are NO replacement tips available, other than at a several hundred percent markup here on Amazon!  Do not buy this product!!!</li>
