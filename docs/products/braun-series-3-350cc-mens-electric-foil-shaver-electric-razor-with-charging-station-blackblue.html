            <li>Excellent shave.</li>
            <li>Excellent price.</li>
            <li>The automatic cleaning system is not something I&#x27;ve used before, but it is a wonderful feature.</li>
            <li>Braun makes an excellent product that always seems to work well.</li>
            <li>Charger lights indicate the charge of the razor, and battery life is awesome.</li>
            <li>However, I find that a pre-shave works the best for me.</li>
            <li>best electric that i have tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I give this unit an excellent rating.</li>
            <li>If you are not getting an excellent shave with it, read the instructions.</li>

            <li>The self cleaning system is also great.</li>
            <li>This shaver is a great buy.</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>Great shaver for the price.  </li>

            <li>The cleaning system is a BONUS and the shaver always smells great and is sanitary.  </li>
            <li>Great shave every time.  </li>
            <li>This is a great shaver.  </li>
            <li>Great buy for your money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy that I bought mine.</li>
            <li>The build quality is still excellent and they shave better than ever.</li>
            <li>Looks good but feels spongy on the skin; cannot compare to shavers in series 7000 and 8000.</li>
            <li>This shaver has a lot of good feathers.</li>
            <li>No burning, no irritation, and a shave that&#x27;s 95% as good as using a blade and cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought an additional shaver as a gift and they loved it as well.</li>
            <li>Braun has made a good shaver in the 350CC</li>
            <li>Not as good as my trusty razor but still does a good job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelco and Remington but Braun is superior for a close shave without burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have a $15 travel Braun that&#x27;s superior to $75</li>
            <li>good to use...</li>
            <li>They either didn&#x27;t do a good job or hurt my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I need to have a good shave every day.</li>
            <li>The cleaning liquid is good for 30 or so cleans or until it dries out, but to charge the shaver in the doc you have to lock it in, at which point it automatically cleans.</li>
            <li>Some were good, others not so much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and frankly it did not do a good job.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and works great!!</li>
            <li>The Braun Shaver is innovative and a great item.  </li>
            <li>He is very satisfied.</li>
            <li>The comfort is very good while shaving and the docking station that is included is really cool.</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t shave more than once a week!</li>
            <li>Then brush the top of the shaver—done!  </li>
            <li>is taken care of by the 10-seconds of tapping and whisking…  and I am not too sure what the ‘Automatic Lubrication’ feature is...or what it does!</li>
            <li>A better choice for my neck beard would probably have been the series 7 shaver, however, I did not feel like paying almost $200 for the series 7!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It comes with a fancy cleaning machine that works great, but you can easily wash under running water or with the brush too.</li>
            <li>in all, this is an amazing shaver for the price</li>
            <li>And the price was more than fair</li>
            <li>Nice shaver for the money,</li>
            <li>whether its being used or not, as it stated it can evaporate on its own.</li>
            <li>The shaver is compact and fits nicely in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>We have been trying to figure out which kind to buy for 3 years and kept putting it off.</li>
            <li>the battery kind of crapped out on me in about a year.</li>
            <li>but I know from experience that it will, and it&#x27;s nice to know</li>
            <li>It is a great shaver, but I think Braun’s marketing department sold me on the advantages of the ‘Clean &amp; Renew’ system.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this Braun 350CC-4 and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>Does a wonderful job, holds a charge, and cleans to like new condition.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for about 6 weeks now (3-4 times/week) and have found it to be very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very good razor,produces a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Extremely easy to use, does a good job and the cleaning station couldnt be more convenient.</li>
            <li>the moment this is by far the best deal for a foil shaver with an included cleaning system - almost all the others are priced over the century mark, and I can&#x27;t see how they&#x27;d do anything much better than this shaver.</li>
            <li>At first it didn&#x27;t shave that great</li>
            <li>7000s have many problems but cut well, 8000 is the way to go if you can find one.</li>
            <li>Trimmer function needs to be better made.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m glad i chose this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps I need more time.</li>
            <li>Again, the pre-electric seemed to make the shave better yet.</li>
            <li>It was my favorite shaver until now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving more years than I care to admit and simply put, Braun is the best.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t have asked for more in a shaver.  </li>
            <li>and i love the shave i get with it.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the shaver, this is my 5th or 6th Braun over the years.  </li>
            <li>but I am satisfied with the purchase</li>
            <li>It does not irritate my head even after many passes, this is where it shines in use.</li>
            <li>Also, living in Hawaii I am used to waiting 3 or 4 weeks, or more, for my mail orders to arrive.</li>
            <li>This one does a better job than my others.</li>
            <li>We were giving it as a present for Christmas and our friend is very happy.</li>
            <li>either way I wanted to try another product to see if i can get more life out of</li>
            <li>so many times it took forever to shave with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So hopefully the battery lasts more than a year, Make sure you fill out the philips warranty card in case you have battery issues like I did.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s peace of mind to be able to plug in and shave if needed -</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Have to make many passes before i get a close shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m most happy with my new shaver.</li>
            <li>Build quality is pretty good tho</li>
            <li>Besides, electrics work best against a dry beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes keeping them in tip top shape so easy.</li>
            <li>as the instructions say, it&#x27;s as good as new when it&#x27;s finished!</li>
            <li>it  gives me a good close shave ,better then my old shaver ..</li>
            <li>I have used Braun shavers for 30+ years and wouldn&#x27;t trade it, because they are the best.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning of the model, like the others, is easy, and so is the cleaning method included.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lost edge very quickly.  </li>
            <li>so I was really debating with myself about switching to a foil razor, but I can honestly tell you now I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>This is very inexpenensive, every bit as effective as the Braun cleaner, and safe.</li>
            <li>You can easily pay well over $130 elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and gives a close shave with out drying out your skin.  </li>
            <li>Easy to operate.  </li>
            <li>Is easy on your skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I returned it and bought another new Philips Bodygroom TT2040 which is superior in all ways</li>
            <li>The razor shaves fine</li>
            <li>so this is a huge step up.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband for christmas and he says it works well and creates a smooth shave, I like the built in cleaner.</li>
            <li>I decided to return the shaver before the 60 day free trial expired.</li>
            <li>The shave is fast and painless, deserving of five stars.</li>
            <li>close shave, charges quickly, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>You will feel comfortable after using it.</li>
            <li>The shaver fits comfortably into my hand and glides smoothly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It felt smooth gliding on the face, however it did not leave my face smooth at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one makes my face feel really smooth.</li>
            <li>Old Braun was easy to clean with a brush, this one seems fairly difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Surprised at how good of a shave it provides...</li>
            <li>The shave was never as good (close) as my old trusty Braun.  </li>
            <li>This is a gift for my brother,he say he love it very much,and his friends are all say nice,so,we love it</li>
            <li>The protective cap is nice in that it not only protects the heads, but effectively blocks the on off switch</li>
            <li>Forty plus years of shaving has come full circle and brought me back to this great shaver.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, quick, comfortable.</li>
            <li>It was a simple shaver, but while in the military, it came in very handy and did a great job.</li>
            <li>You put cleaning solution on the bottom (or if you are like the rest of the world and just clean your razor with water, water does</li>
            <li>I would have to take a safety razor and clean up the problem areas.</li>
            <li>The self clean and lube system probably helps.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I travel for weeks at a time, during which i&#x27;ll clean my razor manually.  </li>
            <li>Gives a fairly close shave, not as close as a blade, but better than other electric razors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>so my face generally is pretty easy to clean up and this razor just would not cut</li>
            <li>good razor overall</li>
            <li>I bought this one because my old Braun Activator 8000 Series shaver recently broke after many years of great service.  </li>
            <li>the braun clean and renew cartridges leave the razor smelling lemony fresh each morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It  worked  fine for the first 4 months</li>
            <li>Every morning the shaver is clean (I&#x27;ve opened it up to check), fully charged and smells lemon fresh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After purchasing three blade and foil kits and having them wear out much to quickly, I decided to try a Norelco.  </li>
            <li>I finally spent the money to buy a nice razor and it works so much better.  </li>
            <li>With the older 350cc it looked more like a rounded rectangular brick.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get the older version of this shaver, make sure you get the one with the -4 tacked on.</li>
            <li>Okay, my Braun is brand new, out of the box</li>
            <li>If they are willing to sell the cleaner more reasonably, I&#x27;ll buy it, but I cannot justify the expense as it is now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>The razor is better than most at not \\&quot;grabbing\\&quot; at longer hairs, though I tend to use the pop up trimmer to get rid of long hairs or multi day beard growth.</li>
            <li>Replacement heads are available on line and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The blades on the Series 3 350 lose it after approx 6 months and the shave is of a distinctly unshaved, bristly feel.</li>
            <li>So far I am pleased with the shave closeness and the comfort in using the shaver.  </li>
            <li>For the money I don&#x27;t think its worth it.  </li>
            <li>It does do a good job though, and I will probably try my own cleaning solution that I have used on Braun shavers for years; distilled water, isopropanol, glycerine, Simple Green, with a drop of light machine oil.</li>
            <li>Shaves close, worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>Braun is worth the price.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure this is pretty low end as far as these things go, but it&#x27;s been working great for me so far.</li>
            <li>It is fairly quite, easy to clean and cuts both long and short hairs.  </li>
            <li>and he said this one works just as good as his other one.</li>
            <li>The main thing is that it shaves well and comfortably.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first Braun in the early early 80&#x27;s and loved the fast convenient shave, however, at that time, the foils they were using in the shaver seemed to wear out rather quickly</li>
            <li>This is the best $100 I have spent in a long time!</li>
            <li>This Braun is quieter than the last (which I like) and it charges more quickly.  </li>
            <li>only CON I have, is the blue light on the charger/cleaning stand is too bright at night.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, the newer design works much better too.</li>
            <li>This is one of the two best I&#x27;ve ever used (the other was a 1975 Eltron that is long gone).</li>
            <li>For the performance this shaver provides for different facial hair types and the cordless system, this is definitely a great buy for any guy</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s nice and rubberized in case you have wet hands or something.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You decide yourself on the before or after shower shave and whether you need the pre-electric shave.&lt;br /&gt;P.S., Many years ago, back in the 60&#x27;s, I owned a Braun travel shaver that was battery driven.</li>
            <li>It lasted for many years and it finally died after about 25 years</li>
            <li>/&gt;razor is ready to go every time I pick it up!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them for many years -- I was on my third shaver.  </li>
            <li>The automatic cleaner, charger and lubricator are really neat!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just replacing the foil for the first time at about the two year point.</li>
            <li>There may be fancier units, but I doubt that they can give a better shave, and a shave is the objective.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>My  first Braun shaver \\&quot;Made in Germany\\&quot;  lasted  over 10 years,  </li>
            <li>It get most of my facial hair...</li>
            <li>The shaver is great, but the charging stand is becoming useless.</li>
            <li>The trimmer on the first shaver broke after 18 months of use.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know anyone who shaves that fast!</li>
            <li>, I had to make multiple passes to get rid of the stubble,but it seems to be getting better every day.</li>
            <li>If I could have purchased the Braun separately without the ‘Clean &amp; Renew’ system, I would have, because now I have a big cleaner to store away somewhere when not in use, and costly ‘Clean &amp; Renew’ refills to purchase again and again.  </li>
            <li>It is not quite as powerful as my older Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>Overall, not quite as good as the last one, but if they still made it, it would be a $200+ razor.</li>
            <li>I think if you shave your whole face daily, have fine hair / light growth, a big upper lip, and are okay with buying lots of cleaning fluid, this unit would be fine.  </li>
            <li>The first night my wife closed the bathroom door because it was too bright and lit up the bedroom with a blue glow.  </li>
            <li>My beard grows in so many different directions that a straight razor cuts well, but, even when I have a professional barber give me a hot shave, he does not do as well as the Braun, which was held in my unprofessional hand.</li>
            <li>I liked my old one so much that when it started to give up the gusto after over 5 years, I picked up the new version of the same model.  </li>
            <li>I really like the close shave and the smoothness of how the shaver glides over the face.</li>
            <li>I noticed that the shave was closer and much smoother.</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver</li>
            <li>After that came the real kick in the nvts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always shaved with a blade, perhaps I was just expecting too much.</li>
            <li>The charge/clean/renew feature does what it promises very well, but the cost of the cleaning cartridge is exorbitant, and downgrades my rating to four stars.</li>
            <li>I will use the cleaning caartridge as along as the price remains reasonable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a blade with a motor, but a highly capable electric razor, with an electrics limits and advantages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>It shaves very close.  </li>
            <li>This item shipped fast and was as advertised.  </li>
            <li>i have been using braun products daily for 10 years and recommend purchasing a different version that is more powerful.</li>
            <li>Gives a really close shave.  </li>
            <li>The Braun has lived up to my expectations and works very well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really get the complaints about these being made in China now -</li>
            <li>and it cut very close.</li>
            <li>I think tomorrow that I will get some pre-electric shave and that it will do very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first cleaning cartridge but new ones don&#x27;t seem to be unreasonably priced.</li>
            <li>, the cleaning cycle will start automatically, it takes about 4 minutes to clean, and the cleaning light will blink for an additional 3 or 4 hours till the razor has fully dried and is ready for use again.</li>
            <li>norelco is much more versatile with a beard trimmer on one side and a close razor on the other.</li>
            <li>It fits great in the hand, not too big not too small.</li>
            <li>The only two things I don&#x27;t like is that I wish it would charge in the cleaning station without requiring it to clean.</li>
            <li>, I usually go back with a razor to do my side burns and clean up anyway</li>
            <li>Just replaced an older Braun as I like them so much.</li>
            <li>I have used Braun razors in past and liked how they shaved.</li>
            <li>The same is true of battery replacement.</li>
            <li>While i&#x27;m shaving, i frequently feel tugs of hairs getting snagged, and after the shave my skin feels pretty irritated.  </li>
            <li>this new Braun and the shave is so much closer and smoother than the rotary shaver.  </li>
            <li>My husband really loves his new razor that I purchased for him for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Having mostly used a safety razor most of my life I have found it difficult</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re looking for a shaver at a decent price point, check this one out.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver as a Christmas gift for my husband, and although he says it works very well, it was actually more shaver than he wanted or needs and would have preferred that I returned it and purchased something simpler, however, that was not allowed due to the fact that it has toxic substances apparently, which must be the cleaner refills that are included.  </li>
            <li>He is diabetic and in his 70&#x27;s was getting a little shakey and was beginning to cut himself more often with his razer.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about the cleaning system, but it works great and sanitizes the head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as slender as the Panasonic shavers, but still, it&#x27;s much nicer than the old style.</li>
            <li>: The cost of a replacement foil is close to a quarter of the cost of a new razor.</li>
            <li>I got this shaver for about $80 (new) on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t  buy a new one, I just hope Norelco has maintained their quality.</li>
            <li>Anyway, got this one from Ebay for $50 brand new still in the box, and have been using it for about 10 days now.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave as clean and through as I expected.</li>
            <li>can say this particular shaver surprised me with the quality and closeness of shave it gives.</li>
            <li>and the motor is quiet compared to most other shavers i&#x27;ve heard</li>
            <li>have no idea what you get by spending more on a Braun because using this for the past year</li>
            <li>Also, the first razor I&#x27;ve ever seen that comes without a case, you have to buy up to the next model to get one.</li>
            <li>I finally got fed up enough to go back to a Braun foil shaver, and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>and I was pleased, but not completely satisfied; however, I used some shave oil</li>
            <li>If there were a way to open, clean, and lube these things, they might last longer.</li>
            <li>2 year old worn out battery norelco cut my hair 10x easier than the brand new braun.</li>
            <li>recommend this shaver for people with medium to light beards and not so much for heavy beards!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The box has everything really well packaged and only took me 5 minutes to set up without reading the instructions, but i&#x27;d recommend giving them a once over for helpful tips and whatnot.</li>
            <li>The manual does not mention using a pre-electric shave, but after another week, I decided to try that as I was using the pre-electric with my old shaver.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a couple days old.</li>
            <li>I have a 20+ year old Braun electric razon that still holds a charge.  </li>
            <li>Trashed my old triple head.</li>
            <li>I replaced my old Braun after fifteen years of service.</li>
            <li>I have Panasonics 4 years old and they are still sharp.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am 54 years young and have been using a rotary razor all my life</li>
            <li>The closeness of the shave I get from this razor doesn&#x27;t even compare to what I was getting from my old Remington.</li>
            <li>I have tried Norelco&#x27;s, old Braun&#x27;s, Wahl (one), and Remington&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>So far these batteries have held up, as has the motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought this as an upgrade to a shaver that was 10+ years old</li>
            <li>Ever since Remington changed to a cheaper replacement cuting head, I was having problems with my old razor.  </li>
            <li>I still have to use a razor afterwards, but my razors last much longer, saving me money.</li>
            <li>The trimmer reminds me of the ones found on the old Braun Activater shavers.</li>
            <li>This shaver gives me a much closer shave without going over and over the same spot or unnaturally stretching my skin.</li>
            <li>if I feel like it at night (this is just personal habit because I like my face to feel totally smooth all the time, but it&#x27;s not really necessary), then put the shaver in the cleaner/charger when I go to bed and repeat the next day.</li>
            <li>so i wouldn&#x27;t go through the fluid so fast.  </li>
            <li>The manual says they should last a month&#x27;s worth of daily use and I seem on pace for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It requires little maintenance (tapping out stubble, running under water), creates no mess, good both wet and dry.</li>
            <li>self clean operation is a little loud at first but quiets down to the sound of a little dishwasher.</li>
            <li>IMO.&lt;br /&gt;It seems they have also redone the battery on it as my old one took 8 hours to charge and the new model only takes 1.</li>
            <li>It is a little larger than my last electric shaver, but a much better shave...</li>
            <li>It cut beard very clean and the noise is also very small.</li>
            <li>My old Braun got to be about 12 years old, and on battery it would only run about 50% speed, so the shaving was poor, but it still worked ok plugged in, although it didn&#x27;t shave as well as when it was new.</li>
            <li>I finally decided it was time to return to Braun since I was going have to purchase a new blade kit for the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>/&gt;Foil shavers don&#x27;t seem like they should work better than an independently floating three-blade rotary, but they do - at least for me.</li>
            <li>I recently noticed that the price of the cleaning cartridge has dropped dramatically, and at that level, it&#x27;s not worth the trouble to make my own.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty nasty beard, but the foil has stood up to it better than most.</li>
            <li>They have made some major improvements on this razor, namely the heads.</li>
            <li>I bought this because i got a job where i would need to be clean shaven everyday, and using a traditional blade tears my face up.</li>
            <li>The motor compartments are generally clogged with hair, which accounts for some of the problem.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s 3 years old diied, and I only used it about 2 or 3 times a month.  </li>
            <li>with my old Braun i only ran the cleaner once a week or so</li>
            <li>The power cord doesn&#x27;t fit and I have been forced to use a power cord from a 10-year-old Braun razor.</li>
            <li>Major irritation plus it took multiple passes to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>The other down side I&#x27;ve found is that it isn&#x27;t as clean at shaving my neck</li>
            <li>This nearly eliminates loss due to evaporating between uses, and it has not yet developed any leaks.</li>
            <li>The scum bags have as yet, after 4 months, to respond to my request for a full refund.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s normally a plus for me, though, because wet/dry shavers generally cannot be used corded (they don&#x27;t know when they&#x27;re wet or dry, so they just won&#x27;t allow corded shaving at all), whereas dry-only shavers like this one can.</li>

            <li> Braun makes an excellent product that always seems to work well.</li>
            <li> Charger lights indicate the charge of the razor, and battery life is awesome.</li>

            <li> The self cleaning system is also great.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a great buy.</li>

            <li> The cleaning system is a BONUS and the shaver always smells great and is sanitary.  </li>
            <li> Great shave every time.  </li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.  </li>
            <li> Great buy for your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy that I bought mine.</li>
            <li> The build quality is still excellent and they shave better than ever.</li>
            <li> Looks good but feels spongy on the skin; cannot compare to shavers in series 7000 and 8000.</li>
            <li> This shaver has a lot of good feathers.</li>
            <li> No burning, no irritation, and a shave that&#x27;s 95% as good as using a blade and cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought an additional shaver as a gift and they loved it as well.</li>
            <li> Braun has made a good shaver in the 350CC</li>
            <li> Not as good as my trusty razor but still does a good job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco and Remington but Braun is superior for a close shave without burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have a $15 travel Braun that&#x27;s superior to $75</li>
            <li> good to use...</li>
            <li> They either didn&#x27;t do a good job or hurt my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I need to have a good shave every day.</li>
            <li> The cleaning liquid is good for 30 or so cleans or until it dries out, but to charge the shaver in the doc you have to lock it in, at which point it automatically cleans.</li>
            <li> Some were good, others not so much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and frankly it did not do a good job.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and works great!!</li>
            <li> The Braun Shaver is innovative and a great item.  </li>
            <li> He is very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The comfort is very good while shaving and the docking station that is included is really cool.</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t shave more than once a week!</li>
            <li> Then brush the top of the shaver—done!  </li>
            <li> is taken care of by the 10-seconds of tapping and whisking…  and I am not too sure what the ‘Automatic Lubrication’ feature is...or what it does!</li>
            <li> A better choice for my neck beard would probably have been the series 7 shaver, however, I did not feel like paying almost $200 for the series 7!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It comes with a fancy cleaning machine that works great, but you can easily wash under running water or with the brush too.</li>
            <li> in all, this is an amazing shaver for the price</li>
            <li> And the price was more than fair</li>
            <li> Nice shaver for the money,</li>
            <li> whether its being used or not, as it stated it can evaporate on its own.</li>
            <li> The shaver is compact and fits nicely in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> We have been trying to figure out which kind to buy for 3 years and kept putting it off.</li>
            <li> the battery kind of crapped out on me in about a year.</li>
            <li> but I know from experience that it will, and it&#x27;s nice to know</li>
            <li> It is a great shaver, but I think Braun’s marketing department sold me on the advantages of the ‘Clean &amp; Renew’ system.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this Braun 350CC-4 and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Does a wonderful job, holds a charge, and cleans to like new condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for about 6 weeks now (3-4 times/week) and have found it to be very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very good razor,produces a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Extremely easy to use, does a good job and the cleaning station couldnt be more convenient.</li>
            <li> the moment this is by far the best deal for a foil shaver with an included cleaning system - almost all the others are priced over the century mark, and I can&#x27;t see how they&#x27;d do anything much better than this shaver.</li>
            <li> At first it didn&#x27;t shave that great</li>
            <li> 7000s have many problems but cut well, 8000 is the way to go if you can find one.</li>
            <li> Trimmer function needs to be better made.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m glad i chose this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps I need more time.</li>
            <li> Again, the pre-electric seemed to make the shave better yet.</li>
            <li> It was my favorite shaver until now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving more years than I care to admit and simply put, Braun is the best.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t have asked for more in a shaver.  </li>
            <li> and i love the shave i get with it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the shaver, this is my 5th or 6th Braun over the years.  </li>
            <li> but I am satisfied with the purchase</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my head even after many passes, this is where it shines in use.</li>
            <li> Also, living in Hawaii I am used to waiting 3 or 4 weeks, or more, for my mail orders to arrive.</li>
            <li> This one does a better job than my others.</li>
            <li> We were giving it as a present for Christmas and our friend is very happy.</li>
            <li> either way I wanted to try another product to see if i can get more life out of</li>
            <li> so many times it took forever to shave with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So hopefully the battery lasts more than a year, Make sure you fill out the philips warranty card in case you have battery issues like I did.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s peace of mind to be able to plug in and shave if needed -</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Have to make many passes before i get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m most happy with my new shaver.</li>
            <li> Build quality is pretty good tho</li>
            <li> Besides, electrics work best against a dry beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes keeping them in tip top shape so easy.</li>
            <li> as the instructions say, it&#x27;s as good as new when it&#x27;s finished!</li>
            <li> it  gives me a good close shave ,better then my old shaver ..</li>
            <li> I have used Braun shavers for 30+ years and wouldn&#x27;t trade it, because they are the best.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning of the model, like the others, is easy, and so is the cleaning method included.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lost edge very quickly.  </li>
            <li> so I was really debating with myself about switching to a foil razor, but I can honestly tell you now I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> This is very inexpenensive, every bit as effective as the Braun cleaner, and safe.</li>
            <li> You can easily pay well over $130 elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and gives a close shave with out drying out your skin.  </li>
            <li> Easy to operate.  </li>
            <li> Is easy on your skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I returned it and bought another new Philips Bodygroom TT2040 which is superior in all ways</li>
            <li> The razor shaves fine</li>
            <li> so this is a huge step up.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for christmas and he says it works well and creates a smooth shave, I like the built in cleaner.</li>
            <li> I decided to return the shaver before the 60 day free trial expired.</li>
            <li> The shave is fast and painless, deserving of five stars.</li>
            <li> close shave, charges quickly, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> You will feel comfortable after using it.</li>
            <li> The shaver fits comfortably into my hand and glides smoothly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It felt smooth gliding on the face, however it did not leave my face smooth at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one makes my face feel really smooth.</li>
            <li> Old Braun was easy to clean with a brush, this one seems fairly difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Surprised at how good of a shave it provides...</li>
            <li> The shave was never as good (close) as my old trusty Braun.  </li>
            <li> This is a gift for my brother,he say he love it very much,and his friends are all say nice,so,we love it</li>
            <li> The protective cap is nice in that it not only protects the heads, but effectively blocks the on off switch</li>
            <li> Forty plus years of shaving has come full circle and brought me back to this great shaver.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, quick, comfortable.</li>
            <li> It was a simple shaver, but while in the military, it came in very handy and did a great job.</li>
            <li> You put cleaning solution on the bottom (or if you are like the rest of the world and just clean your razor with water, water does</li>
            <li> I would have to take a safety razor and clean up the problem areas.</li>
            <li> The self clean and lube system probably helps.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I travel for weeks at a time, during which i&#x27;ll clean my razor manually.  </li>
            <li> Gives a fairly close shave, not as close as a blade, but better than other electric razors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> so my face generally is pretty easy to clean up and this razor just would not cut</li>
            <li> good razor overall</li>
            <li> I bought this one because my old Braun Activator 8000 Series shaver recently broke after many years of great service.  </li>
            <li> the braun clean and renew cartridges leave the razor smelling lemony fresh each morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It  worked  fine for the first 4 months</li>
            <li> Every morning the shaver is clean (I&#x27;ve opened it up to check), fully charged and smells lemon fresh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After purchasing three blade and foil kits and having them wear out much to quickly, I decided to try a Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I finally spent the money to buy a nice razor and it works so much better.  </li>
            <li> With the older 350cc it looked more like a rounded rectangular brick.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get the older version of this shaver, make sure you get the one with the -4 tacked on.</li>
            <li> Okay, my Braun is brand new, out of the box</li>
            <li> If they are willing to sell the cleaner more reasonably, I&#x27;ll buy it, but I cannot justify the expense as it is now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> The razor is better than most at not \\&quot;grabbing\\&quot; at longer hairs, though I tend to use the pop up trimmer to get rid of long hairs or multi day beard growth.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are available on line and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The blades on the Series 3 350 lose it after approx 6 months and the shave is of a distinctly unshaved, bristly feel.</li>
            <li> So far I am pleased with the shave closeness and the comfort in using the shaver.  </li>
            <li> For the money I don&#x27;t think its worth it.  </li>
            <li> It does do a good job though, and I will probably try my own cleaning solution that I have used on Braun shavers for years; distilled water, isopropanol, glycerine, Simple Green, with a drop of light machine oil.</li>
            <li> Shaves close, worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Braun is worth the price.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure this is pretty low end as far as these things go, but it&#x27;s been working great for me so far.</li>
            <li> It is fairly quite, easy to clean and cuts both long and short hairs.  </li>
            <li> and he said this one works just as good as his other one.</li>
            <li> The main thing is that it shaves well and comfortably.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Braun in the early early 80&#x27;s and loved the fast convenient shave, however, at that time, the foils they were using in the shaver seemed to wear out rather quickly</li>
            <li> This is the best $100 I have spent in a long time!</li>
            <li> This Braun is quieter than the last (which I like) and it charges more quickly.  </li>
            <li> only CON I have, is the blue light on the charger/cleaning stand is too bright at night.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, the newer design works much better too.</li>
            <li> This is one of the two best I&#x27;ve ever used (the other was a 1975 Eltron that is long gone).</li>
            <li> For the performance this shaver provides for different facial hair types and the cordless system, this is definitely a great buy for any guy</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s nice and rubberized in case you have wet hands or something.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You decide yourself on the before or after shower shave and whether you need the pre-electric shave.&lt;br /&gt;P.S., Many years ago, back in the 60&#x27;s, I owned a Braun travel shaver that was battery driven.</li>
            <li> It lasted for many years and it finally died after about 25 years</li>
            <li> /&gt;razor is ready to go every time I pick it up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them for many years -- I was on my third shaver.  </li>
            <li> The automatic cleaner, charger and lubricator are really neat!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just replacing the foil for the first time at about the two year point.</li>
            <li> There may be fancier units, but I doubt that they can give a better shave, and a shave is the objective.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> My  first Braun shaver \\&quot;Made in Germany\\&quot;  lasted  over 10 years,  </li>
            <li> It get most of my facial hair...</li>
            <li> The shaver is great, but the charging stand is becoming useless.</li>
            <li> The trimmer on the first shaver broke after 18 months of use.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anyone who shaves that fast!</li>
            <li> , I had to make multiple passes to get rid of the stubble,but it seems to be getting better every day.</li>
            <li> If I could have purchased the Braun separately without the ‘Clean &amp; Renew’ system, I would have, because now I have a big cleaner to store away somewhere when not in use, and costly ‘Clean &amp; Renew’ refills to purchase again and again.  </li>
            <li> It is not quite as powerful as my older Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> Overall, not quite as good as the last one, but if they still made it, it would be a $200+ razor.</li>
            <li> I think if you shave your whole face daily, have fine hair / light growth, a big upper lip, and are okay with buying lots of cleaning fluid, this unit would be fine.  </li>
            <li> The first night my wife closed the bathroom door because it was too bright and lit up the bedroom with a blue glow.  </li>
            <li> My beard grows in so many different directions that a straight razor cuts well, but, even when I have a professional barber give me a hot shave, he does not do as well as the Braun, which was held in my unprofessional hand.</li>
            <li> I liked my old one so much that when it started to give up the gusto after over 5 years, I picked up the new version of the same model.  </li>
            <li> I really like the close shave and the smoothness of how the shaver glides over the face.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the shave was closer and much smoother.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver</li>
            <li> After that came the real kick in the nvts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always shaved with a blade, perhaps I was just expecting too much.</li>
            <li> The charge/clean/renew feature does what it promises very well, but the cost of the cleaning cartridge is exorbitant, and downgrades my rating to four stars.</li>
            <li> I will use the cleaning caartridge as along as the price remains reasonable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a blade with a motor, but a highly capable electric razor, with an electrics limits and advantages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> It shaves very close.  </li>
            <li> This item shipped fast and was as advertised.  </li>
            <li> i have been using braun products daily for 10 years and recommend purchasing a different version that is more powerful.</li>
            <li> Gives a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> The Braun has lived up to my expectations and works very well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get the complaints about these being made in China now -</li>
            <li> and it cut very close.</li>
            <li> I think tomorrow that I will get some pre-electric shave and that it will do very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first cleaning cartridge but new ones don&#x27;t seem to be unreasonably priced.</li>
            <li> , the cleaning cycle will start automatically, it takes about 4 minutes to clean, and the cleaning light will blink for an additional 3 or 4 hours till the razor has fully dried and is ready for use again.</li>
            <li> norelco is much more versatile with a beard trimmer on one side and a close razor on the other.</li>
            <li> It fits great in the hand, not too big not too small.</li>
            <li> The only two things I don&#x27;t like is that I wish it would charge in the cleaning station without requiring it to clean.</li>
            <li> , I usually go back with a razor to do my side burns and clean up anyway</li>
            <li> Just replaced an older Braun as I like them so much.</li>
            <li> I have used Braun razors in past and liked how they shaved.</li>
            <li> The same is true of battery replacement.</li>
            <li> While i&#x27;m shaving, i frequently feel tugs of hairs getting snagged, and after the shave my skin feels pretty irritated.  </li>
            <li> this new Braun and the shave is so much closer and smoother than the rotary shaver.  </li>
            <li> My husband really loves his new razor that I purchased for him for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Having mostly used a safety razor most of my life I have found it difficult</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for a shaver at a decent price point, check this one out.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver as a Christmas gift for my husband, and although he says it works very well, it was actually more shaver than he wanted or needs and would have preferred that I returned it and purchased something simpler, however, that was not allowed due to the fact that it has toxic substances apparently, which must be the cleaner refills that are included.  </li>
            <li> He is diabetic and in his 70&#x27;s was getting a little shakey and was beginning to cut himself more often with his razer.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the cleaning system, but it works great and sanitizes the head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as slender as the Panasonic shavers, but still, it&#x27;s much nicer than the old style.</li>
            <li> : The cost of a replacement foil is close to a quarter of the cost of a new razor.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver for about $80 (new) on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t  buy a new one, I just hope Norelco has maintained their quality.</li>
            <li> Anyway, got this one from Ebay for $50 brand new still in the box, and have been using it for about 10 days now.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as clean and through as I expected.</li>
            <li> can say this particular shaver surprised me with the quality and closeness of shave it gives.</li>
            <li> and the motor is quiet compared to most other shavers i&#x27;ve heard</li>
            <li> have no idea what you get by spending more on a Braun because using this for the past year</li>
            <li> Also, the first razor I&#x27;ve ever seen that comes without a case, you have to buy up to the next model to get one.</li>
            <li> I finally got fed up enough to go back to a Braun foil shaver, and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> and I was pleased, but not completely satisfied; however, I used some shave oil</li>
            <li> If there were a way to open, clean, and lube these things, they might last longer.</li>
            <li> 2 year old worn out battery norelco cut my hair 10x easier than the brand new braun.</li>
            <li> recommend this shaver for people with medium to light beards and not so much for heavy beards!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The box has everything really well packaged and only took me 5 minutes to set up without reading the instructions, but i&#x27;d recommend giving them a once over for helpful tips and whatnot.</li>
            <li> The manual does not mention using a pre-electric shave, but after another week, I decided to try that as I was using the pre-electric with my old shaver.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a couple days old.</li>
            <li> I have a 20+ year old Braun electric razon that still holds a charge.  </li>
            <li> Trashed my old triple head.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Braun after fifteen years of service.</li>
            <li> I have Panasonics 4 years old and they are still sharp.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am 54 years young and have been using a rotary razor all my life</li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave I get from this razor doesn&#x27;t even compare to what I was getting from my old Remington.</li>
            <li> I have tried Norelco&#x27;s, old Braun&#x27;s, Wahl (one), and Remington&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> So far these batteries have held up, as has the motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this as an upgrade to a shaver that was 10+ years old</li>
            <li> Ever since Remington changed to a cheaper replacement cuting head, I was having problems with my old razor.  </li>
            <li> I still have to use a razor afterwards, but my razors last much longer, saving me money.</li>
            <li> The trimmer reminds me of the ones found on the old Braun Activater shavers.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives me a much closer shave without going over and over the same spot or unnaturally stretching my skin.</li>
            <li> if I feel like it at night (this is just personal habit because I like my face to feel totally smooth all the time, but it&#x27;s not really necessary), then put the shaver in the cleaner/charger when I go to bed and repeat the next day.</li>
            <li> so i wouldn&#x27;t go through the fluid so fast.  </li>
            <li> The manual says they should last a month&#x27;s worth of daily use and I seem on pace for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It requires little maintenance (tapping out stubble, running under water), creates no mess, good both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> self clean operation is a little loud at first but quiets down to the sound of a little dishwasher.</li>
            <li> IMO.&lt;br /&gt;It seems they have also redone the battery on it as my old one took 8 hours to charge and the new model only takes 1.</li>
            <li> It is a little larger than my last electric shaver, but a much better shave...</li>
            <li> It cut beard very clean and the noise is also very small.</li>
            <li> My old Braun got to be about 12 years old, and on battery it would only run about 50% speed, so the shaving was poor, but it still worked ok plugged in, although it didn&#x27;t shave as well as when it was new.</li>
            <li> I finally decided it was time to return to Braun since I was going have to purchase a new blade kit for the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> /&gt;Foil shavers don&#x27;t seem like they should work better than an independently floating three-blade rotary, but they do - at least for me.</li>
            <li> I recently noticed that the price of the cleaning cartridge has dropped dramatically, and at that level, it&#x27;s not worth the trouble to make my own.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty nasty beard, but the foil has stood up to it better than most.</li>
            <li> They have made some major improvements on this razor, namely the heads.</li>
            <li> I bought this because i got a job where i would need to be clean shaven everyday, and using a traditional blade tears my face up.</li>
            <li> The motor compartments are generally clogged with hair, which accounts for some of the problem.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s 3 years old diied, and I only used it about 2 or 3 times a month.  </li>
            <li> with my old Braun i only ran the cleaner once a week or so</li>
            <li> The power cord doesn&#x27;t fit and I have been forced to use a power cord from a 10-year-old Braun razor.</li>
            <li> Major irritation plus it took multiple passes to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> The other down side I&#x27;ve found is that it isn&#x27;t as clean at shaving my neck</li>
            <li> This nearly eliminates loss due to evaporating between uses, and it has not yet developed any leaks.</li>
            <li> The scum bags have as yet, after 4 months, to respond to my request for a full refund.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s normally a plus for me, though, because wet/dry shavers generally cannot be used corded (they don&#x27;t know when they&#x27;re wet or dry, so they just won&#x27;t allow corded shaving at all), whereas dry-only shavers like this one can.</li>
            <li> The address is read out fast and in an incoherent voice.</li>
            <li> Since all replacement foils seem to be priced about the same, it might be worthwhile buying a less expensive razor, and just throwing it out when you need a new foil, since all foils and batteries deteriorate.</li>
            <li> charging/cleaning base is super easy to use, just drop the shaver in, and press the lock button</li>
            <li> I just wanted to let people know how long to expect it to last.</li>
            <li> After owning the Braun for a week, what comes to mind is there is probably no need for the ‘Clean &amp; Renew’ system—with its big blue washing machine, and expensive cleaner refills.</li>
            <li> I have REALLY thick facial hair and the flip up razor attachment cuts a straight line like butter.</li>
            <li> you wait too long in between shaves and the hair gets real thick and long, turn the razor over, put the beard trimmer down to 1 give it a brief trim then flip it back over to clean it down to bare skin in a couple passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s cheaper in the long run than blades and foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pay the price, it will save you in the long run.</li>
            <li> If you try this, I suggest brush cleaning before putting the shaver in the cleaner/charger to nearly eliminate the buildup of hair and dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update March 1, 2013:</li>
            <li> Technically you could, but not very well.</li>
            <li> I know, some men have a beard that does not take well to foil shavers, but if a rotary does a poor job and you consider going back to a blade, you might want to give this one a try first --</li>
            <li> I used it for a few years but was never happy with it - I found myself shaving several times a day just to keep my beard manageable, and I never felt like my skin was really smooth shaven.</li>
            <li> Wet, dry, cream, different hair lengths and this thing refused to cut my neck hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one caveat is that I&#x27;ve had a few days where the shaver is not fully dry after taking it out of the cleaning stand, even though it&#x27;s been in there far longer than the 4 hours the manual says is required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is the stand that stinks, using the cord directly on the shaver seems to charge the device adequately.</li>
            <li> There is no heated dry</li>
            <li> in mind this is *not* a wet/dry shaver, so it needs to be fully dry to shave.</li>
            <li> I used it on my dry face</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this shaver, however, the trimmer has broken after only 6 months of weekly use.</li>
            <li> You cannot choose options fast because the system gets confused and kicks you out but only after you have indicated you want to return a product.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s certainly worth the price especially considering how expensive razor blades are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a pretty tough beard</li>
            <li> so its not that inconvenient but definitely doesn&#x27;t do a clean shave on my neck.</li>
            <li> This version has less power and takes longer to shave which has a brand new foil and cutter than my previous 340 which has a foil and cutter that hasn&#x27;t been replaced for 2 years!  </li>
            <li> I got the money back and found it was $10 less than the amount I paid on the receipt.</li>
            <li> last time I used it it caused my entire neck to break out from all the times i had to run over the hair with this razor which nothing usually makes my neck</li>
            <li> Relatively close shave and little to no skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> :  daily shaver, fine hair (but grows in reasonably thick), random patches of growth (soul patch, side burns, chin</li>
            <li> Not sure how long they will last.</li>
            <li> If I shave everyday the series 3 works well enough for my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was there really no way around this?</li>
            <li> The clean and renew base is essential in the system and drove me to purchase the system initially.</li>
            <li> I guess those few hairs grow very flat to the skin and the razor would not catch them no matter how I moved it.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointing because I paid extra for the &amp;#34;Braun&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It does not have some features that my other Braun Shavers had</li>
            <li> You can convert power on a small board, say on the outside of the case.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been using electrics so long, I&#x27;ve been through quite a few.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to replace my 340 with a slightly better model and found that this shaver: disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I should know because I&#x27;ve tried this with multiple shavers, And not many can do this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lazy with buying the cleaning fluid refills, so</li>
            <li> Starting with blade and foam as a teenager, I eventually tired of the constant cuts, styptic pencils and TP.  </li>
            <li> Especially in the neck area where some hairs are hard to mow down.</li>
            <li> Average appliance in effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Making a home made cleaning solution is not worth it unless you buy a gallon of alcohol and a bottle of castor oil.</li>
            <li> The norelco clears my face and neck down in one or two swipes over the area.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> It broke down in just two months...</li>
            <li> My previous shaver always irritated me.</li>
            <li> to  replace a  previous  Braun shaver  with  charging  problems.</li>
            <li> my previous Braun died, I decided to try a Norelco rotary to see how it compared.</li>
            <li> I can have a slight burning sensation for a few hours after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> so a little \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; is required for a close shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy during the cleaning operation but</li>
            <li> No matter what the manual may say, there seems to be little difference in whether or not you wash your face before you use the razor.</li>
            <li> Before I get into the details on the shaver, a little background is in order.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dont have very thick facial hair</li>
            <li> Why not just pop off the foil/shaver, tap it a few times, and whisk the inside with a brush?</li>
            <li> I never realized what I was missing until I made the switch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband does shave every day but he does not have a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> At the cost we paid back then, you would think Braun would stand behind the product.  </li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on this junk.</li>
            <li> so you would be well advised to leave the shaver in the cleaning unit for a few hours so the alcohol can evaporate off the heads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame that Braun has made its third cord/connector change with this model, making all previous cords useless.</li>
            <li> It was missing small patches of hair under the jawline and one area under the nose.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes that it wouldn&#x27;t burn my face like every rotary razor has in the past.</li>
            <li> My face is smoother than it has ever felt, and I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about it.</li>
            <li> No more blade brushing and the&lt;br</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT A GREAT ENGINEERING CHALLENGE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Braun says that you can use this unit wet, I never saw the point of tempting fate.</li>
            <li> The cleaning fluid is way expensive in addition.</li>
            <li> This is easily the worst Braun i&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> The blades are dull in 10 months of use.</li>
            <li> I know the numbering Braun uses is confusing, but</li>
            <li> this razor sucks for someone with a medium to fairly thick beard to cut thru.  </li>
            <li> This makes it very awkward to shave tight spaces like my upper lip and between hair</li>
            <li> I understand the alcohol is a little expensive to replace.</li>
            <li> A little expensive</li>
            <li> After 2 years, the clean and renew base has gone bad.  </li>
            <li> Being expensive, i thought it would at least compete with the norelco.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> The trimmer is flimsy and poorly designed.</li>
            <li> any day.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Its expensive but does not give my husband a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is way too expensive</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Braun.</li>
            <li> I have which unfortunately needs to be sent in for service.</li>
            <li> and when did, look out -- bad cuts would follow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s why it&#x27;s bad for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hated this razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, very disappointed.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Arrived quickly and works great!!</li>
            <li> Looks good but feels spongy on the skin; cannot compare to shavers in series 7000 and 8000. 7000s have many problems but cut well, 8000 is the way to go if you can find one. The blades on the Series 3 350 lose it after approx 6 months and the shave is of a distinctly unshaved, bristly feel. Replacement foil set is costly; I suspect this is where Braun doubles its returns on every shaver sold. At last I dumped it and returned to an 8995. Best cut, man!</li>
            <li> This shaver has a lot of good feathers. I understand the alcohol is a little expensive to replace. I think their is a way to get around that. It feels very good on your face and it gives you a close shave. Thumbs up for this one.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this shaver, however, the trimmer has broken after only 6 months of weekly use. He doesn&#x27;t shave more than once a week! Trimmer function needs to be better made.</li>
            <li> Benn using this shaver quite a while. Excellent shave.</li>
            <li> good razor overall but it did not perform well shaving sideburns.  I also do not like how the cleaner is automatic.</li>
            <li> I bought this because i got a job where i would need to be clean shaven everyday, and using a traditional blade tears my face up. I bought this in hopes that it wouldn&#x27;t burn my face like every rotary razor has in the past. No burning, no irritation, and a shave that&#x27;s 95% as good as using a blade and cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box has everything really well packaged and only took me 5 minutes to set up without reading the instructions, but i&#x27;d recommend giving them a once over for helpful tips and whatnot. the shaver itself feels rather well built and the motor is quiet compared to most other shavers i&#x27;ve heard, it&#x27;s nice and rubberized in case you have wet hands or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging/cleaning base is super easy to use, just drop the shaver in, and press the lock button, the cleaning cycle will start automatically, it takes about 4 minutes to clean, and the cleaning light will blink for an additional 3 or 4 hours till the razor has fully dried and is ready for use again. the braun clean and renew cartridges leave the razor smelling lemony fresh each morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is an amazing shaver for the price and i&#x27;m glad i chose this one.</li>
            <li> it  gives me a good close shave ,better then my old shaver ..i would not trade it for nothing ...</li>
            <li> Best  price, quality and delivery  services  !!</li>
            <li> Having mostly used a safety razor most of my life I have found it difficult&lt;br /&gt;getting used to it. Does not seem to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I need more time.</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim and am really happy I did.  Extremely easy to use, does a good job and the cleaning station couldnt be more convenient.</li>
            <li> I purchased this about a month ago. I really like the close shave and the smoothness of how the shaver glides over the face. My previous shaver always irritated me. I also especially like the cleaning system it comes with. When I got the shaver, I followed the instructions of shaving before my shower. It was close, but I did not feel it was as close as I wanted. So after about 10 days, I decided to shave after the shower. I noticed that the shave was closer and much smoother. The manual does not mention using a pre-electric shave, but after another week, I decided to try that as I was using the pre-electric with my old shaver. Again, the pre-electric seemed to make the shave better yet. I am very happy with this Braun 350CC-4 and would highly recommend it to others. You decide yourself on the before or after shower shave and whether you need the pre-electric shave.&lt;br /&gt;P.S., Many years ago, back in the 60&#x27;s, I owned a Braun travel shaver that was battery driven. It was my favorite shaver until now. It lasted for many years and it finally died after about 25 years and I had to throw it away. It was a simple shaver, but while in the military, it came in very handy and did a great job.</li>
            <li> Surprised at how good of a shave it provides...</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like I never went through puberty.  My face is smoother than it has ever felt, and I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about it.</li>
            <li> I liked my old one so much that when it started to give up the gusto after over 5 years, I picked up the new version of the same model.  Works great, even on a beard that&#x27;s a couple days old.</li>
            <li> Excellent shave. Excellent price. The automatic cleaning system is not something I&#x27;ve used before, but it is a wonderful feature. No more blade brushing and the&lt;br /&gt;razor is ready to go every time I pick it up!</li>
            <li> Braun makes an excellent product that always seems to work well. I&#x27;m most happy with my new shaver. I bought an additional shaver as a gift and they loved it as well.</li>
            <li> So far I am pleased with the shave closeness and the comfort in using the shaver.  The self cleaning system is also great.</li>
            <li> Braun has made a good shaver in the 350CC and it&#x27;s NOT made in China! I&#x27;ve got a pretty tough beard so a little \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; is required for a close shave. Not as good as my trusty razor but still does a good job. It&#x27;s a little noisy during the cleaning operation but as the instructions say, it&#x27;s as good as new when it&#x27;s finished!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as clean and through as I expected. Build quality is pretty good tho</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving more years than I care to admit and simply put, Braun is the best. I&#x27;ve used Norelco and Remington but Braun is superior for a close shave without burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a $15 travel Braun that&#x27;s superior to $75 Remingtons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what you get by spending more on a Braun because using this for the past year I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rcommended</li>
            <li> good to use...i like it...</li>
            <li> Average appliance in effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for christmas and he says it works well and creates a smooth shave, I like the built in cleaner.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a great buy. I have REALLY thick facial hair and the flip up razor attachment cuts a straight line like butter. The comfort is very good while shaving and the docking station that is included is really cool. You put cleaning solution on the bottom (or if you are like the rest of the world and just clean your razor with water, water does fine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The self clean operation is a little loud at first but quiets down to the sound of a little dishwasher. Charger lights indicate the charge of the razor, and battery life is awesome. It fits great in the hand, not too big not too small. For the performance this shaver provides for different facial hair types and the cordless system, this is definitely a great buy for any guy</li>
            <li> Forty plus years of shaving has come full circle and brought me back to this great shaver.  Starting with blade and foam as a teenager, I eventually tired of the constant cuts, styptic pencils and TP.  I purchased my first Braun in the early early 80&#x27;s and loved the fast convenient shave, however, at that time, the foils they were using in the shaver seemed to wear out rather quickly and when did, look out -- bad cuts would follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After purchasing three blade and foil kits and having them wear out much to quickly, I decided to try a Norelco.  I&#x27;ve used them for many years -- I was on my third shaver.  The shave was never as good (close) as my old trusty Braun.  I finally decided it was time to return to Braun since I was going have to purchase a new blade kit for the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this new Braun and the shave is so much closer and smoother than the rotary shaver.  I don&#x27;t have to \\&quot;grind\\&quot; on my face anymore to get that close shave and my wife loves it too.  I know, some men have a beard that does not take well to foil shavers, but if a rotary does a poor job and you consider going back to a blade, you might want to give this one a try first -- I think it&#x27;s cheaper in the long run than blades and foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only CON I have, is the blue light on the charger/cleaning stand is too bright at night.  I wish it would have turned off after it finished it&#x27;s cleaning process. The first night my wife closed the bathroom door because it was too bright and lit up the bedroom with a blue glow.  I unplug it every night now...</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t have asked for more in a shaver.  I have used Braun shavers for 30+ years and wouldn&#x27;t trade it, because they are the best.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning of the model, like the others, is easy, and so is the cleaning method included.&lt;br /&gt;Works quietly and I would challenge a razor any day.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of electric razors.  Up until this one, I only used them for a short period of time.  They either didn&#x27;t do a good job or hurt my skin.  I finally spent the money to buy a nice razor and it works so much better.  Relatively close shave and little to no skin irritation.  This is proof that you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> It works great and i love the shave i get with it.</li>
            <li> For the money I don&#x27;t think its worth it.  Its expensive but does not give my husband a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE SENT IT BACK AS THE BACK PART BROKE OFF. DID YOU EVER RECEIVE IT AND WHATS YOUR ADVICE OR RECOMMENDATION. HOW COME NO ONE HAS ADVISED ME THAT AMAZON RECEIVED IT.  IT DOESN&#x27;T SHAVE HIM AT ALL.</li>
            <li> I agree with flyhi152 review.  I have a 20+ year old Braun electric razon that still holds a charge.  My Braun that&#x27;s 3 years old diied, and I only used it about 2 or 3 times a month.  Battery won&#x27;t charge anymore.  Pretty disappointing because I paid extra for the &amp;#34;Braun&amp;#34; name.</li>
            <li> It is not quite as powerful as my older Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> Lost edge very quickly.  Also, the first razor I&#x27;ve ever seen that comes without a case, you have to buy up to the next model to get one.</li>
            <li> This company is a rip off. They are disingenuous about their money back warrantee. I am a Marine and I need to have a good shave every day. I tried the shaver for 45 days. It was missing small patches of hair under the jawline and one area under the nose. I guess those few hairs grow very flat to the skin and the razor would not catch them no matter how I moved it. I would have to take a safety razor and clean up the problem areas. I decided to return the shaver before the 60 day free trial expired. I tried to get the address over the phone from the automated help line. The line is set up to take you through multiple menu options designed to frustrate. You cannot choose options fast because the system gets confused and kicks you out but only after you have indicated you want to return a product. Then comes the point where you get the return mail address. The address is read out fast and in an incoherent voice. After that the system hangs up on you, forcing you have to make multiple calls. It took me eleven calls to get the address correctly. After that came the real kick in the nvts. I had to pay $15 to ship the razor back. I got the money back and found it was $10 less than the amount I paid on the receipt. I had a $10 PX gift certificate that I had used; it was not a company coupon or Braun gift card but a door prize that the Exchange had given me. The scum bags have as yet, after 4 months, to respond to my request for a full refund. If I could, I would never use another Braun or P&amp;G product.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the shaver, this is my 5th or 6th Braun over the years.  It does not have some features that my other Braun Shavers had but I am satisfied with the purchase and it does provide a close shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver as a Christmas gift for my husband, and although he says it works very well, it was actually more shaver than he wanted or needs and would have preferred that I returned it and purchased something simpler, however, that was not allowed due to the fact that it has toxic substances apparently, which must be the cleaner refills that are included.  Therefore, I must give this item an &amp;#34;OK rating.</li>
            <li> Smooth, quick, comfortable. Trashed my old triple head.</li>
            <li> Great shaver for the price.  I replaced my old Braun after fifteen years of service.</li>
            <li> After owning the Braun for a week, what comes to mind is there is probably no need for the ‘Clean &amp; Renew’ system—with its big blue washing machine, and expensive cleaner refills. Why not just pop off the foil/shaver, tap it a few times, and whisk the inside with a brush? Then brush the top of the shaver—done!  I can charge the unit from the wall with the Braun plug…the ‘automatic cleaning’ is taken care of by the 10-seconds of tapping and whisking…  and I am not too sure what the ‘Automatic Lubrication’ feature is...or what it does! If I could have purchased the Braun separately without the ‘Clean &amp; Renew’ system, I would have, because now I have a big cleaner to store away somewhere when not in use, and costly ‘Clean &amp; Renew’ refills to purchase again and again.  It is a great shaver, but I think Braun’s marketing department sold me on the advantages of the ‘Clean &amp; Renew’ system.</li>
            <li> The blades are dull in 10 months of use. I have Panasonics 4 years old and they are still sharp.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy another Braun again.&lt;br /&gt;I would not reccommend this Shaver.</li>
            <li> This is a gift for my brother,he say he love it very much,and his friends are all say nice,so,we love it</li>
            <li> Great product for a excellent price!</li>
            <li> Gives a fairly close shave, not as close as a blade, but better than other electric razors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I gave it a four star rating only because the shaver does not work so well on my neck hair! It works well on my face and head (shaved head). It does not irritate my head even after many passes, this is where it shines in use. A better choice for my neck beard would probably have been the series 7 shaver, however, I did not feel like paying almost $200 for the series 7! If I shave everyday the series 3 works well enough for my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this shaver for people with medium to light beards and not so much for heavy beards!</li>
            <li> I am 54 years young and have been using a rotary razor all my life so I was really debating with myself about switching to a foil razor, but I can honestly tell you now I am so glad I did. The closeness of the shave I get from this razor doesn&#x27;t even compare to what I was getting from my old Remington. I never realized what I was missing until I made the switch.&lt;br /&gt; Also, living in Hawaii I am used to waiting 3 or 4 weeks, or more, for my mail orders to arrive. I was truly amazed when this razor arrived only 4 days after I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;  This is the best $100 I have spent in a long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always shaved with a blade, perhaps I was just expecting too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a shaver that works for me and I found it. And the price was more than fair</li>
            <li> Nice shaver for the money, and although I haven&#x27;t had to replace the cleaning pod yet, will have to buy extras in the future. Not sure how long they will last. whether its being used or not, as it stated it can evaporate on its own.</li>
            <li> I have tried Norelco&#x27;s, old Braun&#x27;s, Wahl (one), and Remington&#x27;s. The Braun 350cc-4 has given me the closest shave of any electric razor. However, I find that a pre-shave works the best for me. I chose the 350 because it was in my budget range. The automatic cleaner, charger and lubricator are really neat! However, the refill cleaner cartridges from Braun are pricey, but Wal-Mart sells a 2-pack for $11.82. Making a home made cleaning solution is not worth it unless you buy a gallon of alcohol and a bottle of castor oil. I question the home made solution recipes on the internet because the oils they recommend do not dissolve in alcohol. The lubricant in the Braun solution is dissolved. Put a drop of it on a mirror and let is evaporate. Notice the residue; it’s oily. If you would like to try my solution recipe, send me your email address.</li>
            <li> My husband went through 4 or 5 shavers until we found this. Pay the price, it will save you in the long run. Does a wonderful job, holds a charge, and cleans to like new condition. NO COMPLAINTS!</li>
            <li> I have used Braun razors in past and liked how they shaved. This one does a better job than my others. Especially in the neck area where some hairs are hard to mow down. When done I take of the head and rinse it out under running water. I do the same for the part of the razor that the head attaches to. Replacement heads are available on line and reasonably priced. I was skeptical about the cleaning system, but it works great and sanitizes the head.</li>
            <li> The shave is fast and painless, deserving of five stars. The charge/clean/renew feature does what it promises very well, but the cost of the cleaning cartridge is exorbitant, and downgrades my rating to four stars. It does do a good job though, and I will probably try my own cleaning solution that I have used on Braun shavers for years; distilled water, isopropanol, glycerine, Simple Green, with a drop of light machine oil. This is very inexpenensive, every bit as effective as the Braun cleaner, and safe. If they are willing to sell the cleaner more reasonably, I&#x27;ll buy it, but I cannot justify the expense as it is now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Jan 18, 2013: I have been removing the cleaning cartridge and replacing the caps after each use. This nearly eliminates loss due to evaporating between uses, and it has not yet developed any leaks. If you try this, I suggest brush cleaning before putting the shaver in the cleaner/charger to nearly eliminate the buildup of hair and dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update March 1, 2013: I recently noticed that the price of the cleaning cartridge has dropped dramatically, and at that level, it&#x27;s not worth the trouble to make my own. I will use the cleaning caartridge as along as the price remains reasonable.</li>
            <li> Very good razor,produces a very close shave.</li>
            <li> best electric that i have tried. close shave, charges quickly, easy to clean. would recomend to others to try .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for about 6 weeks now (3-4 times/week) and have found it to be very easy to use. It requires little maintenance (tapping out stubble, running under water), creates no mess, good both wet and dry. The only two things I don&#x27;t like is that I wish it would charge in the cleaning station without requiring it to clean. The cleaning liquid is good for 30 or so cleans or until it dries out, but to charge the shaver in the doc you have to lock it in, at which point it automatically cleans. The other down side I&#x27;ve found is that it isn&#x27;t as clean at shaving my neck, I usually go back with a razor to do my side burns and clean up anyway so its not that inconvenient but definitely doesn&#x27;t do a clean shave on my neck.</li>
            <li> Made in china, unlike what is state by another reviewer, this shaver is made in China. If that&#x27;s what you are buying it, don&#x27;t bother</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electrics exclusively since 1975. This is one of the two best I&#x27;ve ever used (the other was a 1975 Eltron that is long gone). The self clean and lube system probably helps. I have a pretty nasty beard, but the foil has stood up to it better than most. I&#x27;m just replacing the foil for the first time at about the two year point. The razor is better than most at not \\&quot;grabbing\\&quot; at longer hairs, though I tend to use the pop up trimmer to get rid of long hairs or multi day beard growth. It excels it that, without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame that Braun has made its third cord/connector change with this model, making all previous cords useless. Was there really no way around this? You can convert power on a small board, say on the outside of the case. Give the customer a break. please, and keep us from littering landfills with all those potential spare cords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One issue with all razors of this type: The cost of a replacement foil is close to a quarter of the cost of a new razor. Since all replacement foils seem to be priced about the same, it might be worthwhile buying a less expensive razor, and just throwing it out when you need a new foil, since all foils and batteries deteriorate. So far these batteries have held up, as has the motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been using electrics so long, I&#x27;ve been through quite a few. Once the motor or batteries can&#x27;t hack it anymore, I dissect them. The motor compartments are generally clogged with hair, which accounts for some of the problem. If there were a way to open, clean, and lube these things, they might last longer. The same is true of battery replacement. THIS IS NOT A GREAT ENGINEERING CHALLENGE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Braun says that you can use this unit wet, I never saw the point of tempting fate. Besides, electrics work best against a dry beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give this unit an excellent rating. There may be fancier units, but I doubt that they can give a better shave, and a shave is the objective. If you are not getting an excellent shave with it, read the instructions. It&#x27;s not a blade with a motor, but a highly capable electric razor, with an electrics limits and advantages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  No matter what the manual may say, there seems to be little difference in whether or not you wash your face before you use the razor. Just my 2 cents.</li>
            <li> Ive used several  trying to replace my Remington that has been discontinued and this is the only one that has worked. It is way too expensive but I cant go around unshaved. The cleaning fluid is way expensive in addition. The main thing is that it shaves well and comfortably.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a birthday present for my nephew.  He loves it!  Great product.  Does exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> This Braun is quieter than the last (which I like) and it charges more quickly.  My husband has had no complaints whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an update, this razor lasted about 15 months. It started dying last month. My husband does shave every day but he does not have a heavy beard.I think it&#x27;s certainly worth the price especially considering how expensive razor blades are. I just wanted to let people know how long to expect it to last.</li>
            <li> After 2 years, the clean and renew base has gone bad.  At the cost we paid back then, you would think Braun would stand behind the product.  The clean and renew base is essential in the system and drove me to purchase the system initially.</li>
            <li> This is my second one of these, and in a line of succession from earlier styles. I like them. They are quality and last and last and last. I bought this one as a gift. i also like the cleaning system that comes with them. It makes keeping them in tip top shape so easy. Treat yourself.</li>
            <li> It cut beard very clean and the noise is also very small. You will feel comfortable after using it. A little expensive</li>
            <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve had with an electric razor!</li>
            <li> I got this shaver for about $80 (new) on Amazon.  You can easily pay well over $130 elsewhere.  Anyway, you&#x27;ll get the smoothest shave ever with this product. It is fairly quite, easy to clean and cuts both long and short hairs.  It is a little larger than my last electric shaver, but a much better shave... literally razor close.  It comes with a fancy cleaning machine that works great, but you can easily wash under running water or with the brush too. The battery charge holds for several days. All in all, a great product.</li>
            <li> The Braun Shaver is innovative and a great item.  The cleaning system is a BONUS and the shaver always smells great and is sanitary.  Easy to use and gives a close shave with out drying out your skin.  The shaver is compact and fits nicely in the bathroom.  Highly recommend!  The shaver fits comfortably into my hand and glides smoothly.</li>
            <li> Bought this as an upgrade to a shaver that was 10+ years old so this is a huge step up. Shaves close, worth what I paid for it. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> My husband really loves his new razor that I purchased for him for Christmas. It shaves very close.  We have been trying to figure out which kind to buy for 3 years and kept putting it off. He is very happy. Braun is worth the price.</li>
            <li> This item shipped fast and was as advertised.  We were giving it as a present for Christmas and our friend is very happy.</li>
            <li> this razor sucks for someone with a medium to fairly thick beard to cut thru.  I was hoping to replace my 340 with a slightly better model and found that this shaver: disappointed.  This version has less power and takes longer to shave which has a brand new foil and cutter than my previous 340 which has a foil and cutter that hasn&#x27;t been replaced for 2 years!  i have been using braun products daily for 10 years and recommend purchasing a different version that is more powerful.</li>
            <li> My husband had a Braun before and he said this one works just as good as his other one. He is very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great shave every time.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with Braun.</li>
            <li> It was a very good buy.</li>
            <li> The razor shaves fine but there is a problem. The power cord doesn&#x27;t fit and I have been forced to use a power cord from a 10-year-old Braun razor. Can you send me the proper power cord?</li>
            <li> I hated this razor.&lt;br /&gt;I owned a Philips Bodygroom TT2040 and the battery kind of crapped out on me in about a year. I left it on the charger alot, so it may have been my fault but either way I wanted to try another product to see if i can get more life out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i Went with the braun. Being expensive, i thought it would at least compete with the norelco.&lt;br /&gt;Not even close. This thing didnt want to cut my hair, Ever. I dont have very thick facial hair so my face generally is pretty easy to clean up and this razor just would not cut it.&lt;br /&gt;I had to go over the same area of my face so many times it took forever to shave with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;I tried various options on the shave. Wet, dry, cream, different hair lengths and this thing refused to cut my neck hair mainly.&lt;br /&gt;The last time I used it it caused my entire neck to break out from all the times i had to run over the hair with this razor which nothing usually makes my neck breakout.&lt;br /&gt;It felt smooth gliding on the face, however it did not leave my face smooth at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it and bought another new Philips Bodygroom TT2040 which is superior in all ways IMO.&lt;br /&gt;It seems they have also redone the battery on it as my old one took 8 hours to charge and the new model only takes 1. So hopefully the battery lasts more than a year, Make sure you fill out the philips warranty card in case you have battery issues like I did. You get 2 1/2 years warranty now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The norelco is much more versatile with a beard trimmer on one side and a close razor on the other. The norelco clears my face and neck down in one or two swipes over the area.&lt;br /&gt;If you wait too long in between shaves and the hair gets real thick and long, turn the razor over, put the beard trimmer down to 1 give it a brief trim then flip it back over to clean it down to bare skin in a couple passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 2 year old worn out battery norelco cut my hair 10x easier than the brand new braun. Dont waste your money on this junk.</li>
            <li> very good thank amazon</li>
            <li> It took only 3 minutes to set is up.  Easy to operate.  Absolutely love it</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband as a gift and he loves it.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.  Gives a really close shave.  Is easy on your skin.  Great buy for your money.</li>
            <li> I  bought this shaver  set  to  replace a  previous  Braun shaver  with  charging  problems. (5 series)  It  worked  fine for the first 4 months but then I  noticed  how  it  started  to  lose  power  after  shaving only  for  about 3  minutes. After about 5 months it  would not  hold the  charge  at  all anymore.  Braun  does not  provide a  return shipping  label,  so you  would  have  to pay  for  the  shipping  or  take  it  to the \\&quot;nearest service  center\\&quot; -  for  me  a  100 mile drive.  Braun is not  what it  used to be.  My  first Braun shaver \\&quot;Made in Germany\\&quot;  lasted  over 10 years,  now it is  \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot;  and you can throw it into the trash after 90 days.</li>
            <li> Just replaced an older Braun as I like them so much. This one makes my face feel really smooth. The cleaning function is used once a week and saves having to brush it out regularly as it is automatic now. Love it!</li>
            <li> Ever since Remington changed to a cheaper replacement cuting head, I was having problems with my old razor.  After the last Remington foil broke and scratched my face, I decided that rather than  purchase another, I would try another brand.  The Braun has lived up to my expectations and works very well.  The cleaning station is supberb.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Husband said he couldn&#x27;t use an electric shaver, irritated his skin. He is diabetic and in his 70&#x27;s was getting a little shakey and was beginning to cut himself more often with his razer. He tried his sons elec. Braun one day, I ordered one for him and he LOVES it.</li>
            <li> It get most of my facial hair... I still have to use a razor afterwards, but my razors last much longer, saving me money.</li>
            <li> Before I get into the details on the shaver, a little background is in order.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used shavers for close to 20 years, starting out with Norelco, then Remington (remember the intercepters?), Braun, and Panasonics. Some were good, others not so much.&lt;br /&gt;I can say this particular shaver surprised me with the quality and closeness of shave it gives. It&#x27;s on parr with the Panasonic es8228s I have which unfortunately needs to be sent in for service. I&#x27;ve had the [[ASIN:B003YJ8ZX8 Braun 350cc]] shaver before and frankly it did not do a good job. Major irritation plus it took multiple passes to get a close shave. They have made some major improvements on this razor, namely the heads. The foils and heads are all one unit now rather than being separate. Apparently, the newer design works much better too. The trimmer reminds me of the ones found on the old Braun Activater shavers. While you wouldn&#x27;t want to make a habbit of this, you can use the trimmer to shave your head. I should know because I&#x27;ve tried this with multiple shavers, And not many can do this. The protective cap is nice in that it not only protects the heads, but effectively blocks the on off switch so it doesn&#x27;t get pushed when traveling. I only wish they included a traveling pouch for the shaver. The shaver&#x27;s shape has been redesigned. With the older 350cc it looked more like a rounded rectangular brick. This one has lost a bit of weight, taking on a cylinder shape and is easier to hold. It&#x27;s not as slender as the Panasonic shavers, but still, it&#x27;s much nicer than the old style. The cleaning system is what I would expect for a shaver at this price point. It&#x27;s not fancy but gets the job done. There is no heated dry so you would be well advised to leave the shaver in the cleaning unit for a few hours so the alcohol can evaporate off the heads. As to durability, I can&#x27;t speak to that having only had the shaver for 1 day.&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking for a shaver at a decent price point, check this one out. Don&#x27;t get the older version of this shaver, make sure you get the one with the -4 tacked on. I know the numbering Braun uses is confusing, but that -4 is there for a reason. If problems come up, I&#x27;ll update.</li>
            <li> The shaver is great, but the charging stand is becoming useless. It is the stand that stinks, using the cord directly on the shaver seems to charge the device adequately. I won&#x27;t  buy a new one, I just hope Norelco has maintained their quality.</li>
            <li> I have had two Braun Series 3 shavers.  The trimmer on the first shaver broke after 18 months of use.  The trimmer on the second shaver broke after 12 months.  The trimmer is flimsy and poorly designed.</li>
            <li> It broke down in just two months...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No reaction when I press the button or recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know where to repair it...</li>
            <li> I had a Braun shaver in the 90&#x27;s, back when they were still made in Germany - it cost me a hundred bucks, didn&#x27;t shave as well as this one and didn&#x27;t come with a cleaning system either. I don&#x27;t really get the complaints about these being made in China now - so what? The build quality is still excellent and they shave better than ever. Does everyone on Amazon have family in Germany that was put out of work by the move to China?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my previous Braun died, I decided to try a Norelco rotary to see how it compared. I used it for a few years but was never happy with it - I found myself shaving several times a day just to keep my beard manageable, and I never felt like my skin was really smooth shaven. I finally got fed up enough to go back to a Braun foil shaver, and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foil shavers don&#x27;t seem like they should work better than an independently floating three-blade rotary, but they do - at least for me. This shaver gives me a much closer shave without going over and over the same spot or unnaturally stretching my skin. There&#x27;s no pulling either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a cleaning system before and I&#x27;m sure this is pretty low end as far as these things go, but it&#x27;s been working great for me so far. My routine is to shave in the morning and again if I feel like it at night (this is just personal habit because I like my face to feel totally smooth all the time, but it&#x27;s not really necessary), then put the shaver in the cleaner/charger when I go to bed and repeat the next day. Every morning the shaver is clean (I&#x27;ve opened it up to check), fully charged and smells lemon fresh. I&#x27;m still on my first cleaning cartridge but new ones don&#x27;t seem to be unreasonably priced. The manual says they should last a month&#x27;s worth of daily use and I seem on pace for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one caveat is that I&#x27;ve had a few days where the shaver is not fully dry after taking it out of the cleaning stand, even though it&#x27;s been in there far longer than the 4 hours the manual says is required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind this is *not* a wet/dry shaver, so it needs to be fully dry to shave. That&#x27;s normally a plus for me, though, because wet/dry shavers generally cannot be used corded (they don&#x27;t know when they&#x27;re wet or dry, so they just won&#x27;t allow corded shaving at all), whereas dry-only shavers like this one can. So if you run out of charge, just plug it in and shave. It hasn&#x27;t happened to me yet but I know from experience that it will, and it&#x27;s nice to know I don&#x27;t have to worry about the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for the record, the battery does seem to last the quoted 45 minutes. For me that&#x27;s around 2 1/2 shaves, though - not the 7 shaves manufacturers like to claim. I don&#x27;t know anyone who shaves that fast! Technically you could, but not very well. So realistically for me the battery lasts one day, as all cordless shavers would. But it&#x27;s peace of mind to be able to plug in and shave if needed - if, for example, I forget to charge one night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the moment this is by far the best deal for a foil shaver with an included cleaning system - almost all the others are priced over the century mark, and I can&#x27;t see how they&#x27;d do anything much better than this shaver. I&#x27;m extremely happy that I bought mine. It&#x27;s one of those purchases I only regret not making earlier.</li>
            <li> Dont meet my espectation</li>
            <li> Okay, my Braun is brand new, out of the box and I&#x27;ve never used an electric razor, before this time. I used it on my dry face and I was pleased, but not completely satisfied; however, I used some shave oil and it cut very close. I think tomorrow that I will get some pre-electric shave and that it will do very well. My beard grows in so many different directions that a straight razor cuts well, but, even when I have a professional barber give me a hot shave, he does not do as well as the Braun, which was held in my unprofessional hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun foil shavers for about 15 years. I bought this one because my old Braun Activator 8000 Series shaver recently broke after many years of great service.  This is easily the worst Braun i&#x27;ve ever owned. Here&#x27;s why it&#x27;s bad for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me:  daily shaver, fine hair (but grows in reasonably thick), random patches of growth (soul patch, side burns, chin patch)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complaints:&lt;br /&gt;- Have to make many passes before i get a close shave.  Probably takes about 50% longer than my last Braun.&lt;br /&gt;- While i&#x27;m shaving, i frequently feel tugs of hairs getting snagged, and after the shave my skin feels pretty irritated.  I can have a slight burning sensation for a few hours after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;- The head is about 50% wider than my last Braun, with a big gap in the middle of the foils.  This makes it very awkward to shave tight spaces like my upper lip and between hair patches.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m lazy with buying the cleaning fluid refills, so with my old Braun i only ran the cleaner once a week or so so i wouldn&#x27;t go through the fluid so fast.  But in order to charge this unit in the stand, you *have* to run the cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;- Sometimes I travel for weeks at a time, during which i&#x27;ll clean my razor manually.  Old Braun was easy to clean with a brush, this one seems fairly difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, very disappointed.  I think if you shave your whole face daily, have fine hair / light growth, a big upper lip, and are okay with buying lots of cleaning fluid, this unit would be fine.  If not, I recommend against it.</li>
            <li> My old Braun got to be about 12 years old, and on battery it would only run about 50% speed, so the shaving was poor, but it still worked ok plugged in, although it didn&#x27;t shave as well as when it was new. Anyway, got this one from Ebay for $50 brand new still in the box, and have been using it for about 10 days now. At first it didn&#x27;t shave that great, I had to make multiple passes to get rid of the stubble,but it seems to be getting better every day. After all, it does say in the instructions to give it 3 weeks to adjust to your face,so there you go. Overall, not quite as good as the last one, but if they still made it, it would be a $200+ razor.</li>
            <li> It works well. I still like a blade for trimming sideburns. The fact that I can use it in the shower was the reason for buying it.</li>
