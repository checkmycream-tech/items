            <li>Living Grace is my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this fragrent to smell fresh.</li>
            <li>It is similar to a shower/shampoo scent, it&#x27;s not bad but it could use a bit more complexity.</li>
            <li>First time i tried it was after my shower, just before getting into bed with freshly laundered linens.</li>
            <li>It is a very soft clean fresh fragrent.</li>

            <li>All of Philosophy&#x27;s products are high quality!</li>
            <li>I felt very feminine, even wearing one of my husbands t-shirts.</li>
            <li>It has a clean lasting scent with a non greasy feel.</li>
            <li>Particularly their fragrances.  </li>
            <li>I sure wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li>Only Philosophy scent I really like.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a very casual school/home scent this would be it, but if you&#x27;re looking for something more complex I would strongly recommend Inner Grace or Amazing Grace.</li>

            <li> Very happy with this scent. I wanted a clean smell. I get compliments on it a lot.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, is because I can&#x27;t smell it! Once I apply it, I never smell it again, but I suppose others do bc I&#x27;m told I smell &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Totally recommend this spray.  Perfect companion to the body wash/shampoo.  It has a clean lasting scent with a non greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and lasting scent.</li>
