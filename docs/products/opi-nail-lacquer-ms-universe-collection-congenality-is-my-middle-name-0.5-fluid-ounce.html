            <li>However with shopping online and going off by an image is all you can do and hope for the best.</li>
            <li>Its awesome!</li>
            <li>OPI is the best nailpolish out there!</li>

            <li>The colors and quality are great, as always, and they arrived promptly and packaged well</li>
            <li>This was a great color of polish for the holidays.</li>
            <li>but I tried it and loved it.</li>
            <li>I have always loved OPI brand.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will look just as good on as it does in the bottle.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>goes on nice and easy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many compliments already from this color, and I never realized it had purple undertones until I had my nails done.</li>
            <li>I love OPI, and have no complaints about the product.  </li>
            <li>The polish itself, when fully mixed, is really beautiful!</li>
            <li>So glad I found someone that had it.</li>
            <li>I did end up getting more of a crimson color for the holidays coming up and for fall..</li>
            <li>Love the color, though, and always love OPI products.</li>
            <li>Pleased.</li>
            <li>The best photographic representation that I have seen online is at allthingsnails.com where photos are taken in various levels of light.</li>
            <li>This polish did go on smooth and is shiny. :)</li>
            <li>Awesome quality, and came sooner than expected!</li>
            <li>Great service and cant wait to order more from you in the future!!!</li>
            <li>Luckily I found it here and was able to buy it.</li>
            <li>Congeniality is my Middle Name is a great purple color.  </li>
            <li>dries smooth and glossy.  </li>
            <li>It is very complimentary to anyone.  </li>
            <li>I am a retired cosmetologist who has used opi products for years and I am never disappointed.</li>
            <li>If a polish does not have one that means that the original polish is not in the bottle because the shaker has been dumped out.</li>
            <li>I clean my house &amp; type a lot</li>
            <li>This is a great pinkish red color that has just the right amount of sparkle.  </li>
            <li>The color is not too bright for a professional environment but can be fun fun fun as well!</li>
            <li>color is true to what see in the bottle.</li>
            <li>It covers amazingly well with only two coats and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite color.</li>
            <li>This is not as thick as I thought it would be, but it has a great color and looks good with a double coat.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mostly reviewing the color, and that is personal opinion.  </li>
            <li>will give it that pretty glossy look.</li>
            <li>When I compared the color of the ordered polish to a bottle that is known to be genuinely OPI, the color was clearly off.</li>
            <li>The stock photo is not even near a true representation.</li>
            <li>Very fall-ish IMHO.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>After getting the polish the color was not what I expected and hoped for something better.</li>
            <li>other then the color, I love OPI, will continue to buy..</li>
            <li>Other colors I&#x27;ve ordered has left me lucky and I&#x27;ve been  satisfied.</li>
            <li>Again, this will stain the skin next to your nails; it is important to clean up while you manicure if your hand is not steady.</li>
            <li>It has a very purple undertone that can only be seen in intense light, but I would not call this \\&quot;magenta\\&quot; more than a deep, deep red with magenta undertones.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Congeniality is my Middle Name\\&quot; (deep magenta with almost purple shine, small sparkles): This color is absolutely beautiful.</li>
            <li>I Love this color and its long lasting.</li>
            <li>Like the previous reviewer described so well, it is a bright reddish pink with purple and sparkly undertones.</li>
            <li>I never expected I would like it so much.</li>
            <li>Only after about 5 minutes of shaking and rolling the bottle, is it ready for use.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product and when it was received the polish was completely separated.</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of my new favorites and I would repurchase in a heart beat.</li>
            <li>Go easy and you must use a base coat with these red polishes and a top coat like Seche Vite</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, but is a little on the thin side just like China Glaze ruby pumps and can spill onto your cuticles if you put too much on the brush.</li>

            <li> To my dismay, it was a limited edition.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like wearing dark colors, pain to get off the polish, so I only wear the dark in the holiday season.  </li>
            <li> REALLY ruins this polish for me</li>
            <li> so not worth it</li>
            <li> is every time I set the bottle down, the golden/purple glitter color settles at the bottom, and is really difficult to mix back into the polish.</li>
            <li> It took 4 coats for the color to come on right and the worst part the handle broke off..</li>
            <li> This is a very hard colour to find.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s weird,</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s this weird looking purple,</li>
            <li> Just wish this color would have been a 5 star :(</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had so many compliments already from this color, and I never realized it had purple undertones until I had my nails done. This is my new favorite color. I never expected I would like it so much. Like the previous reviewer described so well, it is a bright reddish pink with purple and sparkly undertones. I love it!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Congeniality is my Middle Name\\&quot; (deep magenta with almost purple shine, small sparkles): This color is absolutely beautiful. The best photographic representation that I have seen online is at allthingsnails.com where photos are taken in various levels of light. It has a very purple undertone that can only be seen in intense light, but I would not call this \\&quot;magenta\\&quot; more than a deep, deep red with magenta undertones. My friend grabbed this up the night I received it to have her toes painted this color at her next pedicure. I am not a \\&quot;magenta\\&quot; person but I tried it and loved it. The color is not too bright for a professional environment but can be fun fun fun as well! Again, this will stain the skin next to your nails; it is important to clean up while you manicure if your hand is not steady. The color will transfer off nails onto paper but a day-later application of topcoat should be sufficient to extend the life of the color at the tips of your nails.</li>
            <li> I love OPI, and have no complaints about the product.  I&#x27;m mostly reviewing the color, and that is personal opinion.  Congeniality is my Middle Name is a great purple color.  Very fall-ish IMHO.  It&#x27;s got some berry and some fuschia tints, too.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> The polish itself, when fully mixed, is really beautiful! I have no complaints about the complexity of color or consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What REALLY ruins this polish for me is every time I set the bottle down, the golden/purple glitter color settles at the bottom, and is really difficult to mix back into the polish. Only after about 5 minutes of shaking and rolling the bottle, is it ready for use. I&#x27;ve never had such a problem with any other OPI polish, or others in this collection--just this one.</li>
            <li> you have to shake it for approx. 4 min in order to get to color its suppose to be.</li>
            <li> I am a retired cosmetologist who has used opi products for years and I am never disappointed. The colors and quality are great, as always, and they arrived promptly and packaged well</li>
            <li> I got this color at a salon and wanted to buy it. To my dismay, it was a limited edition. Luckily I found it here and was able to buy it. I Love this color and its long lasting. I&#x27;d buy again in a heart beat.</li>
            <li> This polish is absolutely beautiful in the bottle and on the nails. The stock photo is not even near a true representation. It is a deep, blue based red with purple microshimmer. There&#x27;s enough shimmer to give the red a purple hue (no chunky glitter and it is NOT tacky like another review said). This is definitely one of my new favorites and I would repurchase in a heart beat. Goes on easily, but is a little on the thin side just like China Glaze ruby pumps and can spill onto your cuticles if you put too much on the brush. Go easy and you must use a base coat with these red polishes and a top coat like Seche Vite will give it that pretty glossy look. I can&#x27;t stop looking at my nails!</li>
            <li> This is a very hard colour to find. So glad I found someone that had it. My other bottle broke. :o(</li>
            <li> I have always loved OPI brand. One thing is this color wasn&#x27;t what I thought, I was looking for a deep red for the holidays, it&#x27;s weird, in my house it looks deep red, then when I go outside it&#x27;s this weird looking purple, other then the color, I love OPI, will continue to buy.. I did end up getting more of a crimson color for the holidays coming up and for fall.. I don&#x27;t like wearing dark colors, pain to get off the polish, so I only wear the dark in the holiday season.  This polish did go on smooth and is shiny. :)</li>
            <li> After getting the polish the color was not what I expected and hoped for something better. However with shopping online and going off by an image is all you can do and hope for the best. Other colors I&#x27;ve ordered has left me lucky and I&#x27;ve been  satisfied. Just wish this color would have been a 5 star :(</li>
            <li> This is a great pinkish red color that has just the right amount of sparkle.  It is very complimentary to anyone.  It covers amazingly well with only two coats and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> Its awesome! Once you put it on it stays on for 1 week without chipping. I clean my house &amp; type a lot and it still doesn&#x27;t chip. OPI is the best nailpolish out there!</li>
            <li> stocking stuffer for GF.  she loves it.  goes on nice and easy.  dries smooth and glossy.  color is true to what see in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I gave this polish four stars because I haven&#x27;t put it on yet. Hopefully it will look just as good on as it does in the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is not as thick as I thought it would be, but it has a great color and looks good with a double coat.  We gave this to our daughter for Christmas, and she loves it!</li>
            <li> It took 4 coats for the color to come on right and the worst part the handle broke off.. so not worth it</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and when it was received the polish was completely separated. When I went to shack this product to mix the polish there was no rattle from the shaker ball. All OPI nail polishes contain a metal ball that helps to mix the polish. If a polish does not have one that means that the original polish is not in the bottle because the shaker has been dumped out. When I compared the color of the ordered polish to a bottle that is known to be genuinely OPI, the color was clearly off. I would not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Awesome quality, and came sooner than expected! Great service and cant wait to order more from you in the future!!!</li>
            <li> Bottle that was shipped to me shows signs of having sat on the shelf for a while.  Also had leaked at some point.  Love the color, though, and always love OPI products.</li>
            <li> Pleased. This was a great color of polish for the holidays. and it still work for the rest of the year.</li>
