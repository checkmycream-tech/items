            <li>Another great mascara by Maybelline!</li>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>Happy eyes are the best.</li>
            <li>Fairly priced&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a good job of elongating and volumizing my lashes.  </li>
            <li>I guess, so this mascara is good for many people.  </li>
            <li>It does a nice job of thickening my lashes.</li>
            <li>The flexible brush makes it very easy to apply to all lashes.</li>
            <li>The price was great, and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>My granddaughters love these mascaras.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better mascaras out there, but this is my go-to.</li>
            <li>Love the brush.</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love to save money</li>
            <li>I bought this mascara because my favorite one is no longer being made.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it has something to do with the non-flaking factors.  </li>
            <li>There are much better mascara&#x27;s out there in this price range.</li>
            <li>I love that this mascara is easy to apply and not clumpy.</li>
            <li>it shipped fast, good price and all...</li>
            <li>It may work fine if you have thicker eye lashes.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been like a queen before my friends and comments are fabulous</li>
            <li>This mascara does fantastic.</li>
            <li>The wand itself is very, very flexible (I do not like this, but I&#x27;m sure some prefer it).  </li>
            <li>Have fun with this mascara!</li>
            <li>It is the same kind at the drug store but cheaper!</li>
            <li>Washes off easily yet stays in place even in hot humid weather, no raccoon eyes.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t look super haggard.</li>
            <li>No that much volume and dries out in days!!</li>
            <li>Works great, but I&#x27;ve gotten a couple recently with a very low quanity of mascara in it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the gel formula, it&#x27;s gentle on your lashes and leaves them soft after application.</li>
            <li>I most definitely won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras, I have long lashes.</li>
            <li>The brush is kind of big and clunky and doesn&#x27;t really work for the little bottom eyelashes, but works well for the top.</li>
            <li>The only thing is, I only wear mascara very rarely for special occasions, so I don&#x27;t know how this mascara is good for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>I put my mascara on by placing the wand against my lashes and basically blinking so it really separates and extends my lashes.</li>
            <li>Very clumpy, would not get again.</li>
            <li>is very watery.</li>
            <li>and I love that the green and the violet are still mostly black with just the right touch of color.</li>
            <li>It is soft, non clumpy, and gives volume.</li>
            <li>If you have very short, thin lashes, this product may be a bit too heavy, or just perfect.  </li>
            <li>Just to let you know,the other Maybelline mascaras (purple, yellow) in this Volume Express line all work pretty much the same, so go for the color</li>
            <li>The mascara itself is ok, but the wand is really tough to work with.  </li>

            <li> I really like this mascara because it is very dark black and it makes my eyelashes very long and thick.  I have naturally average eyelashes I guess, so this mascara is good for many people.  The only thing is, I only wear mascara very rarely for special occasions, so I don&#x27;t know how this mascara is good for everyday use.  If you have very short, thin lashes, this product may be a bit too heavy, or just perfect.  Just to let you know,the other Maybelline mascaras (purple, yellow) in this Volume Express line all work pretty much the same, so go for the color you like, I don&#x27;t know.  Have fun with this mascara!</li>
            <li> Works great, but I&#x27;ve gotten a couple recently with a very low quanity of mascara in it.</li>
            <li> Another great mascara by Maybelline!</li>
            <li> It was actually what I was looking for gifts&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been like a queen before my friends and comments are fabulous&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> I LOVE the gel formula, it&#x27;s gentle on your lashes and leaves them soft after application. There&#x27;s just too little product in the tube!</li>
            <li> Washes off easily yet stays in place even in hot humid weather, no raccoon eyes.  The flexible brush makes it very easy to apply to all lashes.</li>

            <li> I really like this mascara. It does a nice job of thickening my lashes. The price was great, and the shipping was fast. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My granddaughters love these mascaras.  They picked them out and I sent them to their house.  Happy eyes are the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better mascaras out there, but this is my go-to. Occasionally I buy a different mascara, but I usually end up coming back to this one. Love the brush.</li>
            <li> Great! It is the same kind at the drug store but cheaper! Who doesn&#x27;t love to save money I will order again</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate this mascara. First off, the wand it comes with has that weird flimsy bend part in it which makes it impossible to really get it into your eye lashes. I put my mascara on by placing the wand against my lashes and basically blinking so it really separates and extends my lashes. This wand will not allow you do to that. Second, it was ALWAYS rubs off around the outer corner of my eyes (on the bottom) halfway through my day and I have to go and wipe it off so I don&#x27;t look super haggard. Anyway, I will never, ever buy this mascara again.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Fairly priced&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Wand- design of the wand is horrendous&lt;br /&gt;2. Rubs off onto your eyes and makes you look scary</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras, I have long lashes. All of them clumped even though they said they defined.  This mascara does fantastic. One coat and I&#x27;m done. It is soft, non clumpy, and gives volume. My daughter likes it too.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara because my favorite one is no longer being made.  It goes on well.  The wand itself is very, very flexible (I do not like this, but I&#x27;m sure some prefer it).  It does a good job of elongating and volumizing my lashes.  However, and this is the biggest factor causing me to dislike it, it smears.  All. Day. Long.  I&#x27;ve never had an issue with any other mascara doing this.  I have to check myself in the mirror often when I&#x27;m wearing this mascara because it randomly ends up smeared UNDER my eyes (I do not apply it to my bottom lashes, ever.) I&#x27;m sure it has something to do with the non-flaking factors.  But I&#x27;d rather a few flakes occasionally than random, numerous smears all day.  I will probably request a refund and research other mascaras.  I most definitely won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Very clumpy, would not get again. Used once and will not use again. Makes eyelashes look horrible. There are much better mascara&#x27;s out there in this price range.</li>
            <li> I was not real happy with this mascara.  It goes on to thick for my taste.  It may work fine if you have thicker eye lashes.</li>
            <li> No that much volume and dries out in days!!</li>
            <li> it shipped fast, good price and all... BUT the actual product I&#x27;m not impressed, it does nothing to my lashes and the formula is very watery. this isn&#x27;t a volumizing mascara at all.</li>
            <li> Gives volume and length all in one. The brush is kind of big and clunky and doesn&#x27;t really work for the little bottom eyelashes, but works well for the top. Looks dramatic but not crunchy and harsh like some mascaras. No smudging (even with the non waterproof version).</li>
            <li> I love that this mascara is easy to apply and not clumpy. I have it in black, as well as green and violet and I love that the green and the violet are still mostly black with just the right touch of color.</li>
