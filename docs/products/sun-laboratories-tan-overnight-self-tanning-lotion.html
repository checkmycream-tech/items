            <li>but I am so happy with the results.</li>
            <li>The color is still great, no orange at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the color is great.</li>
            <li>It gives a great color on my arms, legs, and chest but it looks splotchy on my hands and feet and fades faster.</li>
            <li>This product works great.  </li>
            <li>Works great with no smell.</li>
            <li>This greatly evens out skin tone.</li>
            <li>I am experienced with these products and my description of use</li>
            <li>If you use it sparingly it&#x27;s great.</li>

            <li>This product is great for an overnight tan.  </li>
            <li>but besides that, it worked great.  </li>

            <li>That&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>The good thing about the overnight self tanner is that it has a color so you can see where you are putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I read about this product on Pinterest (visit [...] to see how to apply this product her blog is AMAZING)</li>
            <li>I loved that the lotion is tinted so that you can see where you have applied and make sure you have it all rubbed in.</li>
            <li>Honestly I couldn&#x27;t smell anything</li>
            <li>I really liked the color with this product.</li>
            <li>fair tone skin and most self tanning products make me look like a nacho cheese dorito, but not this stuff.  </li>
            <li>But if you take the time to apply it correctly, it is a nice hue and not that funky orange</li>
            <li>But, it is kind of streaky</li>
            <li>Nice, even color.</li>
            <li>and I liked it...</li>
            <li>It looks like a nice tan.</li>
            <li>It also smells really nice like almond &amp; shea butter lotion.</li>
            <li>I love how it immediately produces a good color.</li>
            <li>This self tan smells great and glides on nice, very nice natural tan.</li>
            <li>This product does give a great color and quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Reviews were pretty good!</li>
            <li>I will most def be looking into more products from this company!</li>
            <li>the color is good and the application is smooth, not streaky.</li>
            <li>The color it gives you is natural and the best part about this product.</li>
            <li>Best self tanner&lt;br /&gt;great natural color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far</li>
            <li>Best tanning lotion by far.</li>
            <li>This gives a wonderful natural glow without any orangey-ness.</li>
            <li>and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the BEST i have found i have used tons of store bought (they dont work)&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt streak as long as you rub it in good..</li>
            <li>Easy to blend and not &amp;#34;orangey&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li>it was easy to apply and had no streaks!  </li>
            <li>This works just as well as the original one I loved.  </li>
            <li>It actually really does smell good!</li>
            <li>I was intimidated at first, worried about getting it perfect, but now even on my face I can quickly apply.</li>
            <li>I have very light skin (my mom is a redhead)</li>
            <li>The scent is very light and has none of that \\&quot;cooked potatoes\\&quot; smell that lots of others do.  </li>
            <li>The cream dries quickly and smells good.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use with a nice tan result.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you have super oily skin, this product is good, but I&#x27;m unimpressed.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and provides a good, medium coverage that isn&#x27;t orange.</li>
            <li>The one positive was it did in fact give me a desired amount of tan, but otherwise it wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>I got many compliments on my tan, no one knew it was self-tanner.</li>
            <li>I love the shade it turns my skin.</li>
            <li>Not only does it give you a nice even tan ,its not streaky!!!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a self-tanner that actually smells good, does not leave streaks, and works immediately, this is a great choice.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t have that smell that most self tanners have.</li>
            <li>and this is the next best thing to paying for spray tans.</li>
            <li>product doesn&#x27;t stink like most sunless tanners or clog my pores.</li>
            <li>love this product</li>
            <li>It gave a lovely color, but if you&#x27;re looking for a more noticeable difference I would go for one of the darker shades. :)</li>
            <li>and I love that.</li>
            <li>It looks like a healthy tan.</li>
            <li>love the fact that it has the color guide.</li>
            <li>I really thought this lotion was going to be great</li>
            <li>It looked ok on him</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many self tanners over the years</li>
            <li>learned real quick you need to wear gloves when putting this stuff on.  </li>
            <li>I mix it with body lotion to make it blend better and that helped.</li>
            <li>Most self-tanners will make you smell.</li>
            <li>Through my own research, seeing a dermatologist, and esthetician I have made a huge difference in my skins</li>
            <li>I was able to rub it into my skin evenly with no streaks.</li>
            <li>I love the color of this product.</li>
            <li>I love that I can just put it on before bed</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>

            <li>I also didn&#x27;t use on my face, I did use up my neck and throat, but avoided my face just to be safe.</li>

            <li>When you get the medium one you look more orange</li>
            <li>Self Tanners are they really safe?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I seriously love this product.</li>
            <li>and I must say there are many...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many compliments from the girls at work</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many others and this one is a favorite.</li>
            <li>(just be sure to shave before applying</li>
            <li>and I get so many comments like &amp;#34;did</li>
            <li>and they turned out ok</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>More like a walnut stain.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite self tanner for body</li>
            <li>Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li>Remember this is a gradual building product you have to use it more than once to get to the color you want.</li>
            <li>I like this product better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Make sure to wash your hands immediately, cause it tends to stain your palms a lot.</li>
            <li>The smell at first is pleasant but as the tan develops that sunless tan smell will come on.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easy and easy to spread!</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it has pretty good reviews and also because the price on AMAZON is better then most places.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>Then I lather on the Sun Labs, and have beautiful, soft, tan skin for about 5-7 days.</li>
            <li>At first it looked good then within two or three days</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so excited I found this tanner!  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to tell where coverage is, and where spots are that need more lotion.</li>
            <li>This way, it spreads on with the lotion, way more easily.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, however the resulting color was really streaky and splotchy.</li>
            <li>I spent a lot of time researching the best self tanning lotions and this always came up in the top 3 for every blogger out there</li>
            <li>Loved the tint it left on my fair skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does a great job at making skin look naturally young and healthy and minimizing imperfections.</li>
            <li>Be sure to carefully wash hands immediately after application (baking soda works great!)</li>
            <li>The smell did develop more as the product set overnight, I woke up and did not smell too great, but it is worth it for the beautiful dark color.</li>
            <li>I am very fair with strawberry blond hair and the white skin that goes with it.</li>
            <li>The color is great so far.</li>
            <li>, it just makes me look like I have a nice healthy glow which is exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light olive-y complexion, and this makes me look as if I&#x27;ve been at the beach for a week - healthy, sunkissed and not orange at all.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It gives you a great tan that looks natural.</li>
            <li>but it is a good filler until you get a real tan.</li>
            <li>do notice a mild warm smell 3-4 hours after using the tanner, but doing a quick shower or rinse as early as 4 hours after use, will eliminate the smell, and still leave a beautiful tan.</li>
            <li>Very nice, natural looking color.</li>
            <li>Overall, the color is good and it&#x27;s tinted so you can tell if you miss a spot!</li>
            <li>No ugly orange!</li>
            <li>It would rub off really super easy!</li>
            <li>Easy to blend in</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost a self-tanner virgin, and this was so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>but it does wash off easy</li>
            <li>It tints your skin VERY quickly.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply...definitely wear gloves.</li>
            <li>Goes on evenly and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Goes on even and easy....</li>
            <li>so Its easy to see where you put it.</li>
            <li>but that is easy to fix.</li>
            <li>If u like self tanners get fake bake flawless and be happy</li>
            <li>It DOES give the skin a foul odor, but it gives a great color quickly, and it looks natural for the most part.</li>
            <li>so you can see what parts are yet to be blended it, making even application easy) and dries immediately</li>
            <li>It smells like cherries , is easy to rub on and in and it doesn&#x27;t streak if put on evenly.</li>
            <li>It will wash off - but not as easily as I would like.</li>
            <li>Use a strong soap, and add some baking soda</li>
            <li>Studies have shown that some parabens can MIMIC ESTROGEN in the body, though the FDA asserts that parabens are safe because their estrogenic activity is much lower than the body&#x27;s own estrogen.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>, this is a really good high quality product.</li>
            <li>But it also comes off fairly easily and is very easy to streak if you don&#x27;t do it the right way.</li>
            <li>so when i got this i was thrilled cause first off</li>
            <li>People walking by you will not notice it but it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the new Jergens sunless tanning -</li>
            <li>and it looks fine.</li>
            <li>I thought oh, I&#x27;ll be fine</li>
            <li>It will super stain the palms of your hands!</li>
            <li>The product leaves a nice tan immediately, doesn&#x27;t last too too long, but is perfect when you want that quick tan on the go!!</li>
            <li>I have used many self-tanners in the past, but his one is by far the best, most effective product I have used.</li>
            <li>Make sure you exfoliate first!</li>
            <li>It was darker than I expected so if you are very fair skinned buy the lightest.</li>
            <li>About the free shipping.</li>
            <li>so you get free shipping on anything you buy for a year</li>
            <li>BUT, this is such a great product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been tanning all year but have sat in the sun a couple times just to get lightly toasted.</li>
            <li>I have also used cheap plastic/latex gloves (snatched from my dr office</li>
            <li>Overall a great product.  </li>
            <li>have a light tanner odor, but all in all not bad&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Do not take lightly the discoloration of your hands.</li>
            <li>Great product overall!</li>
            <li>I thought the \\&quot;medium\\&quot; would look too light or not make a difference</li>
            <li>It had a light smell to it</li>
            <li>It fades out so evenly and smoothly that still no one can notice you used a tanner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sticking to my cheap drugstore brand self tanner that doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful but it felt like it took way to long to receive the results I wanted.</li>
            <li>As someone who absolutely CANNOT tan, I love this stuff and get so many compliments on my appearance (not on the tan itself) when using this product.</li>
            <li>This product gives me a gorgeous, incredibly natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>It has a good, natural looking color&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first, it goes on super dark which helps you blend it in completely, resulting in a perfectly even, streak-free, beautiful tan.  </li>
            <li>I rate this product right up there at the top.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like its rubbed in evenly at first, DONT FREAK OUT!!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about it, it&#x27;s easy to put on and produces a GREAT color, I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>You will have to reapply every 3-4 days to maintain the tan, but it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a but pricey for the amount that you get but totally worth it!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad this was the first one I tried.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li>I used gloves as most had recommended and it turned out really well!  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the cost!</li>
            <li>I read the other reviews for this product, I liked the price and took a chance, and I was glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>Then blend those areas a bit with a clean sponge.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly light skin that burns quickly in the sun, then peels, and I get no visible tan.</li>
            <li>Get clean, exfoliated and well moisturized ahead of time.</li>
            <li>But this lotion really creates a great color that compliments my natural skin tone.</li>
            <li>It did come off on my sheets, but the sheets came clean.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is pleasant upon application but develops the same funky smell all the tanning products get once</li>
            <li>I am very pale and this product is wonderful!!</li>
            <li>but if you get the dark tanning kind it has a greenish olive undertone which makes for a more believable tan.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice natural looking tan (no orange)!</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to try it out!.</li>
            <li>As with most self tanners, the results are largely in part to your application techniques</li>
            <li>It looks just like the spray tans that you get at tanning salons, only better because you can cover your feet and hands more accurately.</li>
            <li>The smell really is minimal, and the color is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rather thick cream and smells so good!!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff, works like a champ and dries fast on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought this based on reviews and it has truely made my &amp;#34;bare legged&amp;#34; summers a dream.  </li>
            <li>The color was ok on my arms and very blotchy on my legs.</li>
            <li>Warm, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>well it really doesnt streak more like blotchy looking if&lt;br /&gt;you dont blend it</li>
            <li>The hue wasn&#x27;t as natural as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I have red hair and fair skin.  </li>
            <li>There is no bad odor when you apply it.  </li>
            <li>but it was not a bad and no one said anything.</li>
            <li>Just be sure that you spread it out evenly &amp; quickly as it drys fast and the color is immediate.</li>
            <li>It has a strong almond/cherry smell at first</li>
            <li>Looked very natural and easy to apply!</li>
            <li>and at first it looked like it would come out fine</li>
            <li>HANDS QUICKLY</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because of the fact that the color fades quickly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found that spray tans (I&#x27;ve tried Mystic Tan and VersaSpa) leave me super</li>
            <li>Smell is minimal and tolerable and it leaves a nice even tan that isn&#x27;t orange and lasts longer than most.</li>
            <li>And you have to be quick to wash your hands vigorously after application.  </li>
            <li>This is the most realistic tan color from a sunless tanning product I have ever gotten.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>so quick rubbing is a must.</li>
            <li>Took a quick shower</li>
            <li>this is a good product, a good review coming from someone who was addicted to tanning beds.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also fades quickly so need to reapply about every 3 days</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it for those special events</li>
            <li>I am very fair, light hair and blue eyes and WHITE skin.</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion is okay, I thought from other reviews that it would be amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is not bad but make sure you get the dark tanning kind.</li>
            <li>It goes on without that sticky smelly mess of most self tanners, and smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li>After I trued a lil less it was great.</li>
            <li>After the first time, I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
            <li>I will totally be ordering more!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>So far this one is the best of any I have previously tried.  </li>
            <li>I found this product to have a great color, but thought it came on a little streaky at times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned and was nervous about it adding too much color or being orange, but it adds just enough of a tan to look natural but not draw too much attention, so I have a light tan color all through the winter.</li>
            <li>When the weather is nice enough for shorts but your tan is fading so fast you don&#x27;t feel comfortable in shorts.</li>
            <li>may sound simpler than it really is for a novice.</li>
            <li>I found that I had to rub a towel gently on my skin to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>I am very fair-skinned and don&#x27;t enjoy tanning beds.</li>
            <li>Definitely more of a natural brown than orange.  </li>
            <li>It gives a great natural looking tan without the orange cast you sometimes get with similar products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s useful as a guide to see where you&#x27;ve already applied it.  </li>
            <li>This product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>One of the most natural looking tan from a self tanning lotion that I have found...</li>
            <li>product is fresh</li>
            <li>But I still say the color you get is worth it.</li>
            <li>and WOW it worked SO much better.</li>
            <li>This tan stuff is worth over what i paid for</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I was so impressed by the results that I decided to do another application and put a thin layer on my tummy and arms.</li>
            <li>Gives nice instant and gradual color.</li>
            <li>This tanner gives me a nice natural color, more brown than golden and definitely not orange.</li>
            <li>I bought this one recently after hearing great reviews on it, and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a number of reviews for other self tanning lotions and I&#x27;ve tried many of them, but this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used, I&#x27;ll never go back to another brand.</li>
            <li>Great for pale skin.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do when my other favorite brand was out of stock.</li>
            <li>It was very streaky  and unless you apply it super quick, which i like to take my time, you&#x27;ll end up looking like a zebra with all the stripes.</li>
            <li>I have VERY fair skin, I have seriously tried tons of product/tanning beds.</li>
            <li>it is much cheaper and keeps the tan looking very natural! :)</li>
            <li>I get instant gratification and I am able to get the amount of &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; just right!</li>
            <li>I did not use gloves, I didn&#x27;t need to because it came right off my hands when I washed them.</li>
            <li>but it washes right out.  </li>
            <li>I put it on at night right after I showered and exfoliated, and washed it off in the morning for those wondering about its application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can see a noticeable difference in your skin tone right away</li>
            <li>but so far I am excited to see how this product works!</li>
            <li>Great for those of us who want to wear sandals on vacation but would like a little color before we get to our sunny destination!</li>
            <li>Applies easily, non-streaky, very natural looking, did not rub off on clothing  Cons:</li>
            <li>Make sure to rub it in really well and wash your hands very very frequently</li>
            <li>Lol I had a small moment of panic when trying to wash it off.</li>
            <li>I have a light olive skin tone and my husband is white white and the product looked good on both.  </li>
            <li>My favorite self tanner is Fake Bake Flawless, but the color takes more applications to get as dark as this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a redhead and very fair skinned and a mature woman and have always had trouble with sunless products.  </li>
            <li>For all you self tanners that don&#x27;t use your hands to simply avoid the orange palms I have recently picked up a great trick:  put a squirt of hand soap and a bit of whitening toothpaste on a wash cloth when you are done with the application and scrub the insides of your hands/ fingers.  </li>
            <li>The lotion has a somewhat runny consistency that is easy to apply evenly, and you can clearly see where you&#x27;ve applied.</li>
            <li>, it will wash off, or rub off after a nice, long hot shower.  </li>
            <li>I am a blonde with really fair skin and this product looks really natural on me.</li>
            <li>In the morning I had a very natural, streak-free, light bronze tan.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Now I have to decide if I&#x27;ll get more of this or my other fav brand when it comes available.</li>
            <li>It gives me a beautiful healthy glow, it&#x27;s not super dark</li>
            <li>There is a good amount of preparation needed and time invested  to avoid a splotchy mess as I found out on my first try.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to find a product that (so far) leaves my skin golden rather than orange.</li>
            <li>I used to swear by the Faux tanner byb bare minerals until they recently changed their formula to paraben free, the new one is just not as good</li>
            <li>This is my first time using tanning lotion and after reading a lot of reviews for this product and others, I decided to go for it.</li>
            <li>This is my first review on Amazon...</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time yesterday..</li>
            <li>I would recommend exfoliating first...</li>
            <li>this is my first one.</li>
            <li>Other than that I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>so u can see exactly where u are putting it.</li>
            <li>Also it doesnt leave a weird smell, which is GREAT!</li>
            <li>: I would recommend putting hand lotion on your palms first before applying so that it doesn&#x27;t dye your hands.</li>
            <li>First of all this will most definitely stain your hands so wear gloves.  </li>
            <li>This stuff has a greenish tint to the bronzer when you first apply it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Turns your hands brown if you don&#x27;t use a mitt because it dries so darn fast!</li>
            <li>/&gt;You definitely want to make sure to apply this at night and take a shower in the morning.</li>
            <li>It seemed streaky at first</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>with hot water and soap</li>
            <li>I first applied after a shower at night and</li>
            <li>That works too ;)</li>
            <li>You apply it and there is instant color that develops even more throughout the night (or day, whenever you apply it).</li>
            <li>I realized i needed to lotion first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BE AWARE it WILLLLLL stain your hands</li>
            <li>/&gt;WIll DEF be buying alot more in the future..</li>
            <li>I got this self tanner based on other reviews on Amazon and I love it!  </li>
            <li>Love the color, last about 2-3 days even with showering.</li>
            <li>The main issue with this (aside from the time consumption) is that I don&#x27;t have adequate lighting in my spare bathroom shower (and I can&#x27;t do it in the master bath because we have grout and tile in there</li>
            <li>I will update with more results later if I think about it</li>
            <li>I do modeling shoots, and I&#x27;ve been exposed to many different forms of lighting.</li>
            <li>When I asked if there was anything they could do to make this better, the company said ship it back</li>
            <li>This product does not turn you orange or smell funny.</li>
            <li>This happened when I moisturized first and also when I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I exfoliated first both times</li>
            <li>What I do to fix this is I first rub lotion, oil, or shea butter all over my body, and after that I put on the tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I love that the instant color lets you know if you&#x27;ve missed a spot.</li>
            <li>My favorite self tanner and the only one I&#x27;ll use!</li>
            <li>so you can see exactly where you are putting it on.</li>
            <li>and I feel so much more confident wearing shorts now that my legs are ghostly pale!</li>
            <li>The jury is still out on how long this will last, but if it&#x27;s only a day or two--I&#x27;ll still be a happy girl!</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is very quick to stain your palms, so be sure to wash your hands as soon as possible after application.</li>
            <li>You really have to be sure you take your time and EVENLY rub this is, especially when doing the backs of your legs.</li>
            <li>The towel trick worked for me though and the extra effort needed to apply it evenly was well worth the fantastic color.</li>
            <li>I was referred to this product through a blog (http://doitandhow.com/2013/03/16/self-tanning-tips/) who also advised that I use it in conjunction with Jergen&#x27;s natural glow to prolong the tan and make it look more natural.</li>
            <li>Product has two positive characteristics:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>I used this lotion with amazing results - even the medium tone isn&#x27;t too dark for me.</li>
            <li>It sets in fast so by the time your done with your arms its pretty well dyed your hands.</li>
            <li>Once I mastered putting it on smoothly, it&#x27;s a nice dark color, but not too orange.</li>
            <li>When first put on there is absolutely no stinky smell as with most self-tanners.  </li>
            <li>I bought this lotion in medium after reading all the great reviews about the extra dark.</li>
            <li>I burn quite easily in tanning beds and being outside.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a quick tan that showed up immediately, looked natural and stayed for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks natural and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Very realistic color, not at all orange.</li>
            <li>Lotion rubs on quite easily (and it&#x27;s actually brown in color</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s so low maintenance and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The tan is very realistic, and lasts a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As with any tanning lotion, be sure to put moisturizer on any dry areas before applying the tanner.</li>
            <li>Good price for a long lasting product.</li>
            <li>and I will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>So...I will certainly continue to use this lotion.</li>
            <li>So...I will certainly continue to use this lotion.</li>
            <li>and my color stays pretty constant, although if I ever want darker color, I just apply more frequently.</li>
            <li>Natural looking tan and no unpleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>I have worked long and hard to fix the damage that has been done to my skin since then, and have been very successful thankfully.</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial smell is fine.</li>
            <li>Make sure to rub it in super fast because it dried fast.</li>
            <li>I applied it the other night before bed, using the gloves as recommended (several pairs came with the product)and woke up in the morning with a beautiful even, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>Make sure to exfoliate and lotion up rough areas before applying.</li>
            <li>It is also very forgiving -</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this product!</li>
            <li>It was really orange.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I never have time, nor do I really care too.</li>
            <li>not at all the golden brown from a natural tan.</li>
            <li>It makes application soooo much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>however, they shipped me the \\&quot;very dark.\\</li>
            <li>I ended up giving mine to my father because he is very tanned.  </li>
            <li>reapply the tanning lotion every 3 days to my whole body and touch up places that fade out faster</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Would recommend really rubbing it thoroughly on your toes, if you&#x27;re doing that area -- I didn&#x27;t &amp; my toes were way darker than the rest of my foot.</li>
            <li>as if perhaps its OLD.You know how you go to a drug store and buy salon products and they are not guarenteed unless you buy them from a real salon.</li>
            <li>So after much though, and research I stumbled upon Sun laboratories.</li>
            <li>I can promise you this absolutely comes out looking brown/tan instead of orange!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This works fast and evenly.  </li>
            <li>The bronzer (which is really helpful for even application) will wash off when you shower</li>
            <li>so I am very iffy about tanning beds.</li>
            <li>It really stains your hands so wear gloves.</li>
            <li>/&gt;you really have to rub it in, its a bit of work</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>If I put the lotion on my whole body (face included)</li>
            <li>You really need to wear gloves with this.</li>
            <li>It dries and sets incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So be ready.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works, so it&#x27;s going to stain your hands.</li>
            <li>You really have to wash your hands thoroughly if you don&#x27;t wear gloves.</li>
            <li>I really like this self tanner because it doesn&#x27;t make your skin look orange.</li>
            <li>Looks like a real tan with no sparkles.</li>
            <li>and I must say, I&#x27;m absolutely smitten with this product.</li>
            <li>REAL.</li>
            <li>but I just used too much.</li>
            <li>Worked very well.</li>
            <li>It goes on very streaky too.</li>
            <li>I literally just opened up the package, and it arrived REALLY fast</li>
            <li>but I really did not like the smell at all</li>
            <li>so it turned my hand very orange.</li>
            <li>mad.&lt;br /&gt;It dries very verryyy fast</li>
            <li>got in the shower exfoliated and then lotioned up my whole</li>
            <li>/&gt;it really looks so natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>no this is like a real tan in a bottle.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t pay for fast shipping again</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how real the tan looks.</li>
            <li>I just wish it will not fade as fast.</li>
            <li>it was very splochy</li>
            <li>I even use it on my face (which is very acne-prone), and I&#x27;ve never had any problems.</li>
            <li>Dries really fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use tanning lotions very often because I can&#x27;t stand the smell of them.</li>
            <li>The color is more brown than orange, and I constantly get compliments about how natural it looks.</li>
            <li>It gives you a hint of color immediately, so you are able to tell right away if you are missing any spots or if it&#x27;s getting streaky.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this and had read a lot of positive reviews on it</li>
            <li>Better then any other brands I have used.</li>
            <li>Most of the other ones I&#x27;ve used &#x27;stay&#x27; on your skin until it fades.  </li>
            <li>With a few simple tricks (like using rubber Playtex gloves to apply, standing in front of a mirror to see what you&#x27;re doing, and rubbing very quickly) I get a gorgeous tan instantly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve applied it several different ways; right after the shower, after a long at day work, under and over other moisturizers..  For me the best way is over a moisturizer applied after the shower.  </li>
            <li>First off it smells great, BUT the smell does wear off and you will have to deal with the fake tanner smell until you take a shower.</li>
            <li>The only thing I can really warn you about is that it will stain your hands, use gloves or a tanning mitt to apply it and make sure to stay away from light colored objects for a little while.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it develops a very strong odor after a couple of hours just like the booth tans do, so I highly recommend that you do it at night so that you can wash it off the next morning!</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s a really dark brown color that streaks easily.</li>
            <li>This self tanner looks very natural, and unlike other self tanners it actually smells good when applied.</li>
            <li>Not too dark and not to light!</li>
            <li>I wore dark clothes to bed just to be safe, but I didn&#x27;t end up with any stains on my clothing or bedsheets.</li>
            <li>it does the job ok but to dark for me</li>
            <li>This always my tried and true, but back to ordering from LA</li>
            <li>I did miss a couple spots on my wrist the first time I did it, but that was complete user error.  </li>
            <li>I love how it goes on dark</li>
            <li>I purchased the medium tint because, again...i am very fair and didn&#x27;t want to look like a dorito!eviews I read on it, i washed my hands with a baking soda/dawn dish soap paste and there are no traces of it left behind.</li>
            <li>Really I look like I live in Mexico..</li>
            <li>There is a greenish hue to the lotion which means you&#x27;re getting more of an olive tan than the typical orange.</li>
            <li>Smells decent.</li>
            <li>I am super white!</li>
            <li>I have tried many of these types of items on my Irish girl skin and this is the ONLY one I will endorse.</li>
            <li>I simply look like I just strolled in off the beach with a light, 100% natural tan.</li>
            <li>Tanned quickly - but still had issues with streaking - used only once b/c of that</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a person with a pale complextion but this stuff brings out a nice natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>Also most tanners leave elbows and knees and ankles a mess.</li>
            <li>Very natural color!</li>
            <li>Use the mirror to double check the coverage before it sets in, because it easily streaks or dries in patches if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion and sellerif</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Before applying I made sure to exfoliate very well and slather dry areas (knees, elbows) in regular lotion.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and it does help extend he life of your tan!!  </li>
            <li>, I put a little on my wrist and the more I rubbed it into my wrist</li>
            <li>This product also lacks the strong &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34; smell so prevalent in other brands.</li>
            <li>The smell is not too strong but still has that &amp;#34;sefl tanner&amp;#34; smell to it like any other.  </li>
            <li>you look sun-kissed!&amp;#34; I do think it has an odor to it, but maybe it isn&#x27;t as strong as some other tanners.</li>
            <li>This really made for a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>but Jergens isn&#x27;t near as fast at tanning.</li>
            <li>I really like the natural color (not orange) that this product gives me.</li>
            <li>That initial darkness fades as soon as you shower into a more natural look, but you need to apply the tan when no one will see you for several hours  -Though</li>
            <li>However, on my skin, the self tan smell is pretty apparent after it starts working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the color it gives me- not orange at all, and the smell is bearable and goes away after a few hours.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t necessarily last long, but no awful odor as with some others.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the extra money compared to Jergen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I find that if you don&#x27;t shower afterwards, it does take on more of that dreaded &amp;#34;self tanner smell&amp;#34; with your body heat, but if you shower a few hours after applying the smell is mitigated, though some of the tan will be washed away</li>
            <li>I normally use Jergens tanning lotion, but thought I would try something else.  </li>
            <li>No icky tanner smell.</li>
            <li>It lasts approximately 2-3 days after a good application (even after showering/swimming).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seriously, within 3 hours my skin was noticeably darker, no streaks, it was super easy to see where you were putting it on</li>
            <li>Before applying, I used plain lotion on my wrists and knees to avoid those parts getting darker, but I thought the tanner is just okay.</li>
            <li>or if you simply have the time to kill to get it right.</li>
            <li>(I use latex gloves as per other reviewers suggestions and it works much better than using your bare hand).</li>
            <li>I like how the product goes on dark, so is easy to get it all evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>used this for my high school reunion, I looked fresh, and tan and had a nice glow without that fake orange coloring.  </li>
            <li>you loofa to remove dead skin first, and then use your favorite moisturizing lotion regularly</li>
            <li>:It showed up immediately and developed a little more after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;GOOD</li>
            <li>It smells nice when applying, and the next day it did smell a little bit corn-chippy, but not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>your new tan!)&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>For a particular event I&#x27;ve been known to apply a coat early morning, rinse after lunch, repeat application, and rinse again after dinner.</li>
            <li>I heard such great things about this product, in reality, its not great.  </li>
            <li>I have applied it a few times since then and each time I get more comfortable and with less mistakes.  </li>
            <li>It gives a subtle tan, just not the kind of tan/darkness</li>
            <li>Still had streaks despite everything I did to try and get it on smoothly, and even though it doesn&#x27;t smell in the bottle I guess the actual change in your skin causes a smell because after about an hour it smelled exactly like every other sunless tanner</li>
            <li>It gives you a very natural look.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not orange-y or streaky at all, just very natural looking</li>
            <li>The color is very natural.  </li>
            <li>Color looks very natural.</li>
            <li>It gives a very natural looking color.</li>
            <li>It looked very natural, not orangey at all.  </li>
            <li>It is very natural, building color.</li>
            <li>I also have to apply it very frequently.</li>
            <li>but if I do get some on them, a little bit of baking soda takes it right off!!</li>
            <li>I usually have pasty white skin that does not tan very easily and this stuff really worked.</li>
            <li>Washes off easy tan does not last long didnt care for this product.</li>
            <li>I have light skin and dark hair</li>
            <li>Sun Labs medium sunless tanning lotion is incredibly natural looking!</li>
            <li>I finally purchased Fake Bake Flawless before vacation last year</li>
            <li>It looks so natural!</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that sometimes it dries a little too quickly, before I&#x27;m able to smooth out all the streaks.</li>
            <li>Plus a helpful hint from another review said a long handle spoon with a wash cloth rubber banded to the spoon part for application to the very center of your back was a great idea.</li>
            <li>Covers great, not streaky and does not smell bad like most other lotions tend to.</li>
            <li>I have tried several other tanning products and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>so I was looking for a new tanner and happened across this one and WOW.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately it does last too long.</li>
            <li>I have gotten a few streaks before, but they were easily remedied by rubbing out with moisturizer.</li>
            <li>-Pleasant smell for a fake tanner  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a few products that worked well for me but had strong odors.  </li>
            <li>The color is very natural (I am fair skinned) but doesn&#x27;t last long so you must apply every few days to keep the color.  </li>
            <li>It still turned out slightly splotchy in parts and the color was only okay.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be left with less bronze but a more natural look.</li>
            <li>By far one of the best self-tanning products I&#x27;ve ever used, and ya girl knows fake tanners!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even think about it, but when it developed, the color was super dark and long lasting where I had already peeled and light everywhere else.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s consistency is more liquid than lotion and is hard to get and even coverage.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like other self tanners and it works quickly.</li>
            <li>Make sure you do your due diligence exfoliating in the shower , I use my Moroccan mitt for that , dry off and start applying the lotion as if it was your body lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tinted so you can be sure not to miss any spots but the lotion has a strange greenish tint to it and where the product overlaps leaves dark lines.  </li>
            <li>I have a natural olive bronzed skin tone and it did not make my skin much darker but just enough to look somewhat sunkissed.</li>
            <li>natural looking tan...</li>
            <li>Looks totally natural.</li>
            <li>I still cant get the color to look natural on my hands and wrists.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re not orange or brown, it&#x27;s a natural looking glowing tan</li>
            <li>The next day I&#x27;m ready for my bikini.</li>
            <li>This stuff gives me a natural color without looking orange or streaky.</li>
            <li>The tan it leaves looks natural and even.</li>
            <li>Gives you a natural looking glow.</li>
            <li>Looks natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased direct from the manufacturer before but figured Amazon would be easier, now I&#x27;m returning.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I have been using the Jergens natural glow lotion because is doesn&#x27;t make be streaky.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised.</li>
            <li>I bought this last summer and it lasted almost through the whole season.  </li>
            <li>have naturally olive tone skin</li>
            <li>Natural looking.</li>
            <li>I am near translucent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried body drench and it was nearly identical in results to the Jergens.</li>
            <li>but so far, I&#x27;m liking it.</li>
            <li>Second not so much.</li>
            <li>, natural looking color&lt;br /&gt;-Develops</li>
            <li>Spreads evenly and looks natural.</li>
            <li>and I have no refund thus far.</li>
            <li>My tan looks natural.</li>
            <li>It gives you a natural looking tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved the color that this product gave me but applying it was difficult.</li>
            <li>As a naturally pale gal with light hair/light eyes, I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market, but hear me when I say...</li>
            <li>And it has the most subtle scent out of any tanner I&#x27;ve used (you have to sniff your arm directly to smell anything, and even that close</li>
            <li>It has a smell, like all fake tans, but it isn&#x27;t super strong.</li>
            <li>I used gloves to apply all over my body (to avoid crazy orange hands), but it&#x27;s supposed to be ok as long as you make sure to wash your hands thoroughly after.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face being careful afterward to use a barely damp cloth to wipe off eyebrows, lightly blot the space between my brows, above the lips (avoid the Lindsey Lohan tan-stach), nose creases, and chin.</li>
            <li>tips are to work quickly, wear gloves, and use a tight weave, soft towel (like a car chamois)to apply.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin a little oily though but not bad.  </li>
            <li>Some other brands wash right off</li>
            <li>I will use for a special occasion if I need color but not for everyday.</li>
            <li>I was very pale when I used this and was extremely pleased with the results after one application, instant tan!</li>
            <li>The product was okay, and for the money, much better than Fake Bake, Mystic Tan and St. Tropez, but it didn&#x27;t entirely fufill my expectations after reading all the other reviews.</li>
            <li>It took a couple of rinses, but eventually my palms went back to normal and didn&#x27;t affect the rest of my tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You see some color instantly, and it develops more over the next few hours.</li>
            <li>It seems to have a more natural base color, more olive than orange.</li>
            <li>So your tan def doesn&#x27;t last long like a real tan, and I don&#x27;t really think it is an actual self tanner?  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too dark either, it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li>Once it really soaks in and your skin feels dry again, you can see the difference.</li>
            <li>I bought this fake tanner because they discontinued my last brand, and this one had good reviews.</li>
            <li>It is a thick cream that is tinted, so you can easily see where you have applied and avoid streaks.  </li>
            <li>Also, I felt like it dried almost too quickly.</li>
            <li>I applied with my bare hands (I knew the risk!)</li>
            <li>I was a little intimidated at first because even the Medium is super dark when you squeeze it out</li>
            <li>I love the dark color, but after you shower in the morning you are losing instantly half of intensity.</li>
            <li>It has a long lasting realistic color, just be prepared with baking soda to get the color off of yours hands!</li>
            <li>The instant tint will wash away when you shower, leaving you with a natural even looking tan, from the DHA.</li>
            <li>It washes and wears off but it&#x27;s really dark at first.</li>
            <li>going back to Jergens Natural Glow...</li>
            <li>Of course you have to be careful about how much you use.  </li>
            <li>My only suggestion is to use gloves when applying and wait until the tan completely fades before reapplying.</li>
            <li>Also, you get a deep and natural color.</li>
            <li>To get a natural glow on your hands and avoid the telltale fake-tan &amp;#34;white hand&amp;#34; syndrome, just squirt a bit onto the back of your hand and massage the backs of your hands together.</li>
            <li>It gives you such a natural looking tan, and it builds well.</li>
            <li>The color this product leaves behind is lovely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a naturally fair skinned person and was afraid any sunless tanner would make me look orange.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pale and this gives me a natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>If not rubbed in completely and allowed to dry completely it will streak.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I would have about it is it stains my palms very quickly...</li>
            <li>so I wipe those areas clean with a damp cloth and do the same with eyelids, zits, and small scars on my face using damp q-tips.</li>
            <li>I applied it with my bare hands and after the initial application it tends to settle into lines that are very apparent.</li>
            <li>I have extremely pale irish skin that won&#x27;t tan on its own, so maybe the color just turned out orangy because of my pale starting complextion.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it says its paraben free, although one of the ingredients is a paraben.</li>
            <li>I have used other fake tanners (lotions, foams, sprays) and am pretty skilled at self-tanning, but all of them eventually fade to orange</li>
            <li>I have been using this self tanner for the past year and a half and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just used the &#x27;very dark&#x27; for the first time</li>
            <li>&quot; I know someone who wants to buy the dark bottle from me</li>
            <li>In a classroom full of students of a range of skin colors/tans, I was noticably (at least to myself)oranger than everyone else.</li>
            <li>Product is ok , but not sure I would buy it again.also a little on the pricey side.</li>
            <li>I have Irish pale freckled skin and have tried MANY different self tanning agents over the past 10 years.</li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde and have been very pale my whole life.</li>
            <li>so I can only blame myself for slight streaking on my wrists where I got my hands too wet right afterwards.</li>
            <li>Much more natural looking tan than other products I&#x27;ve used &amp; definitely streaks less &amp; less darkening on elbows &amp; ankles than other brands.</li>

            <li> The color is still great, no orange at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the color is great.</li>
            <li> It gives a great color on my arms, legs, and chest but it looks splotchy on my hands and feet and fades faster.</li>
            <li> This product works great.  </li>
            <li> Works great with no smell.</li>
            <li> This greatly evens out skin tone.</li>
            <li> I am experienced with these products and my description of use</li>
            <li> If you use it sparingly it&#x27;s great.</li>

            <li> This product is great for an overnight tan.  </li>
            <li> but besides that, it worked great.  </li>
            <li> I read a great blog post endorsing this product, and the great reviews on Amazon prompted me to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Mystic tan beat out all others color wise</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a good thing.</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this self tanner!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and great results.</li>
            <li> I had great, great color the first time.</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I read about this product on Pinterest (visit [...] to see how to apply this product her blog is AMAZING)</li>
            <li> I loved that the lotion is tinted so that you can see where you have applied and make sure you have it all rubbed in.</li>
            <li> Honestly I couldn&#x27;t smell anything</li>
            <li> I really liked the color with this product.</li>
            <li> fair tone skin and most self tanning products make me look like a nacho cheese dorito, but not this stuff.  </li>
            <li> But if you take the time to apply it correctly, it is a nice hue and not that funky orange</li>
            <li> But, it is kind of streaky</li>
            <li> Nice, even color.</li>
            <li> and I liked it...</li>
            <li> It looks like a nice tan.</li>
            <li> It also smells really nice like almond &amp; shea butter lotion.</li>
            <li> I love how it immediately produces a good color.</li>
            <li> This self tan smells great and glides on nice, very nice natural tan.</li>
            <li> This product does give a great color and quickly.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Reviews were pretty good!</li>
            <li> I will most def be looking into more products from this company!</li>
            <li> the color is good and the application is smooth, not streaky.</li>
            <li> The color it gives you is natural and the best part about this product.</li>

            <li> Easy to blend and not &amp;#34;orangey&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li> it was easy to apply and had no streaks!  </li>
            <li> This works just as well as the original one I loved.  </li>
            <li> It actually really does smell good!</li>
            <li> I was intimidated at first, worried about getting it perfect, but now even on my face I can quickly apply.</li>
            <li> I have very light skin (my mom is a redhead)</li>
            <li> The scent is very light and has none of that \\&quot;cooked potatoes\\&quot; smell that lots of others do.  </li>
            <li> The cream dries quickly and smells good.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use with a nice tan result.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have super oily skin, this product is good, but I&#x27;m unimpressed.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly and provides a good, medium coverage that isn&#x27;t orange.</li>
            <li> The one positive was it did in fact give me a desired amount of tan, but otherwise it wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> I got many compliments on my tan, no one knew it was self-tanner.</li>
            <li> I love the shade it turns my skin.</li>
            <li> Not only does it give you a nice even tan ,its not streaky!!!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a self-tanner that actually smells good, does not leave streaks, and works immediately, this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t have that smell that most self tanners have.</li>
            <li> and this is the next best thing to paying for spray tans.</li>
            <li> product doesn&#x27;t stink like most sunless tanners or clog my pores.</li>
            <li> love this product</li>
            <li> It gave a lovely color, but if you&#x27;re looking for a more noticeable difference I would go for one of the darker shades. :)</li>
            <li> and I love that.</li>
            <li> It looks like a healthy tan.</li>
            <li> love the fact that it has the color guide.</li>
            <li> I really thought this lotion was going to be great</li>
            <li> It looked ok on him</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many self tanners over the years</li>
            <li> learned real quick you need to wear gloves when putting this stuff on.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with body lotion to make it blend better and that helped.</li>
            <li> Most self-tanners will make you smell.</li>
            <li> Through my own research, seeing a dermatologist, and esthetician I have made a huge difference in my skins</li>
            <li> I was able to rub it into my skin evenly with no streaks.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this product.</li>
            <li> I love that I can just put it on before bed</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Will for sure buy again.</li>
            <li> Use a mirror and make sure that you aren&#x27;t leaving streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Overall a GREAT self- tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> It all rinses away and comes out a nice and even, lightly tanned shade after bathing.</li>
            <li> I found this recommended in a top 3 sunless tanner review on Pinterest.</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li> and I like the product so much more.</li>
            <li> Be sure to get your hairline and wrists.</li>
            <li> This lotion is fabulous!</li>
            <li> Make sure to wash hands after using.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> also love the pump bottle.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t use on my face, I did use up my neck and throat, but avoided my face just to be safe.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Again, I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> When you get the medium one you look more orange</li>
            <li> Self Tanners are they really safe?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I seriously love this product.</li>
            <li> and I must say there are many...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so many compliments from the girls at work</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many others and this one is a favorite.</li>
            <li> (just be sure to shave before applying</li>
            <li> and I get so many comments like &amp;#34;did</li>
            <li> and they turned out ok</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> More like a walnut stain.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite self tanner for body</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> Remember this is a gradual building product you have to use it more than once to get to the color you want.</li>
            <li> I like this product better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Make sure to wash your hands immediately, cause it tends to stain your palms a lot.</li>
            <li> The smell at first is pleasant but as the tan develops that sunless tan smell will come on.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easy and easy to spread!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it has pretty good reviews and also because the price on AMAZON is better then most places.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Then I lather on the Sun Labs, and have beautiful, soft, tan skin for about 5-7 days.</li>
            <li> At first it looked good then within two or three days</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so excited I found this tanner!  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to tell where coverage is, and where spots are that need more lotion.</li>
            <li> This way, it spreads on with the lotion, way more easily.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant, however the resulting color was really streaky and splotchy.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time researching the best self tanning lotions and this always came up in the top 3 for every blogger out there</li>
            <li> Loved the tint it left on my fair skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does a great job at making skin look naturally young and healthy and minimizing imperfections.</li>
            <li> Be sure to carefully wash hands immediately after application (baking soda works great!)</li>
            <li> The smell did develop more as the product set overnight, I woke up and did not smell too great, but it is worth it for the beautiful dark color.</li>
            <li> I am very fair with strawberry blond hair and the white skin that goes with it.</li>
            <li> The color is great so far.</li>
            <li> , it just makes me look like I have a nice healthy glow which is exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m light olive-y complexion, and this makes me look as if I&#x27;ve been at the beach for a week - healthy, sunkissed and not orange at all.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It gives you a great tan that looks natural.</li>
            <li> but it is a good filler until you get a real tan.</li>
            <li> do notice a mild warm smell 3-4 hours after using the tanner, but doing a quick shower or rinse as early as 4 hours after use, will eliminate the smell, and still leave a beautiful tan.</li>
            <li> Very nice, natural looking color.</li>
            <li> Overall, the color is good and it&#x27;s tinted so you can tell if you miss a spot!</li>
            <li> No ugly orange!</li>
            <li> It would rub off really super easy!</li>
            <li> Easy to blend in</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost a self-tanner virgin, and this was so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> but it does wash off easy</li>
            <li> It tints your skin VERY quickly.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply...definitely wear gloves.</li>
            <li> Goes on evenly and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Goes on even and easy....</li>
            <li> so Its easy to see where you put it.</li>
            <li> but that is easy to fix.</li>
            <li> If u like self tanners get fake bake flawless and be happy</li>
            <li> It DOES give the skin a foul odor, but it gives a great color quickly, and it looks natural for the most part.</li>
            <li> so you can see what parts are yet to be blended it, making even application easy) and dries immediately</li>
            <li> It smells like cherries , is easy to rub on and in and it doesn&#x27;t streak if put on evenly.</li>
            <li> It will wash off - but not as easily as I would like.</li>
            <li> Use a strong soap, and add some baking soda</li>
            <li> Studies have shown that some parabens can MIMIC ESTROGEN in the body, though the FDA asserts that parabens are safe because their estrogenic activity is much lower than the body&#x27;s own estrogen.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> , this is a really good high quality product.</li>
            <li> But it also comes off fairly easily and is very easy to streak if you don&#x27;t do it the right way.</li>
            <li> so when i got this i was thrilled cause first off</li>
            <li> People walking by you will not notice it but it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the new Jergens sunless tanning -</li>
            <li> and it looks fine.</li>
            <li> I thought oh, I&#x27;ll be fine</li>
            <li> It will super stain the palms of your hands!</li>
            <li> The product leaves a nice tan immediately, doesn&#x27;t last too too long, but is perfect when you want that quick tan on the go!!</li>
            <li> I have used many self-tanners in the past, but his one is by far the best, most effective product I have used.</li>
            <li> Make sure you exfoliate first!</li>
            <li> It was darker than I expected so if you are very fair skinned buy the lightest.</li>
            <li> About the free shipping.</li>
            <li> so you get free shipping on anything you buy for a year</li>
            <li> BUT, this is such a great product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been tanning all year but have sat in the sun a couple times just to get lightly toasted.</li>
            <li> I have also used cheap plastic/latex gloves (snatched from my dr office</li>
            <li> Overall a great product.  </li>
            <li> have a light tanner odor, but all in all not bad&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Do not take lightly the discoloration of your hands.</li>
            <li> Great product overall!</li>
            <li> I thought the \\&quot;medium\\&quot; would look too light or not make a difference</li>
            <li> It had a light smell to it</li>
            <li> It fades out so evenly and smoothly that still no one can notice you used a tanner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking to my cheap drugstore brand self tanner that doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful but it felt like it took way to long to receive the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> As someone who absolutely CANNOT tan, I love this stuff and get so many compliments on my appearance (not on the tan itself) when using this product.</li>
            <li> This product gives me a gorgeous, incredibly natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li> It has a good, natural looking color&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first, it goes on super dark which helps you blend it in completely, resulting in a perfectly even, streak-free, beautiful tan.  </li>
            <li> I rate this product right up there at the top.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like its rubbed in evenly at first, DONT FREAK OUT!!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about it, it&#x27;s easy to put on and produces a GREAT color, I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on it.  </li>
            <li> You will have to reapply every 3-4 days to maintain the tan, but it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a but pricey for the amount that you get but totally worth it!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad this was the first one I tried.</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I used gloves as most had recommended and it turned out really well!  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the cost!</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews for this product, I liked the price and took a chance, and I was glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> Then blend those areas a bit with a clean sponge.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly light skin that burns quickly in the sun, then peels, and I get no visible tan.</li>
            <li> Get clean, exfoliated and well moisturized ahead of time.</li>
            <li> But this lotion really creates a great color that compliments my natural skin tone.</li>
            <li> It did come off on my sheets, but the sheets came clean.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is pleasant upon application but develops the same funky smell all the tanning products get once</li>
            <li> I am very pale and this product is wonderful!!</li>
            <li> but if you get the dark tanning kind it has a greenish olive undertone which makes for a more believable tan.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice natural looking tan (no orange)!</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to try it out!.</li>
            <li> As with most self tanners, the results are largely in part to your application techniques</li>
            <li> It looks just like the spray tans that you get at tanning salons, only better because you can cover your feet and hands more accurately.</li>
            <li> The smell really is minimal, and the color is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rather thick cream and smells so good!!  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff, works like a champ and dries fast on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews and it has truely made my &amp;#34;bare legged&amp;#34; summers a dream.  </li>
            <li> The color was ok on my arms and very blotchy on my legs.</li>
            <li> Warm, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> well it really doesnt streak more like blotchy looking if&lt;br /&gt;you dont blend it</li>
            <li> The hue wasn&#x27;t as natural as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I have red hair and fair skin.  </li>
            <li> There is no bad odor when you apply it.  </li>
            <li> but it was not a bad and no one said anything.</li>
            <li> Just be sure that you spread it out evenly &amp; quickly as it drys fast and the color is immediate.</li>
            <li> It has a strong almond/cherry smell at first</li>
            <li> Looked very natural and easy to apply!</li>
            <li> and at first it looked like it would come out fine</li>
            <li> HANDS QUICKLY</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because of the fact that the color fades quickly.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found that spray tans (I&#x27;ve tried Mystic Tan and VersaSpa) leave me super</li>
            <li> Smell is minimal and tolerable and it leaves a nice even tan that isn&#x27;t orange and lasts longer than most.</li>
            <li> And you have to be quick to wash your hands vigorously after application.  </li>
            <li> This is the most realistic tan color from a sunless tanning product I have ever gotten.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> so quick rubbing is a must.</li>
            <li> Took a quick shower</li>
            <li> this is a good product, a good review coming from someone who was addicted to tanning beds.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also fades quickly so need to reapply about every 3 days</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it for those special events</li>
            <li> I am very fair, light hair and blue eyes and WHITE skin.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is okay, I thought from other reviews that it would be amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is not bad but make sure you get the dark tanning kind.</li>
            <li> It goes on without that sticky smelly mess of most self tanners, and smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li> After I trued a lil less it was great.</li>
            <li> After the first time, I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
            <li> I will totally be ordering more!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> So far this one is the best of any I have previously tried.  </li>
            <li> I found this product to have a great color, but thought it came on a little streaky at times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned and was nervous about it adding too much color or being orange, but it adds just enough of a tan to look natural but not draw too much attention, so I have a light tan color all through the winter.</li>
            <li> When the weather is nice enough for shorts but your tan is fading so fast you don&#x27;t feel comfortable in shorts.</li>
            <li> may sound simpler than it really is for a novice.</li>
            <li> I found that I had to rub a towel gently on my skin to smooth it out.</li>
            <li> I am very fair-skinned and don&#x27;t enjoy tanning beds.</li>
            <li> Definitely more of a natural brown than orange.  </li>
            <li> It gives a great natural looking tan without the orange cast you sometimes get with similar products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useful as a guide to see where you&#x27;ve already applied it.  </li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> One of the most natural looking tan from a self tanning lotion that I have found...</li>
            <li> product is fresh</li>
            <li> But I still say the color you get is worth it.</li>
            <li> and WOW it worked SO much better.</li>
            <li> This tan stuff is worth over what i paid for</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I was so impressed by the results that I decided to do another application and put a thin layer on my tummy and arms.</li>
            <li> Gives nice instant and gradual color.</li>
            <li> This tanner gives me a nice natural color, more brown than golden and definitely not orange.</li>
            <li> I bought this one recently after hearing great reviews on it, and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a number of reviews for other self tanning lotions and I&#x27;ve tried many of them, but this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used, I&#x27;ll never go back to another brand.</li>
            <li> Great for pale skin.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do when my other favorite brand was out of stock.</li>
            <li> It was very streaky  and unless you apply it super quick, which i like to take my time, you&#x27;ll end up looking like a zebra with all the stripes.</li>
            <li> I have VERY fair skin, I have seriously tried tons of product/tanning beds.</li>
            <li> it is much cheaper and keeps the tan looking very natural! :)</li>
            <li> I get instant gratification and I am able to get the amount of &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; just right!</li>
            <li> I did not use gloves, I didn&#x27;t need to because it came right off my hands when I washed them.</li>
            <li> but it washes right out.  </li>
            <li> I put it on at night right after I showered and exfoliated, and washed it off in the morning for those wondering about its application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can see a noticeable difference in your skin tone right away</li>
            <li> but so far I am excited to see how this product works!</li>
            <li> Great for those of us who want to wear sandals on vacation but would like a little color before we get to our sunny destination!</li>
            <li> Applies easily, non-streaky, very natural looking, did not rub off on clothing  Cons:</li>
            <li> Make sure to rub it in really well and wash your hands very very frequently</li>
            <li> Lol I had a small moment of panic when trying to wash it off.</li>
            <li> I have a light olive skin tone and my husband is white white and the product looked good on both.  </li>
            <li> My favorite self tanner is Fake Bake Flawless, but the color takes more applications to get as dark as this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead and very fair skinned and a mature woman and have always had trouble with sunless products.  </li>
            <li> For all you self tanners that don&#x27;t use your hands to simply avoid the orange palms I have recently picked up a great trick:  put a squirt of hand soap and a bit of whitening toothpaste on a wash cloth when you are done with the application and scrub the insides of your hands/ fingers.  </li>
            <li> The lotion has a somewhat runny consistency that is easy to apply evenly, and you can clearly see where you&#x27;ve applied.</li>
            <li> , it will wash off, or rub off after a nice, long hot shower.  </li>
            <li> I am a blonde with really fair skin and this product looks really natural on me.</li>
            <li> In the morning I had a very natural, streak-free, light bronze tan.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Now I have to decide if I&#x27;ll get more of this or my other fav brand when it comes available.</li>
            <li> It gives me a beautiful healthy glow, it&#x27;s not super dark</li>
            <li> There is a good amount of preparation needed and time invested  to avoid a splotchy mess as I found out on my first try.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to find a product that (so far) leaves my skin golden rather than orange.</li>
            <li> I used to swear by the Faux tanner byb bare minerals until they recently changed their formula to paraben free, the new one is just not as good</li>
            <li> This is my first time using tanning lotion and after reading a lot of reviews for this product and others, I decided to go for it.</li>
            <li> This is my first review on Amazon...</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time yesterday..</li>
            <li> I would recommend exfoliating first...</li>
            <li> this is my first one.</li>
            <li> Other than that I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> so u can see exactly where u are putting it.</li>
            <li> Also it doesnt leave a weird smell, which is GREAT!</li>
            <li> : I would recommend putting hand lotion on your palms first before applying so that it doesn&#x27;t dye your hands.</li>
            <li> First of all this will most definitely stain your hands so wear gloves.  </li>
            <li> This stuff has a greenish tint to the bronzer when you first apply it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Turns your hands brown if you don&#x27;t use a mitt because it dries so darn fast!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You definitely want to make sure to apply this at night and take a shower in the morning.</li>
            <li> It seemed streaky at first</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> with hot water and soap</li>
            <li> I first applied after a shower at night and</li>
            <li> That works too ;)</li>
            <li> You apply it and there is instant color that develops even more throughout the night (or day, whenever you apply it).</li>
            <li> I realized i needed to lotion first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BE AWARE it WILLLLLL stain your hands</li>
            <li> /&gt;WIll DEF be buying alot more in the future..</li>
            <li> I got this self tanner based on other reviews on Amazon and I love it!  </li>
            <li> Love the color, last about 2-3 days even with showering.</li>
            <li> The main issue with this (aside from the time consumption) is that I don&#x27;t have adequate lighting in my spare bathroom shower (and I can&#x27;t do it in the master bath because we have grout and tile in there</li>
            <li> I will update with more results later if I think about it</li>
            <li> I do modeling shoots, and I&#x27;ve been exposed to many different forms of lighting.</li>
            <li> When I asked if there was anything they could do to make this better, the company said ship it back</li>
            <li> This product does not turn you orange or smell funny.</li>
            <li> This happened when I moisturized first and also when I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I exfoliated first both times</li>
            <li> What I do to fix this is I first rub lotion, oil, or shea butter all over my body, and after that I put on the tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I love that the instant color lets you know if you&#x27;ve missed a spot.</li>
            <li> My favorite self tanner and the only one I&#x27;ll use!</li>
            <li> so you can see exactly where you are putting it on.</li>
            <li> and I feel so much more confident wearing shorts now that my legs are ghostly pale!</li>
            <li> The jury is still out on how long this will last, but if it&#x27;s only a day or two--I&#x27;ll still be a happy girl!</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is very quick to stain your palms, so be sure to wash your hands as soon as possible after application.</li>
            <li> You really have to be sure you take your time and EVENLY rub this is, especially when doing the backs of your legs.</li>
            <li> The towel trick worked for me though and the extra effort needed to apply it evenly was well worth the fantastic color.</li>
            <li> I was referred to this product through a blog (http://doitandhow.com/2013/03/16/self-tanning-tips/) who also advised that I use it in conjunction with Jergen&#x27;s natural glow to prolong the tan and make it look more natural.</li>
            <li> Product has two positive characteristics:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> I used this lotion with amazing results - even the medium tone isn&#x27;t too dark for me.</li>
            <li> It sets in fast so by the time your done with your arms its pretty well dyed your hands.</li>
            <li> Once I mastered putting it on smoothly, it&#x27;s a nice dark color, but not too orange.</li>
            <li> When first put on there is absolutely no stinky smell as with most self-tanners.  </li>
            <li> I bought this lotion in medium after reading all the great reviews about the extra dark.</li>
            <li> I burn quite easily in tanning beds and being outside.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a quick tan that showed up immediately, looked natural and stayed for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks natural and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Very realistic color, not at all orange.</li>
            <li> Lotion rubs on quite easily (and it&#x27;s actually brown in color</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s so low maintenance and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The tan is very realistic, and lasts a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As with any tanning lotion, be sure to put moisturizer on any dry areas before applying the tanner.</li>
            <li> Good price for a long lasting product.</li>
            <li> and I will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> So...I will certainly continue to use this lotion.</li>
            <li> So...I will certainly continue to use this lotion.</li>
            <li> and my color stays pretty constant, although if I ever want darker color, I just apply more frequently.</li>
            <li> Natural looking tan and no unpleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> I have worked long and hard to fix the damage that has been done to my skin since then, and have been very successful thankfully.</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial smell is fine.</li>
            <li> Make sure to rub it in super fast because it dried fast.</li>
            <li> I applied it the other night before bed, using the gloves as recommended (several pairs came with the product)and woke up in the morning with a beautiful even, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Make sure to exfoliate and lotion up rough areas before applying.</li>
            <li> It is also very forgiving -</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this product!</li>
            <li> It was really orange.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> I never have time, nor do I really care too.</li>
            <li> not at all the golden brown from a natural tan.</li>
            <li> It makes application soooo much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> however, they shipped me the \\&quot;very dark.\\</li>
            <li> I ended up giving mine to my father because he is very tanned.  </li>
            <li> reapply the tanning lotion every 3 days to my whole body and touch up places that fade out faster</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Would recommend really rubbing it thoroughly on your toes, if you&#x27;re doing that area -- I didn&#x27;t &amp; my toes were way darker than the rest of my foot.</li>
            <li> as if perhaps its OLD.You know how you go to a drug store and buy salon products and they are not guarenteed unless you buy them from a real salon.</li>
            <li> So after much though, and research I stumbled upon Sun laboratories.</li>
            <li> I can promise you this absolutely comes out looking brown/tan instead of orange!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This works fast and evenly.  </li>
            <li> The bronzer (which is really helpful for even application) will wash off when you shower</li>
            <li> so I am very iffy about tanning beds.</li>
            <li> It really stains your hands so wear gloves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;you really have to rub it in, its a bit of work</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> If I put the lotion on my whole body (face included)</li>
            <li> You really need to wear gloves with this.</li>
            <li> It dries and sets incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So be ready.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, so it&#x27;s going to stain your hands.</li>
            <li> You really have to wash your hands thoroughly if you don&#x27;t wear gloves.</li>
            <li> I really like this self tanner because it doesn&#x27;t make your skin look orange.</li>
            <li> Looks like a real tan with no sparkles.</li>
            <li> and I must say, I&#x27;m absolutely smitten with this product.</li>
            <li> REAL.</li>
            <li> but I just used too much.</li>
            <li> Worked very well.</li>
            <li> It goes on very streaky too.</li>
            <li> I literally just opened up the package, and it arrived REALLY fast</li>
            <li> but I really did not like the smell at all</li>
            <li> so it turned my hand very orange.</li>
            <li> mad.&lt;br /&gt;It dries very verryyy fast</li>
            <li> got in the shower exfoliated and then lotioned up my whole</li>
            <li> /&gt;it really looks so natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> no this is like a real tan in a bottle.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t pay for fast shipping again</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how real the tan looks.</li>
            <li> I just wish it will not fade as fast.</li>
            <li> it was very splochy</li>
            <li> I even use it on my face (which is very acne-prone), and I&#x27;ve never had any problems.</li>
            <li> Dries really fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use tanning lotions very often because I can&#x27;t stand the smell of them.</li>
            <li> The color is more brown than orange, and I constantly get compliments about how natural it looks.</li>
            <li> It gives you a hint of color immediately, so you are able to tell right away if you are missing any spots or if it&#x27;s getting streaky.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this and had read a lot of positive reviews on it</li>
            <li> Better then any other brands I have used.</li>
            <li> Most of the other ones I&#x27;ve used &#x27;stay&#x27; on your skin until it fades.  </li>
            <li> With a few simple tricks (like using rubber Playtex gloves to apply, standing in front of a mirror to see what you&#x27;re doing, and rubbing very quickly) I get a gorgeous tan instantly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied it several different ways; right after the shower, after a long at day work, under and over other moisturizers..  For me the best way is over a moisturizer applied after the shower.  </li>
            <li> First off it smells great, BUT the smell does wear off and you will have to deal with the fake tanner smell until you take a shower.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can really warn you about is that it will stain your hands, use gloves or a tanning mitt to apply it and make sure to stay away from light colored objects for a little while.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it develops a very strong odor after a couple of hours just like the booth tans do, so I highly recommend that you do it at night so that you can wash it off the next morning!</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s a really dark brown color that streaks easily.</li>
            <li> This self tanner looks very natural, and unlike other self tanners it actually smells good when applied.</li>
            <li> Not too dark and not to light!</li>
            <li> I wore dark clothes to bed just to be safe, but I didn&#x27;t end up with any stains on my clothing or bedsheets.</li>
            <li> it does the job ok but to dark for me</li>
            <li> This always my tried and true, but back to ordering from LA</li>
            <li> I did miss a couple spots on my wrist the first time I did it, but that was complete user error.  </li>
            <li> I love how it goes on dark</li>
            <li> I purchased the medium tint because, again...i am very fair and didn&#x27;t want to look like a dorito!eviews I read on it, i washed my hands with a baking soda/dawn dish soap paste and there are no traces of it left behind.</li>
            <li> Really I look like I live in Mexico..</li>
            <li> There is a greenish hue to the lotion which means you&#x27;re getting more of an olive tan than the typical orange.</li>
            <li> Smells decent.</li>
            <li> I am super white!</li>
            <li> I have tried many of these types of items on my Irish girl skin and this is the ONLY one I will endorse.</li>
            <li> I simply look like I just strolled in off the beach with a light, 100% natural tan.</li>
            <li> Tanned quickly - but still had issues with streaking - used only once b/c of that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a person with a pale complextion but this stuff brings out a nice natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Also most tanners leave elbows and knees and ankles a mess.</li>
            <li> Very natural color!</li>
            <li> Use the mirror to double check the coverage before it sets in, because it easily streaks or dries in patches if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion and sellerif</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Before applying I made sure to exfoliate very well and slather dry areas (knees, elbows) in regular lotion.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and it does help extend he life of your tan!!  </li>
            <li> , I put a little on my wrist and the more I rubbed it into my wrist</li>
            <li> This product also lacks the strong &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34; smell so prevalent in other brands.</li>
            <li> The smell is not too strong but still has that &amp;#34;sefl tanner&amp;#34; smell to it like any other.  </li>
            <li> you look sun-kissed!&amp;#34; I do think it has an odor to it, but maybe it isn&#x27;t as strong as some other tanners.</li>
            <li> This really made for a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> but Jergens isn&#x27;t near as fast at tanning.</li>
            <li> I really like the natural color (not orange) that this product gives me.</li>
            <li> That initial darkness fades as soon as you shower into a more natural look, but you need to apply the tan when no one will see you for several hours  -Though</li>
            <li> However, on my skin, the self tan smell is pretty apparent after it starts working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the color it gives me- not orange at all, and the smell is bearable and goes away after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t necessarily last long, but no awful odor as with some others.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the extra money compared to Jergen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I find that if you don&#x27;t shower afterwards, it does take on more of that dreaded &amp;#34;self tanner smell&amp;#34; with your body heat, but if you shower a few hours after applying the smell is mitigated, though some of the tan will be washed away</li>
            <li> I normally use Jergens tanning lotion, but thought I would try something else.  </li>
            <li> No icky tanner smell.</li>
            <li> It lasts approximately 2-3 days after a good application (even after showering/swimming).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously, within 3 hours my skin was noticeably darker, no streaks, it was super easy to see where you were putting it on</li>
            <li> Before applying, I used plain lotion on my wrists and knees to avoid those parts getting darker, but I thought the tanner is just okay.</li>
            <li> or if you simply have the time to kill to get it right.</li>
            <li> (I use latex gloves as per other reviewers suggestions and it works much better than using your bare hand).</li>
            <li> I like how the product goes on dark, so is easy to get it all evenly distributed.</li>
            <li> used this for my high school reunion, I looked fresh, and tan and had a nice glow without that fake orange coloring.  </li>
            <li> you loofa to remove dead skin first, and then use your favorite moisturizing lotion regularly</li>
            <li> :It showed up immediately and developed a little more after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;GOOD</li>
            <li> It smells nice when applying, and the next day it did smell a little bit corn-chippy, but not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> your new tan!)&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> For a particular event I&#x27;ve been known to apply a coat early morning, rinse after lunch, repeat application, and rinse again after dinner.</li>
            <li> I heard such great things about this product, in reality, its not great.  </li>
            <li> I have applied it a few times since then and each time I get more comfortable and with less mistakes.  </li>
            <li> It gives a subtle tan, just not the kind of tan/darkness</li>
            <li> Still had streaks despite everything I did to try and get it on smoothly, and even though it doesn&#x27;t smell in the bottle I guess the actual change in your skin causes a smell because after about an hour it smelled exactly like every other sunless tanner</li>
            <li> It gives you a very natural look.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not orange-y or streaky at all, just very natural looking</li>
            <li> The color is very natural.  </li>
            <li> Color looks very natural.</li>
            <li> It gives a very natural looking color.</li>
            <li> It looked very natural, not orangey at all.  </li>
            <li> It is very natural, building color.</li>
            <li> I also have to apply it very frequently.</li>
            <li> but if I do get some on them, a little bit of baking soda takes it right off!!</li>
            <li> I usually have pasty white skin that does not tan very easily and this stuff really worked.</li>
            <li> Washes off easy tan does not last long didnt care for this product.</li>
            <li> I have light skin and dark hair</li>
            <li> Sun Labs medium sunless tanning lotion is incredibly natural looking!</li>
            <li> I finally purchased Fake Bake Flawless before vacation last year</li>
            <li> It looks so natural!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that sometimes it dries a little too quickly, before I&#x27;m able to smooth out all the streaks.</li>
            <li> Plus a helpful hint from another review said a long handle spoon with a wash cloth rubber banded to the spoon part for application to the very center of your back was a great idea.</li>
            <li> Covers great, not streaky and does not smell bad like most other lotions tend to.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other tanning products and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> so I was looking for a new tanner and happened across this one and WOW.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately it does last too long.</li>
            <li> I have gotten a few streaks before, but they were easily remedied by rubbing out with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> -Pleasant smell for a fake tanner  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a few products that worked well for me but had strong odors.  </li>
            <li> The color is very natural (I am fair skinned) but doesn&#x27;t last long so you must apply every few days to keep the color.  </li>
            <li> It still turned out slightly splotchy in parts and the color was only okay.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be left with less bronze but a more natural look.</li>
            <li> By far one of the best self-tanning products I&#x27;ve ever used, and ya girl knows fake tanners!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even think about it, but when it developed, the color was super dark and long lasting where I had already peeled and light everywhere else.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s consistency is more liquid than lotion and is hard to get and even coverage.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like other self tanners and it works quickly.</li>
            <li> Make sure you do your due diligence exfoliating in the shower , I use my Moroccan mitt for that , dry off and start applying the lotion as if it was your body lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tinted so you can be sure not to miss any spots but the lotion has a strange greenish tint to it and where the product overlaps leaves dark lines.  </li>
            <li> I have a natural olive bronzed skin tone and it did not make my skin much darker but just enough to look somewhat sunkissed.</li>
            <li> natural looking tan...</li>
            <li> Looks totally natural.</li>
            <li> I still cant get the color to look natural on my hands and wrists.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not orange or brown, it&#x27;s a natural looking glowing tan</li>
            <li> The next day I&#x27;m ready for my bikini.</li>
            <li> This stuff gives me a natural color without looking orange or streaky.</li>
            <li> The tan it leaves looks natural and even.</li>
            <li> Gives you a natural looking glow.</li>
            <li> Looks natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased direct from the manufacturer before but figured Amazon would be easier, now I&#x27;m returning.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I have been using the Jergens natural glow lotion because is doesn&#x27;t make be streaky.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised.</li>
            <li> I bought this last summer and it lasted almost through the whole season.  </li>
            <li> have naturally olive tone skin</li>
            <li> Natural looking.</li>
            <li> I am near translucent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried body drench and it was nearly identical in results to the Jergens.</li>
            <li> but so far, I&#x27;m liking it.</li>
            <li> Second not so much.</li>
            <li> , natural looking color&lt;br /&gt;-Develops</li>
            <li> Spreads evenly and looks natural.</li>
            <li> and I have no refund thus far.</li>
            <li> My tan looks natural.</li>
            <li> It gives you a natural looking tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved the color that this product gave me but applying it was difficult.</li>
            <li> As a naturally pale gal with light hair/light eyes, I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market, but hear me when I say...</li>
            <li> And it has the most subtle scent out of any tanner I&#x27;ve used (you have to sniff your arm directly to smell anything, and even that close</li>
            <li> It has a smell, like all fake tans, but it isn&#x27;t super strong.</li>
            <li> I used gloves to apply all over my body (to avoid crazy orange hands), but it&#x27;s supposed to be ok as long as you make sure to wash your hands thoroughly after.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face being careful afterward to use a barely damp cloth to wipe off eyebrows, lightly blot the space between my brows, above the lips (avoid the Lindsey Lohan tan-stach), nose creases, and chin.</li>
            <li> tips are to work quickly, wear gloves, and use a tight weave, soft towel (like a car chamois)to apply.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin a little oily though but not bad.  </li>
            <li> Some other brands wash right off</li>
            <li> I will use for a special occasion if I need color but not for everyday.</li>
            <li> I was very pale when I used this and was extremely pleased with the results after one application, instant tan!</li>
            <li> The product was okay, and for the money, much better than Fake Bake, Mystic Tan and St. Tropez, but it didn&#x27;t entirely fufill my expectations after reading all the other reviews.</li>
            <li> It took a couple of rinses, but eventually my palms went back to normal and didn&#x27;t affect the rest of my tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You see some color instantly, and it develops more over the next few hours.</li>
            <li> It seems to have a more natural base color, more olive than orange.</li>
            <li> So your tan def doesn&#x27;t last long like a real tan, and I don&#x27;t really think it is an actual self tanner?  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too dark either, it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li> Once it really soaks in and your skin feels dry again, you can see the difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this fake tanner because they discontinued my last brand, and this one had good reviews.</li>
            <li> It is a thick cream that is tinted, so you can easily see where you have applied and avoid streaks.  </li>
            <li> Also, I felt like it dried almost too quickly.</li>
            <li> I applied with my bare hands (I knew the risk!)</li>
            <li> I was a little intimidated at first because even the Medium is super dark when you squeeze it out</li>
            <li> I love the dark color, but after you shower in the morning you are losing instantly half of intensity.</li>
            <li> It has a long lasting realistic color, just be prepared with baking soda to get the color off of yours hands!</li>
            <li> The instant tint will wash away when you shower, leaving you with a natural even looking tan, from the DHA.</li>
            <li> It washes and wears off but it&#x27;s really dark at first.</li>
            <li> going back to Jergens Natural Glow...</li>
            <li> Of course you have to be careful about how much you use.  </li>
            <li> My only suggestion is to use gloves when applying and wait until the tan completely fades before reapplying.</li>
            <li> Also, you get a deep and natural color.</li>
            <li> To get a natural glow on your hands and avoid the telltale fake-tan &amp;#34;white hand&amp;#34; syndrome, just squirt a bit onto the back of your hand and massage the backs of your hands together.</li>
            <li> It gives you such a natural looking tan, and it builds well.</li>
            <li> The color this product leaves behind is lovely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a naturally fair skinned person and was afraid any sunless tanner would make me look orange.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pale and this gives me a natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li> If not rubbed in completely and allowed to dry completely it will streak.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I would have about it is it stains my palms very quickly...</li>
            <li> so I wipe those areas clean with a damp cloth and do the same with eyelids, zits, and small scars on my face using damp q-tips.</li>
            <li> I applied it with my bare hands and after the initial application it tends to settle into lines that are very apparent.</li>
            <li> I have extremely pale irish skin that won&#x27;t tan on its own, so maybe the color just turned out orangy because of my pale starting complextion.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it says its paraben free, although one of the ingredients is a paraben.</li>
            <li> I have used other fake tanners (lotions, foams, sprays) and am pretty skilled at self-tanning, but all of them eventually fade to orange</li>
            <li> I have been using this self tanner for the past year and a half and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just used the &#x27;very dark&#x27; for the first time</li>
            <li> &quot; I know someone who wants to buy the dark bottle from me</li>
            <li> In a classroom full of students of a range of skin colors/tans, I was noticably (at least to myself)oranger than everyone else.</li>
            <li> Product is ok , but not sure I would buy it again.also a little on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> I have Irish pale freckled skin and have tried MANY different self tanning agents over the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde and have been very pale my whole life.</li>
            <li> so I can only blame myself for slight streaking on my wrists where I got my hands too wet right afterwards.</li>
            <li> Much more natural looking tan than other products I&#x27;ve used &amp; definitely streaks less &amp; less darkening on elbows &amp; ankles than other brands.</li>
            <li> The good thing about it is that it won&#x27;t leave a heavy residue like fake bake , just a tiny bit comes off the next morning when you shower .</li>
            <li> i mean wow fast.</li>
            <li> (This is not my first go round with self tanner, but this product is far less forgiving than some others)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy to use, as I&#x27;m used to using a spray but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Not only that, but all other tanning lotions, and even when I get professionally spray tanned, as the tan starts to fade out, it starts to streak somewhat... but not this one.</li>
            <li> goes on dark and looks very natural, not orange at all.  </li>
            <li> -Ended up with a noticeable decent tan, not too orange, perhaps a little streaky.  </li>
            <li> The other thing that bothers me about this product is it does not look natural on my hands or feet.</li>
            <li> Would get rashes from other products (sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> all other lights I haven&#x27;t had issues with (Natural, Incandescent, CFL, Halogen, etc.).</li>
            <li> It left me with a natural brown tan but it also had a little bit of red to it to make it look like it actually came from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this certainly helped prevent any excessive tanning in those areas.</li>
            <li> As a novice self-tanner I was a little intimidated when I first received this product and read other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I am fairly pale, and it gave me a realistic looking tan.</li>
            <li> WILL stain your hands quite quickly, so either wear thin latex gloves while applying or scrub your palms afterwards with a gritty cleaner like Lava soap.</li>
            <li> other self tanners, I noticed they always ended up flaking off in odd patches when they started to wear off, but this product simply fades away like a real tan.</li>
            <li> it was the medium and not the dark one because the picture clearly shows the word medium on the bottom of the front of the bottle.</li>
            <li> They usually look very unnatural, but this one looks natural and doesn&#x27;t turn my age spots too dark.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure that I really needed to.</li>
            <li> It does not last long before you need to reapply but I would still recommend it.</li>
            <li> As long as you exfoliate properly beforehand and run in well, it won&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li> -It&#x27;s difficult to apply evenly, the lotion is somewhat thick, and tends to dry quickly so it doesn&#x27;t smooth on in an even coat.  </li>
            <li> I loved the look on my body but the blotchy look on my face was obvious and very disappointing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> I am an incredibly pale Irish girl who lacks the ability to tan naturally, so I decided to give this sunless tanning thing a try.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints other than being able to faintly smell it.  </li>
            <li> (only bc they know), while other friends and patients ask if I just got back from vacation!!!</li>
            <li> The color also intensifies within a couple of hours, and it gives you really natural, dark color, just like I used to get at the tanning salon, without all the damage to my skin!</li>
            <li> Really orange and hard to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> Looked like i had some kind of bad skin condition ..</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion leaves a really nice tan on your skin, doesn&#x27;t streak too bad at all either.</li>
            <li> on initially way too dark to go out in public.</li>
            <li> I applied the lotion long before I got into bed</li>
            <li> and I am not sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> It lasted a long time too even thought I did not leave it on overnight like it said to do.  </li>
            <li> Not professional looking at all.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately like most self tanners, it has a typical \\&quot;self tanner\\&quot; smell.</li>
            <li> If I applied to half my arm and ten seconds later applied it to the other, you could see a line that I had to blend with regular lotion to cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry, or for the color to show up either.  </li>
            <li> If you are a natural blonde, you understand how frustrating it can be to just walk outside in a pair of shorts being so white.</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d try something a little more expensive.</li>
            <li> I would apply the self-tanner and wake up 3 different shades of orange and smeared from one end to the other.  </li>
            <li> and I actually trashed all my other self tanners after using this one.</li>
            <li> If you have any dry patches this will highlight your reptile skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and then it started making my skin dry and peal.  </li>
            <li> I guess I have dry skin and just&lt;</li>
            <li> I forgot to do this and ended up with a couple of dark/orangish spots on my feet where they were dry.</li>
            <li> Color does last with a slow natural fade.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every single drug store tanner and nothing</li>
            <li> Not going to lie though, the first time I applied it and this dark brownish green comes out of the bottle, I was a little nervous</li>
            <li> It is a dark lotion so you can see if you have put too much/or not enough on.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> i actually thought i ordered the ultra dark.</li>
            <li> I have also found out it is necessary to blend the lotion well in areas of the skin that have wrinkles (eg.the knuckles on the tops of the hands)in order to avoid dark lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried several self tanning products and this one will leave your hands dark with product</li>
            <li> reapplication to stay dark is necessary.</li>
            <li> When I showered the next morning, I could see the color running down the drain and the color goes almost all the way away.</li>
            <li> Only down side is the stain of your hands.</li>
            <li> Mix it with lotion for a more subtle look or use it by itself for a serious tan!</li>
            <li> /&gt;-There is only a slight smell, but it&#x27;s pleasant!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather save some money and get about the same results for under half the price.</li>
            <li> Okay ,all that sounds really bad</li>
            <li> Just be careful around wrists and ankles, I blend with lotion in these area&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Even after it dried once I went and sat outside.</li>
            <li> so be careful</li>
            <li> This product worked exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> I left on for a few hours and washed off.  </li>
            <li> I had darker accumulation on my elbows and ankles, but really not that noticeable.</li>
            <li> This is NOT what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as fake bake and didn&#x27;t like the color of my skin and weird smell.</li>
            <li> and second, i got it for way less than retail price!</li>
            <li> I have pale skin (freckles, red hair - was always the nerd kid wearing the t-shirt in the pool.)  </li>
            <li> Especially for pale skin.</li>
            <li> I am a pale red head and all self tanners look orange on me.</li>
            <li> I am blonde and quite pale in the winter</li>
            <li> The color is fairly natural but it was so difficult to apply due to the drying time, and due to the dryness it&#x27;s even more difficult to apply the product</li>
            <li> If I feel like I&#x27;m looking a little pale one day, I just put some on and I look much less ghostly and very natural</li>
            <li> So the fact that it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long is another down side I suppose.</li>
            <li> I used it with a dab of regular lotion to help it be a little thinner and not as dark.</li>
            <li> a thick layer of gauze pad taped to a long serving spoon helps to reach the areas on your back your hands can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a bit less expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Now a few hours later I can tell there is a slight smell due to the tanner, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything anyone would notice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too smelly like other self tanners .I</li>
            <li> Plus, sun exposure  to the point of tan is not an option due to skin cancer and premature wrinkling.  </li>
            <li> word of advice: If you get sunburned and peel, do NOT use this (or any other self tanner).</li>
            <li> every other day.&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution to those who workout a lot.  </li>
            <li> every other day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that a lot of other sunless tanners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other lotions before and we all know the types of issues you can have with them - streaking, smell etc.</li>
            <li> I saw other reviews that said it faded patchy, but I did not not have that happen.  </li>
            <li> this is unavoidable and expected!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve attached two pictures, one of my leg before I showered and the other after.</li>
            <li> I had heard from a blog that this product doesn&#x27;t smell like other sunless tanners, but it does.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have that smell like all the other self tanners.</li>
            <li> Had to be very careful that I didn&#x27;t leave any unblended areas or missed areas.</li>
            <li> Very minimal smell</li>
            <li> I was disappointed after having followed all instructions last night, this morning when I put only water on my legs (10 hours later) it completely washed off.</li>
            <li> After several hours there is a faint odor but not anywhere near the odor of other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Its difficult to stay the same skin tone with this product without frequent application.</li>
            <li> Gives me a little bit of instant color &amp; gets a little darker over time!  </li>
            <li> This self tanning lotion is far too expensive to have an outcome similar or less than any like product I have purchased off the shelf at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Comes out of the bottle already a dark brown color</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t make you so dark that you feel unnatural.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is how dark it made my palms while trying to apply.</li>
            <li> I have dark under eye circles</li>
            <li> but my palms got REALLY DARK putting this on</li>
            <li> The color is defiantly not as dark as I thought it would be either.  </li>
            <li> It is dark brown in color</li>
            <li> like so so dark</li>
            <li> The color isnt as DARK but</li>
            <li> so this looks like my REAL tan and its the prettyiest fake tan</li>
            <li> The product is a dark green/brown...</li>
            <li> I can control how dark each application is.</li>
            <li> Tip: scrub hands with baking soda and water to remove dark color on palms 😀</li>
            <li> so maybe you can put it in with some good smelling lotion for maintenance but the color is dead on!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> i would have to get into the shower to spritz it on and rub it in and then wipe down my shower and tub.</li>
            <li> (i didn&#x27;t see it washing down the drain) and checked my results...</li>
            <li> And after awhile it didn&#x27;t turn to that dry stink that usually follows application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS</li>
            <li> it seems when I shower, you know you can see the water slightly discolored going down the drain, but not this one.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it fades a little faster than I would like.</li>
            <li> There is a slight smell but goes away after shower.</li>
            <li> -You have to scrub your hands like a maniac immediately after application if you don&#x27;t want black hands.  </li>
            <li> Ive been on the hunt for that pefect non orange glow, but this tanner still had a slightly orange tint.</li>
            <li> less streaks when you do it gradually.</li>
            <li> a subtle color was instant making even application a sinch.</li>
            <li> and it gives me a instant subtle glow.</li>
            <li> After my shower, the tint rinsed off and I was left with a subtle brown glow all over my body.</li>
            <li> It is basically a black &amp;#34;fluid&amp;#34; - not a lotion.  </li>
            <li> So when I put just a little on my finger it looked so dark...</li>
            <li> but that was not true at all.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t make a mess of my hands</li>
            <li> i suggest the tight dr ones cuz those others slide around</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m extremely pale, but I wouldn&#x27;t be anywhere close to the definition of &amp;#34;naturally dark complected&amp;#34; either.</li>
            <li> Plus the color is a still quite dark, so people will notice unless you mix the tanner with plain lotion.</li>
            <li> (I bought the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; 8oz), and I didn&#x27;t buy the mitt to help put it on because the reviews on them were terrible and said they pretty much broke apart and disintegrated while using them.</li>
            <li> and it does become enhanced slightly after a few hours.</li>
            <li> as long as you don&#x27;t put it on everyday, you will NOT have the awful orangey that comes with most self tanners.</li>
            <li> I am looking at my feet and ankles (always areas with issues) and there is a little bit of streaking</li>
            <li> I just use a little baking soda on my hands after to get the formula off.</li>
            <li> I just did my legs to test it out and it gave me a little bit of color which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t last very long, which I like, because you don&#x27;t get those weird semi-tan blotches as it wear off.  </li>
            <li> it can be a little messy so apply it in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> The dark color is a little shocking, but it makes for instant tanning, with full color coming after about 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li> It really stains and is hard to wash off the hands, making it a dead giveaway that it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> I am a redhead and have very pale sensative skin and all other products</li>
            <li> Used the product a few times.</li>
            <li> Waited a few days .</li>
            <li> Give it a few hours to absorb.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had trouble with this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot of time and trouble with exfoliating, shaving, and all that</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or your money on anything by Sun Laboratories.</li>
            <li> Not smooth.</li>
            <li> I had a few smears on my wrists and feet, but nothing no one but myself could ever notice and my tan lasted a few days.  </li>
            <li> This product arrived green in color.</li>
            <li> but...when I opened it the tub of the  pump was really messy</li>
            <li> so after a few days i was like OK.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but based on one of the reviews I read on it, i washed my hands with a baking soda/dawn dish soap paste and there are no traces of it left behind.</li>
            <li> The stuff dried in about an hour, and I went to bed.</li>
            <li> but then I had really pale hands and feet while the rest of my body was tan....</li>
            <li> If you are pale then DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely pale and this product does not leave me orange.</li>
            <li> and now I never have to be pale again.</li>
            <li> My pale gams are forever changed.</li>
            <li> My bf is pale.</li>
            <li> We are both pale.</li>
            <li> I am so pale</li>
            <li> Just being this pale</li>
            <li> We have tried a lot of other products with negative results.</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is that it didn&#x27;t work for my neck and face.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is, it&#x27;s a little difficult to blend.  </li>
            <li> and maybe I need a little practice with it!</li>
            <li> only negative comment is that it leaves a dark, weird color on your hands</li>
            <li> Very little product needed for results.</li>
            <li> Got my skin back to normal.once again few days later after reapplying,moisturizing, exfolating the crap out of my skin.</li>
            <li> It has a tint which balances out the usual orange tone, so I use it in the morning to take advantage of that.  </li>
            <li> but I was pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Work in small sections.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so the &#x27;fake tan&#x27; odor will only offend me...</li>
            <li> so i had to take some lotion after the spots because the lotion had dried and they smoothed out!</li>
            <li> so i had to take some lotion after the spots because the lotion had dried and they smoothed out!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m just not sure how to correct this.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, not too thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about this stuff</li>
            <li> but there is little control over where it&#x27;s applied and the cost is ridiculous ($20 per spray?)</li>
            <li> thin other times...</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this as it is tinted (so I thought it wouldn&#x27;t streak so bad) and supposedly has no smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this shade because I am extremely pale, but even on my skin the results were almost too subtle.</li>
            <li> i get very pale in the winter time and wanted an alternative to tanning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale and have a hard time tanning, I end up looking like a lobster.</li>
            <li> If you apply it on dry skin, it streaks in a really weird way and doesn&#x27;t spread evenly.</li>
            <li> Hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Hard to use now.  </li>
            <li> it brings back that old nasty self tanning smell....</li>
            <li> /&gt;This isn&#x27;t really a complaint</li>
            <li> I gave up on tanning beds, and as it is late February, I&#x27;ve been craving tan skin.</li>
            <li> I had to wash my hands at  least 4 times to get it off.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and body with no irritation or negative effects.</li>
            <li> but I never liked the streaky results.</li>
            <li> It does not go on smoothly, and looks horrible.  </li>
            <li> I feel like the lotion is too thick sometimes and</li>
            <li> I am very, very pale with dark hair and this product doesn&#x27;t make me look like I have a fake tan</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Skinny Fake Bake, L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronze, St. Tropez, and Mystic Tans, so I know the techniques of applying it, and to exfoliate extremely well before hand</li>
            <li> Went on streaky and left my legs a weird pinkish brown color!</li>
            <li> No more guessing and waiting to see if you got everywhere, only to have a nasty orange streak 4 hours later!</li>
            <li> and i mean MEGA BAD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more Oompa Loompa tan!</li>
            <li> I have gone to tanning beds in the past and got tired of paying for skin cancer</li>
            <li> Thin liquid with a bunch of small chunks everywhere.</li>
            <li> Years down the road, you may be sorry.  </li>
            <li> Almost too subtle of a tan  </li>
            <li> seriously.  </li>
            <li> seriously.</li>
            <li> Seriously this product is fool proof.</li>
            <li> It goes on with a little color to guide you , I use it with my fake bake application mitt and I just take a lot of time to get it even.</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to apply evenly though.</li>
            <li> bad thing is the color washes off the next day.</li>
            <li> Not a good look.</li>
            <li> Did not experience terrible self tanning odor right away.</li>
            <li> I was a dumb kid that worked my way through college by working a tanning salon.</li>
            <li> I have tried other sunless tanners, only twice before with terrible results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of the sunless tan products from Sun Laboratories, each time I&#x27;ve been profoundly disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells the same as all the rest. :-(</li>
            <li> Definitely try it out because you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> it got lighter, but the second thing I noticed, besides how dark was IT SMELLED TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> You can reapply without exfoliating if you want a tough up on your arms and shoulder or legs....</li>
            <li> I dont know if I got an outdated bottle.or if this product is just garbage.</li>
            <li> Being so pale, I was afraid to try a spray tan or self tanner because if the color is even the slightest orange, I would come out looking like a ommpa loopa.</li>
            <li> I promise you it will look very fake and orange if you are pale.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not orange like everything else I&#x27;ve tried, and it&#x27;s also not too dramatic.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very subtle).  </li>
            <li> but after an hour it stinks just as bad as any other, so I feel like I have to shower before and after applying.</li>
            <li> Also, if you put it on with bare hands it makes your hands look terrible!</li>
            <li> Over all I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> I did end up with a fake tan, and I will continue to use up this bottle, but I don&#x27;t think I would buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> and then be so sorry I did.</li>
            <li> But i guess i was wrong</li>
            <li> Looked like crap after a few days.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, and my Mom can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t look fake.</li>
            <li> and yes, the fake tan scent was there...</li>
            <li> I like it, but the texture is really weird.</li>
            <li> and I walk around smelling faintly of corn chips.</li>
            <li> (does anyone else think fake tan smells like chips?!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have done the spray tanning and it is just too expensive to keep up.</li>
            <li> But the application drives me crazy.  </li>
            <li> So what does my cynical self think?</li>
            <li> They usually smell awful and look orange.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look orange or fake!  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make me look orange or fake!</li>
            <li> but when I used it on my face, it was blotchy and it is very difficult to wash off.</li>
            <li> The lotion was almost impossible to blend in.</li>
            <li> but it still had a bad scent.</li>
            <li> I bought it because the reviews I read said &amp;#34;no bad odor&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> I looked like I had a bad  orange tint.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, either.  </li>
            <li> out I&#x27;d have time to recover before exposure if it was disastrous, after my shower and put on my pj pants...</li>
            <li> i tried to use it three times, and each time i was SO disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended in Consumer Reports, and I was not at all disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m addicted!!!</li>
            <li> Does not look fake at all and had no streaking!!  </li>
            <li> I hate to buy something</li>
            <li> Stained the crap out of my hands. .</li>
            <li> If you have a base tan then you could probably use it.  </li>
            <li> so bad!</li>
            <li> DO NOT use this self tanner with eyebrow dye I had a really bad reaction with the two combined and my eyelids are swollen now!</li>
            <li> it turned my hands a horrifying shade of umber that wouldn&#x27;t rinse away...or scrub away, chemically peel away.</li>
            <li> I was fearful</li>
            <li> I hated it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and will not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make you orange like a lot of self tanners and the smell isn&#x27;t terrible!</li>
            <li> The application is very annoying.</li>
            <li> The worst!</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE!  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> The color was terrible</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell terrible.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have that terrible tanning lotion smell.</li>
            <li> This is the worst self tanning lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I bought the maintainer to see if that helped but that stuff smells horrible!</li>
            <li> The color was streaky and orange, and the smell I smelled like a self tanner even worst when I sweat</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I used to swear by the Faux tanner byb bare minerals until they recently changed their formula to paraben free, the new one is just not as good so I was looking for a new tanner and happened across this one and WOW.  This works just as well as the original one I loved.  No streaks, beautiful color and so easy to apply.  There is NO smell, and After drying I didnt even notice any rubbing off on my clothing.  I&#x27;m buying the bigger bottle next time.</li>
            <li> This self tanning lotion is far too expensive to have an outcome similar or less than any like product I have purchased off the shelf at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me because of the low odor but that was not true at all. I actually had to throw away my pjs because I could not get the odor to wash out. the color is good and the application is smooth, not streaky. I will use for a special occasion if I need color but not for everyday.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Doesn&#x27;t make you orange like a lot of self tanners and the smell isn&#x27;t terrible! Great thing to use if you want to quit tanning!</li>
            <li> Great product....It is a dark lotion so you can see if you have put too much/or not enough on.&lt;br /&gt;Very natural looking tan...i didnt have any orange or streaking!  Love it!</li>
            <li> love this stuff! Easy to blend in and I use it on my face too.  I&#x27;m pretty pale and this gives me a natural looking tan.  There is a slight smell but goes away after shower.</li>
            <li> I got many compliments on my tan, no one knew it was self-tanner. It has a smell, like all fake tans, but it isn&#x27;t super strong. I would recommend using it as an overnight! Make sure to rub it in really well and wash your hands very very frequently bc it does stain! Overall, the color is good and it&#x27;s tinted so you can tell if you miss a spot!</li>
            <li> I have very light skin (my mom is a redhead) and I was nervous about purchasing the medium... but it has been great. I love the shade it turns my skin. It does take some effort with baking soda and a pumice stone to get the color off the palms of my hands, but no biggie.</li>
            <li> Instant tan, and as long as you don&#x27;t put it on everyday, you will NOT have the awful orangey that comes with most self tanners. I am fair skinned and this gives me perfect color. I was intimidated at first, worried about getting it perfect, but now even on my face I can quickly apply. I wash my hands with soap and baking soda to remove the staining after application. I couldn&#x27;t imagine using gloves to successfully apply this. I will be a customer for life, that is for sure!! Come winter, this product is going to be my BEST FRIEND. lol.</li>
            <li> Tried it once and I&#x27;m addicted!!! I love this product! Not only does it give you a nice even tan ,its not streaky!!! It&#x27;s not too smelly like other self tanners .I would reccommed this product to anyone! This product gave me a very nice sunkissed glow!! -Allie ,NH</li>
            <li> This is my first time using tanning lotion and after reading a lot of reviews for this product and others, I decided to go for it. I was nervous about it being too streaky or orange. I&#x27;m very fair skinned. After the first time, I&#x27;m a believer! I rubbed it in well to avoid streaks and the color is awesome. No ugly orange! Looks totally natural.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try yet another self-tanner but I am so happy with the results. If you are looking for a self-tanner that actually smells good, does not leave streaks, and works immediately, this is a great choice. I have used many self-tanners in the past, but his one is by far the best, most effective product I have used. Make sure to exfoliate and lotion up rough areas before applying. You will have to reapply every 3-4 days to maintain the tan, but it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I love that this self tanner is tinted! I get instant gratification and I am able to get the amount of &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; just right! Not too dark and not to light! Also, it doesn&#x27;t have that smell that most self tanners have.</li>
            <li> Just tried this product last night.  When first put on there is absolutely no stinky smell as with most self-tanners.  The color is also good.  Definitely more of a natural brown than orange.  I let the product sit over-night before showering.  Now a few hours later I can tell there is a slight smell due to the tanner, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything anyone would notice but me. Definitely plan on re-ordering this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use for my cruise. I applied it the other night before bed, using the gloves as recommended (several pairs came with the product)and woke up in the morning with a beautiful even, natural looking tan. I loved that the lotion is tinted so that you can see where you have applied and make sure you have it all rubbed in. It looks just like the spray tans that you get at tanning salons, only better because you can cover your feet and hands more accurately. The only drawback is that it develops a very strong odor after a couple of hours just like the booth tans do, so I highly recommend that you do it at night so that you can wash it off the next morning! Love it!</li>
            <li> Pros  -Pleasant smell for a fake tanner  -Ended up with a noticeable decent tan, not too orange, perhaps a little streaky.  Cons  -Goes on initially way too dark to go out in public. That initial darkness fades as soon as you shower into a more natural look, but you need to apply the tan when no one will see you for several hours  -Though it says overnight, I Would not recommend unless you don&#x27;t mind stained sheets.  -It&#x27;s difficult to apply evenly, the lotion is somewhat thick, and tends to dry quickly so it doesn&#x27;t smooth on in an even coat.  -You have to scrub your hands like a maniac immediately after application if you don&#x27;t want black hands.  I bought this fake tanner because they discontinued my last brand, and this one had good reviews. Over all I was not impressed. I did end up with a fake tan, and I will continue to use up this bottle, but I don&#x27;t think I would buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just used the &#x27;very dark&#x27; for the first time and I&#x27;m so excited I found this tanner!  I have pale skin (freckles, red hair - was always the nerd kid wearing the t-shirt in the pool.)  and it takes a lot of patience to get an actual tan without burning for me.  Plus, sun exposure  to the point of tan is not an option due to skin cancer and premature wrinkling.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of self tanners over the years; both drugstore and designer.  So far this one is the best of any I have previously tried.  It is a thick cream that is tinted, so you can easily see where you have applied and avoid streaks.  The cream dries quickly and smells good.  I always apply with my hands as I feel this is the best way to get an even tan.  For all you self tanners that don&#x27;t use your hands to simply avoid the orange palms I have recently picked up a great trick:  put a squirt of hand soap and a bit of whitening toothpaste on a wash cloth when you are done with the application and scrub the insides of your hands/ fingers.  It&#x27;s like magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.  Especially for pale skin.</li>
            <li> The application is very annoying. I love the dark color, but after you shower in the morning you are losing instantly half of intensity. The color is still great, no orange at all. But the application drives me crazy.  I prefer self tanning milks, they seem to moisturize the skin, and don&#x60;t stain  the skin (I don&#x60;t have to wear gloves to put self tan on). You just need a practice to don&#x60;t miss the spot.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do when my other favorite brand was out of stock. I hate to buy something and then be so sorry I did. I read the other reviews for this product, I liked the price and took a chance, and I was glad I bought it! I rate this product right up there at the top. It goes on easily, smells good for a self tanner, has good color and lasts on me. Some other brands wash right off it seems when I shower, you know you can see the water slightly discolored going down the drain, but not this one. Now I have to decide if I&#x27;ll get more of this or my other fav brand when it comes available.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing I love it! I&#x27;m a person with a pale complextion but this stuff brings out a nice natural looking tan. I&#x27;ve gotten the best compliments! It&#x27;s a but pricey for the amount that you get but totally worth it! I wont use anything else!</li>
            <li> I have been using this self tanner for the past year and a half and absolutely love it. The color is more brown than orange, and I constantly get compliments about how natural it looks. I put it on once every 5 days or so and my color stays pretty constant, although if I ever want darker color, I just apply more frequently. It is also very forgiving - I just put it on before I go to bed, put my pajamas on, and I never ever have streaks or blotches! I am a college student on a budget and this is the next best thing to paying for spray tans. I highly recommend trying this product!</li>
            <li> I loved the color that this product gave me but applying it was difficult. First, it&#x27;s a really dark brown color that streaks easily. Every time I use it I have to apply regular lotion all over to prevent streaking. Also, I felt like it dried almost too quickly. If I applied to half my arm and ten seconds later applied it to the other, you could see a line that I had to blend with regular lotion to cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t stink like most sunless tanners or clog my pores. The color is beautiful but it felt like it took way to long to receive the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> Hey now! This is what i&#x27;ve been waiting for! love this product and it gives your skin a glow along with the tan. Caution...it can be a little messy so apply it in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I did research on this product before buying it. Reviews were pretty good! I was pretty excited to try it out!. So i looked around trying to find  the cheapest place. .and i did. ..... i actually thought i ordered the ultra dark. But i guess i was wrong,i ended up with the medium. So. My stuff came in the mail.. took a shower, exfoliated,I&#x27;ve done what I&#x27;m supposed to do. Used the product a few times. Looked like crap after a few days. So i figured i would donthe process all over again. Waited a few days . Got my skin back to normal.once again few days later after reapplying,moisturizing, exfolating the crap out of my skin. Looked gross! It was really orange. If i exfoliated before i shaved you can see lines in my legs!!! It would rub off really super easy! Looked like i had some kind of bad skin condition .. although it does smell really good!!!! Stained the crap out of my hands. . I dont know if I got an outdated bottle.or if this product is just garbage. But I will never buy it again. ...... then Amazon is a bunch of bull. About the free shipping. Theirs a cautch. They automatically charge you 70 bucks for a year or something so you get free shipping on anything you buy for a year or something.and I never buy stuff here. So you get screwed. So Amazon I will never buy from you again!</li>
            <li> Easy to use with a nice tan result. It was darker than I expected so if you are very fair skinned buy the lightest.</li>
            <li> Great product! No smell and doesn&#x27;t turn you orange. It also came quickly and in perfect condition. I will totally be ordering more! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Pros: Applies easily, non-streaky, very natural looking, did not rub off on clothing  Cons: Almost too subtle of a tan  The formula for this product is excellent. I&#x27;m almost a self-tanner virgin, and this was so easy to apply. Before applying I made sure to exfoliate very well and slather dry areas (knees, elbows) in regular lotion. I used gloves to apply all over my body (to avoid crazy orange hands), but it&#x27;s supposed to be ok as long as you make sure to wash your hands thoroughly after. The lotion has a somewhat runny consistency that is easy to apply evenly, and you can clearly see where you&#x27;ve applied. I wore dark clothes to bed just to be safe, but I didn&#x27;t end up with any stains on my clothing or bedsheets. In the morning I had a very natural, streak-free, light bronze tan. I got this shade because I am extremely pale, but even on my skin the results were almost too subtle. It gave a lovely color, but if you&#x27;re looking for a more noticeable difference I would go for one of the darker shades. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion in medium after reading all the great reviews about the extra dark. I&#x27;ve tried Skinny Fake Bake, L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronze, St. Tropez, and Mystic Tans, so I know the techniques of applying it, and to exfoliate extremely well before hand (I scrub with a pumice stone). Before applying, I used plain lotion on my wrists and knees to avoid those parts getting darker, but I thought the tanner is just okay. It still turned out slightly splotchy in parts and the color was only okay. I still cant get the color to look natural on my hands and wrists. Ive been on the hunt for that pefect non orange glow, but this tanner still had a slightly orange tint. In a classroom full of students of a range of skin colors/tans, I was noticably (at least to myself)oranger than everyone else. Plus the color is a still quite dark, so people will notice unless you mix the tanner with plain lotion. I have extremely pale irish skin that won&#x27;t tan on its own, so maybe the color just turned out orangy because of my pale starting complextion. When I showered the next morning, I could see the color running down the drain and the color goes almost all the way away. Its difficult to stay the same skin tone with this product without frequent application. The product was okay, and for the money, much better than Fake Bake, Mystic Tan and St. Tropez, but it didn&#x27;t entirely fufill my expectations after reading all the other reviews.</li>
            <li> This is my first review on Amazon...so you know that means this self tanner was AWESOME! I have gone to tanning beds in the past and got tired of paying for skin cancer so I decided to try self tanner. I have tried a lot of self tanners out there and believe me when I say that Sun Laboratories is the best. It has a yummy scent when you put it on...I have seen some reviews that they say after you put it on it brings back that old nasty self tanning smell....Honestly I couldn&#x27;t smell anything and I asked the people around me and they couldn&#x27;t either. I used it for the first time yesterday..I would recommend exfoliating first...I did not use gloves, I didn&#x27;t need to because it came right off my hands when I washed them. I have a perfect golden tan and no streaks.Really I look like I live in Mexico..haha You put it on like you would lotion...I would recommend buying the \\&quot;dark\\&quot; self tanner. I will recommend this product to anyone!!! And any review that says this product makes them look orange or streaky...dont believe it.[[ASIN:B00266UK7E SUN LABORATORIES Self Tanning Lotion Tan Overnight - Medium (8 oz)]]</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying, I never write reviews on products I buy. NEVER. this is my first one. I never have time, nor do I really care too. BUT, this is such a great product. I could not be happier with it. I&#x27;m very pale and have a hard time tanning, I end up looking like a lobster. I&#x27;ve never used a self tanner before and I&#x27;m glad this was the first one I tried. I got it in medium. It gives me a beautiful healthy glow, it&#x27;s not super dark and I love that. It looks like a healthy tan. Very easy to apply. Only down side is the stain of your hands. I suggest using gloves. I was able to remove the color from my palms with hands soap and toothpaste, but there is still a faint color on them. Other than that I absolutely love this product! I would definitely recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST sunless tanner ever!  Comes out of the bottle already a dark brown color so u can see exactly where u are putting it. Does not streak or leave \\&quot;orange spots\\&quot; around joints. I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> The worst! Went on streaky and left my legs a weird pinkish brown color! not at all the golden brown from a natural tan. i would not recommend this to anyone! i tried to use it three times, and each time i was SO disappointed. i ended up throwing the bottle away.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 8 years and it is one of the best on the market. It gives a great natural looking tan without the orange cast you sometimes get with similar products. It is best to use vinyl or latex gloves to apply the product to keep the palms of your hands from turning brown. I have also found out it is necessary to blend the lotion well in areas of the skin that have wrinkles (eg.the knuckles on the tops of the hands)in order to avoid dark lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are applying it alone a thick layer of gauze pad taped to a long serving spoon helps to reach the areas on your back your hands can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> I was told that this came with a mitt, but it didn&#x27;t, so that was disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the color is great. Once I mastered putting it on smoothly, it&#x27;s a nice dark color, but not too orange. My favorite self tanner is Fake Bake Flawless, but the color takes more applications to get as dark as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial smell is fine. It&#x27;s pretty sweet smelling. However, on my skin, the self tan smell is pretty apparent after it starts working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it has the color guide. It makes application soooo much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of advice: If you get sunburned and peel, do NOT use this (or any other self tanner). I didn&#x27;t even think about it, but when it developed, the color was super dark and long lasting where I had already peeled and light everywhere else. Exfoliate, exfoliate exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking it was the medium and not the dark one because the picture clearly shows the word medium on the bottom of the front of the bottle. however, they shipped me the \\&quot;very dark.\\&quot; I know someone who wants to buy the dark bottle from me so I don&#x27;t have to ship it back but now I have to re order and wait.</li>
            <li> I have invested lots of money in drugstore self tanners so I thought I&#x27;d try something a little more expensive. I am a pale red head and all self tanners look orange on me. I really liked the color with this product. The color it gives you is natural and the best part about this product. Unfortunately like most self tanners, it has a typical \\&quot;self tanner\\&quot; smell. In order to use the product, I put it on before bed and shower in the morning. I do not notice it coming off but I would not go out in public after putting on this lotion (because of the smell). The other thing that bothers me about this product is it does not look natural on my hands or feet. It gives a great color on my arms, legs, and chest but it looks splotchy on my hands and feet and fades faster. I tried avoiding them altogether but then I had really pale hands and feet while the rest of my body was tan....</li>
            <li> works great!  Just wish there was a way to not get my hands so orangy/tanny while applying.&lt;br /&gt;I think I need to buy gloves?</li>
            <li> I really thought this lotion was going to be great but it was everything but that.  If you are pale then DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  I promise you it will look very fake and orange if you are pale.  I have light skin and dark hair and I couldn&#x27;t even leave my house after I had put this stuff on.  I looked like I needed to be sitting in a fruit basket.  HORRIBLE!  If you have a base tan then you could probably use it.  I ended up giving mine to my father because he is very tanned.  It looked ok on him but it does wash off easy and I found it coming off on my clothing days after I applied it.  I would never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am pasty white with freckles.  I burn quite easily in tanning beds and being outside.  I&#x27;ve used so many self tanners over the years I cannot name them all.  I&#x27;ve used sprays, mouse, lotion and towelettes.  There&#x27;s a few products that worked well for me but had strong odors.  This lotion is perfect!!  I&#x27;ve applied it several different ways; right after the shower, after a long at day work, under and over other moisturizers..  For me the best way is over a moisturizer applied after the shower.  With any self tanner you&#x27;ll have darker patches on your knees and ankles, but applying a moisturizer before applying this stuff seems to help prevent that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned real quick you need to wear gloves when putting this stuff on.  It tints your skin VERY quickly.  It&#x27;s useful as a guide to see where you&#x27;ve already applied it.  It doesn&#x27;t look like its rubbed in evenly at first, DONT FREAK OUT!!  Give it a few hours to absorb.  Hence why it&#x27;s suggested to use before bed time.  I use it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t cause me break out.  It makes my skin a little oily though but not bad.  The day after is the best!!  You&#x27;re not orange or brown, it&#x27;s a natural looking glowing tan and it&#x27;s gorgeous!!&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered this twice, so that should tell you how well I like it!!  The second time I got the tan extender lotion.  This stuff is truly amazing!!  It&#x27;s a rather thick cream and smells so good!!  It makes my skin so soft and it does help extend he life of your tan!!  I have cracking skin my knuckles and this heeled it in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;I reapply the tanning lotion every 3 days to my whole body and touch up places that fade out faster every other day.&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution to those who workout a lot.  You already know the struggle of self tanners bleeding out when you sweat, this one is no different.  I have to touch up my chest, back and arms every other day.&lt;br /&gt;It will stain clothes if it bleeds out but it washes right out.  I highly recommend this lotion and sellerif you use self tanners!!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> used this for my high school reunion, I looked fresh, and tan and had a nice glow without that fake orange coloring.  Love this stuff, works like a champ and dries fast on the skin.  I would suggest wearing gloves when applying though!</li>
            <li> Best self tanner&lt;br /&gt;great natural color</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner that I have used.  Easy to blend and not &amp;#34;orangey&amp;#34;!  It gives you a very natural look.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This really made for a natural looking tan. The only problem I had was trying to get it off my hands after application. It really stains and is hard to wash off the hands, making it a dead giveaway that it&#x27;s fake. I mix it with body lotion to make it blend better and that helped.</li>
            <li> This product works great.  Easy to apply...definitely wear gloves. Smells decent. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because I wish it lasted longer. One shower (even 24hrs later) &amp; it faded. Much more natural looking tan than other products I&#x27;ve used &amp; definitely streaks less &amp; less darkening on elbows &amp; ankles than other brands. Would recommend really rubbing it thoroughly on your toes, if you&#x27;re doing that area -- I didn&#x27;t &amp; my toes were way darker than the rest of my foot. Not a good look.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and easy to spread! Also it doesnt leave a weird smell, which is GREAT! The product leaves a nice tan immediately, doesn&#x27;t last too too long, but is perfect when you want that quick tan on the go!!</li>
            <li> I am super white! I have freckles and burn like a tomato. This is the only tanner that doesn&#x27;t make me look orange. Don&#x27;t be scared of the instant tint. If you know how DHA works, then you know that there is a chemical reaction that actually darkens skin cells. The instant tint will wash away when you shower, leaving you with a natural even looking tan, from the DHA. Just be careful around wrists and ankles, I blend with lotion in these area&#x27;s. And I always wear gloves. I researched for weeks and decided on this one because of cost and performance. Very glad I did! Oh yeah, and my Mom can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s fake. Trust me, she is not one to hold her tongue, and she couldn&#x27;t tell I stopped going to the tanning bed. Also it&#x27;s smells good. What else do you want? Skin cancer?</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews and it has truely made my &amp;#34;bare legged&amp;#34; summers a dream.  It goes on without that sticky smelly mess of most self tanners, and smells pretty good.  It has a tint which balances out the usual orange tone, so I use it in the morning to take advantage of that.  The color doesn&#x27;t last very long, which I like, because you don&#x27;t get those weird semi-tan blotches as it wear off.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was told this stuff was good. And it is. Works great with no smell. Most self-tanners will make you smell. This one doesn&#x27;t. Also most tanners leave elbows and knees and ankles a mess. I haven&#x27;t had trouble with this one. I bought it to get me through the end of summer/early fall. When the weather is nice enough for shorts but your tan is fading so fast you don&#x27;t feel comfortable in shorts. Well this stuff is perfect. Just enough color to take away that feeling of being too white but it doesn&#x27;t make you so dark that you feel unnatural. The only complaint is how dark it made my palms while trying to apply. It washes and wears off but it&#x27;s really dark at first.</li>
            <li> I am olive skinned and tan-ish. I haven&#x27;t been tanning all year but have sat in the sun a couple times just to get lightly toasted. I have tried every drug store brand as well as a couple fancier types. I bought this product because it has pretty good reviews and also because the price on AMAZON is better then most places. I wanted a quick tan that showed up immediately, looked natural and stayed for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;FAST:It showed up immediately and developed a little more after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;GOOD COLOR: It did not appear orange on my olive skin. It complimented the browner tones in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;SNIFF SNIFF: THe smell was pleasant. Better then any other brands I have used. And after awhile it didn&#x27;t turn to that dry stink that usually follows application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;OLD LOTION: I feel like the lotion is too thick sometimes and thin other times...as if perhaps its OLD.You know how you go to a drug store and buy salon products and they are not guarenteed unless you buy them from a real salon. I feel the same way about this product.&lt;br /&gt;DYES HANDS QUICKLY: I would recommend putting hand lotion on your palms first before applying so that it doesn&#x27;t dye your hands. It sets in fast so by the time your done with your arms its pretty well dyed your hands. I have also used cheap plastic/latex gloves (snatched from my dr office hee hee!) to apply.&lt;br /&gt;WILL STREAK: If not rubbed in completely and allowed to dry completely it will streak. Even after it dried once I went and sat outside. After crossing my legs for a bit the sweat spot on the back of my leg formed and made a prominant...and embaressing line I had to go back and fix later. Not cute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;d good. I purchased the \\&quot;overnight\\&quot; by mistake and will not get it next time. I use it on occasion just because I bought two bottles and even though its not my dream product I can&#x27;t really let it go to waste. I will try the brand again but not the overnight variety.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this as it is tinted (so I thought it wouldn&#x27;t streak so bad) and supposedly has no smell.&lt;br /&gt;It fell short.  Still had streaks despite everything I did to try and get it on smoothly, and even though it doesn&#x27;t smell in the bottle I guess the actual change in your skin causes a smell because after about an hour it smelled exactly like every other sunless tanner I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to Jergens Natural Glow... less streaks when you do it gradually.</li>
            <li> Did not experience terrible self tanning odor right away. The smell did develop more as the product set overnight, I woke up and did not smell too great, but it is worth it for the beautiful dark color. I am extremely pale and this product does not leave me orange. As with most self tanners, the results are largely in part to your application techniques so I can only blame myself for slight streaking on my wrists where I got my hands too wet right afterwards.</li>
            <li> I was a dumb kid that worked my way through college by working a tanning salon. Big mistake! I have worked long and hard to fix the damage that has been done to my skin since then, and have been very successful thankfully. Through my own research, seeing a dermatologist, and esthetician I have made a huge difference in my skins health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I miss my summer glow so bad! So after much though, and research I stumbled upon Sun laboratories. I have tried other sunless tanners, only twice before with terrible results. They usually smell awful and look orange. I can promise you this absolutely comes out looking brown/tan instead of orange!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- First off it smells great, BUT the smell does wear off and you will have to deal with the fake tanner smell until you take a shower. Then its fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I noticed allot of people when they put it on its looks streaky and then they wash it off in the morning and it looks fine. I did NOT have this problem. I was able to rub it into my skin evenly with no streaks. I knew when it was going to be delivered so I moisturized the 2 days leading up to me getting it, and then exfoliated. So that may have helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I put it on at night right after I showered and exfoliated, and washed it off in the morning for those wondering about its application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It will super stain the palms of your hands! Lol I had a small moment of panic when trying to wash it off. Use a strong soap, and add some baking soda and you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Be carful around your elbow&#x27;s, knee&#x27;s, and ankles. Use it sparsely in those areas and rub it in good.</li>
            <li> This works fast and evenly.  I have no complaints other than being able to faintly smell it.  People walking by you will not notice it but it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the new Jergens sunless tanning - but Jergens isn&#x27;t near as fast at tanning.</li>
            <li> Very good tanner. Stains your hands very easily but comes off with a good scrubbing! Advise you to use gloves when applying to your skin.... Goes on evenly and easy to apply. Doesn&#x27;t make you look orange!</li>
            <li> I have Irish pale freckled skin and have tried MANY different self tanning agents over the past 10 years. Mystic tan beat out all others color wise but there is little control over where it&#x27;s applied and the cost is ridiculous ($20 per spray?) not to mention you may have to drive home from the salon in 98degree weather which means you&#x27;ll be sweating streaks all the way home. I love the color of this product. There is a greenish hue to the lotion which means you&#x27;re getting more of an olive tan than the typical orange. That&#x27;s a good thing. Apply with gloves and rub in circular motions. Sponge apply your hands and feet. I use it on my face being careful afterward to use a barely damp cloth to wipe off eyebrows, lightly blot the space between my brows, above the lips (avoid the Lindsey Lohan tan-stach), nose creases, and chin. Then blend those areas a bit with a clean sponge. I have dark under eye circles so I wipe those areas clean with a damp cloth and do the same with eyelids, zits, and small scars on my face using damp q-tips. This greatly evens out skin tone. The bronzer (which is really helpful for even application) will wash off when you shower and you&#x27;ll be left with less bronze but a more natural look. Follow up with a second or third coat if you wish. I do. For a particular event I&#x27;ve been known to apply a coat early morning, rinse after lunch, repeat application, and rinse again after dinner. The next day I&#x27;m ready for my bikini. I am experienced with these products and my description of use may sound simpler than it really is for a novice. It&#x27;s a lot of time and trouble with exfoliating, shaving, and all that but it&#x27;s worth it for those special events or if you simply have the time to kill to get it right. As someone who absolutely CANNOT tan, I love this stuff and get so many compliments on my appearance (not on the tan itself) when using this product. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far so I give it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> Gives just enough color in the winter so it doesn&#x27;t look fake. This does no make you look orange at all.</li>
            <li> This products is great!  I&#x27;m a redhead and very fair skinned and a mature woman and have always had trouble with sunless products.  They usually look very unnatural, but this one looks natural and doesn&#x27;t turn my age spots too dark.  Of course you have to be careful about how much you use.  If you use it sparingly it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this and had read a lot of positive reviews on it but I was pretty disappointed. The lotion was almost impossible to blend in. Even when I thought I had gotten it all I had stray streaks and spots later in the day. The one positive was it did in fact give me a desired amount of tan, but otherwise it wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! With a few simple tricks (like using rubber Playtex gloves to apply, standing in front of a mirror to see what you&#x27;re doing, and rubbing very quickly) I get a gorgeous tan instantly.  It&#x27;s so awesome to know that I can be immediately tan any time I want!    There is no bad odor when you apply it.  After several hours there is a faint odor but not anywhere near the odor of other brands I&#x27;ve tried. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This stuff gives me a natural color without looking orange or streaky. I love that I can just put it on before bed like I would lotion &amp; tada! I&#x27;m tan in the morning. My favorite part though had to be the awesome smell! I&#x27;m used to tanning lotions smelling like feet, but this has an almondy/cherry scent.</li>
            <li> Streaky. Unnatural color. Hard to apply. I&#x27;ve tried several of the sunless tan products from Sun Laboratories, each time I&#x27;ve been profoundly disappointed. Don&#x27;t waste your time or your money on anything by Sun Laboratories.</li>
            <li> First of all this will most definitely stain your hands so wear gloves.  The color is very natural (I am fair skinned) but doesn&#x27;t last long so you must apply every few days to keep the color.  The smell at first is pleasant but as the tan develops that sunless tan smell will come on.  I apply at night so that the smell wont bother me and then rinse and moisturize in the morning.  Overall a great product.  I gave it 4 stars because of the fact that the color fades quickly.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I can&#x27;t say enough good about it, it&#x27;s easy to put on and produces a GREAT color, I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on it.  Will for sure buy again.</li>
            <li> Goes on even and easy.... Very natural color!</li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde and have been very pale my whole life. Skin cancer runs in my family so I am very iffy about tanning beds. But Tanning beds never helped anyways because I would just get a sunburn and no tan. Being so pale, I was afraid to try a spray tan or self tanner because if the color is even the slightest orange, I would come out looking like a ommpa loopa. I did a lot of research and found this product and now I never have to be pale again. It makes me look tan, it gives me confidence, and its just amazing. If you are a natural blonde, you understand how frustrating it can be to just walk outside in a pair of shorts being so white. This product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Very nice, natural looking color. I don&#x27;t find any orange undertones with this. My only complaint is that sometimes it dries a little too quickly, before I&#x27;m able to smooth out all the streaks.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time researching the best self tanning lotions and this always came up in the top 3 for every blogger out there so I decided to try it out, and it worked like a charm! Seriously, within 3 hours my skin was noticeably darker, no streaks, it was super easy to see where you were putting it on so I didn&#x27;t miss any spots!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t really a complaint but my palms got REALLY DARK putting this on (I bought the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; 8oz), and I didn&#x27;t buy the mitt to help put it on because the reviews on them were terrible and said they pretty much broke apart and disintegrated while using them. So, I had to wash my palms and scrub with baking soda to get it off. It took a couple of rinses, but eventually my palms went back to normal and didn&#x27;t affect the rest of my tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it worked great!</li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion! It has a long lasting realistic color, just be prepared with baking soda to get the color off of yours hands!</li>
            <li> i get very pale in the winter time and wanted an alternative to tanning. so when i got this i was thrilled cause first off, this is a really good high quality product. and second, i got it for way less than retail price! ive used it twice now and i must say it&#x27;s amazing! i look like i did mid summer. it&#x27;s not orange-y or streaky at all, just very natural looking</li>
            <li> The good thing about the overnight self tanner is that it has a color so you can see where you are putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;The bad thing is the color washes off the next day. It really stains your hands so wear gloves. The color was terrible&lt;br /&gt;on my face, do not recommend that at all. The color was ok on my arms and very blotchy on my legs.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly light skin that burns quickly in the sun, then peels, and I get no visible tan. I don&#x27;t like the idea of tanning beds and I&#x27;ve found that spray tans (I&#x27;ve tried Mystic Tan and VersaSpa) leave me super orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product after reading a blog that recommended it to me (can&#x27;t remember or I&#x27;d share it!) and was impressed with the results. It left me with a natural brown tan but it also had a little bit of red to it to make it look like it actually came from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tips are to work quickly, wear gloves, and use a tight weave, soft towel (like a car chamois)to apply. Use a mirror and make sure that you aren&#x27;t leaving streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a feeling I will be using this product for years to come!</li>
            <li> good product gave it 4 out of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;gave a good tan, for someone who has lighter complexion.&lt;br /&gt;you really have to rub it in, its a bit of work but it makes an awesome sun kissed tan&lt;br /&gt;does have a light tanner odor, but all in all not bad&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with this product.  It does not leave you with an orange tint...the color is brown, but not orange at all.  The scent is very light and has none of that \\&quot;cooked potatoes\\&quot; smell that lots of others do.  I have tried many of these types of items on my Irish girl skin and this is the ONLY one I will endorse.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  The color is very natural.  The only thing is, it&#x27;s a little difficult to blend.  Had to be very careful that I didn&#x27;t leave any unblended areas or missed areas. Sometimes had to reapply to missed spots. However, it&#x27;s cheaper than the tanning sheets and maybe I need a little practice with it!</li>
            <li> So far, so good! Make sure to rub it in super fast because it dried fast. The color is great so far. Used baking soda and soap to scrub off the color from my palms and it worked great, I don&#x27;t know what the big deal about the hands and glove thing is. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion by far. Put on before bed and shower in the morning and you have a perfect glow. Lasts about three days and wouldn&#x27;t suggest putting on face.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion. It smells amazing and comes out brown so Its easy to see where you put it. DO NOT use this self tanner with eyebrow dye I had a really bad reaction with the two combined and my eyelids are swollen now!</li>
            <li> This stuff has a greenish tint to the bronzer when you first apply it. It&#x27;s gone once you wash it off though. The tan it leaves looks natural and even. To remove the stuff from your palms just use toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Great product and was very Easy to apply.  Never had a self tanner last like this one.  Will buy again and recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like this tanner was the best. The color is fairly natural but it was so difficult to apply due to the drying time, and due to the dryness it&#x27;s even more difficult to apply the product evenly.&lt;br /&gt;Turns your hands brown if you don&#x27;t use a mitt because it dries so darn fast! I am going to try Tanwise instead.</li>
            <li> I tried this self-tanning lotion after reading a blog review of how wonderful it is and it didn&#x27;t disappoint!  I have fair tone skin and most self tanning products make me look like a nacho cheese dorito, but not this stuff.  I got excellent color without the orange tint, not to mention that it smells wonderful (not typical of many self tanning products).  The only thing I can really warn you about is that it will stain your hands, use gloves or a tanning mitt to apply it and make sure to stay away from light colored objects for a little while.  It doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry, or for the color to show up either.  I&#x27;ve seen a number of reviews for other self tanning lotions and I&#x27;ve tried many of them, but this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used, I&#x27;ll never go back to another brand.</li>
            <li> It was recommended and has no smell- what could be better! Looks natural and dries quickly. Great for those of us who want to wear sandals on vacation but would like a little color before we get to our sunny destination!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I am blonde and quite pale in the winter so this product gives me some color without using the tanning bed and damaging my skin.. I love the color it gives me- not orange at all, and the smell is bearable and goes away after a few hours. The only complaint I would have about it is it stains my palms very quickly... If I put the lotion on my whole body (face included) I have to stop and wash my hands multiple times because if I wait till the end, they are already stained. Overall a GREAT self- tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> No as good as the aresol can. Washes off easy tan does not last long didnt care for this product.</li>
            <li> The color this product leaves behind is lovely. Warm, natural looking tan. Very realistic color, not at all orange. Loved the tint it left on my fair skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is not a product you can just slap on before bed and wake up looking sun-kissed and perfect. There is a good amount of preparation needed and time invested  to avoid a splotchy mess as I found out on my first try. (This is not my first go round with self tanner, but this product is far less forgiving than some others) You really need to wear gloves with this. It dries and sets incredibly fast. Even working in sections and washing in between it turned my hands a horrifying shade of umber that wouldn&#x27;t rinse away...or scrub away, chemically peel away. Nightmare.  If you have any dry patches this will highlight your reptile skin.&lt;br /&gt;So be ready. Get clean, exfoliated and well moisturized ahead of time. Get some latex gloves. Work in small sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You definitely want to make sure to apply this at night and take a shower in the morning. You wouldn&#x27;t want to go out in the day with this on.  It&#x27;s tinted so you can be sure not to miss any spots but the lotion has a strange greenish tint to it and where the product overlaps leaves dark lines.  It all rinses away and comes out a nice and even, lightly tanned shade after bathing. Fragrance is pleasant upon application but develops the same funky smell all the tanning products get once the chemical reactions start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color lasts about three days and fades rather evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I knew what I was in for successive applications have had great results. Does a great job at making skin look naturally young and healthy and minimizing imperfections.</li>
            <li> I found this recommended in a top 3 sunless tanner review on Pinterest. Covers great, not streaky and does not smell bad like most other lotions tend to. I was very pale when I used this and was extremely pleased with the results after one application, instant tan! My only advice is to WEAR GLOVES when applying. This stuff really works, so it&#x27;s going to stain your hands. Washing them after applying wasn&#x27;t enough. Definitely good stuff!</li>
            <li> Great color....but it still had a bad scent. I bought it because the reviews I read said &amp;#34;no bad odor&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s smells the same as all the rest. :-(</li>
            <li> One of the most natural looking tan from a self tanning lotion that I have found...I definitely will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Do not take lightly the discoloration of your hands. I have tried several self tanning products and this one will leave your hands dark with product no matter what you try.  It&#x27;s consistency is more liquid than lotion and is hard to get and even coverage.  Try something else out there. . Skip this one!</li>
            <li> I heard such great things about this product, in reality, its not great.  I did everything that you are supposed to do with self tanners..  and at first it looked like it would come out fine and then it started making my skin dry and peal.  Maybe if you have super oily skin, this product is good, but I&#x27;m unimpressed.  The color is defiantly not as dark as I thought it would be either.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> You really have to be sure you take your time and EVENLY rub this is, especially when doing the backs of your legs. Use the mirror to double check the coverage before it sets in, because it easily streaks or dries in patches if you&#x27;re not careful. I do use latex gloves when I apply this, otherwise it gets under your nails. You really have to wash your hands thoroughly if you don&#x27;t wear gloves. Once it really soaks in and your skin feels dry again, you can see the difference. It washes / wears off in a day or two, so reapplication to stay dark is necessary. But if you take the time to apply it correctly, it is a nice hue and not that funky orange that a lot of other sunless tanners.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Gives you a natural looking glow. I used it with a dab of regular lotion to help it be a little thinner and not as dark. Lasts forever and does the trick! Love this product</li>
            <li> I like the color of this tanning lotion and it&#x27;s very reasonably priced.  My only real complaint is that it didn&#x27;t work for my neck and face.  It just looked like I smeared dirt on those areas.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF. lasts a while. gorgeous color. doesn&#x27;t smell terrible. stains hands but that is easy to fix. will buy again</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have that terrible tanning lotion smell. Looks natural. Has enough color that you can see where you&#x27;ve applied it. Easy to use and great results.</li>
            <li> I really like this self tanner because it doesn&#x27;t make your skin look orange. But, it is kind of streaky and if you don&#x27;t cover every inch it can end up looking splotchy. I mixed it with a regular unscented moisturizer which helped with that. Since I started doing that it goes on evenly and I like the product so much more. I would buy it again now that I have it figured out. Also, if you put it on with bare hands it makes your hands look terrible! But, washing your hands with some soap and baking soda took care of that.</li>
            <li> Not as good as fake bake and didn&#x27;t like the color of my skin and weird smell. If u like self tanners get fake bake flawless and be happy</li>
            <li> Best sunless tan I&#x27;ve used to date. Smell is minimal and tolerable and it leaves a nice even tan that isn&#x27;t orange and lasts longer than most. When it starts to fade, it fades evenly as well, not in patches like some.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Looks like a real tan with no sparkles. Everyone complements what a great tan you have!&lt;br /&gt;Try it you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> I tried this lotion last night after reading several *glowing* reviews (no pun intended)... and I must say, I&#x27;m absolutely smitten with this product. As a naturally pale gal with light hair/light eyes, I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market, but hear me when I say... THIS. IS. THE. REAL. DEAL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used some disposable vinyl gloves to apply all over (face to ankles) and immediately looked sun-kissed. So what does my cynical self think? &amp;#34;This stuff HAS to be too good to be true.&amp;#34; And with that... I went to bed fully expecting to wake up looking like a freak. To my surprise there was ZERO orange, ZERO streaking, and NONE of that &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; way-too-tan look when I awoke. I simply look like I just strolled in off the beach with a light, 100% natural tan. I showered and was a teeny bit lighter than before, but was still impressed with the uniform tan that was maintained. The jury is still out on how long this will last, but if it&#x27;s only a day or two--I&#x27;ll still be a happy girl! My pale gams are forever changed.</li>
            <li> It seemed streaky at first but I just used too much. After I trued a lil less it was great. Not orange at all and I have very fair skin. Worked very well. And inexpensive too.</li>
            <li> Nice, even color. Good tone. Doesn&#x27;t necessarily last long, but no awful odor as with some others. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Gives me a little bit of instant color &amp; gets a little darker over time!  Doesn&#x27;t look orange or fake!  I use an applicator mit so I don&#x27;t make a mess of my hands but if I do get some on them, a little bit of baking soda takes it right off!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best self-tanners I&#x27;ve used. I was very happy with it. The hardest thing is getting it off your hands after you apply. But I found cotton balls work well for applying or for removing it from my hands.</li>
            <li> It DOES give the skin a foul odor, but it gives a great color quickly, and it looks natural for the most part. Be sure to get your hairline and wrists.</li>
            <li> This is a very good sun tan product.  However, I was totally unprepared for it.  The muddy appearance of the cream is a shock.  And you have to be quick to wash your hands vigorously after application.  I think it gives a good looking tan and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m extremely pale, but I wouldn&#x27;t be anywhere close to the definition of &amp;#34;naturally dark complected&amp;#34; either. I bought this product in medium, and I feel like it was the perfect amount of tint for my skin tone. I&#x27;ve always loved having a tan, regardless if it was from the sun, tanning bed, or sunless tan lotion. And even at my darkest tan in mid-to-late summer, my skin/tan almost has a hint of orange to it -maybe one would call it &amp;#34;golden&amp;#34; rather than brown ;) But this lotion really creates a great color that compliments my natural skin tone. There&#x27;s not any hint of &amp;#34;fake orange&amp;#34; at all, just be sure to thoroughly clean/scrub your hands after applying or use gloves (I used gloves and had great results). I gave up on tanning beds, and as it is late February, I&#x27;ve been craving tan skin. I am very impressed with this product and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> This lotion is fabulous! The best sunless tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t streak, stink or turn skin orange. It is dark brown in color so it&#x27;s easy to tell where coverage is, and where spots are that need more lotion. No more guessing and waiting to see if you got everywhere, only to have a nasty orange streak 4 hours later! The dark color is a little shocking, but it makes for instant tanning, with full color coming after about 3-4 hours. If it ever rubs against clothing or towels it comes out in the wash and won&#x27;t stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results I shave my legs first, then put a good lotion over my feet, toes, elbows, knees and ankles to eliminate over saturation. Then I lather on the Sun Labs, and have beautiful, soft, tan skin for about 5-7 days. Make sure to wash hands after using.&lt;br /&gt;I do notice a mild warm smell 3-4 hours after using the tanner, but doing a quick shower or rinse as early as 4 hours after use, will eliminate the smell, and still leave a beautiful tan. The odor is nothing compared to the stink of Jergins&#x27; or Neutragena&#x27;s sunless tanners.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the pump bottle. It reduces the mess!&lt;br /&gt;This makes beautiful results on my face but I have noticed that it clog pores. So if I use it on my face, I always exfoliate that evening.</li>
            <li> This is the worst self tanning lotion I have ever used. It stains your hands immediately. I had to wash my hands at  least 4 times to get it off. It also stained my sheets. I applied the lotion long before I got into bed but it still rubbed onto my sheets. It goes on very streaky too. Not smooth. Very disappointed and will not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> This lotion does the job.  It gives you instant color and buildable color, at that.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, it will wash off, or rub off after a nice, long hot shower.  So your tan def doesn&#x27;t last long like a real tan, and I don&#x27;t really think it is an actual self tanner?  Most of the other ones I&#x27;ve used &#x27;stay&#x27; on your skin until it fades.  This one, washes or rubs off on your towel (we have white, and it was brown after drying).&lt;br /&gt;My one helpful hint: WASH YOUR HANDS AS SOON AS YOU CAN AFTER APPLICATION...with hot water and soap or you&#x27;ll be wishing you had NEVER tried this stuff.  :)</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. Definitely worth the extra money compared to Jergen&#x27;s. It gives you a very nice tan over night that doesn&#x27;t look orange at all and it lasts quite a while. My only word of advice is put it on using gloves!</li>
            <li> As a novice self-tanner I was a little intimidated when I first received this product and read other reviews.  I was fearful I would apply the self-tanner and wake up 3 different shades of orange and smeared from one end to the other.  Quite the opposite!!! I first applied after a shower at night and a subtle color was instant making even application a sinch. When I woke up in the morning my body was glowing tan, like I has visited the beach overnight. AND it was a beautiful brown bronze color, NOT A BIT ORANGE! I had a few smears on my wrists and feet, but nothing no one but myself could ever notice and my tan lasted a few days.  I have applied it a few times since then and each time I get more comfortable and with less mistakes.  Everyone compliments my tan and I feel so much more confident wearing shorts now that my legs are ghostly pale! You can still tan with the sun through this product so be careful but it is a good filler until you get a real tan. My only suggestion is to use gloves when applying and wait until the tan completely fades before reapplying. I also didn&#x27;t use on my face, I did use up my neck and throat, but avoided my face just to be safe. I TOTALLY recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This product worked exactly as expected.  I&#x27;m very fair skinned and was nervous about it adding too much color or being orange, but it adds just enough of a tan to look natural but not draw too much attention, so I have a light tan color all through the winter.</li>
            <li> Best sunless tanner ever. Works great. I&#x27;m fair skinned. My bf is pale. Works on both of us great. Use baking soda and water to get it off your hands. Or toothpaste. That works too ;)</li>
            <li> Excellent product!! Color looks very natural. Great for pale skin. Very little product needed for results. This bottle will last a while.</li>
            <li> it does the job ok but to dark for me</li>
            <li> This product arrived green in color. Unusable. I&#x27;ve purchased direct from the manufacturer before but figured Amazon would be easier, now I&#x27;m returning.&lt;br /&gt;When product is fresh it&#x27;s great! Would get rashes from other products (sensitive skin). This always my tried and true, but back to ordering from LA</li>
            <li> Really orange and hard to apply evenly. Not a fan.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from beauty blogger maskCARA! I am an incredibly pale Irish girl who lacks the ability to tan naturally, so I decided to give this sunless tanning thing a try. Sun Labs medium sunless tanning lotion is incredibly natural looking! You would never know my tan came from a bottle. It isn&#x27;t too dark either, it&#x27;s just right. I re-apply every 2 days or so, and sometimes I add it to lotion when I just want to keep it from fading. I will definitely be buying this again! Great product overall!</li>
            <li> I have VERY fair skin, I have seriously tried tons of product/tanning beds. I have been using the Jergens natural glow lotion because is doesn&#x27;t make be streaky. I literally just opened up the package, and it arrived REALLY fast I got it days before the estimated arrival days so that&#x27;s awesome...but...when I opened it the tub of the  pump was really messy so it made me nervous that y package may be defective, its not, but that kinda sucked. So when I put just a little on my finger it looked so dark...like so so dark, I put a little on my wrist and the more I rubbed it into my wrist it got lighter, but the second thing I noticed, besides how dark was IT SMELLED TERRIBLE! and I am not sensitive to smells but I really did not like the smell at all I was really surprised. however, if I smell my wrists I cant smell it anymore. WASH YOUR HANDS AFTER. seriously.  Okay ,all that sounds really bad but so far I am excited to see how this product works! I can already see a difference in my wrists!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I thought the \\&quot;medium\\&quot; would look too light or not make a difference but it definitely does! You apply it and there is instant color that develops even more throughout the night (or day, whenever you apply it). I use it about 2 times a week and moisturize my \\&quot;off\\&quot; days to keep the color looking even. Not going to lie though, the first time I applied it and this dark brownish green comes out of the bottle, I was a little nervous but it goes away as you rub it in. Again, I love this product. Will purchase again and again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other lotions before and we all know the types of issues you can have with them - streaking, smell etc. This one is really different. Lotion rubs on quite easily (and it&#x27;s actually brown in color so you can see what parts are yet to be blended it, making even application easy) and dries immediately (I use latex gloves as per other reviewers suggestions and it works much better than using your bare hand). You can see a noticeable difference in your skin tone right away and it does become enhanced slightly after a few hours. I use it on my face and body with no irritation or negative effects. It gives a very natural looking color. I am very, very pale with dark hair and this product doesn&#x27;t make me look like I have a fake tan, it just makes me look like I have a nice healthy glow which is exactly what I was hoping for. If I feel like I&#x27;m looking a little pale one day, I just put some on and I look much less ghostly and very natural - it&#x27;s so low maintenance and easy to use. Very minimal smell but it&#x27;s not that bad. Lasts (for me) about 2 days before I need to reapply. Definitely try it out because you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It goes on with a little color to guide you , I use it with my fake bake application mitt and I just take a lot of time to get it even. The good thing about it is that it won&#x27;t leave a heavy residue like fake bake , just a tiny bit comes off the next morning when you shower . It gives me the perfect shade of sun kissed and it sure outlast all others I tried . Make sure you do your due diligence exfoliating in the shower , I use my Moroccan mitt for that , dry off and start applying the lotion as if it was your body lotion. It smells like cherries , is easy to rub on and in and it doesn&#x27;t streak if put on evenly. Hence get an applicator mitten . No need to wear gloves under the one I got , just wash the mitten out after every use and then wash your hands well and you good to go. the tan is build-able to your desired shade and it lasts the week. You can reapply without exfoliating if you want a tough up on your arms and shoulder or legs.... All in all it&#x27;s good for the prize and I will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products. This is easy to use and smells good! Worth the price!</li>
            <li> This is the most realistic tan color from a sunless tanning product I have ever gotten. It is a little difficult to apply evenly though. I found that I had to rub a towel gently on my skin to smooth it out. I applied it with my bare hands and after the initial application it tends to settle into lines that are very apparent. The towel trick worked for me though and the extra effort needed to apply it evenly was well worth the fantastic color. It does need to be reapplied after 3 days. So the fact that it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long is another down side I suppose. But I still say the color you get is worth it.</li>
            <li> Actually works without making you look orange and lasts for a couple days.  If you apply every day, you get a great tan.  I love it and I actually trashed all my other self tanners after using this one.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product. It is not orange or streaky at all and very easy to apply!</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner I have tried yet! Being fair skinned this gives the perfect glow without looking too tan. The end result is a nice brown tan! Not orange at all!!</li>
            <li> Tanned quickly - but still had issues with streaking - used only once b/c of that</li>
            <li> I definitely do not recommend buying this. It was very streaky  and unless you apply it super quick, which i like to take my time, you&#x27;ll end up looking like a zebra with all the stripes. I hated it. And i didn&#x27;t have gloves so it turned my hand very orange. I looked like a oompa loompa. I recommend sun goddess or body drench</li>
            <li> I bought this last summer and it lasted almost through the whole season.  It dries quickly and provides a good, medium coverage that isn&#x27;t orange. This product also lacks the strong &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34; smell so prevalent in other brands. I would recommend scrubbing hands immediately after applying or else it does stain!  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I realized i needed to lotion first. I guess I have dry skin and just&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t know. I put the stuff on and was so mad.&lt;br /&gt;It dries very verryyy fast i mean wow fast. which is GREAT but then again doesnt give you&lt;br /&gt;any time to rub in.. wel so after a few days i was like OK.&lt;br /&gt;I got in the shower exfoliated and then lotioned up my whole body.&lt;br /&gt;So i go to do it again and WOW it worked SO much better. The color isnt as DARK but&lt;br /&gt;i would rather get it on like that and gradually get tan then what it looked like before.&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally olive tone skin so this looks like my REAL tan and its the prettyiest fake tan i have ever seen&lt;br /&gt;it really looks so natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the BEST i have found i have used tons of store bought (they dont work)&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt streak as long as you rub it in good.. well it really doesnt streak more like blotchy looking if&lt;br /&gt;you dont blend it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE AWARE it WILLLLLL stain your hands and i mean MEGA BAD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so wear gloves. i suggest the tight dr ones cuz those others slide around&lt;br /&gt;but yeah its like you just went out in the sun for a bit and then came in and have a&lt;br /&gt;natural reddish brown glow. This tan stuff is worth over what i paid for&lt;br /&gt;now i wont get sun cancer(runs in my family) and wont have to pay for a tanning bed&lt;br /&gt;plus its no work just slap it on and after a few hrs your looks really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WIll DEF be buying alot more in the future..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fake tan? no this is like a real tan in a bottle. it rocks. so glad i took a chance on it!</li>
            <li> I chose this because I don&#x27;t want skin cancer from tanning. Claims it won&#x27;t stink, however it does smell like sunless tanner. Tan is great though...Just use lots of body spray.</li>
            <li> I like how the product goes on dark, so is easy to get it all evenly distributed. Make sure you exfoliate first!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended in Consumer Reports, and I was not at all disappointed.  I have a light olive skin tone and my husband is white white and the product looked good on both.  Natural looking.</li>
            <li> I got this self tanner based on other reviews on Amazon and I love it!  I usually have pasty white skin that does not tan very easily and this stuff really worked. It lasted a long time too even thought I did not leave it on overnight like it said to do.  I left on for a few hours and washed off.  It looked very natural, not orangey at all.  I saw other reviews that said it faded patchy, but I did not not have that happen.  I will definitely buy again.  My only complaint is that it says its paraben free, although one of the ingredients is a paraben.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a friend who has the same skin tone. We are both pale. We have tried a lot of other products with negative results. This product is &amp;#34;IT&amp;#34; ...no need to purchase anything else. I got the medium and am incredibily happy. The product is a dark green/brown...don&#x27;t be scared just rub it in ( I used medical gloves to apply) and let it work it&#x27;s magic!</li>
            <li> This product is great for an overnight tan.  Does not look fake at all and had no streaking!!  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is not bad but make sure you get the dark tanning kind. When you get the medium one you look more orange but if you get the dark tanning kind it has a greenish olive undertone which makes for a more believable tan.</li>
            <li> I am very fair-skinned and don&#x27;t enjoy tanning beds. I used this lotion with amazing results - even the medium tone isn&#x27;t too dark for me. I can control how dark each application is. I love this product and I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Self Tanners are they really safe?  Years down the road, you may be sorry.  Look for one that does NOT contain...    \\&quot;PARABENS (which includes methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, and butyl-parabens) are a family of preservatives which can affect the ENDOCRINE SYSTEM that produces the body&#x27;s HORMONES. Studies have shown that some parabens can MIMIC ESTROGEN in the body, though the FDA asserts that parabens are safe because their estrogenic activity is much lower than the body&#x27;s own estrogen.\\&quot;    [...]</li>
            <li> Goes on well, you need to wash your hand immediately after applying or you will tan palms, also the lotion does not have s very pleasant smell to it. Fortunately it does last too long. Product is ok , but not sure I would buy it again.also a little on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> it was easy to apply and had no streaks!  It had a light smell to it but it was not a bad and no one said anything.</li>
            <li> This product worked great! I am fairly pale, and it gave me a realistic looking tan. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money. I have very fair skin and it gives me a instant subtle glow. It does not last long before you need to reapply but I would still recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the color, last about 2-3 days even with showering. The only tanning lotion that does not break me out. I&#x27;m allergic to all I&#x27;ve tried except this one.</li>
            <li> the title says it all.. I am so pale I am almost translucent... but this works splendidly. I have tried almost every single drug store tanner and nothing even comes close to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product literally comes out looking like hershey syrup... seriously. It absorbs quickly so quick rubbing is a must. This gives a wonderful natural glow without any orangey-ness. Seriously this product is fool proof. Some people have said that it stained there hands but with hand washings in between every couple of pumps and a final exfoliating with say yes to tomatoes scrub... there was no oranging of the hands. However I did put white petroleum jelly on all parts I did not want to get overly tanned (elbows, knees, wrists, hands, ankles etc) and this certainly helped prevent any excessive tanning in those areas. This was a necessity for me... because as I said... I am near translucent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I seriously love this product. I cannot praise it enough! Just being this pale I know all of the catastrophes and risks of at home self tanning and I must say there are many... but this product simply works and smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;applies easily&lt;br /&gt;looks like hershey&#x27;s syrup&lt;br /&gt;dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;smells wonderful&lt;br /&gt;blends easily&lt;br /&gt;works on all skin (face included)&lt;br /&gt;NOT ORGANGE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;it isn&#x27;t cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to solve the only con? Purchase the tan maintainer and use that five days out of the week... it is much cheaper and keeps the tan looking very natural! :)</li>
            <li> This self tan smells great and glides on nice, very nice natural tan. Product came in box factory sealed. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Doesn&#x27;t make me look orange or fake! I&#x27;ve had so many compliments from the girls at work (only bc they know), while other friends and patients ask if I just got back from vacation!!!</li>
            <li> By far one of the best self-tanning products I&#x27;ve ever used, and ya girl knows fake tanners!!</li>
            <li> I have been doing a ton of research on the sunless tanners and this one keeps coming up as one of the best (for the best cost) so I finally bit the bullet and hit &#x27;order now&#x27;. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of the cheaper lines like Jergens but I never liked the streaky results. I&#x27;ve tried body drench and it was nearly identical in results to the Jergens. I finally purchased Fake Bake Flawless before vacation last year and I liked it...a lot! The results were just what I wanted...brown with no orange. However...the spritz is a pain in the butt for application. i would have to get into the shower to spritz it on and rub it in and then wipe down my shower and tub. The main issue with this (aside from the time consumption) is that I don&#x27;t have adequate lighting in my spare bathroom shower (and I can&#x27;t do it in the master bath because we have grout and tile in there and I have no interest in giving my grout a tan. I wanted a lotion that i could put on, go to bed, wake up and wash and then move on...no additional steps! I applied this almond scented lotion to my legs as a test...since it&#x27;s still 50 degrees out I&#x27;d have time to recover before exposure if it was disastrous, after my shower and put on my pj pants...I woke up this morning and yes, the fake tan scent was there...this is unavoidable and expected! Took a quick shower (i didn&#x27;t see it washing down the drain) and checked my results...bear in mind i&#x27;m &#x27;fish belly white&#x27; and I was so impressed by the results that I decided to do another application and put a thin layer on my tummy and arms. I work by myself so the &#x27;fake tan&#x27; odor will only offend me...I can handle that. I am looking at my feet and ankles (always areas with issues) and there is a little bit of streaking but i rubbed coconut oil on those spots and it seems to have evened out. I will update with more results later if I think about it but so far, I&#x27;m liking it. I do need to add that last night I applied with my bare hands (I knew the risk!) but based on one of the reviews I read on it, i washed my hands with a baking soda/dawn dish soap paste and there are no traces of it left behind. This morning I didn&#x27;t have the time allowance so I applied with some plastic gloves (like they wear in cafeterias) and it didn&#x27;t rub in as well so i had to take some lotion after the spots because the lotion had dried and they smoothed out! So...I will certainly continue to use this lotion. I purchased the medium tint because, again...i am very fair and didn&#x27;t want to look like a dorito!eviews I read on it, i washed my hands with a baking soda/dawn dish soap paste and there are no traces of it left behind.

            <li> We got it when they said we would. I wouldn&#x27;t pay for fast shipping again but besides that, it worked great.  Use your head with self tanners. I had great, great color the first time. Second not so much. But that was my fault!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy to use, as I&#x27;m used to using a spray but it&#x27;s worth it! The color looks awesome! I just use a little baking soda on my hands after to get the formula off.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every self tanning product out there and this is the best by far. Here&#x27;s what I love:&lt;br /&gt;-Great, natural looking color&lt;br /&gt;-Develops fast&lt;br /&gt;-There is only a slight smell, but it&#x27;s pleasant!&lt;br /&gt;-If you loofa to remove dead skin first, and then use your favorite moisturizing lotion regularly, it lasts several days before needing to be reapplied&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative comment is that it leaves a dark, weird color on your hands so I recommend gloves! It will wash off - but not as easily as I would like.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! It looks so natural! Not only that, but all other tanning lotions, and even when I get professionally spray tanned, as the tan starts to fade out, it starts to streak somewhat... but not this one. It fades out so evenly and smoothly that still no one can notice you used a tanner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution though. I do modeling shoots, and I&#x27;ve been exposed to many different forms of lighting. You won&#x27;t look good if you get too close to LED lights with this on, all other lights I haven&#x27;t had issues with (Natural, Incandescent, CFL, Halogen, etc.). However, that&#x27;s not just an issue with this tanning lotion, but with any.</li>
            <li> I like it, but the texture is really weird. Thin liquid with a bunch of small chunks everywhere. But it works!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Gives nice instant and gradual color. Spreads evenly and looks natural.</li>
            <li> I read a great blog post endorsing this product, and the great reviews on Amazon prompted me to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My heritage is Scandinavian and Scots-Irish. I am very fair, light hair and blue eyes and WHITE skin. I have used other fake tanners (lotions, foams, sprays) and am pretty skilled at self-tanning, but all of them eventually fade to orange and I walk around smelling faintly of corn chips. (does anyone else think fake tan smells like chips?!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is tinted green/brown, so you can see where you are applying. It does not rub in evenly, BUT DON&#x27;T BE SCARED. I was fairly panicked because I looked like I rolled in a mud pit. The stuff dried in about an hour, and I went to bed. It did come off on my sheets, but the sheets came clean. After my shower, the tint rinsed off and I was left with a subtle brown glow all over my body. NO STREAKS. I had darker accumulation on my elbows and ankles, but really not that noticeable. I was so relieved. I am so excited to find a product that (so far) leaves my skin golden rather than orange. I am on day three and it still looks great! It smells nice when applying, and the next day it did smell a little bit corn-chippy, but not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Use plastic gloves to apply, or wash hands with baking soda after. Baking soda takes everything off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: mix a squirt of tanner with regular face moisturizer to apply to face for a smoother application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve attached two pictures, one of my leg before I showered and the other after.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of most self tanners, but this is the best I have tried. Also, you get a deep and natural color. Well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> I had to mix it with regular lotion, in order for it not to look streaky. I had heard from a blog that this product doesn&#x27;t smell like other sunless tanners, but it does. It has a strong almond/cherry smell at first but after an hour it stinks just as bad as any other, so I feel like I have to shower before and after applying. It lasted probably 4-5 days with only one application, so that was a plus. It seems to have a more natural base color, more olive than orange. I will continue using this product every once in a while until it is gone, but I won&#x27;t be buying this one again. I&#x27;d rather save some money and get about the same results for under half the price.</li>
            <li> Best self tanner I have used to date! I&#x27;ve used lots!  It doesn&#x27;t streak and it&#x27;s not orange at all.</li>
            <li> It worked great all over my body but when I used it on my face, it was blotchy and it is very difficult to wash off. I have a natural olive bronzed skin tone and it did not make my skin much darker but just enough to look somewhat sunkissed. When I asked if there was anything they could do to make this better, the company said ship it back and we&#x27;ll refund you. I shipped it back and I have no refund thus far. I loved the look on my body but the blotchy look on my face was obvious and very disappointing. This was after exfoliating and moisturizing my skin too that it was blotchy.</li>
            <li> Worked great! Looked very natural and easy to apply!</li>
            <li> Love this sunless tanner! I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and I love it. It&#x27;s the only sunless tanner I&#x27;ve used that has no orangey tone to it. It is very natural, building color.</li>
            <li> This self tanner give a very nice color that lasts for days.  DEFINITELY wear gloves to apply this product!  I thought oh, I&#x27;ll be fine, I&#x27;m only doing my legs...yeah, not the case.  I had orange hands for a couple days. It is a product that you want to apply before bed and shower off in the morning.  The smell is not too strong but still has that &amp;#34;sefl tanner&amp;#34; smell to it like any other.  I have tried many others and this one is a favorite.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  Has a smell to it so maybe you can put it in with some good smelling lotion for maintenance but the color is dead on!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Natural looking tan and no unpleasant smell.  Worked well with my fair skin.</li>
            <li> This self tanner looks very natural, and unlike other self tanners it actually smells good when applied. I find that if you don&#x27;t shower afterwards, it does take on more of that dreaded &amp;#34;self tanner smell&amp;#34; with your body heat, but if you shower a few hours after applying the smell is mitigated, though some of the tan will be washed away (just be sure to shave before applying so you don&#x27;t &amp;#34;shave off&amp;#34; your new tan!)&lt;br /&gt;With other self tanners, I noticed they always ended up flaking off in odd patches when they started to wear off, but this product simply fades away like a real tan. I&#x27;m light olive-y complexion, and this makes me look as if I&#x27;ve been at the beach for a week - healthy, sunkissed and not orange at all.&lt;br /&gt;This WILL stain your hands quite quickly, so either wear thin latex gloves while applying or scrub your palms afterwards with a gritty cleaner like Lava soap. To get a natural glow on your hands and avoid the telltale fake-tan &amp;#34;white hand&amp;#34; syndrome, just squirt a bit onto the back of your hand and massage the backs of your hands together.</li>
            <li> I was scared to try self-tanners because I didn&#x27;t want to look orange or streaky. This was recommended and so I tried it. I put mine on with gloves, then take one glove off at a time to do my hands. I never look streaky and I get so many comments like &amp;#34;did you just get back from vacation? you look sun-kissed!&amp;#34; I do think it has an odor to it, but maybe it isn&#x27;t as strong as some other tanners. I also have to apply it very frequently. It lasts about 2 days for me. Still, I probably won&#x27;t switch tanners, I know this one works.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion leaves a really nice tan on your skin, doesn&#x27;t streak too bad at all either. My only suggestion when using it is to wash your hands after each leg/arm, etc because it will stain the palms of your hands, otherwise use gloves. It doesn&#x27;t last very long but I still think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions. I use gloves and a swatch of disposable cloth for easier application. Plus a helpful hint from another review said a long handle spoon with a wash cloth rubber banded to the spoon part for application to the very center of your back was a great idea. This product does not turn you orange or smell funny. It turns brown.</li>
            <li> I am very fair with strawberry blond hair and the white skin that goes with it. This tanner gives me a nice natural color, more brown than golden and definitely not orange. My problem is in the application, it seems if you rub it on enough to be even, it begins to ball up and you end up with no color in those spots. This happened when I moisturized first and also when I didn&#x27;t.  I exfoliated first both times so I&#x27;m just not sure how to correct this.  For years I used Jergens self tanner and did not have this problem but I wanted a product WITHOUT PARABENS. On the spots that balled up, I went back later and touched them up and they turned out ok but this is not how one should have to do it each time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It gives you such a natural looking tan, and it builds well. As long as you exfoliate properly beforehand and run in well, it won&#x27;t streak. I have gotten a few streaks before, but they were easily remedied by rubbing out with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a GOD SEND! I can&#x27;t believe how real the tan looks. It&#x27;s the middle of the winter, I haven&#x27;t seen the sun in months, and I have a beautiful, glowing, real-looking tan. It&#x27;s not orange like everything else I&#x27;ve tried, and it&#x27;s also not too dramatic. The tan is very realistic, and lasts a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem that I encountered was actually applying it. If you apply it on dry skin, it streaks in a really weird way and doesn&#x27;t spread evenly. What I do to fix this is I first rub lotion, oil, or shea butter all over my body, and after that I put on the tanning lotion. This way, it spreads on with the lotion, way more easily. You have to walk around the house naked for like an hour afterwards, but I do that anyway... lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> At first it looked good then within two or three days I looked like I had a bad  orange tint.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and this product is wonderful!! I will buy this again</li>
            <li> I love this product. It gives you a great tan that looks natural. This tanner does not leave you feeling like you have an orange tan.</li>
            <li> I really like the natural color (not orange) that this product gives me. I am a blonde with really fair skin and this product looks really natural on me. I just wish it will not fade as fast.</li>
            <li> I had read how great this stuff was on a beauty blog. The smell is pleasant, however the resulting color was really streaky and splotchy. I&#x27;m sticking to my cheap drugstore brand self tanner that doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li> goes on dark and looks very natural, not orange at all.  More like a walnut stain.  Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, either.  Wears off fairly evenly, not noticeable.</li>
            <li> This product does give a great color and quickly.  But it also comes off fairly easily and is very easy to streak if you don&#x27;t do it the right way.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite summer and winter beauty products!! I have a skin condition and this takes care of that.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, not too thick. I was disappointed after having followed all instructions last night, this morning when I put only water on my legs (10 hours later) it completely washed off. No soap, no scrubbing, just water. I have no color on my legs now. I&#x27;m going to try again tonight. Maybe I needed to rub it in longer. I washed my hands in between legs and did not get orange palms, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> Best self tanner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. It doesn&#x27;t smell like other self tanners and it works quickly. My only complaint is it fades a little faster than I would like. I bought the maintainer to see if that helped but that stuff smells horrible!</li>
            <li> Love it! Color shows instantly n doesn&#x27;t look orange. It looks like a nice tan. Tip: scrub hands with baking soda and water to remove dark color on palms 😀</li>
            <li> This is NOT what I expected.  It is basically a black &amp;#34;fluid&amp;#34; - not a lotion.  It does not go on smoothly, and looks horrible.  Does not blend well at all.  Thankfully I bought the Tanning mitt too - so I didn&#x27;t ruin everything.  I normally use Jergens tanning lotion, but thought I would try something else.  I&#x27;ll stick with Jergens!</li>
            <li> The hue wasn&#x27;t as natural as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about this stuff it looks good except my legs it was very splochy</li>
            <li> Provided an immediate deep tan without the dreaded Orange tinge. No icky tanner smell. Color does last with a slow natural fade. Be sure to carefully wash hands immediately after application (baking soda works great!) Or you will end up with tinted palms. No more Oompa Loompa tan!</li>
            <li> This self tanner is wonderful! It gives a nice natural looking tan (no orange)! I love that the instant color lets you know if you&#x27;ve missed a spot. It also smells really nice like almond &amp; shea butter lotion. I wish it was a bit less expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I found this product as part of a blog to stay tan when you cannot be outside all the time. Works great!</li>
            <li> The color was streaky and orange, and the smell I smelled like a self tanner even worst when I sweat</li>
            <li> Great product!  My tan looks natural.</li>
            <li> I have red hair and fair skin.  This product gives me a gorgeous, incredibly natural looking tan.  I have tried several other tanning products and this is by far my favorite.  At first, it goes on super dark which helps you blend it in completely, resulting in a perfectly even, streak-free, beautiful tan.  And it has the most subtle scent out of any tanner I&#x27;ve used (you have to sniff your arm directly to smell anything, and even that close it&#x27;s very subtle).  Has to be reapplied often to keep the color; I reapply almost every day after showering. You see some color instantly, and it develops more over the next few hours.</li>
            <li> Five Reasons I recommend this Tanning Lotion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) It lasts approximately 2-3 days after a good application (even after showering/swimming).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) It gives you a natural looking tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) It feels good upon application - not greasy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) It has a pleasant fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(5) Good price for a long lasting product.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good self-tanner and this seems to be the one. I love how it immediately produces a good color.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion! It gives you a hint of color immediately, so you are able to tell right away if you are missing any spots or if it&#x27;s getting streaky. The color also intensifies within a couple of hours, and it gives you really natural, dark color, just like I used to get at the tanning salon, without all the damage to my skin! I even use it on my face (which is very acne-prone), and I&#x27;ve never had any problems. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is very quick to stain your palms, so be sure to wash your hands as soon as possible after application. I would gladly recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Best one I have used.  Mix it with lotion for a more subtle look or use it by itself for a serious tan!</li>
            <li> I found this product to have a great color, but thought it came on a little streaky at times. I think I would have preferred the spray version.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a naturally fair skinned person and was afraid any sunless tanner would make me look orange.  This product did not at all!  I used gloves as most had recommended and it turned out really well!  I did miss a couple spots on my wrist the first time I did it, but that was complete user error.  I&#x27;d never used an instant sunless tanner before, but I don&#x27;t think I will stop using this one.  Totally worth the cost!</li>
            <li> Bottle came with a snapped off pump.  Bummer.  Hard to use now.  Wish I could have waited for a replacement but was heading out of town.</li>
            <li> I was referred to this product through a blog (http://doitandhow.com/2013/03/16/self-tanning-tips/) who also advised that I use it in conjunction with Jergen&#x27;s natural glow to prolong the tan and make it look more natural. Really good advice and this is a good product, a good review coming from someone who was addicted to tanning beds.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after a seeing it reviewed by a blogger. It worked great! No streaking and no orange residue left over. I did wear gloves but I&#x27;m not sure that I really needed to. It gave me a nice glow and was perfect for the pastey spring-to-summer time of year.</li>
            <li> My favorite self tanner and the only one I&#x27;ll use! Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite self tanner for body and I have used alot of different ones..This stays on the longest and does not clog pores..</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> This leaves streaks and lines non matter how well you try try to rub it in. Not professional looking at all.</li>
            <li> I read about this product on Pinterest (visit [...] to see how to apply this product her blog is AMAZING) I am a redhead and have very pale sensative skin and all other products turn me a burnt orange color. I have done the spray tanning and it is just too expensive to keep up. I was a little intimidated at first because even the Medium is super dark when you squeeze it out but once its rubbed in its perfect. I just did my legs to test it out and it gave me a little bit of color which is what I was looking for. Remember this is a gradual building product you have to use it more than once to get to the color you want. I will most def be looking into more products from this company!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this self tanner! It actually really does smell good! You don&#x27;t have that smell like all the other self tanners. I love how it goes on dark so you can see exactly where you are putting it on. Dries really fast.</li>
            <li> I like this product better than any others I&#x27;ve tried. Just be sure that you spread it out evenly &amp; quickly as it drys fast and the color is immediate. You might want to wear gloves (the plastic/rubber type) as it will stain your hands if you don&#x27;t scrub them quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also fades quickly so need to reapply about every 3 days or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in about 3 days and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is okay, I thought from other reviews that it would be amazing. It gives a subtle tan, just not the kind of tan/darkness I thought. Make sure to wash your hands immediately, cause it tends to stain your palms a lot. I had to use a loofa to get it all the way off.</li>
            <li> Product has two positive characteristics:&lt;br /&gt;1) It has a good, natural looking color&lt;br /&gt;2) The product does not rub off onto clothing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use tanning lotions very often because I can&#x27;t stand the smell of them. I bought this one recently after hearing great reviews on it, and was pleasantly surprised. The smell really is minimal, and the color is great. As with any tanning lotion, be sure to put moisturizer on any dry areas before applying the tanner. I forgot to do this and ended up with a couple of dark/orangish spots on my feet where they were dry.</li>
