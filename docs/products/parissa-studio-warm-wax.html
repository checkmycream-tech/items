    <ol>
            <li>Awesome, awesome.</li>
            <li>This is THE best wax kit I have tried.  </li>
            <li>This is the best at home waxing kit i&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>Tried a lot of waxes this is the best.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best waxes out there.</li>
            <li>i have yet to try it but the kit looks wonderful!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>of wax; what a great deal!</li>
            <li>Best wax for he money.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I must say this is the BEST one I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>IT IS ALSO NOT MICROWAVE SAFE!!!!</li>
            <li>but I just ran to the store and bought a pack of 20 Popsicle sticks, they work perfectly.</li>
            <li>1.5 minutes is perfect time.</li>
            <li>Good Luck!</li>
            <li>lol.  </li>
            <li>which is great.</li>
            <li>i will continue to buy this wax, it was a great purchase.</li>
            <li>Works great, though mastering the art of not getting it all over the place is rather a challenge.  </li>
            <li>The wax removes just about all the hair in one pull, which is great.</li>
            <li>A great product, I have used this for years.</li>
            <li>So, all around great money saver.  </li>
            <li>LOL.  </li>
            <li>once I saw how effective it was, I was hooked!  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this out after seeing a lot of good reviews for it elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Strips are a good size.</li>
            <li>excited all the reviews says they work wonderful</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love not having to worry about being prickly when someone brushes up against my leg!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>You cannot wash off the wax with soap &amp; warm water.  </li>
            <li>Shaving is just so much work and never gives that flawless skin look like waxing does.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for years, a great and quick hair removal.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best at home wax system I have used.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever used waxed and I found this product very easy to use and it did a great job.  </li>
            <li>Super easy, cleans off great.</li>
            <li>I do my own waxing at home because it is easy and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>It is wayyy better then</li>
            <li>I will get more :)</li>
            <li>It also comes with azulene oil to prevent ingrown hairs and it also makes the skin nice and smooth feeling.  </li>
            <li>I have waxed many times by myself and this wax tears off the skin everytime.</li>
            <li>Love this wax.</li>
            <li>Still looking for something better</li>
            <li>but you will pay more for some.</li>
            <li>This wax kit is my favorite of all.  </li>
            <li>Excellent , enough said.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This wax does not have to be very warm at all, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt much when you remove it.  </li>
            <li>We have a nice microwave (KitchenAid that is built in, which never had problems unless you use this &amp;#34;microwaveable warm wax&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and effective.</li>
            <li>This is a really easy product to use, and I plan on buying more.  </li>
            <li>It is nice and sticky but the oil included gets everything clean easily.</li>
            <li>Great results so far.  </li>
            <li>The wax is easy to heat in the microwave and the sticks and strips included work as intended.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, i got the heating pad with it for ease and travel ability.  </li>
            <li>I also love that this kit comes with an adequate amount of strips.  </li>
            <li>This product is FABULOUS.</li>
            <li>This is a gimmick free wax kit that gets the job done.</li>
            <li>no wax is pain free</li>
            <li>Thanks Parissa!!!</li>
            <li>The oil included in this kit is excellent at preventing ingrown hairs, which is usually a problem for me.  </li>
            <li>(this will also be needed to clean the bathroom afterwards).</li>
            <li>It works almost as well and is a lot easier to clean up (water soluble).</li>
            <li>It is also quite clean.</li>
            <li>So, by the time my face is healed up, I will have a full beard.</li>
            <li>Parissa wax works really well, better than Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>but it seems most of the microwaveable variety are really crappy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep purchasing this in the future, so glad I found this brand!</li>
            <li>parissa is very good for thick stubborn hair and also gets the shorter hairs (as the others do not).</li>
            <li>Works great without the mess of a heating pot, this goes right in the microwave</li>
            <li>This worked great but was messy.</li>
            <li>Key it to run strip over the waxed area til it feels nice and warmed, then pull off.</li>
            <li>It took about 1.5 minutes to warm up (using 30 second intervals) and it is not any easier then this.  </li>
            <li>It was clear that I was going to need a lot more oil than they provided.  </li>
            <li>Great company but a wrong choice of product by my own doing.</li>
            <li>Will return for right product.</li>
            <li>I prefer the pre-waxed strips for my bikini line, but with long legs the warm wax is the way to go.  </li>
            <li>The hair came right off the first time (no touchups needed).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, not messy and I don&#x27;t feel like I have to superheat the wax in order for it to work.</li>
            <li>I have gone to professional waxers and will never again after using this easy to use, at-home alternative.</li>
            <li>this was the first time I&#x27;d tried wax with strips.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever waxed.</li>
            <li>I had only done the top of one eyebrow and the area between my eyes.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time I did it myself</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t find anything better locally.</li>
            <li>I like it because it never seems to be too hot...</li>
            <li>First off, the wax seemed of much higher quality than the sally hansen one.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>You will have to purchase more wooden sticks</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t go into detail, but it wasn&#x27;t pretty.</li>
            <li>Applys warm, not hot-</li>
            <li>Parissa wax took all my unwanted fine blonde facial hair off, and was super easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also super messy, but it does clean up easily with oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different products and this one really does work well.</li>
            <li>and I expected a huge mess and some degree of pain, neither of which I experienced.</li>
            <li>Honestly the first strip took the bulk of the hair out, then I had to apply it maybe 2-3 more times in small areas where the hair grew in a different direction, then pull again.</li>
            <li>Then, you can easily move onto a new section of hair with no mess.  </li>
            <li>But be careful, it&#x27;s incredibly sticky and hard to clean up if you spill it.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of having smooth legs for a few weeks!  </li>
            <li>I have course hair that grows back very quickly.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I tried this for the first time and we both fell in love with it because it didn&#x27;t hurt like the other products we were using before</li>
            <li>and this really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried one yet, but supposedly they really help take the edge off.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this wax.</li>
            <li>and then it really hurts when you pull it off.  </li>
            <li>I have spent a greater chunk of my life trying to find a solution to my hair problems.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than going to a salon</li>
            <li>Removes more than other waxes</li>
            <li>I love this wax for eyebrows, among other things, but do yourself a favor: don&#x27;t even try to use it on your armpits.</li>
            <li>I got this instead of the Moom that I normally use, not realizing how much messier, stickier, it is to use wax.</li>
            <li>I will stick with the much easier to remove Moom (and more ecofriendly, albeit a bit more expensive).</li>
            <li>I ended up just heating up this wax the old fashioned way with the use of hot water.</li>
            <li>The wax lasted for a greater area, and I used less strips.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It can get messy, however, as many wax kits do.  </li>
            <li>I have been waxing for a long time and I have tried so many different wax kits.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY coarse hair that grows back very quickly.</li>
            <li>I ended up with a large scab on that area that is still very sore a week later.  </li>
            <li>If you are new to waxing, get a sugar wax.</li>
            <li>This is just as good as any of the other kits out there for less money.</li>
            <li>The second time I did it, it was MUCH faster and cleaner!  </li>
            <li>First of all, this wax, obviously, sticks to everything it touches.</li>
            <li>Shaving has been what I have done mostly in the past (for my legs).  </li>
            <li>I got this product previously from Walmart and it worked fantastic, so</li>
            <li>The key is to remove as much excess wax as you can in-between pulls with the oil and the strips.  </li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well on coarse hairs.  </li>
            <li>nair and veet burn under my arms, cause ingrown hairs in my bikini area, and dont seem to get the hair completely (i can still see the roots).</li>
            <li>just completely screws up my microwave.</li>
            <li>At one point we thought we had to completely replace it because it continued to spark after.</li>
            <li>it allows me to go longer between waxing and the hair is much finer and thinner when it grows back in.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that the wax doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well in the bikini area...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other waxes (which microwaved just fine such as sally hansen) and this has never happened before.</li>
            <li>It works just fine on my upper lip, but on my chin I have pretty thick hairs</li>
            <li>I am sure this will take weeks to completely clear up and since I am having a really hard time not picking at them, It could possible leave scars.......</li>
            <li>Only thing I would add is another stick, since this includes two and there may be enough wax for more than two waxings if you are doing small areas.</li>
            <li>It is VERY easy and THIN layers are key.</li>
            <li>I will be returning the wax to the store and going back to using my trusty old tweezers.</li>
            <li>Once you get it down, you can put wax on larger sections and use the same strip to quickly pull them.</li>
            <li>In fact, it was almost impossible to find a cruelty free wax, so when I found this one I was so excited.</li>
            <li>Definitely there is no other wax for me now.</li>
            <li>I usually have enough strips to do 2-3 sessions of armpits and &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;, but if you are an inexperienced waxer, you may need to buy some extra strips because it takes a while to figure out how to place them in the most efficient manner</li>
            <li>I highly suggest buying a wax warmer though, because it gets annoying having to microwave the wax every so often (you can find one super cheap on amazon or just use a coffee mug/candle warmer, which is what I use).  </li>
            <li>It spreads easily and doesn&#x27;t leave hairs behind when you pull it off.</li>

            <li> Honestly the first strip took the bulk of the hair out, then I had to apply it maybe 2-3 more times in small areas where the hair grew in a different direction, then pull again.</li>
            <li> Then, you can easily move onto a new section of hair with no mess.  </li>
            <li> But be careful, it&#x27;s incredibly sticky and hard to clean up if you spill it.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of having smooth legs for a few weeks!  </li>
            <li> I have course hair that grows back very quickly.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I tried this for the first time and we both fell in love with it because it didn&#x27;t hurt like the other products we were using before</li>
            <li> and this really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried one yet, but supposedly they really help take the edge off.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this wax.</li>
            <li> and then it really hurts when you pull it off.  </li>
            <li> I have spent a greater chunk of my life trying to find a solution to my hair problems.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than going to a salon</li>
            <li> Removes more than other waxes</li>
            <li> I love this wax for eyebrows, among other things, but do yourself a favor: don&#x27;t even try to use it on your armpits.</li>
            <li> I got this instead of the Moom that I normally use, not realizing how much messier, stickier, it is to use wax.</li>
            <li> I will stick with the much easier to remove Moom (and more ecofriendly, albeit a bit more expensive).</li>
            <li> I ended up just heating up this wax the old fashioned way with the use of hot water.</li>
            <li> The wax lasted for a greater area, and I used less strips.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It can get messy, however, as many wax kits do.  </li>
            <li> I have been waxing for a long time and I have tried so many different wax kits.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY coarse hair that grows back very quickly.</li>
            <li> I ended up with a large scab on that area that is still very sore a week later.  </li>
            <li> If you are new to waxing, get a sugar wax.</li>
            <li> This is just as good as any of the other kits out there for less money.</li>
            <li> The second time I did it, it was MUCH faster and cleaner!  </li>
            <li> First of all, this wax, obviously, sticks to everything it touches.</li>
            <li> Shaving has been what I have done mostly in the past (for my legs).  </li>
            <li> I got this product previously from Walmart and it worked fantastic, so</li>
            <li> The key is to remove as much excess wax as you can in-between pulls with the oil and the strips.  </li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well on coarse hairs.  </li>
            <li> nair and veet burn under my arms, cause ingrown hairs in my bikini area, and dont seem to get the hair completely (i can still see the roots).</li>
            <li> just completely screws up my microwave.</li>
            <li> At one point we thought we had to completely replace it because it continued to spark after.</li>
            <li> it allows me to go longer between waxing and the hair is much finer and thinner when it grows back in.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that the wax doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well in the bikini area...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other waxes (which microwaved just fine such as sally hansen) and this has never happened before.</li>
            <li> It works just fine on my upper lip, but on my chin I have pretty thick hairs</li>
            <li> I am sure this will take weeks to completely clear up and since I am having a really hard time not picking at them, It could possible leave scars.......</li>
            <li> Only thing I would add is another stick, since this includes two and there may be enough wax for more than two waxings if you are doing small areas.</li>
            <li> It is VERY easy and THIN layers are key.</li>
            <li> I will be returning the wax to the store and going back to using my trusty old tweezers.</li>
            <li> Once you get it down, you can put wax on larger sections and use the same strip to quickly pull them.</li>
            <li> In fact, it was almost impossible to find a cruelty free wax, so when I found this one I was so excited.</li>
            <li> Definitely there is no other wax for me now.</li>
            <li> I usually have enough strips to do 2-3 sessions of armpits and &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;, but if you are an inexperienced waxer, you may need to buy some extra strips because it takes a while to figure out how to place them in the most efficient manner</li>
            <li> I highly suggest buying a wax warmer though, because it gets annoying having to microwave the wax every so often (you can find one super cheap on amazon or just use a coffee mug/candle warmer, which is what I use).  </li>
            <li> It spreads easily and doesn&#x27;t leave hairs behind when you pull it off.</li>
            <li> Just dab a strip over the area that has leftover wax on it from the previous pull (the wax will transfer from your skin to the paper), then rub in a few drops of the oil and wipe the area clean with a dry wash cloth or something.  </li>
            <li> but this is my first negative review</li>
            <li> Use oil and a cloth to clean up any wax left behind... soap and water will not get this off!</li>
            <li> The first try was a little messy, but</li>
            <li> I usually gravitate towards hard strip-less wax which I stopped purchasing since I couldn&#x27;t find any that were cruelty free.</li>
            <li> that I accidentally brushed my hands on, like my cheek and abdomen, so I had to rub myself down with the oil afterwards and take a very thorough shower due to the mess I made.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical with the instructions of applying the thinnest layer possible to remove the most amount of hair (opposite of hard wax), but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The Zip wax is quite painful since it has to be pretty hot</li>
            <li> I had maybe 3-4 hairs left after all was done, so I plucked the last few.</li>
            <li> And the Parissa wax has gotten it down even further at roughly $9.75!</li>
            <li> I would recommend doing a very small test strip for new waxing locations.</li>
            <li> I would use hard wax for bikini and under arm and soft for legs and face.</li>
            <li> You definitely should have enough for at least one session though.  </li>
            <li> i have tried a few hair removing products such as veet, nair, and also nair wax, but none seem to get the hair as well as parissa.</li>
            <li> There is not really much to say about wax.</li>
            <li> The waxing itself was easy enough, a little messy and hurts a little, but wasn&#x27;t difficult to figure it all out...</li>
            <li> I usually use Zip wax, but when I ran out this time I decided to try something different.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy any other wax kits again.</li>
            <li> clean up is a pain, but since it lasts so long it isnt so bad.</li>
            <li> I have extremely coarse, thick hair</li>
            <li> If your hair is thick and coarse, this will take it off compared to a lot of the brands out there.</li>
            <li> It does seem to hurt less and less each time I wax, however.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Sally Hansen drugstore kit previously and this way outshines that product.</li>
            <li> The warmer the product, the easier to apply and less you will use.    </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll be using 4 or less a year at this point.  </li>
            <li> I actually like this moreeee than the hard wax now!</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t waste them.  </li>
            <li> A couple of times it stung but went away in a few seconds.</li>
            <li> and it has worked well for a few months.  </li>
            <li> The first bikini wax I gave myself took about 5 minutes and was suprisingly not too painful when strip was removed.  </li>
            <li> It really didnt hurt bad at all.</li>
            <li> not sure what caused the breakout maybe I am allergic to it???  </li>
            <li> it helps for small areas and since i didnt have baby oil, for my legs</li>
            <li> plus you use just a small amount.  </li>
            <li> My only conclusion is that the reviews on here are fake.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to find in a brick and mortar store.  </li>
            <li> This was hard to use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it took my skin off but left the hair behind.</li>
            <li> Not only is this one bad at removing hair, it&#x27;s also REALLY MESSY.</li>
            <li> Recently I have gotten tired of buying expensive razor cartridges that cost me about $35 at Costco.  </li>
            <li> and I wish I could give it negative stars.</li>
            <li> But unless you want to be unable to remove the wax by any means other than the oil provided, don&#x27;t buy this wax.</li>
            <li> no more hair!</li>
            <li> what I mean is, I never get burnt with it.</li>
            <li> and you can avoid everyone and their uncle seein&#x27; your business if you know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> I grew hair out for 4 days, applied thin layer of wax to armpits as directed, then drank a few beers &amp; had hubby pull the strips!</li>
            <li> Been trying to use pre-waxed strips for the past year with poor results.</li>
            <li> the waxes I have purchased from beauty supply places, this is seriously just like my salons wax.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s that serious you can always try a numbing cream.  </li>
            <li> The stupid wax is so sticky and hard to keep it only where you want it.</li>
            <li> It was so inconvenient and ridiculously messy that there is wax on my floor that will be there until the end of the century.</li>
            <li> I feel like I am always behind when it comes to shaving and always have stubble.....</li>
            <li> the box took the wax out and opened the lid and the seal had already been broken.</li>
            <li> Box was smashed and glass container with oil was broken, glass pieces were all over the box.</li>
            <li> do recommend using baby powder on the skin before applying the wax, just to help from it sticking to the skin and also makes it less painful.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to wax my legs for years, but it was too expensive for me to keep it up.  </li>
            <li> After using the last of my horrible smelling Nair product, I purchased this kit at Target.      </li>
            <li> difficult for a novice to use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I ordered this product and when it arrived I opened</li>
            <li> though hmm ill buy it here</li>
            <li> Unless you want an absolutely messy, impossible to get off, and horrible skin irritant that causes purple bruises DON&#x27;T GET IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The seal was stuck onto the wax (need to remove before microwaving, so I had to claw it out with my fingers, so my hands were absurdly sticky even before I&#x27;d officially started to wax!</li>
            <li> The wax got on random parts of me (the learning curve is steep!)</li>
            <li> I broke out something HORRIBLE!!!</li>
            <li> Awful product compared to their strip-free version!</li>
            <li> This is the worst wax product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I was disgusted and threw it out because who knows who used this before I received it!!!!</li>
            <li> This wax is absolutely horrible.</li>

            <li> This wax works. But unless you want to be unable to remove the wax by any means other than the oil provided, don&#x27;t buy this wax. It was so inconvenient and ridiculously messy that there is wax on my floor that will be there until the end of the century.</li>
            <li> This is the only wax that works for me. It is nice and sticky but the oil included gets everything clean easily. The wax is easy to heat in the microwave and the sticks and strips included work as intended. This size includes enough to wax my arms and legs, or my legs twice. Only thing I would add is another stick, since this includes two and there may be enough wax for more than two waxings if you are doing small areas.</li>
            <li> Only wax that works for my underarms.</li>
            <li> After years of paying to have my eyebrows and upper lip waxed by the salon, I wanted to give home salon wax a try. It is VERY easy and THIN layers are key. I can now wax my entire leg (below the knee) with ONE strip and one application of wax. For those who are not savvy with waxing do not try on your eyebrows initially. Key it to run strip over the waxed area til it feels nice and warmed, then pull off.Wax warms in the microwave in about a minute. It is wayyy better then the waxes I have purchased from beauty supply places, this is seriously just like my salons wax. I have already paid for my kit after 3 uses. Awesome, awesome. I will get more :)</li>
            <li> I have wanted to wax my legs for years, but it was too expensive for me to keep it up.  I found this product and tried it at home.  The first try was a little messy, but once I saw how effective it was, I was hooked!  The second time I did it, it was MUCH faster and cleaner!  I love the feel of having smooth legs for a few weeks!  I prefer the pre-waxed strips for my bikini line, but with long legs the warm wax is the way to go.  Once you get it down, you can put wax on larger sections and use the same strip to quickly pull them. I am buying the warmer next so I don&#x27;t have to go back to the microwave!</li>
            <li> This is THE best wax kit I have tried.  I have extremely coarse, thick hair and this really gets the job done.  It can get messy, however, as many wax kits do.  The key is to remove as much excess wax as you can in-between pulls with the oil and the strips.  Just dab a strip over the area that has leftover wax on it from the previous pull (the wax will transfer from your skin to the paper), then rub in a few drops of the oil and wipe the area clean with a dry wash cloth or something.  Then, you can easily move onto a new section of hair with no mess.  I highly suggest buying a wax warmer though, because it gets annoying having to microwave the wax every so often (you can find one super cheap on amazon or just use a coffee mug/candle warmer, which is what I use).  I also love that this kit comes with an adequate amount of strips.  I usually have enough strips to do 2-3 sessions of armpits and &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;, but if you are an inexperienced waxer, you may need to buy some extra strips because it takes a while to figure out how to place them in the most efficient manner so you don&#x27;t waste them.  You definitely should have enough for at least one session though.  Oh and waxing definitely hurts, unless you have been doing it for years and your pain receptors are permanently damaged or something lol.  It does seem to hurt less and less each time I wax, however.  If it&#x27;s that serious you can always try a numbing cream.  I haven&#x27;t tried one yet, but supposedly they really help take the edge off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used stripless wax- this was the first time I&#x27;d tried wax with strips. It did not work out for me. It ripped my skin off- not the affect I was going for. Unfortunately, it took my skin off but left the hair behind. So, by the time my face is healed up, I will have a full beard. Nice.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this wax. I usually gravitate towards hard strip-less wax which I stopped purchasing since I couldn&#x27;t find any that were cruelty free. In fact, it was almost impossible to find a cruelty free wax, so when I found this one I was so excited. I was very skeptical with the instructions of applying the thinnest layer possible to remove the most amount of hair (opposite of hard wax), but was pleasantly surprised. I actually like this moreeee than the hard wax now! Applys warm, not hot- which is great. And when you pull it off it truly only pulls the hair, not the skin. I&#x27;m going to keep purchasing this in the future, so glad I found this brand!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever waxed. The waxing itself was easy enough, a little messy and hurts a little, but wasn&#x27;t difficult to figure it all out... but about an hour after I finished I broke out something HORRIBLE!!! I am sure this will take weeks to completely clear up and since I am having a really hard time not picking at them, It could possible leave scars....... not sure what caused the breakout maybe I am allergic to it???  But I won&#x27;t ever use it again.....</li>
            <li> This is the best at home waxing kit i&#x27;ve bought. I&#x27;ve used the Sally Hansen drugstore kit previously and this way outshines that product. It&#x27;s easy to use, not messy and I don&#x27;t feel like I have to superheat the wax in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> I usually use Zip wax, but when I ran out this time I decided to try something different.  The Zip wax is quite painful since it has to be pretty hot and then it really hurts when you pull it off.  This wax does not have to be very warm at all, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt much when you remove it.  But it doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well on coarse hairs.  It works just fine on my upper lip, but on my chin I have pretty thick hairs and I had to keep trying over and over to get all the hairs off.  I ended up with a large scab on that area that is still very sore a week later.  It&#x27;s also super messy, but it does clean up easily with oil.</li>
            <li> After using the last of my horrible smelling Nair product, I purchased this kit at Target.      It took about 1.5 minutes to warm up (using 30 second intervals) and it is not any easier then this.  There must be dozens of uses in this kit.  The first bikini wax I gave myself took about 5 minutes and was suprisingly not too painful when strip was removed.  The warmer the product, the easier to apply and less you will use.    I feel like I am always behind when it comes to shaving and always have stubble.....NOT ANYMORE!!!      Thanks Parissa!!!</li>
            <li> The package was opened.</li>
            <li> i have tried a few hair removing products such as veet, nair, and also nair wax, but none seem to get the hair as well as parissa. nair and veet burn under my arms, cause ingrown hairs in my bikini area, and dont seem to get the hair completely (i can still see the roots). the nair wax didnt work at all for those areas but did for my legs. parissa is very good for thick stubborn hair and also gets the shorter hairs (as the others do not). it also comes with this oil to help remove the leftover wax and prevent ingrown hairs. the only thing i had to figure out was how to get it off when i was done. water alone will not do it, but the oil that comes with it helps for small areas and since i didnt have baby oil, for my legs i used vegetable oil (this will also be needed to clean the bathroom afterwards). clean up is a pain, but since it lasts so long it isnt so bad. i will continue to buy this wax, it was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t waxed my eyebrows in years, but after having to deal with plucking them every darn day, I decided to try this wax.  First of all, this wax, obviously, sticks to everything it touches. You cannot wash off the wax with soap &amp; warm water.  They give you this itty bitty tube of blue oil to get it off.  It was clear that I was going to need a lot more oil than they provided.  It was a mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second turn off was that it ripped my skin off! I had only done the top of one eyebrow and the area between my eyes.  This wax ripped my skin off in 3 different areas, and the hair was still there.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Thank heavens I didn&#x27;t do my upper lip! I would have been sporting a red, skinless mustache. That would&#x27;ve been messed up!.  This was one decision I regretted. I will be returning the wax to the store and going back to using my trusty old tweezers.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used waxed and I found this product very easy to use and it did a great job.  The hair came right off the first time (no touchups needed).  The oil included in this kit is excellent at preventing ingrown hairs, which is usually a problem for me.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works great, though mastering the art of not getting it all over the place is rather a challenge.  I&#x27;ve tried many different products and this one really does work well.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best at home wax system I have used. Not to mention the only one that has worked for me. I have VERY coarse hair that grows back very quickly. Shaving is just so much work and never gives that flawless skin look like waxing does. I decided to try this out after seeing a lot of good reviews for it elsewhere. The wax removes just about all the hair in one pull, which is great. It&#x27;s quick and effective. It also comes with azulene oil to prevent ingrown hairs and it also makes the skin nice and smooth feeling.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I do recommend using baby powder on the skin before applying the wax, just to help from it sticking to the skin and also makes it less painful.</li>
            <li> difficult for a novice to use. The stupid wax is so sticky and hard to keep it only where you want it.</li>
            <li> Tried a lot of waxes this is the best.  Removes more than other waxes but it&#x27;s hard to find in a brick and mortar store.  Thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best waxes out there. If your hair is thick and coarse, this will take it off compared to a lot of the brands out there.</li>
            <li> A great product, I have used this for years.</li>
            <li> Parissa wax works really well, better than Sally&#x27;s. It spreads easily and doesn&#x27;t leave hairs behind when you pull it off. But be careful, it&#x27;s incredibly sticky and hard to clean up if you spill it. If you are new to waxing, get a sugar wax. It works almost as well and is a lot easier to clean up (water soluble).</li>
            <li> Tears off the skin. I don&#x27;t care what anyone says about being a &#x27;pro-waxer&#x27;. I have waxed many times by myself and this wax tears off the skin everytime. Awful product compared to their strip-free version!</li>
            <li> This is the worst wax product I have ever used.  Not only did it not remove hair, but I ended up breaking out from it.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I ordered this product and when it arrived I opened the box took the wax out and opened the lid and the seal had already been broken. I was disgusted and threw it out because who knows who used this before I received it!!!! Never again👎👎👎 And I only give it 1star for delivering it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, i got the heating pad with it for ease and travel ability.  Works as described.  I would use hard wax for bikini and under arm and soft for legs and face. Just saying you might need scissors otherwise.</li>
            <li> i have yet to try it but the kit looks wonderful! excited all the reviews says they work wonderful</li>
            <li> The only wax I will use. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Box was smashed and glass container with oil was broken, glass pieces were all over the box.</li>
            <li> Love this wax. It&#x27;s the only home kit I can use without breaking out or have a severe reaction.</li>
            <li> This worked great but was messy. Use oil and a cloth to clean up any wax left behind... soap and water will not get this off!</li>
            <li> I just used this product to wax off my armpit hair. I have to shave everyday, my whole body, and it grows back within 12 hours. So I decided to wax for now. I grew hair out for 4 days, applied thin layer of wax to armpits as directed, then drank a few beers &amp; had hubby pull the strips! Vuala! no more hair! Honestly the first strip took the bulk of the hair out, then I had to apply it maybe 2-3 more times in small areas where the hair grew in a different direction, then pull again. It really didnt hurt bad at all. A couple of times it stung but went away in a few seconds. I had maybe 3-4 hairs left after all was done, so I plucked the last few. The oil relieves the sting immediately &amp; keeps your armpits from feeling sticky.     Great product! Looking forward to waxing bikini line &amp; legs for summer! And not having to shave twice a day!</li>
            <li> This product is FABULOUS. I wasn&#x27;t expecting the wooden sticks, strips and an aftercare oil to all be included with the 4oz. of wax; what a great deal! I have gone to professional waxers and will never again after using this easy to use, at-home alternative. This was the first time I did it myself and I expected a huge mess and some degree of pain, neither of which I experienced. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great company but a wrong choice of product by my own doing. Will return for right product.</li>
            <li> This wax Did Not work for me &amp;#60;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; I would not buy this again i plan to return it..My face hairs are still there..</li>
            <li> I bought this at a local drug store and it&#x27;s so crappy but I can&#x27;t find anything better locally. I&#x27;ve gone through a LOT of waxes but it seems most of the microwaveable variety are really crappy. Not only is this one bad at removing hair, it&#x27;s also REALLY MESSY. It sticks to everything yuck! Still looking for something better but this isn&#x27;t it...</li>
            <li> I got this product previously from Walmart and it worked fantastic, so I though hmm ill buy it here way cheaper... NO don&#x27;t buy it, it rips your skin off  with NO hair... Doesn&#x27;t work and you cannot return it...</li>
            <li> There is not really much to say about wax. I like it because it never seems to be too hot... what I mean is, I never get burnt with it. It does the job quite painlessly. It is also quite clean. Definitely there is no other wax for me now.</li>
            <li> Best wax for he money. Strips are a good size. There is enough to do your entire body in one box. This is a gimmick free wax kit that gets the job done. Lets face it no wax is pain free but you will pay more for some. Why bother? This is just as good as any of the other kits out there for less money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, a great and quick hair removal. I use it for my face and underarms. Super easy, cleans off great.</li>
            <li> I have course hair that grows back very quickly.  I shave my legs, and they&#x27;re \\&quot;prickly\\&quot; by the next morning.  I have spent a greater chunk of my life trying to find a solution to my hair problems.  Shaving has been what I have done mostly in the past (for my legs).  Recently I have gotten tired of buying expensive razor cartridges that cost me about $35 at Costco.  I started experimenting with waxing my legs.  Great results so far.  I just went and got a sally hansen microwave wax kit and it has worked well for a few months.  I have heard about Parissa wax, and decided I would try it.  First off, the wax seemed of much higher quality than the sally hansen one.  It seemed to grab the shorter, prickly hairs (hair grows in cycles, and I am NOT waiting until all of my leg hair is 1/4 in long...GROSS).  The wax lasted for a greater area, and I used less strips.  This is a really easy product to use, and I plan on buying more.  A half-leg wax at a salon costs about $35 here + tax and tip.  I bought the sally hansen wax for $11 with a coupon.  And the Parissa wax has gotten it down even further at roughly $9.75! I use a razor every once in a while to get some missed spots or if I&#x27;m in a rush...I think I&#x27;ll be using 4 or less a year at this point.  So, all around great money saver.  I love not having to worry about being prickly when someone brushes up against my leg!</li>
            <li> This was hard to use. I got this instead of the Moom that I normally use, not realizing how much messier, stickier, it is to use wax. The seal was stuck onto the wax (need to remove before microwaving, so I had to claw it out with my fingers, so my hands were absurdly sticky even before I&#x27;d officially started to wax! The wax got on random parts of me (the learning curve is steep!) that I accidentally brushed my hands on, like my cheek and abdomen, so I had to rub myself down with the oil afterwards and take a very thorough shower due to the mess I made. I will stick with the much easier to remove Moom (and more ecofriendly, albeit a bit more expensive).</li>
            <li> Been trying to use pre-waxed strips for the past year with poor results. Parissa wax took all my unwanted fine blonde facial hair off, and was super easy to use. Did not try on legs yet. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> This wax kit is my favorite of all.  I have been waxing for a long time and I have tried so many different wax kits.  I must say this is the BEST one I&#x27;ve ever had.  I do my own waxing at home because it is easy and inexpensive.  My daughter and I tried this for the first time and we both fell in love with it because it didn&#x27;t hurt like the other products we were using before plus you use just a small amount.  It also did not irritate our skin.  I took a picture of the box and I&#x27;ve been sharing it to my friends and family.  I&#x27;ll never buy any other wax kits again. Thank you thank you thank you for this product!</li>
            <li> Excellent , enough said.</li>
            <li> I love this wax for eyebrows, among other things, but do yourself a favor: don&#x27;t even try to use it on your armpits. YOU WILL REGRET IT!</li>
            <li> My only conclusion is that the reviews on here are fake. I bought this product in Harris Teeter our local grocery store - see picture for proof that it is the same product. This wax is absolutely horrible. IT IS ALSO NOT MICROWAVE SAFE!!!! I can&#x27;t emphasize this enough. This wax sparks no matter how I try to microwave it .. lid no lid different containers doesn&#x27;t matter just completely screws up my microwave. We have a nice microwave (KitchenAid that is built in, which never had problems unless you use this &amp;#34;microwaveable warm wax&amp;#34;) At one point we thought we had to completely replace it because it continued to spark after. I ended up just heating up this wax the old fashioned way with the use of hot water. Unless you want an absolutely messy, impossible to get off, and horrible skin irritant that causes purple bruises DON&#x27;T GET IT!!!!!! I&#x27;ve used other waxes (which microwaved just fine such as sally hansen) and this has never happened before. I&#x27;ve left plenty of reviews on amazon but this is my first negative review and I wish I could give it negative stars.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I use it to wax my armpits...it allows me to go longer between waxing and the hair is much finer and thinner when it grows back in. As for the product, I purchased the warmer with it and turn it on about 30 minutes before I need to use it. The wax heats and works like a charm. You will have to purchase more wooden sticks but I just ran to the store and bought a pack of 20 Popsicle sticks, they work perfectly. My only issue is that the wax doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well in the bikini area...I won&#x27;t go into detail, but it wasn&#x27;t pretty. I would recommend doing a very small test strip for new waxing locations. Good Luck!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Much cheaper than going to a salon and you can avoid everyone and their uncle seein&#x27; your business if you know what I mean.  LOL.  It takes a little practice but once you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll be done in 10 minutes!</li>
            <li> Works great without the mess of a heating pot, this goes right in the microwave 1.5 minutes is perfect time.</li>
