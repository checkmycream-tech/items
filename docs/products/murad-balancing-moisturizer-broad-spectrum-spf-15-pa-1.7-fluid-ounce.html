            <li>(some kind of floral scent) which makes me start sneezing as soon as I put it on.</li>
            <li>It is very light weight and goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Murad moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mentioning it here because had I done more research before purchasing</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d have moved on and looked for a more hormone-friendly product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me, I&#x27;ve found that I want something that will be harmonious with my body more than I want the beauty bonuses it promises.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and blends nicely.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight, has some built-in SPF, but I would put on sunscreen on top if planning to spend times in the sun or outdoors.</li>
            <li>would like to say though that I absolutely LOVE their pore reforming cleanser and t-zone serum.</li>
            <li>I also received the foaming cleanser which was sealed up and like new, so I am happy about that.</li>
            <li>the original application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always seen Murad in high fashion magazines, but I decided to splurge based on the need to protect my skin and this product got great reviews.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and is super light, night greasy.</li>
            <li>The lotion is light and my skin did not react as strongly as it has to most products.</li>
            <li>absolutely love this moisturizer, i have a combination, sensitive skin and this lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer goes on with a light feeling, but yet you don&#x27;t feel you need to reapply.  </li>
            <li>The scent is rather strong when applied but fades quickly.</li>
            <li>I felt like the product just sat on top of my skin instead of being absorbed which made my face appear super oily</li>
            <li>but my wife liked it, I will have to buy it again in the future :)</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>You can definitely see the difference when you put this on because my tzone takes longer to get oily and the application goes on very smooth and light.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if they made a larger bottle!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Murad products since I was in my mid-twenties and now, at 43 years old, I still get carded to buy wine :)</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t go into details about endocrine disrupting ingredients because there&#x27;s plenty of information out there if you&#x27;re interested.  </li>
            <li>I love Murad, started using it about a year ago and everyone notices the difference in my skin and it does not make my face feel dry or oily.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I was really iffy about it to begin with because I have acne prone skin</li>
            <li>if you put too much on, you will be greasy all day.</li>
            <li>I purchased it for two reasons: I have sensitive but oily skin that sweats under most moisturizers and, as part of my job, I am occasionally outside without knowing I would be ahead of time, so I wanted something that would provide SPF for my super-fair skin just in case</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t sealed, and is more watery than my last tube, but smells the same.</li>
            <li>Im going back to my Clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel until I find something better.</li>
            <li>I am 26 yrs old with have combo skin.</li>
            <li>it is not a heavy cream.</li>
            <li>This is a non drying product that works wonders on my sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, yet does not dry out my cheeks at all, after using it for just few days i noticed big difference in my T-zone</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product! However, this review has nothing to do with the actual product, just the seller. I think I got a bum product. It wasn&#x27;t sealed, and is more watery than my last tube, but smells the same. My guess is some was used and they refilled it with water to bulk it back up (at least, I hope it was just water). BUT, I am desperate and leaving for vacation, so I am going to take it. I also received the foaming cleanser which was sealed up and like new, so I am happy about that.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Murad moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love Murad, started using it about a year ago and everyone notices the difference in my skin and it does not make my face feel dry or oily.</li>
            <li> For some reason this burns and irritates my skin. I thought I would itch my face off.  I&#x27;ve returned to just using the perfecting lotion.</li>
            <li> I am 26 yrs old with have combo skin. I love this moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or make it too oily. Although, I do still have minor break outs the Blue label from Murad doesn&#x27;t do enough.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer I just every morning and night and I have noticed the change in my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving the Murad Balancing Moisturizer 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;The Pros: it does not irritate my skin. It goes on lightweight. It absorbs quickly. It also appears to be making my pores smaller or appear smaller in my T-zone, after applying once a day for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;The Cons: The ingredients to achieve this.  In doing research on women&#x27;s hormones and looking at this product&#x27;s contents, several ingredients are endocrine blockers.  I won&#x27;t go into details about endocrine disrupting ingredients because there&#x27;s plenty of information out there if you&#x27;re interested.  I&#x27;m mentioning it here because had I done more research before purchasing, I&#x27;d have moved on and looked for a more hormone-friendly product.&lt;br /&gt;As always, it comes down to personal choice/preference.  For me, I&#x27;ve found that I want something that will be harmonious with my body more than I want the beauty bonuses it promises.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. This is the only moisturizer I use. It is great for combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;Pros.&lt;br /&gt;1. Great for all season&lt;br /&gt;2. Doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily&lt;br /&gt;3. Has enough spf(15) protection&lt;br /&gt;4. Smells great (not that feminine)</li>
            <li> I started using Murad products about one year ago after getting facials with this product from Message Envoy. I now notice my skin is flawless with or without make. Try it for yourselves and you will agree.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for about 2 months now and I really like it. It is very light weight and goes on very smoothly. It is not greasy and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this moisturizer, i have a combination, sensitive skin and this lotion is amazing. It&#x27;s very light, yet does not dry out my cheeks at all, after using it for just few days i noticed big difference in my T-zone, pores appeared smaller and my skin is basically clear (before I had problems with black heads and pimples around my chin area). I would absolutely recommend this product for anyone with combination skin, GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and blends nicely.  No greasy finish and I&#x27;ve worn it out in the sun quite a bit - coverage lasts quite a while!</li>
            <li> it is not a heavy cream. You don&#x27;t need very much</li>
            <li> This moisturizer goes on with a light feeling, but yet you don&#x27;t feel you need to reapply.  I use it every morning,</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer. It is lightweight, has some built-in SPF, but I would put on sunscreen on top if planning to spend times in the sun or outdoors. It doesn&#x27;t have any annoying fragrances and I have had no adverse reactions. It is not greasy, but keeps my skin moisturized, radiant, and assists with keeping pores minimal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Murad, and have been for decades. This is my &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; product, especially as the fall weather rolls in.</li>
            <li> I was rather disappointed by this product. I purchased it for two reasons: I have sensitive but oily skin that sweats under most moisturizers and, as part of my job, I am occasionally outside without knowing I would be ahead of time, so I wanted something that would provide SPF for my super-fair skin just in case I end up taking a client for a walk outside or such. The lotion is light and my skin did not react as strongly as it has to most products. Although it seemed to slide off my face on warmer days, I could tolerate that if the sun protection part held up. Obviously, on days when it slid, I didn&#x27;t expect protection, but even on days when I applied the product, then my makeup, and everything stated in place all day, my face became badly burned several times, and I was in the sun only maybe 20-30 minutes, and it was less than a few hours after the original application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always seen Murad in high fashion magazines, but I decided to splurge based on the need to protect my skin and this product got great reviews. I didn&#x27;t expect it to operate as sunscreen on a day at the beach, but for a day of driving and running errands, I expected protection my skin and I did not receive. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> The scent is rather strong when applied but fades quickly. I have another Murad moisturizer that is rather thin but the consistency of this is good.</li>
            <li> Great product for my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer. Not too heavy, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, and has SPF. Would be nice if they made a larger bottle!</li>
            <li> I am returning this product. I was really iffy about it to begin with because I have acne prone skin and I didn&#x27;t think it would do the trick without having benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid in it but I bought it anyways because that is what my esthetician recommended to me. She said she thought Murad&#x27;s acne line would be too harsh on my skin and that the reason I was getting acne was just clogged pores from hormonal imbalances. I gave the moisturizer three weeks before I decided I&#x27;m going to return it. I felt like the product just sat on top of my skin instead of being absorbed which made my face appear super oily but yet when I washed it off my face didn&#x27;t seem moisturized at all. So, if you have oily or acne prone skin, I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to say though that I absolutely LOVE their pore reforming cleanser and t-zone serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become a fan of Murad.  This is a non drying product that works wonders on my sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Great product! I found out about this cream from the Real Simple magazine. It was on their best face product list. It has a very nice texture and provides moisture.</li>
            <li> Awesome prices online VS the beauty store!  Great products - I&#x27;ve been using Murad products since I was in my mid-twenties and now, at 43 years old, I still get carded to buy wine :)</li>
            <li> I like to have sunscreen in my moisturizer. It is one less step in my busy day.</li>
            <li> My go to. Smells nice and is super light, night greasy.</li>
            <li> I do not know the details but my wife liked it, I will have to buy it again in the future :)</li>
            <li> I have acne prone, sensitive, combination skin and this stuff was awful. This made my face greasy and did not absorb well. I broke out after using it for 2 days. Additionally the smell is nasty (some kind of floral scent) which makes me start sneezing as soon as I put it on. I wont be buying this again. Im going back to my Clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel until I find something better.</li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long way. if you put too much on, you will be greasy all day. I have combination skin that is prone to breakouts but this product does not seem to cause blemishes.</li>
            <li> You can definitely see the difference when you put this on because my tzone takes longer to get oily and the application goes on very smooth and light. It doesn&#x27;t give off a greasy feeling ever.</li>
