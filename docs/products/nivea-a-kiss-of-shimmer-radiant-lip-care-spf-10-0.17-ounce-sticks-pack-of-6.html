            <li>Living in the desert I am always on the lookout for the perfect lip balm, I found it.</li>
            <li>The hint of shimmer is perfect alone or applied over my lipstick.  </li>
            <li>otherwise, great product well done nivea!!!!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!!!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!!!  </li>
            <li>This is not too shiny and Nivea is great.</li>
            <li>Price is great here on Amazon, but what price can you put on &amp;#34;Hey</li>
            <li>this product was great one star for moisture,, one star for the grape scent , one star for the appearence</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great neutral/pink with some shimmer to it but not shiny like gloss.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I had a good experience with Nivea Kiss of Moisture, because it was on sale, and also because it had shimmers in it.</li>
            <li>It does provide shimmer, however it does not provide good lip moisture.  </li>
            <li>Feels good, smells and taste good as well.</li>
            <li>This product keeps your lips moisturized and feeling good.  </li>
            <li>and I always loved the color.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice color for my skin tone (olive/tan)</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a really nice Chapstick with a summer glow.</li>
            <li>Works well, fells good (not sticky like many) and has a nice &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; to it.</li>
            <li>I liked these for the color and to use when not using lipstick.</li>
            <li>I love a company that is honest from the get go.</li>
            <li>I have light brown skin tone and it looks absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li>and I had to reapply, which made my lips look even more ghostly.</li>
            <li>Love the flavor, reminds me of a candy I grew up with in germany.  </li>
            <li>Love the pearly sheen to the color as well,</li>
            <li>i feel as though it wears off faster than the chapstick brand, but i like how this looks on my lips better.</li>
            <li>I gave a tube of it to each of my daughters and one to my soon-to-be-daughter-in-law and all of them love it.</li>
            <li>I am thinking maybe if you are darker-skinned, it might look like too much of a contrast, but I think it would look great on most people.</li>
            <li>i love how it looks and</li>
            <li>So glad I found this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>I love the shimmer in the product.</li>
            <li>I purchased  more than one</li>
            <li>Perfect for those who don&#x27;t care for lipstick or lipgloss especially in the summer.</li>
            <li>The scent I don&#x27;t find too strong either.</li>
            <li>also love that this company has full disclosure not just on the cardboard packaging but on the tube of balm as well.</li>
            <li>The feel and color are fine, but the perfume in it is so strong.  </li>
            <li>And the guys seem to enjoy it as well.</li>
            <li>So much smoother....smells and tastes nice too.</li>
            <li>It is very light pink and frosty looking, but more of a shimmer/sheer kind of thing going on there...</li>
            <li>It also has a strong scent that it hits right up your nostrils where you can practically taste it in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>But as I continued to use it and the top layer is gone from the stick, it&#x27;s very moisturizing now.</li>
            <li>luckily found this on sale this week at CVS.</li>
            <li>A quick swipe and you&#x27;ve got pretty pink shimmer and great moisture.</li>
            <li>Im not a lipstick, color type of person, so this is just right for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh, it&#x27;s light, it&#x27;s great for those days where you want tinted moisturizer and this clean look like you don&#x27;t have any makeup on (guys are stupid, they have no clue, lol) and you can feel young and fresh as a daisy.</li>
            <li>i love the light pink tint color it leaves, but it does not moisturize well.</li>
            <li>they love this lip care and their mom is happy that her daughters won&#x27;t be playing with her expensive lipsticks.</li>
            <li>It makes necessary lip care more fun.</li>
            <li>It had a white pearly finish on my lips so maybe this product would look better on lighter skinned people.</li>
            <li>has a pretty tint of color would repurchase when my supply runs out.</li>
            <li>They claim to last 8 hours, more like 8 seconds.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find in my area, so glad I found here!!</li>
            <li>What attracted me was the sexy and dusty pink color; I thought it would blend beautifully to give a natural yet shimmery look for some light makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe this is marketed towards teenagers, but even then, I recommend getting a Victoria Secret Beauty Rush Colorshine gloss ( I use Pink Lemonaid because it can be layered and has that shimmery look) or for a matte look try Sephora lip stick Lip Attitude Star (S02); both have a much more pleasant smell and look more natural.</li>
            <li>It is more expensive than some of the other brands she has tried, but she swears this is the best lip care product on the market.  </li>
            <li>: they are using wayyyy too much.</li>
            <li>My favorite Chapstick with a pink shimmer!</li>
            <li>First of all, when I open the cap, there&#x27;s a very strong smell of something like bubblegum and baby powder ; it smells fake and very strong.</li>
            <li>The balm is offered in a few options/flavors: The Pearly Shimmer is the newest addition to my Nivea lip balm collection (love Passionfruit and Cherry Kiss of Flavor also)  </li>
            <li>so I am hunting around town to purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that i have to apply a lot of it to get the color to really show as much as i want.</li>
            <li>this chapstick has a nice pink pearl sheen to it, unlike other chapsticks.</li>
            <li>i find my lips dry fast</li>
            <li>finally 2 stars for the shimmer and pretty pink tint, or color</li>
            <li>I actually get upset whenever I pick up this lip balm in my purse and find out there&#x27;s no other options.  </li>
            <li>Right now my lips are dryer than usual, but nivea isn&#x27;t drying them out, the weather is.</li>

            <li> Yes it has SPF in it, but they are clear to say that it doesn&#x27;t prevent cancer and other skin damaging effects, you should still use sunscreen when out in the sun.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like it to.</li>
            <li> After 5 minutes of my initial application, my lips felt extremely dry</li>
            <li> I love lip stuff (hate chapstick, too much alcohol in them).</li>
            <li> ~ These products have long been coveted in Europe and are sold under the Labello line.</li>
            <li> After attempting to email them, the site link takes so long to load that it just ends up giving you a run-time error instead of sending the message through.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like the shimmers would cling to the dry skin on my lips.</li>
            <li> For starters, the actual tube lasts awhile, a couple of months at least.</li>
            <li> it sounds ridiculous because obviously I don&#x27;t sit there and eat lip balm</li>
            <li> little bit retro feel.  </li>
            <li> (downside is the nviea is a little pricey, I was hoping to find a comparable solution with the maybelline stuff after I had seen their commercials).</li>
            <li> Then, the color looks fake and metallic; so there&#x27;s no way it blends well for a natural look.</li>
            <li> I found this product a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Waste of money as I cannot stand wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also did not like the product 1st few days because it was not motorizing.</li>
            <li> I used both this shimmer and the plain lip balm by Nivea.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m bound to accidentally lick my lips and whenever that happens I get a horrible plastic taste in my mouth (versus the other Nivea lipbalms which I&#x27;m not even aware of the taste when I accidentally lick my lips).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be the consistency of Kiss of Moisture with the extra benefit of shimmers, but it was highly disappointing.</li>
            <li> I suppose if you slather this stuff on or have dark skin, the shimmer will look weird.</li>
            <li> I did read a review from an African-American woman who says it was not a good look on her.</li>
            <li> and it is not pleasant; in fact it makes it intolerable to wear.  </li>
            <li> It helps that their product works and they aren&#x27;t trying to trick you into false security.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I drove over my tube today</li>
            <li> For those evenings when it&#x27;s Jeans night out, throw this on and add some casual polish to your lips.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> And calling them is just as bad, as I just hung up after waiting on hold for 3+ minutes.  </li>
            <li> came on time, but was disappointed because i got 6 instead of 1.</li>
            <li> I purchases Maybelline Baby Lips or some crap as a substitute when I ran out</li>
            <li> I am a brown skinned girl, and this product looked horrible against my skin.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is shockingly awful.  </li>
            <li> This is probably the worst lip product I&#x27;ve purchased EVER!!!  </li>

            <li> This is the only chap stick/lip gloss I use. It&#x27;s hard to find in my area, so glad I found here!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I had a good experience with Nivea Kiss of Moisture, because it was on sale, and also because it had shimmers in it. I thought this product would be the consistency of Kiss of Moisture with the extra benefit of shimmers, but it was highly disappointing. I am a brown skinned girl, and this product looked horrible against my skin. It had a white pearly finish on my lips so maybe this product would look better on lighter skinned people. Even so, this product dragged on my lips and highlighted the chapped areas.  It seemed like the shimmers would cling to the dry skin on my lips. After 5 minutes of my initial application, my lips felt extremely dry and I had to reapply, which made my lips look even more ghostly. It also had a chemical scent to it. I returned the product to the store the day after I bought it.</li>
            <li> This is not too shiny and Nivea is great.</li>
            <li> Hey... I don&#x27;t use this product, but as the father of a teenage girl, I can tell you it is the ONLY lip balm/care product she will use.  It is more expensive than some of the other brands she has tried, but she swears this is the best lip care product on the market.  Who am I to question her?</li>
            <li> This lip balm is shockingly awful.  I can&#x27;t imagine what Nivea was thinking, except that maybe they created it for thirteen year olds.</li>
            <li> i love the light pink tint color it leaves, but it does not moisturize well. i find my lips dry fast and i&#x27;m always re-applying. gave the rest to my nieces who are 5 and 7. they love this lip care and their mom is happy that her daughters won&#x27;t be playing with her expensive lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!!  Unfortunately, I drove over my tube today so I am hunting around town to purchase a new one.  Love the flavor, reminds me of a candy I grew up with in germany.  Love the pearly sheen to the color as well, little bit retro feel.  I think it goes well with darker, olive skin, brings out skin tone. Im not a lipstick, color type of person, so this is just right for me.  Simple.  And the guys seem to enjoy it as well.</li>
            <li> I actually get upset whenever I pick up this lip balm in my purse and find out there&#x27;s no other options.  What attracted me was the sexy and dusty pink color; I thought it would blend beautifully to give a natural yet shimmery look for some light makeup. First of all, when I open the cap, there&#x27;s a very strong smell of something like bubblegum and baby powder ; it smells fake and very strong. Then, the color looks fake and metallic; so there&#x27;s no way it blends well for a natural look. Also, taste should be a concern...it sounds ridiculous because obviously I don&#x27;t sit there and eat lip balm but I&#x27;m bound to accidentally lick my lips and whenever that happens I get a horrible plastic taste in my mouth (versus the other Nivea lipbalms which I&#x27;m not even aware of the taste when I accidentally lick my lips).&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this is marketed towards teenagers, but even then, I recommend getting a Victoria Secret Beauty Rush Colorshine gloss ( I use Pink Lemonaid because it can be layered and has that shimmery look) or for a matte look try Sephora lip stick Lip Attitude Star (S02); both have a much more pleasant smell and look more natural.</li>
            <li> I adore this Chapstick! It&#x27;s a nice color for my skin tone (olive/tan) and it has no taste to it. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like it to. But it&#x27;s a really nice Chapstick with a summer glow.</li>
            <li> Kiss of Shimmer equates to a Kiss of Lip Heaven. Living in the desert I am always on the lookout for the perfect lip balm, I found it. Nivea&#x27;s Kiss of Shimmer glides onto your lips, feels silky but not sticky, last&#x27;s for quite some time, and adds just a hint of shimmer. The balm is offered in a few options/flavors: The Pearly Shimmer is the newest addition to my Nivea lip balm collection (love Passionfruit and Cherry Kiss of Flavor also)  The hint of shimmer is perfect alone or applied over my lipstick.  For those evenings when it&#x27;s Jeans night out, throw this on and add some casual polish to your lips.&lt;br /&gt;Note ~ These products have long been coveted in Europe and are sold under the Labello line.</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst lip product I&#x27;ve purchased EVER!!!  It does provide shimmer, however it does not provide good lip moisture.  It only makes your lips sticky and tears your skin off of your lips.  It also has a strong scent that it hits right up your nostrils where you can practically taste it in your mouth.  Contacting their company is another experience.  After attempting to email them, the site link takes so long to load that it just ends up giving you a run-time error instead of sending the message through.  And calling them is just as bad, as I just hung up after waiting on hold for 3+ minutes.  Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money or time buying this item.</li>
            <li> this chapstick has a nice pink pearl sheen to it, unlike other chapsticks. it is unscented. i feel as though it wears off faster than the chapstick brand, but i like how this looks on my lips better.</li>
            <li> My Mom loves this balm and I bought them for her as a present. It took forever to get them, though...</li>
            <li> Feels good, smells and taste good as well. has a pretty tint of color would repurchase when my supply runs out.</li>
            <li> This product should not be used on people with olive oil skin or brown skin. The lip balm was not moisturizing at all and it made my lips look white when I put it on. Definitely would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> My favorite Chapstick with a pink shimmer!</li>
            <li> I get compliments ALL THE TIME!! Every time I wear this, people compliment me on my lips and ask what it is that I&#x27;m wearing. I gave a tube of it to each of my daughters and one to my soon-to-be-daughter-in-law and all of them love it. It is very light pink and frosty looking, but more of a shimmer/sheer kind of thing going on there...you just need to try it!! I did read a review from an African-American woman who says it was not a good look on her. I am thinking maybe if you are darker-skinned, it might look like too much of a contrast, but I think it would look great on most people. It&#x27;s fresh, it&#x27;s light, it&#x27;s great for those days where you want tinted moisturizer and this clean look like you don&#x27;t have any makeup on (guys are stupid, they have no clue, lol) and you can feel young and fresh as a daisy. Price is great here on Amazon, but what price can you put on &amp;#34;Hey, you always look so great!&amp;#34; ??</li>
            <li> I suppose if you slather this stuff on or have dark skin, the shimmer will look weird. But you don&#x27;t need a lot, and I have a feeling that&#x27;s why some are saying the shimmer is too frosty: they are using wayyyy too much. The scent I don&#x27;t find too strong either. A quick swipe and you&#x27;ve got pretty pink shimmer and great moisture. I don&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> this product was great one star for moisture,, one star for the grape scent , one star for the appearence it came in i love how it looks and finally 2 stars for the shimmer and pretty pink tint, or color it gave me. The only problem is that i have to apply a lot of it to get the color to really show as much as i want. otherwise, great product well done nivea!!!!</li>
            <li> I love lip stuff (hate chapstick, too much alcohol in them). But I regularly have lip stuff on me everywhere I go. I found this product a few months ago. I love it! For starters, the actual tube lasts awhile, a couple of months at least. I get compliments on the color all the time. It&#x27;s a great neutral/pink with some shimmer to it but not shiny like gloss. Also- the moisture actually stays on. I purchases Maybelline Baby Lips or some crap as a substitute when I ran out (downside is the nviea is a little pricey, I was hoping to find a comparable solution with the maybelline stuff after I had seen their commercials). They claim to last 8 hours, more like 8 seconds. I was constantly reapplying that stuff. Nivea is opposite. Right now my lips are dryer than usual, but nivea isn&#x27;t drying them out, the weather is. Nivea puts moisture on, not suck it out of your lips like it feels some lip care does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I luckily found this on sale this week at CVS. It was buy one get one, so now I have one for my bag and one for my nightstand. I recommend this product to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that this company has full disclosure not just on the cardboard packaging but on the tube of balm as well. Yes it has SPF in it, but they are clear to say that it doesn&#x27;t prevent cancer and other skin damaging effects, you should still use sunscreen when out in the sun. I love a company that is honest from the get go. It helps that their product works and they aren&#x27;t trying to trick you into false security.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this on Amazon. I was paying $3.25 a tube at my local drugstore. I was a Burts Bees user until I found this product. So much smoother....smells and tastes nice too.</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm. Works well, fells good (not sticky like many) and has a nice &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; to it. Cheaper to order it online.</li>
            <li> I love the shimmer in the product. It makes necessary lip care more fun. I purchased  more than one so I wouldn&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!!!  It&#x27;s Chapstick with a shimmer. Perfect for those who don&#x27;t care for lipstick or lipgloss especially in the summer. 😍😍😍😍</li>
            <li> The feel and color are fine, but the perfume in it is so strong.  It is all I can smell while wearing this and it is not pleasant; in fact it makes it intolerable to wear.  Waste of money as I cannot stand wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to like nivea products, but I would not get this again.</li>
            <li> I liked these for the color and to use when not using lipstick.</li>
            <li> came on time, but was disappointed because i got 6 instead of 1. I don&#x27;t like the shimmer it produced.</li>
            <li> I used both this shimmer and the plain lip balm by Nivea. This product keeps your lips moisturized and feeling good.  It also helps with with sun exposure and keeps you from burning your lips.</li>
            <li> I also did not like the product 1st few days because it was not motorizing. But as I continued to use it and the top layer is gone from the stick, it&#x27;s very moisturizing now. and I always loved the color. I have light brown skin tone and it looks absolutely gorgeous.</li>
