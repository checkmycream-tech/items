            <li>Very nice and like the other Loreal Voluminous, it is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty light</li>
            <li>It is really a nice tone of blue</li>
            <li>; worth of gas.</li>
            <li>Loved  it, I really like the shade of blue.</li>
            <li>light and surprisingly natural looking</li>
            <li>I love the shade of blue</li>
            <li>First you see it then</li>
            <li>, it just looks like normal mascara, but when you go in the light, it is a pretty blue color that seems to bounce light off of it.  </li>
            <li>THE BRIGHT BLUE COLOUR DOES NOT LAST</li>
            <li>Whoever thought of it - thanks.  </li>
            <li>This is a fabulous shade of blue mascara - gosh, I hope they keep making this!</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara</li>
            <li>Really need this item in waterproof formula as my eyes tend to water a bit which causes produçt to run and burn my eyes.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really find this to be up to Loreal&#x27;s normal standards.  </li>
            <li>Great mascara, especially when it&#x27;s quite hard to find a blue one at the store.</li>
            <li>Better than other blue mascaras I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Not too light and not too dark.  </li>
            <li>Also i love how it&#x27;s dark blue</li>
            <li>Brings back the old days  thanks</li>
            <li>My current solution is to apply a layer of same brand in w/p black on underside of top lashes and topside of bottom.</li>
            <li>I love blue mascara and it is hard to find.</li>
            <li>Indoors (or in dull light)</li>
            <li>Love the blue which is hard to find!</li>
            <li>It looks like a black mascara when you first put it on, but when the sun hits it it looks blue or violet.</li>

            <li> It looks like a black mascara when you first put it on, but when the sun hits it it looks blue or violet.</li>
            <li> This is sort of dark Sky Blue.</li>
            <li> its just mascara, there&#x27;s a slight blue tint to it.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not very fond of the applicator wand because it&#x27;s plastic</li>
            <li> so I have to cover it with regular mascara making it kinda pointless.</li>
            <li> Liked the color - it smelled kinda awful but no big deal....</li>
            <li> use it every single day, and it goes with whatever colour clothing I&#x27;m wearing because its not a bright blue, but a sutle navy.  </li>
            <li> Navy blue mascara is hard to find.</li>
            <li> blue is so hard to find.  </li>
            <li> It is so hard to find mascara in blue</li>
            <li> truly a denim colour...looks subtle for a blue</li>
            <li> That was a waste of a &amp;#34;gallon and a half&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Does not appear harsh to the eyes and adds a little flare to the eyelashes!!  </li>
            <li> so the color is definitely noticeable but not too crazy or out there.</li>
            <li> UNFORTUNATELY</li>
            <li> so it does not look weird or anything.  </li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong in buying this mascara at all.</li>

            <li> I love this! Denim color to go with your jeans? Whoever thought of it - thanks.  Better than other blue mascaras I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> THE COLOUR IS A POPPING BLUE ITS LOOKS BEAUTIFUL IN THE SUN LIGHT. IT EXTENDES THE LASHES. UNFORTUNATELY THE BRIGHT BLUE COLOUR DOES NOT LAST I HAVE TO TOUCH IT UP ONCE  OR TWICE A DAY. THE TWO STARS IS FOR THE COLOUR..</li>

            <li> I like to lighten up my mascara with this blue shade for the summer.  It is really a nice tone of blue so it does not look weird or anything.  L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s mascaras are great quality so this one is no exception.  Totally recommend.</li>
            <li> light and surprisingly natural looking</li>
            <li> I wanted navy blue.  This is sort of dark Sky Blue. Uh. No. That was a waste of a &amp;#34;gallon and a half&amp;#34; worth of gas.</li>
            <li> I wish the color was darker. It&#x27;s pretty light so I have to cover it with regular mascara making it kinda pointless.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really find this to be up to Loreal&#x27;s normal standards.  It didn&#x27;t show its denim color well.  It clumped.</li>
            <li> I love it!  Does not appear harsh to the eyes and adds a little flare to the eyelashes!!  Wish you had more!!</li>

Very nice and like the other Loreal Voluminous, it is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t clump but just defines your eyelashes very definitely.  It is so hard to find mascara in blue but this is the perfect blue for me.  Not too light and not too dark.  You cannot go wrong in buying this mascara at all.</li>
            <li> I use this product and color to accent the tip of my eye lashes. I have blue eye, so it accentuates my eye color</li>
            <li> Always get tons of compliments on this mascara. The best blue mascara I have tried. I love the shade of blue it is.</li>

            <li> absolutely the best mascara ever !!!&lt;br /&gt;I use it every single day, and it goes with whatever colour clothing I&#x27;m wearing because its not a bright blue, but a sutle navy.
