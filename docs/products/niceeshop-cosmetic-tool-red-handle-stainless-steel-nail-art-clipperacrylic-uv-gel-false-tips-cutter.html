            <li>but I can always buy more from them.</li>
            <li>Invest in a better one at Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have this product within my possession.</li>
            <li>better than nothing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a lot more efficient and quicker in getting the job done.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s more me than the item</li>
            <li>Just glad I didn&#x27;t spend a lot.</li>
            <li>so I guess its better than nothing.</li>
            <li>Makes the nails look better taken care of.</li>
            <li>They work great and arrived rather fast</li>
            <li>The best thing, though, was that I got these clippers for well under five dollars, and at Sally Beauty I would be paying over thirty dollars for the same thing.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I suppose these clippers would be OK if I ever receive them.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I purchased this, makes doing my manicures so much faster</li>
            <li>I love the color of these clippers.</li>
            <li>I had one before that used to bend my nail more than cut it</li>
            <li>They work great and will much ease.</li>
            <li>BUT IT IS OK</li>
            <li>this product is ok quality for price, havent had a chance  to use them yet</li>
            <li>so im sure it will do its job</li>
            <li>Cuts evenly and smoothly!</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite cases..</li>
            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>This item is okay</li>
            <li>It cuts ok I guess.  </li>
            <li>I really love this. ..</li>
            <li>/&gt;You will see this posted many times.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d be happier with a quality nail tip cutter for decades if I could justify the price.</li>
            <li>Does what its supposed to what more could you ask?</li>
            <li>This nail clipper cuts my acrylics to the perfect length and doesn&#x27;t strain on my nail like regular nail clippers.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>Im extremely pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The rubber helps you cut better.</li>

            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more than the clipper itself.</li>
            <li>Besides that though, I love this nail clipper.</li>
            <li>Glad I got it.  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying a better quality one at Sally Beauty for $12</li>
            <li>so that is what I have, thus in all fairness perhaps I should have paid more attention to the descriptive words in Amazon&#x27;s presentation.</li>
            <li>Glad I ordered this.</li>
            <li>will buy more products from them if needed</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>The blade cuts the acrylic nail so smoothly!</li>
            <li>so it worked really nice right off the bat!</li>
            <li>Its pretty good for the price</li>
            <li>I loved these at first, but after about 5 uses, they broke on me.&lt;br</li>

            <li>but, first practice on nail tips (blanks) before you apply the tip to your own nail.</li>
            <li>I will not give it the full 5 stars until I can use it more often.  </li>
            <li>This product was ok for the price but its not sharp and didn&#x27;t cut my nails good</li>
            <li>I would have rated this 5 but the blade was just a bittttt slanted but the blade is very very sharp which was awesome to cut nails with.</li>

            <li>Looked cheap but does the job well.</li>
            <li>I like the item the handle felt kinda cheap</li>
            <li>Immediately you can tell its cheap ...</li>
            <li>You can feel something grinding against another part, it makes it feel cheap.</li>
            <li>The good think it got here early</li>
            <li>So I had to order another pair from Amazon made in The good old USA and already received them.</li>
            <li>I am surprised that these are actually good quality clippers.</li>
            <li>i wouldnt know if you could use it for natural nails and good condition</li>
            <li>So cheap the screw feel off of it and now it never cuts right save your time and money and buy something better quality</li>
            <li>They are so strong and durable and for such an amazing price!</li>
            <li>These clippers leave a smooth, clean cut.</li>
            <li>this item works good when trying to remove an old full set.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone who likes to do their own nails.</li>

            <li>Works perfectly for my white tips any my clear tips.</li>
            <li>Gives my nails a nice even cut and much better then the standard &#x27;toe nail&#x27; type clippers.</li>
            <li>However they make a clean cut  and do not crack the nail.</li>
            <li>this works best with really long thick nails, not so great for thinner nails.  </li>
            <li>Also wanted a video of how I use it to see if I just wasn&#x27;t doing it right!</li>
            <li>I was super excited for it to arrive and the receipt stated it would arrive in 3-5 days.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use It was reasonably priced, and overall I was very satisfied.</li>
            <li>they come in a cheap looking packege and feel a little cheap but for the price they are great</li>
            <li>They worked great the first time I used them, the second time the springy thing broke and they would no longer cut.</li>
            <li>Was well worth the wait of shipping for the huge savings.</li>
            <li>The handles are a bit flimsy but overall good product.</li>
            <li>Good luck to you in future sales.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Good handset for a in-home pedicure at a low cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thx</li>

            <li>It is high quality for the price, comfortable/effortless to hold and super easy for this beginner to use!</li>
            <li>I did have to wipe a little bit of the oil off but 5 stars is perfect for this because its a great buy for so little price!</li>
            <li>but just a tip is easy get a lil harder with acylic nias but its a good tool for the price</li>
            <li>but this is pretty strong and fits all of my nails.</li>
            <li>Easy to work with this, are not difficult.</li>

            <li>I love it especially if your  customer wants a little flare in there nails its great!!!!!</li>
            <li>Great clippers, not cheap looking at all.</li>
            <li>I really do enjoy this because they are so much easier to use on tips rather than having to cut from side to side.</li>
            <li>Cheap and cuts really well.</li>
            <li>my old one is better though than this.</li>
            <li>This tool help made my finger nails look more professional</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH</li>
            <li>Shipping took awhile but was worth it.</li>
            <li>I cut nail tips and have even cut acrylics with success.</li>
            <li>The best cutting tool a nail styles could have use them all day they cut with eazy and evenly love them</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>They cut great except no matter how much I tried to make a straight cut, it was always crooked,  </li>
            <li>These came earlier than I expected and working awesome!</li>
            <li>but after i used it it was worth the time it took to be delivered.</li>
            <li>The cost was well worth the purchas.</li>
            <li>Worth the money i recommend if your trying to save some money.</li>
            <li>and it was totally worth it.</li>
            <li>This is okay, its very flimpsy and you can tell it wasn&#x27;t made very well, the blade has no cover over it</li>
            <li>worth</li>
            <li>It is not at all useful for me.</li>
            <li>Do my own acrylics at home, these are definite help!!</li>
            <li>they cut my false nails perfectly</li>
            <li>This is an awesome tool for clipping  false nails.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for this product and for getting it to me quickly.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product and excited it arrived thank you so much now I can complete my set</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really budget friendly</li>
            <li>Owner wanted to know if I was using it right when I contacted them.</li>
            <li>You have to put a lot of force to cut right</li>
            <li>Waited a long time to recieve but was very impressed with the quality since the cost was so minimal.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time to buy the cutter, it is so convenient and easy to use as well as high performance of quality/cost.</li>
            <li>a very smart purchase</li>
            <li>They can cut a straight edge or oval, they can also turn full cover acrylics into tips.  </li>
            <li>took a long time to get, but liked it once I received it</li>
            <li>Great purchase don&#x27;t have to do much I just cut and file a little bit</li>
            <li>I often do my own acrylic nails, so when I put on the tips (which are very long)</li>
            <li>The Cosmetic Tool Red Handle cutter really come in handy.</li>
            <li>If you want to cut less than 1/2 inch, the nail tends to get mangled rather than a nice clean cut.</li>
            <li>For those who want to purchase you can send me the money and at least get a nice inspiring card.</li>
            <li>but overall good for the price and got here 3 days early</li>
            <li>I got mine, it&#x27;s a cute light baby pink color!</li>
            <li>they work good but maybe could use to be a little sharper</li>
            <li>It seems a bit on the cheap side,  but as long as it works and doesn&#x27;t break,  I&#x27;m fine with it.</li>
            <li>Other than that they are good clippers I gave 2 stars cause , they came super early .</li>
            <li>I would really rate this no stars btw!</li>
            <li>and these are a big help! :-)</li>
            <li>This item looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>will need to order more later on.</li>
            <li>but I would have to spend a lot more time filing to correct my crooked cut.</li>
            <li>The color is really pretty</li>
            <li>and I use this consistently to trim my nails.</li>
            <li>Broke on the first day.</li>
            <li>Broke on the first attempt to use.</li>
            <li>I was using scissors or nail clippers before to cut the acrylic nails, but this really makes my life easier!</li>
            <li>I gave these 5 stars because they are exactly as posted and do the job.  </li>
            <li>They are exactly the ones that are used in salons.</li>
            <li>Worked better than what I used from a local supply house.  </li>
            <li>They really work!</li>
            <li>I love these, I noticed they are the same ones used in nail salons.</li>
            <li>works very well!</li>
            <li>it looks pretty sturdy</li>
            <li>At first, I was unsure about the quality because of the price.</li>
            <li>It is pretty flimsy.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>I am a beginner at nail art, and this is one of my first tools to build my kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a tiny bit cheap (but so is the price!)</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Soo much better than regular nail clippers!!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li>it was in its package and it was brand new!i really recommend you to buy it!</li>
            <li>This acrylic nail clipper does exactly what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li>And it is also pretty out of my imagination.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I was looking for.....sturdy construction....would recommend.</li>
            <li>It took a little while to come but it was worth the wait.... ordering more soon!</li>
            <li>Its nice and sharp and works well.</li>
            <li>The clippers are really nice my only problem is that it is kind of hard to make sure they are even so my nails some times come out crooked</li>
            <li>Cuts very well sturdy, like it very much</li>
            <li>Came late but really good does the right job.</li>
            <li>I use these to cut my natural nail in a square, makes a great straight line and all I have to do is file the corners to round off</li>
            <li>this really does cut nails straight!</li>
            <li>Item was exactly what was described and has worked very well for the price that was paid.</li>
            <li>works good so far only used it twice so far</li>
            <li>I only used it once, because they broke so easily</li>
            <li>easy to cut the nails to the proper length and works for helping taking the gel or acrylic nails off.</li>
            <li>They cut the nail tips easily but without the bulk of bigger clippers.</li>
            <li>Pure garbage.</li>
            <li>I will certainly recommend this site and item to others</li>
            <li>The pink grip makes them very comfortable in my hand when squeezing.</li>
            <li>this makes it very easy to trim down to size.</li>
            <li>works well arrived fast</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to do much filing.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>it makes acrylic nails so much easier to work with.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for all you have done for me.</li>
            <li>I waited a whole month and it never came.</li>
            <li>I received my item fairly fast</li>
            <li>Its very sturdy</li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy this again even though I don&#x27;t see needing another one anytime soon.</li>
            <li>Saves me so much time now that I bought this.</li>
            <li>Guess I could have taken the time to read the whole description.</li>
            <li>I like that the product came fast.</li>
            <li>these worked really well for me</li>
            <li>Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot</li>
            <li>Came fast and looks like the picture.</li>
            <li>They have absolutely zero customer service.</li>
            <li>it act like it wants to fall into pieces</li>
            <li>A real treasure.</li>
            <li>I really do like the one I got.</li>
            <li>It does not cut straight though.</li>
            <li>Love the pink handles.</li>
            <li>The ones at the store are very pricey...</li>
            <li>they make doing your nails so much easier.</li>
            <li>This works very well even on the thickest of  acrylic.  </li>
            <li>This item works very well.</li>
            <li>And it really makes it a lot easier to keep the nails shaped because they sort if pre shape the nail</li>
            <li>because it doesn&#x27;t really work like a shop works</li>
            <li>I tried it with my real nails</li>
            <li>The item wad very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Really stainless.</li>
            <li>so you really have to watch what your doing</li>
            <li>These nail clippers work very well.</li>
            <li>Once again very sturdy, would recommend</li>
            <li>Very sturdy product for the price</li>
            <li>Fast shipping /</li>
            <li>Fast shipping from China</li>
            <li>I really do recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t like them all that much.</li>
            <li>i like the grip that is on the clippers verses the metel 5 stars for service very please</li>
            <li>Veery fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Loved it, product was simply what I expected.</li>
            <li>A great false nail tips clipper.</li>
            <li>They work nicely, but the feel is just thin and light.</li>
            <li>It shipped really fast and was actually better than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done a few sets of nails and clipped off my own acrylics with it</li>
            <li>You do have to hold at a certain angle to get a clean cut, but is so much easier than having to deal with regular nail clippers!</li>
            <li>I finally got the package today and was excited to try them out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problems in the past with these type of nail clippers not clipping all the way through the nails, but I am actually able to even clip the acrylic nail after it has been finished with these!</li>
            <li>I like this cause it easy to cut on false nail and get them in the right shape and works fine.</li>
            <li>So far it is pretty sturdy and it has not broken.</li>
            <li>I love this tool very sharp and cuts without ripping or tearing the nail, even after I have done the tips they still cut very well.</li>
            <li>and i also love the little purple pouch it arrived in it was safely and carefully packaged</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I ordered and works well on both natural and acrylics.</li>
            <li>The only problem with it is the gel is starting the peel off the bottom of the handles but still works just a fine!</li>
            <li>Works well, just have to be careful because it seems like it could break really easily.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done and is decent for the price.</li>
            <li>Handy for fake nails and very useful.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended seller.</li>
            <li>highly recommended; Received today 12/05/2014</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>These clippers work great and are wide enough that they can clip duck tips, too (the ones that have a wide tip) and I really like that.</li>
            <li>Great on tough nails, too!  --D</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and it makes clipping long nails short fast and easy.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S SHARP AND EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li>I love the pink color too!!!</li>
            <li>They seem very durable so far.</li>
            <li>when i cut the nail it had a diagonal line rather than a straight cut, but i fixed that with some glue.</li>
            <li>Very well priced and came in early in the post.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all pink and looks cheap.</li>
            <li>I love the length of this product and it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>They cut quick and easy and you have to only file them a little bit</li>
            <li>Also, if you have long enough nails, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work on natural ones too!</li>
            <li>Good and necessary women&#x27;s, I highly recommend this clipper for acrylic nails, before I get the clipper I have to pay extra $3 to cut my nails, but now I cut my nails whenever I want without pay extra in the Chinese salon.</li>
            <li>I ordered a big pack of plastic nails and it cuts through them very easily and lines up nicely with the shape of artificial nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so precise and sharp.</li>
            <li>This did not appear new.  </li>
            <li>I really live the nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new..</li>
            <li>So far, in a few weeks, they are ok.</li>
            <li>Love the clippers, they are solid baby pink in color</li>
            <li>I got this yesterday 9 or more days earlier than expected</li>
            <li>I got the nial cutters earlier than expected I always buy these from this distributer I get more than my moneys</li>
            <li>I got the same color as the picture, pink and make sure to cut the nail with the blade facing away from nail and skin.</li>
            <li>They are a little cheap and came in a light pink color.</li>
            <li>It still works fine, very sharp and mine is just as described on picture.</li>
            <li>They stuck a little bit, but after a little (tiny tiny bit) of WD-40 they worked great!!</li>
            <li>The first pair of clippers similar to these was purchased from a beauty supply company for almost $30.</li>
            <li>but wow!</li>
            <li>First of all, I didn&#x27;t even get the same nail clipper as in the picture shown.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I have acrylic nails and they grow so long before I get them filled, this helps to keep them trimmed back.</li>
            <li>Specially because its pink and does a great job cutting tips.</li>
            <li>these seem a little cheap</li>
            <li>A little on the cheap side</li>
            <li>They feel a little cheap when you get them</li>
            <li>but it does the job for the price and good for if you can&#x27;t invest in an expensive one right now but will do the job for a long time !</li>
            <li>great tool for cutting nail tips to size.</li>
            <li>great for cutting acrilic nails</li>
            <li>I received them earlier then expected delivery date which is a plus the handle is comfortable</li>
            <li>not as much control as traditional nail clippers though</li>
            <li>far from what I&#x27;ve seen, this item works well</li>
            <li>but they get the job done and so far they have not fallen apart</li>
            <li>I purchased the Nail Clipper to use on my natural nails.  </li>
            <li>Finally Got it Thanks</li>
            <li>But when it came I was quite surprised.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe how much easier it is with these instead of regular nail clippers.</li>
            <li>Works on natural nails as well, fingers and toes.</li>
            <li>This tool is obviously quicker and cuts much straighter edges and saves me filing time.</li>
            <li>I assumed it was 1/2 the price because it was 1/2 the quality, but so far, that has not been the case.</li>
            <li>Did not cut my natural nails whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Cheap material and will break after a few cuts.</li>
            <li>I was nervous at the price but pleasantly surprised at the quality.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>brought tis product but haven&#x27;t got a chance to used it because too busy working.</li>
            <li>Came early and did not stick up at all.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t going to waste my time when it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>So much easier to cut nail tips than regular nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>but so far it has worked well.</li>
            <li>but you need to be a professional in order to use it.  </li>
            <li>It did cut my natural nail and my acrylic nails also .</li>
            <li>I recommend these clippers to any professional nail tech.</li>
            <li>I use this for my natural nails and when I get acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it on my natural nails</li>
            <li>Mine is pink, though, but I don&#x27;t mind because pink is my favorite color</li>
            <li>The cut was uneven and the experience was more like trying to hack open an orange with a butter knife.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is a good tool for fake nails.ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li>I received the Nail Clippers within the expected date of delivery, I tested the Nail Clippers first on a false nail and then on my own nail</li>
            <li>Nail tips are generally much too long for me</li>
            <li>Love these helps with trimming long nail tips, I actually cut the tip in half and use both pieces</li>
            <li>I have used them several times, and they are still working liken new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m positive the description about the product says pink.</li>
            <li>After a few months of very light use, they cut them very roughly, and the resulting cut looks ragged and chewed.</li>
            <li>Works as expected, thanks.</li>
            <li>i will be ordering from you in the near future.</li>
            <li>Maybe I am too old to adapt to innovation (My cell phone only makes and receives calls</li>
            <li>It look liked someone used it, got tired of it and sent it me!</li>
            <li>I do my own fake nails weekly</li>
            <li>I love my acrylic false tips cutter</li>
            <li>Good to cut down false nail.</li>
            <li>These in particular come with a red handle, and they&#x27;re smaller than those you get at your local beauty supply, seemingly thinner metal too.</li>
            <li>i highly reccommend this tool, it works so much better than regular nail clippers; if your using them for fake nails (tips).</li>
            <li>and they cut sharp and straight.</li>
            <li>This product cuts the fake nails very easily, but I still haven&#x27;t figured out how to cut the shapes yet XP...</li>
            <li>Junk - not sharp enough to cut paper let alone nails.</li>
            <li>Very accurate cutting of nails!! :-)</li>
            <li>it is actually red not pink</li>
            <li>Was not pink the color was red!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast; came a few weeks early actually!!</li>
            <li>And, with the price, I&#x27;ve already gotten my money&#x27;s worth in the past month.</li>
            <li>You have to be real careful on keeping it straight.</li>
            <li>this is so much faster than filing down.</li>
            <li>i noticed if i dont clamp down as fast</li>
            <li>Cheep but its dull and breaks quickly...</li>
            <li>Was extreme!y cheap, weak and when I clip a nail</li>
            <li>Second, I didn&#x27;t even cut a single nail and this waste of money broke within the first 5 minutes of getting it!</li>
            <li>Worked fine until the screw got loose, now it&#x27;s a little crooked and not as sharp as before, I haven&#x27;t tried fixing it, but will use it for now.</li>
            <li>Good for Amazon, BAD FOR CHINA.</li>

            <li> I just love this nail clipper .....</li>
            <li> i bought all these supply&#x27;s for Christmas gift&#x27;s because my Grand daughter is learning to do nails.the cost is great and they deliver fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i guess it would be okay for starters that if it dosent arrive broke like mine did.</li>
            <li> :) and I started out with scissors to cut my nail tips, which gets the job done</li>
            <li> Not to mention the cute color and inexpensive price.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the color.</li>
            <li> In pleased with my purchase. :-)</li>
            <li> but I can always buy more from them.</li>
            <li> Invest in a better one at Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have this product within my possession.</li>
            <li> better than nothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a lot more efficient and quicker in getting the job done.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s more me than the item</li>
            <li> Just glad I didn&#x27;t spend a lot.</li>
            <li> so I guess its better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Makes the nails look better taken care of.</li>
            <li> They work great and arrived rather fast</li>
            <li> The best thing, though, was that I got these clippers for well under five dollars, and at Sally Beauty I would be paying over thirty dollars for the same thing.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I suppose these clippers would be OK if I ever receive them.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I purchased this, makes doing my manicures so much faster</li>
            <li> I love the color of these clippers.</li>
            <li> I had one before that used to bend my nail more than cut it</li>
            <li> They work great and will much ease.</li>
            <li> BUT IT IS OK</li>
            <li> this product is ok quality for price, havent had a chance  to use them yet</li>

            <li> /&gt;You will see this posted many times.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d be happier with a quality nail tip cutter for decades if I could justify the price.</li>
            <li> Does what its supposed to what more could you ask?</li>
            <li> This nail clipper cuts my acrylics to the perfect length and doesn&#x27;t strain on my nail like regular nail clippers.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>

            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more than the clipper itself.</li>
            <li> Besides that though, I love this nail clipper.</li>
            <li> Glad I got it.  </li>
            <li> I ended up buying a better quality one at Sally Beauty for $12</li>
            <li> so that is what I have, thus in all fairness perhaps I should have paid more attention to the descriptive words in Amazon&#x27;s presentation.</li>
            <li> Glad I ordered this.</li>
            <li> will buy more products from them if needed</li>

            <li> so it worked really nice right off the bat!</li>
            <li> Its pretty good for the price</li>
            <li> I loved these at first, but after about 5 uses, they broke on me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best thing I have gotten in a long time!</li>

            <li> but, first practice on nail tips (blanks) before you apply the tip to your own nail.</li>

            <li> This product was ok for the price but its not sharp and didn&#x27;t cut my nails good</li>
            <li> I would have rated this 5 but the blade was just a bittttt slanted but the blade is very very sharp which was awesome to cut nails with.</li>

            <li> Cheap and broke easily</li>
            <li> I do my own acrylic nails at home and this cuts my tips SO EASILY and make a very nice sharp, clean cut.</li>

            <li> but it was cheap.</li>
            <li> They also haven&#x27;t lost their &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; an they are comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> This cheap ish broke the min</li>
            <li> Looked cheap but does the job well.</li>
            <li> I like the item the handle felt kinda cheap</li>
            <li> Immediately you can tell its cheap ...</li>
            <li> You can feel something grinding against another part, it makes it feel cheap.</li>
            <li> The good think it got here early</li>
            <li> So I had to order another pair from Amazon made in The good old USA and already received them.</li>
            <li> I am surprised that these are actually good quality clippers.</li>
            <li> i wouldnt know if you could use it for natural nails and good condition</li>
            <li> So cheap the screw feel off of it and now it never cuts right save your time and money and buy something better quality</li>
            <li> They are so strong and durable and for such an amazing price!</li>
            <li> These clippers leave a smooth, clean cut.</li>
            <li> this item works good when trying to remove an old full set.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone who likes to do their own nails.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Gets the job done and although the price is cheep, the product is worth every cent!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> I love these so much!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for my white tips any my clear tips.</li>
            <li> Gives my nails a nice even cut and much better then the standard &#x27;toe nail&#x27; type clippers.</li>
            <li> However they make a clean cut  and do not crack the nail.</li>
            <li> this works best with really long thick nails, not so great for thinner nails.  </li>
            <li> Also wanted a video of how I use it to see if I just wasn&#x27;t doing it right!</li>
            <li> I was super excited for it to arrive and the receipt stated it would arrive in 3-5 days.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use It was reasonably priced, and overall I was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> they come in a cheap looking packege and feel a little cheap but for the price they are great</li>
            <li> They worked great the first time I used them, the second time the springy thing broke and they would no longer cut.</li>
            <li> Was well worth the wait of shipping for the huge savings.</li>
            <li> The handles are a bit flimsy but overall good product.</li>
            <li> Good luck to you in future sales.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> Good handset for a in-home pedicure at a low cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thx</li>

            <li> It is high quality for the price, comfortable/effortless to hold and super easy for this beginner to use!</li>
            <li> I did have to wipe a little bit of the oil off but 5 stars is perfect for this because its a great buy for so little price!</li>
            <li> but just a tip is easy get a lil harder with acylic nias but its a good tool for the price</li>
            <li> but this is pretty strong and fits all of my nails.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with this, are not difficult.</li>

            <li> Because it&#x27;s a great little gift.  </li>
            <li> Great little clipper.  </li>
            <li> My nails are extremely hard thanks to Quimica Alemana (best nail hardener EVER!!)</li>
            <li> I love it especially if your  customer wants a little flare in there nails its great!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great clippers, not cheap looking at all.</li>
            <li> I really do enjoy this because they are so much easier to use on tips rather than having to cut from side to side.</li>
            <li> Cheap and cuts really well.</li>
            <li> my old one is better though than this.</li>
            <li> This tool help made my finger nails look more professional</li>
            <li> WELL WORTH</li>
            <li> Shipping took awhile but was worth it.</li>
            <li> I cut nail tips and have even cut acrylics with success.</li>
            <li> The best cutting tool a nail styles could have use them all day they cut with eazy and evenly love them</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> They cut great except no matter how much I tried to make a straight cut, it was always crooked,  </li>
            <li> These came earlier than I expected and working awesome!</li>
            <li> but after i used it it was worth the time it took to be delivered.</li>
            <li> The cost was well worth the purchas.</li>
            <li> Worth the money i recommend if your trying to save some money.</li>
            <li> and it was totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This is okay, its very flimpsy and you can tell it wasn&#x27;t made very well, the blade has no cover over it</li>
            <li> worth</li>
            <li> It is not at all useful for me.</li>
            <li> Do my own acrylics at home, these are definite help!!</li>
            <li> they cut my false nails perfectly</li>
            <li> This is an awesome tool for clipping  false nails.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for this product and for getting it to me quickly.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product and excited it arrived thank you so much now I can complete my set</li>
            <li> other wise</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really budget friendly</li>
            <li> Owner wanted to know if I was using it right when I contacted them.</li>
            <li> You have to put a lot of force to cut right</li>
            <li> Waited a long time to recieve but was very impressed with the quality since the cost was so minimal.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time to buy the cutter, it is so convenient and easy to use as well as high performance of quality/cost.</li>
            <li> a very smart purchase</li>
            <li> They can cut a straight edge or oval, they can also turn full cover acrylics into tips.  </li>
            <li> took a long time to get, but liked it once I received it</li>
            <li> Great purchase don&#x27;t have to do much I just cut and file a little bit</li>
            <li> I often do my own acrylic nails, so when I put on the tips (which are very long)</li>
            <li> The Cosmetic Tool Red Handle cutter really come in handy.</li>
            <li> If you want to cut less than 1/2 inch, the nail tends to get mangled rather than a nice clean cut.</li>
            <li> For those who want to purchase you can send me the money and at least get a nice inspiring card.</li>
            <li> but overall good for the price and got here 3 days early</li>
            <li> I got mine, it&#x27;s a cute light baby pink color!</li>
            <li> they work good but maybe could use to be a little sharper</li>
            <li> It seems a bit on the cheap side,  but as long as it works and doesn&#x27;t break,  I&#x27;m fine with it.</li>
            <li> Other than that they are good clippers I gave 2 stars cause , they came super early .</li>
            <li> I would really rate this no stars btw!</li>
            <li> and these are a big help! :-)</li>
            <li> This item looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> will need to order more later on.</li>
            <li> but I would have to spend a lot more time filing to correct my crooked cut.</li>
            <li> The color is really pretty</li>
            <li> and I use this consistently to trim my nails.</li>
            <li> Broke on the first day.</li>
            <li> Broke on the first attempt to use.</li>
            <li> I was using scissors or nail clippers before to cut the acrylic nails, but this really makes my life easier!</li>
            <li> I gave these 5 stars because they are exactly as posted and do the job.  </li>
            <li> They are exactly the ones that are used in salons.</li>
            <li> Worked better than what I used from a local supply house.  </li>
            <li> They really work!</li>
            <li> I love these, I noticed they are the same ones used in nail salons.</li>
            <li> works very well!</li>
            <li> it looks pretty sturdy</li>
            <li> At first, I was unsure about the quality because of the price.</li>
            <li> It is pretty flimsy.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I am a beginner at nail art, and this is one of my first tools to build my kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a tiny bit cheap (but so is the price!)</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Soo much better than regular nail clippers!!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li> it was in its package and it was brand new!i really recommend you to buy it!</li>
            <li> This acrylic nail clipper does exactly what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> And it is also pretty out of my imagination.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I was looking for.....sturdy construction....would recommend.</li>
            <li> It took a little while to come but it was worth the wait.... ordering more soon!</li>
            <li> Its nice and sharp and works well.</li>
            <li> The clippers are really nice my only problem is that it is kind of hard to make sure they are even so my nails some times come out crooked</li>
            <li> Cuts very well sturdy, like it very much</li>
            <li> Came late but really good does the right job.</li>
            <li> I use these to cut my natural nail in a square, makes a great straight line and all I have to do is file the corners to round off</li>
            <li> this really does cut nails straight!</li>
            <li> Item was exactly what was described and has worked very well for the price that was paid.</li>
            <li> works good so far only used it twice so far</li>
            <li> I only used it once, because they broke so easily</li>
            <li> easy to cut the nails to the proper length and works for helping taking the gel or acrylic nails off.</li>
            <li> They cut the nail tips easily but without the bulk of bigger clippers.</li>
            <li> Pure garbage.</li>
            <li> I will certainly recommend this site and item to others</li>
            <li> The pink grip makes them very comfortable in my hand when squeezing.</li>
            <li> this makes it very easy to trim down to size.</li>
            <li> works well arrived fast</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to do much filing.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> it makes acrylic nails so much easier to work with.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for all you have done for me.</li>

            <li> I received my item fairly fast</li>
            <li> Its very sturdy</li>
            <li> I would absolutely buy this again even though I don&#x27;t see needing another one anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Saves me so much time now that I bought this.</li>
            <li> Guess I could have taken the time to read the whole description.</li>
            <li> I like that the product came fast.</li>
            <li> these worked really well for me</li>
            <li> Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot</li>
            <li> Came fast and looks like the picture.</li>
            <li> They have absolutely zero customer service.</li>
            <li> it act like it wants to fall into pieces</li>
            <li> A real treasure.</li>
            <li> I really do like the one I got.</li>
            <li> It does not cut straight though.</li>
            <li> Love the pink handles.</li>
            <li> The ones at the store are very pricey...</li>
            <li> they make doing your nails so much easier.</li>
            <li> This works very well even on the thickest of  acrylic.  </li>
            <li> This item works very well.</li>
            <li> And it really makes it a lot easier to keep the nails shaped because they sort if pre shape the nail</li>
            <li> because it doesn&#x27;t really work like a shop works</li>
            <li> I tried it with my real nails</li>
            <li> The item wad very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Really stainless.</li>

            <li> I really do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t like them all that much.</li>
            <li> i like the grip that is on the clippers verses the metel 5 stars for service very please</li>
            <li> Veery fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Loved it, product was simply what I expected.</li>
            <li> A great false nail tips clipper.</li>
            <li> They work nicely, but the feel is just thin and light.</li>
            <li> It shipped really fast and was actually better than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a few sets of nails and clipped off my own acrylics with it</li>
            <li> You do have to hold at a certain angle to get a clean cut, but is so much easier than having to deal with regular nail clippers!</li>
            <li> I finally got the package today and was excited to try them out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems in the past with these type of nail clippers not clipping all the way through the nails, but I am actually able to even clip the acrylic nail after it has been finished with these!</li>
            <li> I like this cause it easy to cut on false nail and get them in the right shape and works fine.</li>
            <li> So far it is pretty sturdy and it has not broken.</li>
            <li> I love this tool very sharp and cuts without ripping or tearing the nail, even after I have done the tips they still cut very well.</li>
            <li> and i also love the little purple pouch it arrived in it was safely and carefully packaged</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I ordered and works well on both natural and acrylics.</li>
            <li> The only problem with it is the gel is starting the peel off the bottom of the handles but still works just a fine!</li>
            <li> Works well, just have to be careful because it seems like it could break really easily.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done and is decent for the price.</li>
            <li> Handy for fake nails and very useful.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended seller.</li>
            <li> highly recommended; Received today 12/05/2014</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These clippers work great and are wide enough that they can clip duck tips, too (the ones that have a wide tip) and I really like that.</li>
            <li> Great on tough nails, too!  --D</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and it makes clipping long nails short fast and easy.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S SHARP AND EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li> I love the pink color too!!!</li>
            <li> They seem very durable so far.</li>
            <li> when i cut the nail it had a diagonal line rather than a straight cut, but i fixed that with some glue.</li>
            <li> Very well priced and came in early in the post.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all pink and looks cheap.</li>
            <li> I love the length of this product and it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> They cut quick and easy and you have to only file them a little bit</li>
            <li> Also, if you have long enough nails, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work on natural ones too!</li>
            <li> Good and necessary women&#x27;s, I highly recommend this clipper for acrylic nails, before I get the clipper I have to pay extra $3 to cut my nails, but now I cut my nails whenever I want without pay extra in the Chinese salon.</li>
            <li> I ordered a big pack of plastic nails and it cuts through them very easily and lines up nicely with the shape of artificial nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so precise and sharp.</li>
            <li> This did not appear new.  </li>
            <li> I really live the nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new..</li>
            <li> So far, in a few weeks, they are ok.</li>
            <li> Love the clippers, they are solid baby pink in color</li>
            <li> I got this yesterday 9 or more days earlier than expected</li>
            <li> I got the nial cutters earlier than expected I always buy these from this distributer I get more than my moneys</li>
            <li> I got the same color as the picture, pink and make sure to cut the nail with the blade facing away from nail and skin.</li>
            <li> They are a little cheap and came in a light pink color.</li>
            <li> It still works fine, very sharp and mine is just as described on picture.</li>
            <li> They stuck a little bit, but after a little (tiny tiny bit) of WD-40 they worked great!!</li>
            <li> The first pair of clippers similar to these was purchased from a beauty supply company for almost $30.</li>
            <li> but wow!</li>
            <li> First of all, I didn&#x27;t even get the same nail clipper as in the picture shown.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I have acrylic nails and they grow so long before I get them filled, this helps to keep them trimmed back.</li>
            <li> Specially because its pink and does a great job cutting tips.</li>
            <li> these seem a little cheap</li>
            <li> A little on the cheap side</li>
            <li> They feel a little cheap when you get them</li>
            <li> but it does the job for the price and good for if you can&#x27;t invest in an expensive one right now but will do the job for a long time !</li>
            <li> great tool for cutting nail tips to size.</li>
            <li> great for cutting acrilic nails</li>
            <li> I received them earlier then expected delivery date which is a plus the handle is comfortable</li>
            <li> not as much control as traditional nail clippers though</li>
            <li> far from what I&#x27;ve seen, this item works well</li>
            <li> but they get the job done and so far they have not fallen apart</li>
            <li> I purchased the Nail Clipper to use on my natural nails.  </li>
            <li> Finally Got it Thanks</li>
            <li> But when it came I was quite surprised.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe how much easier it is with these instead of regular nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Works on natural nails as well, fingers and toes.</li>
            <li> This tool is obviously quicker and cuts much straighter edges and saves me filing time.</li>
            <li> I assumed it was 1/2 the price because it was 1/2 the quality, but so far, that has not been the case.</li>
            <li> Did not cut my natural nails whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Cheap material and will break after a few cuts.</li>
            <li> I was nervous at the price but pleasantly surprised at the quality.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> brought tis product but haven&#x27;t got a chance to used it because too busy working.</li>
            <li> Came early and did not stick up at all.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to waste my time when it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> So much easier to cut nail tips than regular nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> but so far it has worked well.</li>
            <li> but you need to be a professional in order to use it.  </li>
            <li> It did cut my natural nail and my acrylic nails also .</li>
            <li> I recommend these clippers to any professional nail tech.</li>
            <li> I use this for my natural nails and when I get acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it on my natural nails</li>
            <li> Mine is pink, though, but I don&#x27;t mind because pink is my favorite color</li>
            <li> The cut was uneven and the experience was more like trying to hack open an orange with a butter knife.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is a good tool for fake nails.ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> I received the Nail Clippers within the expected date of delivery, I tested the Nail Clippers first on a false nail and then on my own nail</li>
            <li> Nail tips are generally much too long for me</li>
            <li> Love these helps with trimming long nail tips, I actually cut the tip in half and use both pieces</li>
            <li> I have used them several times, and they are still working liken new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m positive the description about the product says pink.</li>
            <li> After a few months of very light use, they cut them very roughly, and the resulting cut looks ragged and chewed.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, thanks.</li>
            <li> i will be ordering from you in the near future.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am too old to adapt to innovation (My cell phone only makes and receives calls</li>
            <li> It look liked someone used it, got tired of it and sent it me!</li>
            <li> I do my own fake nails weekly</li>
            <li> I love my acrylic false tips cutter</li>
            <li> Good to cut down false nail.</li>
            <li> These in particular come with a red handle, and they&#x27;re smaller than those you get at your local beauty supply, seemingly thinner metal too.</li>
            <li> i highly reccommend this tool, it works so much better than regular nail clippers; if your using them for fake nails (tips).</li>
            <li> and they cut sharp and straight.</li>
            <li> This product cuts the fake nails very easily, but I still haven&#x27;t figured out how to cut the shapes yet XP...</li>
            <li> Junk - not sharp enough to cut paper let alone nails.</li>
            <li> Very accurate cutting of nails!! :-)</li>
            <li> it is actually red not pink</li>
            <li> Was not pink the color was red!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast; came a few weeks early actually!!</li>
            <li> And, with the price, I&#x27;ve already gotten my money&#x27;s worth in the past month.</li>
            <li> You have to be real careful on keeping it straight.</li>
            <li> this is so much faster than filing down.</li>
            <li> i noticed if i dont clamp down as fast</li>
            <li> Cheep but its dull and breaks quickly...</li>
            <li> Was extreme!y cheap, weak and when I clip a nail</li>
            <li> Second, I didn&#x27;t even cut a single nail and this waste of money broke within the first 5 minutes of getting it!</li>
            <li> Worked fine until the screw got loose, now it&#x27;s a little crooked and not as sharp as before, I haven&#x27;t tried fixing it, but will use it for now.</li>
            <li> Good for Amazon, BAD FOR CHINA.</li>
            <li> The nail bent before cutting but other than that it was good</li>
            <li> It also feels really cheap not like the usual heavy ones</li>
            <li> When I did this, the whole thing fell apart and I was not able to put it back together.</li>
            <li> As a nail technician for the last fifteen years, I&#x27;d have to rate this item a single star because it doesn&#x27;t met the material standard in nail technology.</li>
            <li> so not sure really what there like will review again when i have</li>
            <li> Long lasting blade</li>
            <li> cuz they were sorta long and it totally word</li>
            <li> This took a LONG time to arrive,  but when it finally did,  it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> The pink handles on it are very cheaply done, its just the metal that they dipped in rubber, and its layered on very thin...</li>
            <li> nothing is loose, they are quiet, and they can trim even when the acrylic has hardend like butter.</li>
            <li> Does the job but is getting loose after only 2 uses.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised when two arrived in the mail rather than one, but that&#x27;s no problem.</li>
            <li> With this little guy it helps to make my manicure look like I had it done professionally.</li>
            <li> BETTER THAN USING NAIL CLIPPERS OR SCISSORS FOR CUTTING NAILS.</li>
            <li> I love that they send instructions on how to use them for cutting your nail style.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t give them a long life expectancy.</li>
            <li> The shipping took a long time though so keep that in mind before buying.</li>
            <li> They also worked on my mom&#x27;s naturally long nails.</li>
            <li> It was a totally different color (pink) when I got it.</li>
            <li> My nails will really be long by then.</li>
            <li> TOOK A LONG TIME TO GETTHE ITEM</li>
            <li> I actually ordered this in pink</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thankful that they came sooner than the estimated dates which were between July 9th and July 27th that would of been so long to wait.&lt;br /&gt;Again thank you.</li>
            <li> I gave this four stars because in the picture the handle looks pink, but when I received this, it was red.</li>
            <li> I received ,h clippers in the mail and pulled out a red pair, even tho it says pink.</li>
            <li> and I did not have to wait that long for delivery..</li>
            <li> What arrived was not the same as the picture, it was all pink.</li>
            <li> Not very great quality..doesn&#x27;t cut very well..not sharp enough for my nails!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen these at Sally beauty supply and other drugstore and they are almost double the price</li>
            <li> so u either trim a little at time or cut one side then next which makes the nail week in middle an they split.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend other people to buy</li>
            <li> This is the second one I bought as the other one broke.</li>
            <li> Other than that I would TOTALLY recommend!</li>
            <li> so long so when they came in the mail it was like a surprise to myself!</li>
            <li> Sharp enough to trim acrylic nails as well.</li>
            <li> The blade is very dull and it broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Great for cutting false nails.</li>
            <li> And it arrived about the time expected but it was a few days early.</li>
            <li> When I got it i was worried it would break because of how loose the handles were</li>
            <li> Its a lot faster than filing nails down or clipping side by side with a regular clipper.</li>
            <li> Looked at this same item in a beauty supply shop for $15, then found it here for less then $2.</li>
            <li> no complain as long as it sharp.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure how long they&#x27;ll last in the long run.</li>
            <li> As little as I use it, I don&#x27;t want to spend big bucks.  </li>
            <li> today they stopped working the knife thing won&#x27;t slide back down !</li>
            <li> They cut either way, and you can see the amount of nail through the mental piece to get just the correct amount.  </li>
            <li> I ordered in pink.</li>
            <li> but it works as expected</li>
            <li> I can be rough on things</li>
            <li> It s not real sturdy but will do for cosmetology school for now.</li>
            <li> Nicer than I expected.  </li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t pink.</li>
            <li> Cheep and leaves nails rough and cracked</li>
            <li> I got a poppy pink cutter.</li>
            <li> The item I received was all silver and not with the pink handles.</li>
            <li> is pink and purple so this does not match everything else I have.  </li>
            <li> I received the tip cutter sooner then expected.</li>
            <li> But in all honesty what did I expected?</li>
            <li> Mine do not have the pink grips on the handle as pictured, but they do seem to work well.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s what I expected - Thank you.</li>
            <li> These clippers work great for cutting false nails!</li>
            <li> I use it quite often on false nails and my real nails sometimes.</li>
            <li> I use it quite often on false nails and my real nails sometimes.</li>
            <li> Works very well on false nails.  </li>
            <li> cos ordinary clippers don&#x27;t let u go down to far</li>
            <li> Wonderfully sharp and smooth cutting...</li>
            <li> No struggle what to ever, its light, sharp, and cuts my artificial nail tips with no problem.</li>
            <li> I bought them on Sept.2nd and not here yet do to coming from China with a long month and a half waiting period.</li>
            <li> When I was trimming my false nails down to size, the clippers functioned smoothly and did not spit shards of hard plastic everywhere.</li>
            <li> ok I am not sure if I got a bad pair or not because after a couple of uses the blade slanted and wouldn&#x27;t cut any longer I am getting another pair to try same brand</li>
            <li> And being that all my other tools are pink I decided to order this nail clipper.</li>
            <li> It is precise in cutting half nails and it is a little smaller than other Nail clippers that I have used, but its not a problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright at cutting nail tips but when you clamp down on the handle, it doesn&#x27;t move smoothly.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t think to order these before doing my nail the first time</li>
            <li> Not exactly as pictured but I like it.</li>
            <li> Looks sharp and performs well on any nail.</li>
            <li> You can cut it curvy, sharp edges, etc.</li>
            <li> NOT SO SHARP</li>
            <li> Came faster than I expected!</li>
            <li> i gave it a 3 because its not too sharp</li>
            <li> This is really sharp though so be careful when using it!</li>
            <li> Which means the blades in clipper are sharp.</li>
            <li> will be buying other items from this seller</li>
            <li> and I have to do very minimal filing with these.</li>
            <li> They feel a little loose when I use them.</li>
            <li> These clippers work great when it comes to cutting artificial nails.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was longer than expected item too small for it to have taken so long to get to me.</li>
            <li> I gave them 2 stars because, hopefully, they will cut nails a few times before breaking or becoming otherwise dull and useless.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it</li>
            <li> Shipped fast; clippers work well with fake nails.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good product based on the reviews, (maybe i got a defective one) but it was horrible.</li>
            <li> It does leave the edge of the nail a little rough, with sharp corners, but just a few swipes with an emery board takes care of that.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using them on trimming down nails with acrylic already on them.</li>
            <li> Helps to cut down on file time.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy again and won&#x27;t take this post down.</li>
            <li> It cuts down acrylic nails with ease.</li>
            <li> Lastly, it came wayyyyyy past the date it was supposed to arrive!</li>
            <li> but I mean it was only $2.</li>
            <li> So durable and strong works on all nails whether real or fake.</li>
            <li> first I had a hard time cutting my nail but by they second use, I got it down pack.</li>
            <li> and this can prove difficult;  not only to hold the nail but to try and fit the wide end into the cutting slot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very strong.</li>
            <li> Mine were that &amp;#34;Blade&amp;#34; was slightly tilted so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since discovered that Walmart sells Nailene brand for less than $4, and the no-slip grips are vinyl covered.</li>
            <li> Small and pink!</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous to buy.</li>
            <li> i was a little worried about quality with the price</li>
            <li> It took a little practice.</li>
            <li> Could be a little sharper.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to push down really hard like with other brands.</li>
            <li> I am a cosmetologist and I find this product very convenient when clipping artificial nails.</li>
            <li> Want to do straight edge cutting like the professionals do at the salon?</li>
            <li> These make cutting those acrylic nails sooo much easier.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Toenails did not fit this type of clipper</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheaply made either.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even waste one cent on this item.</li>
            <li> and a firm grip.</li>
            <li> if it is missing they replace it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a waste of money ..</li>
            <li> and it also cuts uneven</li>
            <li> Make sure they are sharp or cold bend the artificial nail.</li>
            <li> Either way, I have to file them down to shape them, so it&#x27;s not a huge deal, but its annoying that these have gone dull so quickly.</li>
            <li> but it was hard keeping up with my artificial nails when I was trying to get that straight edge look.</li>
            <li> it may take a little longer, but you&#x27;ll save a ton of money!</li>
            <li> I love cutting my fake nails with them now!</li>
            <li> Broke first time used :(</li>
            <li> And its small as heck looks like something for a child to use.</li>
            <li> Anything you buy here an amazon thats under 5$ is bound to have a few negative points.</li>
            <li> small</li>
            <li> and I am totally disappointed with first usage.</li>
            <li> It must not be made to work on ordinary finger nails and I am a guy</li>
            <li> I like short fake nails and this trims any length you need.</li>
            <li> It broke on my third nail using it the very first time &amp;#62;:( I was so unhappy.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave a 4 instead of a 5 is because in the picture it shows a pink handle and the one I received is a ugly burnt orange color...</li>
            <li> The clipper is smooth when cutting artificial nails.</li>
            <li> Not very good.  </li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied and disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the shipping took very long, almost 2 months.</li>
            <li> When I tried it the blade is dull as well.  </li>
            <li> so far not so bad.</li>
            <li> Was hesitant to buy these from all the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> There are maybe 3-5 different nail cutting shapes you can do with this thing.</li>
            <li> I order from overseas all the time, and I think this was still ridiculously late.</li>
            <li> However you need to be careful because the way you position the clipper you may trim the nail wrong.</li>
            <li> Not amazing quality, but</li>
            <li> so now I dnt have any not very happy with this product at all</li>
            <li> hard to get a rounded cut with this until you have some serious practice.</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT top quality!</li>
            <li> It took forever (I mean over a month) to arrive, but for the price, I can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li> is totally ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of the price</li>
            <li> Not good .</li>
            <li> but I received an ugly red shade clipper, NOT what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I use it a lot and it is cutting nails sharply leaving no &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; edges on nails.</li>
            <li> Not pleasant.</li>
            <li> Horrible broke the first day I used them,</li>
            <li> Dumb PPL.</li>
            <li> When I tried cutting my nails, the hinge was off and wouldn&#x27;t clamp down in order to cut the nail.</li>
            <li> doesnt cut my nails, very dull</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made poorly nd</li>
            <li> Poorly made.</li>
            <li> and it was broken.</li>
            <li> and mine came broken</li>
            <li> Was broken when it arrived.</li>
            <li> These game from China.</li>
            <li> Came with broken spring, not in any sanitary packaging.</li>
            <li> plus i was tired of waiting.</li>
            <li> When it arrived at my house it was broken.</li>
            <li> This cutter cuts false nails well</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes of it making it easier for me to trim false nails when I do my nails.</li>
            <li> Nail Clipper Acrylic Uv GEL False Tips Cutter 46p(Nail Clipper)</li>
            <li> False advertisement ..</li>
            <li> they slice throug the false nails like butter.</li>
            <li> makes clipping false tips easier and faster.</li>
            <li> I like this product o trim my false nails because it does not crack them, chip them, or ruin the nail polish.</li>
            <li> Sadly on the thumbnails it bends them before it cuts them so the false nail is then weak and prone to breaking.</li>
            <li> , I was a little doubtful.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s in the wrong direction</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it was not what was shown in picture...</li>
            <li> I bought this to trim my fake nails like they do at the salon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad because the item I received is not as the seller has pictured</li>
            <li> An fail to deliver item.</li>
            <li> I use these on the fake nails for the tips I bought myself.</li>
            <li> thank you very much ill keep shopping</li>
            <li> Been wanting one for years, but they are too expensive in the nail supply stores.</li>
            <li> Made very poorly.</li>
            <li> Instead, they are all metal and, except for the cutting surface, are painted with an awful shade of pink paint!</li>
            <li> it bends the nail and then causes it to stretch and snap at the cutting point until it snaps off.</li>
            <li> I used to fiddle about cutting my nails</li>
            <li> they cut artificial nail tips.</li>
            <li> so it causes the nail to bend in between when cutting.</li>
            <li> It truly does the job cutting my nails and artificial nails as well.</li>
            <li> Essesntial, to cut acrylic or artificial  nails</li>
            <li> FALSE ADVERTISING!!</li>
            <li> its very small!!!</li>
            <li> Very unfortunate.</li>
            <li> I am every up set because I wanted this so badly.......</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I just got a bad pair?</li>
            <li> it is 11/14/13 and geting frustrated a bit on the delivery and all wishing it was here</li>
            <li> it makes it look ugly</li>
            <li> I was so so disappointed in receiving this item.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> This stupid thing here .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so annoying .</li>
            <li> kinda annoying,  but</li>
            <li> I hate these because they don&#x27;t even cut the name it just ben&#x27;s it</li>
            <li> Ugh! Ugly!  </li>
            <li> I received the clippers today, ordered 23 days ago, and I am VERY DISAPPOINTED.  </li>
            <li> Terrible!  </li>
            <li> so t may have just been me :(!!</li>
            <li> This is CRAP!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Color was different from the picture but It works great.</li>
            <li> These clippers work perfect for acrylic nails! They are well made, and do not feel as if they would break on you. I have used them several times, and they are still working liken new.</li>
            <li> works okay broke after a couple weeks</li>
            <li> This product cuts the fake nails very easily, but I still haven&#x27;t figured out how to cut the shapes yet XP...</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t receive what is shown, my nail cutters look the same as the picture, except the handle is red. BUT they do work.</li>
            <li> I love the length of this product and it will last a very long time. add more products as a package to give to your clients</li>
            <li> this product does not have a traditional blade. it bends the nail and then causes it to stretch and snap at the cutting point until it snaps off. leaves a nice edge though. hard to get a rounded cut with this until you have some serious practice.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my extra stuff. my old one is better though than this. no complain as long as it sharp. I will recommend this.</li>
            <li> smaller than the one I have, but still work well.</li>
            <li> Broke first time used :(</li>
            <li> good for acrylic nails</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time as stated i was hoping to get it earlier for Christmas.  Because it&#x27;s a great little gift.  I thought it could&#x27;ve been more sturdier, but she loved it and that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li> this worked soooooooooooo perfect !!!!! there are 3 different ways u can cut ur nails and the instructions tell and show u how. I love this nail cutter !!!! just like the salons.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for! Now I can cut my own nails and stop paying the salon $3 to do it!</li>
            <li> perfect just like the salon and a great deal</li>
            <li> Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Not very good.  It&#x27;s made poorly nd it feels like it&#x27;s gonna fall apart as in using it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> doesnt cut my nails, very dull</li>
            <li> Fist time tried works as says it does</li>
            <li> It is much better than using a nail clipper. Cannot beat the price. Does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> They worked awesome at first but after the 6th time I used them they broke...</li>
            <li> Leaves a indentation mark where you clip the nail</li>
            <li> Impressed with this tool !</li>
            <li> This cutter cuts my nail tips perfectly. It&#x27;s a good quality cutter. I got it within 10 days, so I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li> Came late but really good does the right job. Great for acrylic.</li>
            <li> Poorly made. Didn&#x27;t even used yet and it was broken.</li>
            <li> works well arrived fast</li>
            <li> It broke the SECOND DAY i used it . Wanna return it but going to use my uncanny mechanical skills to try and fix it but . This stupid thing here . Not worth it</li>
            <li> The nail clippers work every time I use them!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very strong. It broke on my third nail using it the very first time &amp;#62;:( I was so unhappy.</li>
            <li> There red lol and cheap looking</li>
            <li> Excellent product and it came on time</li>
            <li> Works as expected, thanks.</li>
            <li> Loved it, product was simply what I expected. Outstanding value at excellent price, I will definitely be buying from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Good product but not so strong.</li>
            <li> great clippers, really easy to use, good quality, and the price is so great. I would recommend if you are looking for sq nail tips.</li>
            <li> great to cut nail tips/acrylics. not as much control as traditional nail clippers though</li>
            <li> I do my own nail but it was hard keeping up with my artificial nails when I was trying to get that straight edge look. The Cosmetic Tool Red Handle cutter really come in handy. This tool help made my finger nails look more professional and I don&#x27;t have to do much filing.</li>
            <li> This item is not of the best category.  However it was a steal at this price.</li>
            <li> This did not appear new.  When I tried it the blade is dull as well.  It looks worn and I will have to purchase another one.</li>
            <li> Great purchase. Highly Recommended seller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda flimsy and bent but it does the job for the price and good for if you can&#x27;t invest in an expensive one right now but will do the job for a long time !</li>
            <li> GREAT QUALITY. SO INEXPENSIVE IT WAS WELL WORTH THE WAIT. CHEAP IN PRICE BUT NOT IN QUALITY! IT&#x27;S SHARP AND EASY TO USE. BETTER THAN USING NAIL CLIPPERS OR SCISSORS FOR CUTTING NAILS. I WOULD BUY AGAIN.</li>
            <li> They are pretty cheap. they don&#x27;t feel sturdy. I keep expecting them to fall apart.  So far, in a few weeks, they are ok. I don&#x27;t give them a long life expectancy. But for now, they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Looks just like the picture.i haven&#x27;t used it yet but it looks like it&#x27;s going to irk okay. I recommend this product for the price and the product</li>
            <li> These were packaged well and came on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far from what I&#x27;ve seen, this item works well and Im pleased with it&#x27;s quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT top quality! It look liked someone used it, got tired of it and sent it me!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Works perfectly</li>
            <li> took a long time to get, but liked it once I received it</li>
            <li> I love these things better than standard clippers.  They cut either way, and you can see the amount of nail through the mental piece to get just the correct amount.  Great on tough nails, too!  --D</li>
            <li> Toenails did not fit this type of clipper</li>
            <li> I was so glad when the clippers came!! I have been wanting this for sometime now. They stuck a little bit, but after a little (tiny tiny bit) of WD-40 they worked great!!</li>
            <li> Junk - not sharp enough to cut paper let alone nails.</li>
            <li> Came on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I had a hard time cutting my nail but by they second use, I got it down pack.</li>
            <li> They feel a little loose when I use them.</li>
            <li> these seem a little cheap but they get the job done and so far they have not fallen apart yet so we will see...</li>
            <li> Handy for fake nails and very useful.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Nail Clipper to use on my natural nails.  I prefer a squared-off nail look, rather than oval, and regular nail clippers just weren&#x27;t doing it for me.  This tool has made a huge difference.  It easily clips the nail in the square shape. It does leave the edge of the nail a little rough, with sharp corners, but just a few swipes with an emery board takes care of that.  Now that I&#x27;ve used this for awhile, I consider it something I wouldn&#x27;t do without.</li>
            <li> havent goten them yet stll wateing for them it is 11/14/13 and geting frustrated a bit on the delivery and all wishing it was here</li>
            <li> I would have rated this 5 but the blade was just a bittttt slanted but the blade is very very sharp which was awesome to cut nails with.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to look after my nails. I don&#x27;t have to visit the manicurist quite so often.</li>
            <li> This product works well but the packaging is sub par. I bought as a gift for my girlfiend who does nails and she swears by these</li>
            <li> Finally Got it Thanks</li>
            <li> this works best with really long thick nails, not so great for thinner nails.  If you want to cut less than 1/2 inch, the nail tends to get mangled rather than a nice clean cut.</li>
            <li> I love it because in the store their $18-$20 but there only $2 on here but I placed my order on October 21,2013 and today is December 3,2013 it said it would come in ten day  an  I still don&#x27;t have  it I am every up set because I wanted this so badly.......I would really rate this no stars btw!</li>
            <li> Very good item. Impressed. Very accurate cutting of nails!! :-)</li>
            <li> I ordered this nail clipper a month ago. I finally got the package today and was excited to try them out but when I opened the package I got tweezers instead. I&#x27;ve already emailed the alert but haven&#x27;t heard back from them. Very dissatisfied and disappointed.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t broke your gel nails but please don&#x27;t cut them too short you may regret it...</li>
            <li> I try to save money, so when I was looking for nail clippers and I stumbled upon this, I was a little doubtful. But when it came I was quite surprised. I have no issues with this and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This package arrived 8 days earlier than the estimated arrival date was also very nicely packaged, very well wrap. they&#x27;re very study and work very good on plastic nails. I do my own fake nails weekly and these are a big help! :-)</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and works well for my purposes. The handles are a bit flimsy but overall good product. I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
            <li> Was hesitant to buy these from all the negative reviews. But I love them they cut very easily and I&#x27;ve had them for a while and use them all the time and they are still working great and haven&#x27;t broke.</li>
            <li> Good and necessary women&#x27;s, I highly recommend this clipper for acrylic nails, before I get the clipper I have to pay extra $3 to cut my nails, but now I cut my nails whenever I want without pay extra in the Chinese salon.</li>
            <li> These do what they&#x27;re supposed to do. Mine is pink, though, but I don&#x27;t mind because pink is my favorite color haha.</li>
            <li> Fell apart after 2days.</li>
            <li> I only used it once, because they broke so easily</li>
            <li> Great It is good I got it on time so good . I may buy more depends on how others goes,</li>
            <li> Got the Clippers 2 days ago .. today they stopped working the knife thing won&#x27;t slide back down ! It&#x27;s so annoying . Other than that they are good clippers I gave 2 stars cause , they came super early .</li>
            <li> It cuts with ease and does not damage my acry nails. It&#x27;s so precise and sharp. It;s well made, but so cheap!!! It&#x27;s probably my best online purchase ever!!!</li>
            <li> Work nice and received them in a timely manor.</li>
            <li> Does not look like in the picture. Look very cheap</li>
            <li> Been needing one of these forever! Shipping took awhile but was worth it. Very handy to be able to cut the nail evenly with no fuss. Would purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> So happy these arrived Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t think to order these before doing my nail the first time and I can&#x27;t believe how much easier it is with these instead of regular nail clippers. Absolutely love them arms highly recommended.  Thank you</li>
            <li> It cuts very well just be careful because you have to cut it in a position to get your ideal look</li>
            <li> So durable and strong works on all nails whether real or fake. Clean cut just wonderful. So easy to handle.</li>
            <li> it got here when it was supposed to, and it is perfect  thank you.. I love love love it, thanks</li>
            <li> This item looks exactly like the picture. Not amazing quality, but it gets the job done. The shipping took a long time though so keep that in mind before buying.</li>
            <li> This was absolutely AMAZING for the price! It is super sharp and cuts great! Also the back of the wrapping comes with instruction on how to get three different types of tips with this cutter! GREAT!</li>
            <li> This tool worked great.It is very easy to use It was reasonably priced, and overall I was very satisfied. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great!  A good product does not need lots of words. Works on natural nails as well, fingers and toes.</li>
            <li> This is a very good nail clipper it&#x27;s actually all sliver metal. Cuts very well sturdy, like it very much</li>
            <li> Not exactly as pictured but I like it. Thank you very much for this product and for getting it to me quickly.</li>
            <li> This product was ok for the price but its not sharp and didn&#x27;t cut my nails good it worked but not that good but my nails are strong not weak maybe if your nails are week or brittle it will work better for you.</li>
            <li> As soon as I saw this nail clipper, I immediately knew it would be the end of my visits to the manicurist or pedicurist. It was time I did my own nails, which saves me money as well. Looks sharp and performs well on any nail.</li>
            <li> Love em, excellent price and I have to do very minimal filing with these. I ordered in pink. Thank u seller!!</li>
            <li> I just love this nail clipper .....it makes acrylic nails so much easier to work with. Thank you very much !</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for my white tips any my clear tips. The pink grip makes them very comfortable in my hand when squeezing. They seem very durable so far.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for all you have done for me. Good luck to you in future sales.&lt;br /&gt;Have a nice rest of the day&lt;br /&gt;goodbye</li>
            <li> so far not so bad. will need to order more later on. one is not enough for the work I want to do</li>
            <li> They worked great the first time I used them, the second time the springy thing broke and they would no longer cut. Very disappointing, wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> i bought all these supply&#x27;s for Christmas gift&#x27;s because my Grand daughter is learning to do nails.the cost is great and they deliver fast. she loves them.</li>
            <li> its very small!!! and mine came broken also took forever to get here.&lt;br /&gt;i guess it would be okay for starters that if it dosent arrive broke like mine did.</li>
            <li> It works but it is kinda cheap</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for the price. I am a &amp;#34;rookie at home nail technician&amp;#34; :) and I started out with scissors to cut my nail tips, which gets the job done but I would have to spend a lot more time filing to correct my crooked cut. This tool is obviously quicker and cuts much straighter edges and saves me filing time. I&#x27;ve seen these at Sally beauty supply and other drugstore and they are almost double the price so I was worried about purchasing this one...I assumed it was 1/2 the price because it was 1/2 the quality, but so far, that has not been the case. I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months now. What a great value! It is high quality for the price, comfortable/effortless to hold and super easy for this beginner to use! Also, My suggestion to any beginners out there trying to do their acrylics at home: use ASP dual nail forms! They are like $6 and It&#x27;s a great way to start and you&#x27;ll be happy with your results! Oh and purchase your supplies on amazon, not beauty supplies stores... it may take a little longer, but you&#x27;ll save a ton of money!</li>
            <li> This cutter cuts false nails well but it&#x27;s in the wrong direction so one has to turn the nail around while hold the short end and this can prove difficult;  not only to hold the nail but to try and fit the wide end into the cutting slot.</li>
            <li> great tool for cutting nail tips to size.</li>
            <li> Too forever to ship but it works as expected</li>
            <li> I used to fiddle about cutting my nails cos ordinary clippers don&#x27;t let u go down to far so u either trim a little at time or cut one side then next which makes the nail week in middle an they split. This tool is wonderful as u just put your nails through to where u whant it clipped. It&#x27;s like a hand held giulletine lol</li>
            <li> These do what they are supposed to do- they cut artificial nail tips. After a few months of very light use, they cut them very roughly, and the resulting cut looks ragged and chewed. Either way, I have to file them down to shape them, so it&#x27;s not a huge deal, but its annoying that these have gone dull so quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes of it making it easier for me to trim false nails when I do my nails. Sadly on the thumbnails it bends them before it cuts them so the false nail is then weak and prone to breaking.</li>
            <li> Delivery was longer than expected item too small for it to have taken so long to get to me. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but it dose not look like the picture at all it was all pink-as I chose it simply because I thought it was like the picture and it looks cheap in person. And its small as heck looks like something for a child to use. I will be back later to rate on the functionality.</li>
            <li> Was broken when it arrived.</li>
            <li> I was worried about it since it is so cheap but this is pretty strong and fits all of my nails. Cuts smooth and easily on my acrylics.</li>
            <li> they cut my false nails perfectly they come in a cheap looking packege and feel a little cheap but for the price they are great</li>
            <li> So I ordered this nail clipper thinking it was the best price anyone could pay. I was super excited for it to arrive and the receipt stated it would arrive in 3-5 days. I waited a whole month and it never came. It has now been 6 months.</li>
            <li> Works well, just have to be careful because it seems like it could break really easily. But good for the price.</li>
            <li> it broke in the middle of doing my nails and so had to do alot of filing to get them were i wanted them so i will not bew getting this one again</li>
            <li> Did not cut my natural nails whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price! I cut nail tips and have even cut acrylics with success. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best clipper in the world but it does the job. Very easy to use. You can even use it for the flare nails</li>
            <li> Very cheap! Very handy. I&#x27;m a beginner nail designer and I needed something to clip the nails. There are maybe 3-5 different nail cutting shapes you can do with this thing. You can cut it curvy, sharp edges, etc. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> JUST AS ORDERED. EASY TO USE AND EASY TO GRIP AND NOT LET GO. NOT SO SHARP AS TO CUT YOURSELF&lt;br /&gt;EASY TO HANDLE.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this item, I&#x27;m happy with results. Good handset for a in-home pedicure at a low cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thx</li>
            <li> I received my item fairly fast but unfortunately it was not what was shown in picture...but you get what you pay for..I just hope it works and I will be fine with it.&lt;br /&gt;thanks for the speedy delivery.  Cant wait to use it!</li>
            <li> The color is really pretty and they cut real good too!</li>
            <li> Not even close to the picture represented. They came apart before I even used them. China strikes again.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product. I am a cosmetologist and I find this product very convenient when clipping artificial nails. Not to mention the cute color and inexpensive price. Will buy again</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!! Great purchase don&#x27;t have to do much I just cut and file a little bit and my nails look great, would definitely recommend to buy</li>
            <li> I recently got into DIY nail art and acrylic nails. These clippers work great for cutting false nails! They also worked on my mom&#x27;s naturally long nails. You can alter the shape of the tip by changing the angle of the clipper. Definitely beats regular clippers! With these, you can cut the entire tip in with one squeeze of the handles! I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> for finger nails only</li>
            <li> I bought this to trim my fake nails like they do at the salon and it works wonderful!  It was not only cheap but is of great quality!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I ordered and works well on both natural and acrylics. That fact that its my favorite color is always a plus! I&#x27;m happy with my purchase â˜º</li>
            <li> I use it for all nails! I love it. It makes perfect square nails its not cheap. Its very sturdy</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product and excited it arrived thank you so much now I can complete my set</li>
            <li> The first pair of clippers similar to these was purchased from a beauty supply company for almost $30. This clipper is as sturdy and works just as well at a terrific price.</li>
            <li> Works great very satisfied with this product. I would definitley purchase from you guys again! I love it alot and it was cheap</li>
            <li> It was a totally different color (pink) when I got it. But it works well and does what it needs to.</li>
            <li> I really live the nail clippers.  I did not know you could get people nail clippers like these.  Wow they are easy to use and do a wonderful job</li>
            <li> I like this cause it easy to cut on false nail and get them in the right shape and works fine.</li>
            <li> I love this tool very sharp and cuts without ripping or tearing the nail, even after I have done the tips they still cut very well. I would absolutely buy this again even though I don&#x27;t see needing another one anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Came quick and works so good. Saves me so much time now that I bought this. I would definitely recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> I love using these nail clippers because they shape my acrylic nails and my real nails in a perfect shape!</li>
            <li> This nail clipper is great, so far.  I have used them several time, with and without acrylic. I love that they send instructions on how to use them for cutting your nail style.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used this a million times! I love them! Best thing I could have gotten. Just what I need when doing nails!</li>
            <li> Small and pink! It has comfy hand grip and great for any nail tech to use! It is a great deal!</li>
            <li> Works just like my dog clippers. Make sure they are sharp or cold bend the artificial nail. Thank you for the design.</li>
            <li> Works perfect for acrylic nails had a lil prob to get a good cut on gel nails or natural nails but just a tip is easy get a lil harder with acylic nias but its a good tool for the price</li>
            <li> These game from China. Guess I could have taken the time to read the whole description. still a good product. and a great price.</li>
            <li> This product works great and does exactly what it was designed to do. It cuts perfectly. It&#x27;s not cheaply made either. I would buy from this seller again</li>
            <li> A great false nail tips clipper. it&#x27;s actually works great. I love the color. nice size good grip I used it twice it works for me.</li>
            <li> Just recvd today, 3.31.14. Looks as promised like advertisement picture. It will serve the purpose for which I ordered it and it didn&#x27;t cost a fortune. Thank you. In pleased with my purchase. :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a nail clipper for a while, now I have my very own. Thank you so much :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> After reading reviews about this product and how it breaks when used. I was a little nervous to buy. But my product arrived very fast and works perfectly! Gets the job done and although the price is cheep, the product is worth every cent! I would still buy from them even if it wasn&#x27;t as cheep!</li>
            <li> Excellent came in before projected due date and excellent good quality pair of nail clippers. A product you only have to buy once in your life unless you run it over with a truck.</li>
            <li> i was a little worried about quality with the price but wow! nothing is loose, they are quiet, and they can trim even when the acrylic has hardend like butter. they dont look cheap either and all metal.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re alright. A little on the cheap side but it does cut the tips great. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using them on trimming down nails with acrylic already on them.</li>
            <li> It broke real easy so now I dnt have any not very happy with this product at allðŸ˜žðŸ˜žnot very happy</li>
            <li> I just recieved it yesterday, and I only do nails on the weekend, so I will get to use it this weekend, it took foreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeever getting to me. I order from overseas all the time, and I think this was still ridiculously late.</li>
            <li> Terrible!  I used this twice and it broke apart.</li>
            <li> Works great :) And its cheap! i highly reccommend this tool, it works so much better than regular nail clippers; if your using them for fake nails (tips).</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good product based on the reviews, (maybe i got a defective one) but it was horrible. The blade is not set close enough to the actual clipper so it causes the nail to bend in between when cutting. I hope that made sense. The cut was uneven and the experience was more like trying to hack open an orange with a butter knife. Not pleasant. Will not order again.</li>
            <li> Its a good product and works well! The only problem with it is the gel is starting the peel off the bottom of the handles but still works just a fine! A good product!</li>
            <li> I like that the product came fast. it was inexpensive to buy. of course it may not be like unbreakable but I can always buy more from them. and if I cant find them again, dog clipers are the same thing</li>
            <li> Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
            <li> This is great for the price. My nails are extremely hard thanks to Quimica Alemana (best nail hardener EVER!!) and I use this consistently to trim my nails. It gives them the perfect square cut for my manis. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price, but i&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and it&#x27;s still intact.</li>
            <li> When i first got this product I thought it felt very cheap, but I have put mine through a lot and they are very durable and work fantastically!</li>
            <li> Broke on the first day. Very cheaply made. Very unfortunate. Dont waste your money. Invest in a better one at Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Broke on the first attempt to use. You get what you pay for. For those who want to purchase you can send me the money and at least get a nice inspiring card.</li>
            <li> The nail clipper Acrylic tip cutter is great, it helps me to cut the tips easily, with no complications. I&#x27;m glad to have this product within my possession.</li>
            <li> The nail bent before cutting but other than that it was good</li>
            <li> these worked really well for me i have had them for well over a month with no problem i would recommend these to any one looking for a good cheap nail clipper</li>
            <li> Anything you buy here an amazon thats under 5$ is bound to have a few negative points. Mine were that &amp;#34;Blade&amp;#34; was slightly tilted so when i cut the nail it had a diagonal line rather than a straight cut, but i fixed that with some glue. l it arrived within 2 weeks! better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Its a lot faster than filing nails down or clipping side by side with a regular clipper. It&#x27;s also a lot more efficient and quicker in getting the job done.</li>
            <li> small but it should work</li>
            <li> I was so so disappointed in receiving this item. I battled to use it!! It is a great rip-off and a criminal case should be opened against the designers of this product. Pure garbage. I bought two as a gist for my sister!!</li>
            <li> This thing is literally poop. First of all, I didn&#x27;t even get the same nail clipper as in the picture shown. Second, I didn&#x27;t even cut a single nail and this waste of money broke within the first 5 minutes of getting it! Lastly, it came wayyyyyy past the date it was supposed to arrive! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The best cutting tool a nail styles could have use them all day they cut with eazy and evenly love them</li>
            <li> The clippers are really nice my only problem is that it is kind of hard to make sure they are even so my nails some times come out crooked but that&#x27;s more me than the item</li>
            <li> love this  make&#x27;s it  easy to cut the nails.</li>
            <li> Just got my nail clippers today iam excited to use them so far they seem to work out great</li>
            <li> This tool is fantastic. I was using scissors or nail clippers before to cut the acrylic nails, but this really makes my life easier!</li>
            <li> This clipper worked well for a while but after about 12 uses it broke. I can be rough on things so t may have just been me :(!!</li>
            <li> Awesome! Came in perfect qualityquality</li>
            <li> They work well but look nothing like the picture they are very cheap made out of aluminum or something good price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m positive the description about the product says pink. And being that all my other tools are pink I decided to order this nail clipper. But... It&#x27;s red. And this is the second time something like this has happened to me. It also feels really cheap not like the usual heavy ones but I mean it was only $2.</li>
            <li> My clipper is crooked and the screw is About to come out and I only used it once?</li>
            <li> I never revived this item so I have no clue how well it works. Thanks for nothing. Just glad I didn&#x27;t spend a lot.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and it is the same as shown. Great for quicker nail prep.</li>
            <li> easy to cut the nails to the proper length and works for helping taking the gel or acrylic nails off.</li>
            <li> Omg !! ,I&#x27;m soo happy I just now received my cosmetic tool today while it said that it well arrive around may the 7th or 24th ðŸ˜« I&#x27;m super surprise that it came so early and its perfect,cuts smooth and easily.Over all 5stars ðŸ˜š ðŸ˜˜</li>
            <li> I TOTALLY LOVE THIS CUTTER!! BEST IDEA EVER to get one for acrylic nails!! Will be using this for years to come! Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> I received the Nail Clippers within the expected date of delivery, I tested the Nail Clippers first on a false nail and then on my own nail and they work like a charm. I&#x27;m sad because the item I received is not as the seller has pictured but I am happy that they will work for my needs. All in all even though the item is not as pictured a am giving a 5 star rating. I will do business with this seller again.</li>
            <li> I use this to trip back my nails.  I have acrylic nails and they grow so long before I get them filled, this helps to keep them trimmed back.</li>
            <li> Best nail trimmer I could ever remember having. Also the lowest price I ever paid for one.  Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> As a nail technician for the last fifteen years, I&#x27;d have to rate this item a single star because it doesn&#x27;t met the material standard in nail technology. Cheap material and will break after a few cuts.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Cheep but its dull and breaks quickly... But. I really didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot so I guess its better than nothing.</li>
            <li> This is just as described.  Looks just like the picture.  Lightweight, gives accurate cuts.  I have only used this once. Thus far it works great.</li>
            <li> Worked fine until the screw got loose, now it&#x27;s a little crooked and not as sharp as before, I haven&#x27;t tried fixing it, but will use it for now.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly and were a great price!</li>
            <li> It lasted about two weeks before it broke . Came faster than I expected!</li>
            <li> Not very great quality..doesn&#x27;t cut very well..not sharp enough for my nails!</li>
            <li> They are a little cheap and came in a light pink color. Not like the picture, they are all think metal and do not have the rubber on the handles but they do the job</li>
            <li> When I received this item it was broke so the manufacturer just sent anything being that it came from China and the hassle to exchange/return is totally ridiculous. I wouldn&#x27;t even waste one cent on this item.</li>
            <li> this really does cut nails straight! easy to use. Makes the nails look better taken care of. Your nails are going to get cut anyways so might as well use this.</li>
            <li> Want to do straight edge cutting like the professionals do at the salon? Buy these! They work great and arrived rather fast</li>
            <li> Came fast and looks like the picture. It s not real sturdy but will do for cosmetology school for now.</li>
            <li> I use this on my natural nails which i grow out... and its great! Gives my nails a nice even cut and much better then the standard &#x27;toe nail&#x27; type clippers. The price is good for what you get, great for at home use, and you aren&#x27;t stuck paying for a pricey, professional nail cutter.</li>
            <li> This took forever to come in the mail and by the time I got it I had no use for it. It was alright but seemed very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I just got this nail clipper in the mail today. It is very well made and performs beautifully. When I was trimming my false nails down to size, the clippers functioned smoothly and did not spit shards of hard plastic everywhere. The best thing, though, was that I got these clippers for well under five dollars, and at Sally Beauty I would be paying over thirty dollars for the same thing.</li>
            <li> When I got it i was worried it would break because of how loose the handles were but it works perfectly!!!!!!!! I love it especially if your  customer wants a little flare in there nails its great!!!!!</li>
            <li> I cut everything with these work great</li>
            <li> MY DAUGHTER IS VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I gave these 5 stars because they are exactly as posted and do the job.  You can&#x27;t beat these for the price either.</li>
            <li> This came quickly and does the job but, first practice on nail tips (blanks) before you apply the tip to your own nail. It took a little practice.</li>
            <li> It was a gift the item is in good conditions and safe.</li>
            <li> These pple are a rip off they charge ur card. An fail to deliver item. They have absolutely zero customer service.</li>
            <li> I use it to do my own cut downs helps me save so much money and works great! ! !</li>
            <li> I love it I use it on my own nails and it&#x27;s a good one. The good think it got here early</li>
            <li> Great product. I was nervous at the price but pleasantly surprised at the quality. You will not regret buying thisthis.</li>
            <li> It feels really cheap (i.e., light weight), but it has worked EXCELLENTLY. I was pleasantly surprised. And, with the price, I&#x27;ve already gotten my money&#x27;s worth in the past month. I would probably order it again if it breaks.</li>
            <li> They are exactly the ones that are used in salons. The grip makes it easier to&lt;br /&gt;use and a firm grip.</li>
            <li> Looked at this same item in a beauty supply shop for $15, then found it here for less then $2. Was well worth the wait of shipping for the huge savings. Works perfectly too.</li>
            <li> brought tis product but haven&#x27;t got a chance to used it because too busy working. will update whenever I can.</li>
            <li> Did Not like it broke after the 3rd time</li>
            <li> Love the clippers, they are solid baby pink in color and they work great. Good fit when I am clipping nails.</li>
            <li> Works great. I use it quite often on false nails and my real nails sometimes. Would totally recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> FALSE ADVERTISING!! I received the clippers today, ordered 23 days ago, and I am VERY DISAPPOINTED.  They are not as represented in the photos, whatsoever: Metal with what looks like vinyl covered grip handles - - Instead, they are all metal and, except for the cutting surface, are painted with an awful shade of pink paint! Ugh! Ugly!  Cheap quality.  I gave them 2 stars because, hopefully, they will cut nails a few times before breaking or becoming otherwise dull and useless.  I&#x27;ve since discovered that Walmart sells Nailene brand for less than $4, and the no-slip grips are vinyl covered.</li>
            <li> Its pretty good for the price</li>
            <li> These work fine I received them earlier then expected delivery date which is a plus the handle is comfortable it is actually red not pink like the pic looks but I didn&#x27;t mind you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> I suppose these clippers would be OK if I ever receive them. I bought them on Sept.2nd and not here yet do to coming from China with a long month and a half waiting period. My nails will really be long by then. So I had to order another pair from Amazon made in The good old USA and already received them. Good for Amazon, BAD FOR CHINA.</li>
            <li> me parece demasiado el tiempo en la demora de este articulo, pues lo pedi para llevarmelo a mi pais porque me lo encargaron y me toca devolverme a mi pais sin el,</li>
            <li> The clippers work good the light wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting I thought I could cure actually gel not the polish amd when I got it there was a light out amd the acrylic was good and my phone case broke with in a week of having it the screen protector is good</li>
            <li> Great clippers, not cheap looking at all. item is all metal with plastic grip covers, and works great.  I use these to cut my natural nail in a square, makes a great straight line and all I have to do is file the corners to round off and my nails are done. this is so much faster than filing down. I am so happy that I purchased this, makes doing my manicures so much faster</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, very smooth cut and very easy to handle with one hand if you are doing your own nails.</li>
            <li> Nicer than I expected.  Comfortable hand grip.  Worked better than what I used from a local supply house.  Very good price</li>
            <li> I love the color of these clippers. I use these on the fake nails for the tips I bought myself. &amp; I can&#x27;t get enough of working with these clippers. I love the pink color too!!! Really goes good with my skin, nails and tips.</li>
            <li> The blade is very dull and it broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> i gave it a 3 because its not too sharp</li>
            <li> I use these all the time! I often do my own acrylic nails, so when I put on the tips (which are very long) this makes it very easy to trim down to size. You do have to hold at a certain angle to get a clean cut, but is so much easier than having to deal with regular nail clippers! Came early and did not stick up at all. My local beauty supply sore was selling these for 15$!! It&#x27;s a great price here</li>
            <li> highly recommended; Received today 12/05/2014</li>
            <li> Came with broken spring, not in any sanitary packaging. Appeared to be used and all scratched up. Owner wanted to know if I was using it right when I contacted them. Also wanted a video of how I use it to see if I just wasn&#x27;t doing it right! I wasn&#x27;t going to waste my time when it was so cheap. Will not be shopping here again.</li>
            <li> Made very poorly. Was not pink the color was red! WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN!</li>
            <li> Was extreme!y cheap, weak and when I clip a nail it act like it wants to fall into pieces and it probably will soon,&lt;br /&gt;Will I shop with this company again ? Probably not</li>
            <li> For being .62 cents, this product is amazing. It works so good. I am very happy for the price too.</li>
            <li> They look different in the pic but they will work for now and shipping takes time too but well tell friend to get them because the r cheap</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t pink. They&#x27;re red. Kill me.</li>
            <li> It is exactlly a nail clipper- works great-service was great.... In a good way, you see exactly what you get and that is what is expected when you online shop&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Best thing I have gotten in a long time! This is really sharp though so be careful when using it!</li>
            <li> Eh. Had to get a refund. The rubber grip was torn.</li>
            <li> Cheep and leaves nails rough and cracked</li>
            <li> It works + good price!</li>
            <li> Best weapon in acrylic nails. Helps to cut down on file time.</li>
            <li> How great is this product!  So much easier to cut nail tips than regular nail clippers.  A real treasure.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller, product exactly as described.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and it makes clipping long nails short fast and easy.</li>
            <li> Good to cut down false nail.</li>
            <li> They really work! I was surprise!  Great salon nails in the comfort of your home.</li>
            <li> They cut great except no matter how much I tried to make a straight cut, it was always crooked,  kinda annoying,  but good product, sturdy, and good price</li>
            <li> they work good but maybe could use to be a little sharper i noticed if i dont clamp down as fast then it bends the nail a tad. but overall good for the price and got here 3 days early</li>
            <li> WOW! These make cutting those acrylic nails sooo much easier. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it! I really do like the one I got.</li>
            <li> They work nicely, but the feel is just thin and light. Thus I wonder how it will last but so far it has worked well.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once and it works great. I will not give it the full 5 stars until I can use it more often.  It is easy to use and comfortable in your hand. 4 stars.</li>
            <li> came faster then i thought and was very good</li>
            <li> looks and kinda cheep but it&#x27;s cute!</li>
            <li> I love these, I noticed they are the same ones used in nail salons. I am gathering all the supplies to learn to do mine and my daughters acrylics.</li>
            <li> Kind of junky quality. However they make a clean cut  and do not crack the nail. Overall a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Works great. I use it quite often on false nails and my real nails sometimes. Would totally recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Waited a long time to recieve but was very impressed with the quality since the cost was so minimal.  I had one before that used to bend my nail more than cut it but this one cut the nail perfectly!</li>
            <li> These were a great buy ... They work great and will much ease. I was happy to find these and at such a great price. Thank you</li>
            <li> Nail Clipper Acrylic Uv GEL False Tips Cutter 46p(Nail Clipper) .... TOOK A LONG TIME TO GETTHE ITEM BUT IT IS OK</li>
            <li> this product is ok quality for price, havent had a chance  to use them yet so not sure really what there like will review again when i have</li>
            <li> Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new.. if it is missing they replace it.</li>
            <li> This is CRAP!!! IT BENT IN LIKE A WEEK... DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> These took FOREVER to come. They came over 6 months later and I had already forgotten about them and didn&#x27;t need them anymore.</li>
            <li> works very well! However you need to be careful because the way you position the clipper you may trim the nail wrong.</li>
            <li> I got this yesterday 9 or more days earlier than expected and I love it! It cuts through the nail tips nicely and you can go slow or fast and its nice! I got mine with red handles with were bright and colorful and it was oiled so it worked really nice right off the bat! I did have to wipe a little bit of the oil off but 5 stars is perfect for this because its a great buy for so little price! Also, if you have long enough nails, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work on natural ones too!</li>
            <li> I ended up buying one locally because I never received it from the seller plus i was tired of waiting. Overall it is a great tool and it helps not to damage the tips.</li>
            <li> Great little clipper.  It took forever (I mean over a month) to arrive, but for the price, I can&#x27;t complain.  Works very well on false nails.  Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> i have yet to use it, but it got here within 3 weeks of ordering it. it looks pretty sturdy so im sure it will do its job</li>
            <li> Does the job, and got here on time so what else is there to say! Im happy with my product.</li>
            <li> Works and is easy to use. Good price for this product. It does not cut straight though. You have to be real careful on keeping it straight.</li>
            <li> These came earlier than I expected and working awesome! I am sure the quality can be a bit better but for the price I could not ask for more!</li>
            <li> I totally loved this. Specially because its pink and does a great job cutting tips. Definitely recommend other people to buy</li>
            <li> very useful item at a very reasonable price. I received this item quickly. I will certainly recommend this site and item to others</li>
            <li> I got a poppy pink cutter. Not what the pictures shows. False advertisement .. Not good . Will not be ordering again</li>
            <li> These are a great pair of acrylic nail clippers. They work, just like they said they would, and the price was not bad either. I would recomment them. Wished they had come in a different color though.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with this, are not difficult. Ideal for beginners. I am thrilled to be working fine with them.</li>
            <li> works good so far only used it twice so far</li>
            <li> They work great! But shipping took like a month that&#x27;s my only complain is the shipping other wise I&#x27;m so happy with them</li>
            <li> I Was  upset with the time it took to arrive but after i used it it was worth the time it took to be delivered. its perfect an it cuts your nails perfect its as decribed. i may order a extra one to have on hand.</li>
            <li> Hal clipper acrylic is the BEST!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am surprised that these are actually good quality clippers. Amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> Cuts evenly and smoothly! I didn&#x27;t think it would be good quality because of the price. It&#x27;s better than the one I bought from Sally&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> This product was everything I was expecting also it was delivered 3 weeks before the actual delivery date</li>
            <li> The clippers are very light and manageable. Love the pink handles. They are sturdy and there is no hesitation when clipping the tip. Which means the blades in clipper are sharp. Would like a spare pair to have laying around. The price was appropriate for the item! Great clippers!</li>
            <li> for the price they work wonderful</li>
            <li> These cutters work well!</li>
            <li> I really do enjoy this because they are so much easier to use on tips rather than having to cut from side to side. Great quality for a great price, if you were to buy these in stores they would be so much more money</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and packaging was excellent. Item was exactly what was described and has worked very well for the price that was paid. Great for a new nail enthusiast.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite cases.. I bought a couple so that I can switch the colors up. It took a little while to come but it was worth the wait.... ordering more soon!</li>
            <li> At first, I was unsure about the quality because of the price. Now that I have it and have used it... it is wonderful for the price and worth it. Thank you!!! The ones at the store are very pricey...</li>
            <li> Great for cuttin nails but you need to be a professional in order to use it.  Took about a month to arrive but i didn&#x27;t mind I wasn&#x27;t needing it asap. I would definitely reccomend This item of you know how to use it</li>
            <li> I bought these for at home use when I do my acrylics and it works perfectly. it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> The nail clipper was cricket</li>
            <li> Wonderfully sharp and smooth cutting... great price too!</li>
            <li> I love my acrylic false tips cutter and i also love the little purple pouch it arrived in it was safely and carefully packaged and i love it i will be ordering from you in the near future.</li>
            <li> they make doing your nails so much easier. they slice throug the false nails like butter. The cost was well worth the purchas. I woudl definatly recomend this item</li>
            <li> This item is okay, you get what you pay for! Looks very cheap but hey It&#x27;ll do the job. The item I received was all silver and not with the pink handles.</li>
            <li> These clippers work great when it comes to cutting artificial nails.  They can cut a straight edge or oval, they can also turn full cover acrylics into tips.  Highly recommend for anyone who likes to do their own nails.</li>
            <li> This works very well even on the thickest of  acrylic.  It does feel flimsy but dont be fooled.  The only thing reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because it took awhile to get here.</li>
            <li> This item works very well. And it arrived about the time expected but it was a few days early. I use this product once every 2 Weeks.</li>
            <li> The reason I like it is because of the price.  As little as I use it, I don&#x27;t want to spend big bucks.  It is pretty flimsy.  This is the second one I bought as the other one broke.</li>
            <li> Arrived quicker than anticipated and works great no complaints.</li>
            <li> I figured these would be cheap and break but they cut without any effort. They feel a little cheap when you get them but they work great</li>
            <li> The clippers did not cut the nails.Plus, the blade came out. They also came 2 months after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Product broke after 1st time using it.</li>
            <li> It cuts ok I guess.  I actually ordered this in pink but I received an ugly red shade clipper, NOT what I wanted.  I do nails and everything I own is pink and purple so this does not match everything else I have.  Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use!  Nail tips are generally much too long for me so this is perfect for trimming.  Regular nail clippers tend to bend the nail; this does not!  If you do your own nail tips this is a must!</li>
            <li> Its nice and sharp and works well. And it really makes it a lot easier to keep the nails shaped because they sort if pre shape the nail</li>
            <li> Cheap price but took almost a month to get.</li>
            <li> I really love this. ..</li>
            <li> Waited awhile to do this review to give it time to see if it would break and guess what IT DIDNT BREAK. It truly does the job cutting my nails and artificial nails as well. It cuts it even and with one click it does it perfectly. The handle was made perfect for someone like me with arthritis I coukd grip it and it did not slip one bit. I think I found the one and saved a lot of money doing it.</li>
            <li> Cut nail tips great.  Long lasting blade</li>
            <li> They broke after a month.</li>
            <li> Horrible broke the first day I used them,</li>
            <li> Top quality, great price. So glad I finally bought one at the great price.</li>
            <li> These work wonderful!! Great value for the price!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Use with acrylics; also an excellent price.  In order to apply tips, it&#x27;s absolutely necessary to have these.  Definitely recomend.</li>
            <li> It does what is says. Have not had a problem. The only reason I gave a 4 instead of a 5 is because in the picture it shows a pink handle and the one I received is a ugly burnt orange color... Other than that I would TOTALLY recommend!</li>
            <li> I received today;earlier than the expected ETA; works great! :)</li>
            <li> This is an awesome tool for clipping  false nails.</li>
            <li> Shipping was on time.. The clipper are  okay.&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for.. Over all only get it if you need for 3 time use!</li>
            <li> I use this all the time when i have to cut nails i havent had any problems with this i like it</li>
            <li> This nail clipper cuts great! No struggle what to ever, its light, sharp, and cuts my artificial nail tips with no problem. You can&#x27;t even feel pressure when it slices the nail</li>
            <li> This product is great. It shipped really fast and was actually better than I expected it to be. I would recommend again to others. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, precise, good quality. It was so easy to use and it arrived fairly fast. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and I would recommend. Great for someone who&#x27;s just learning to make their own nails....which is my case.</li>
            <li> They work just great. I am so glad that I ordered them as they make it so easy to trim nails to desired length.</li>
            <li> It did cut my natural nail and my acrylic nails also . I will recommend this to any one .</li>
            <li> When I bought this item it was only $0.51 + free shipping I was a little skeptical of the price but I like risks and bought it. Boy do I love these!!! They cut quick and easy and you have to only file them a little bit :) They are the best for real and acrylic nails!! Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed nail tech so these are always handy to have around. These in particular come with a red handle, and they&#x27;re smaller than those you get at your local beauty supply, seemingly thinner metal too. but they&#x27;ll do the job in a pinch. 3 stars because fo the cheap metal and I&#x27;m not sure how long they&#x27;ll last in the long run. but for like a buck, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I am a beginner at nail art, and this is one of my first tools to build my kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will see this posted many times.  I will put items to use as I gather them all together, from sellers I trust!</li>
            <li> Great my wife loves it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally inexpensive for the value you obtain for it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a very smart purchase, I hope we can do business in future</li>
            <li> great product I love it.  makes clipping false tips easier and faster. I recommend these clippers to any professional nail tech. cant beat the price</li>
            <li> Came before estimated delivery and the product is very light weight. It still works fine, very sharp and mine is just as described on picture. Worth the money i recommend if your trying to save some money.</li>
            <li> because it doesn&#x27;t really work like a shop works</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for--it works every bit as well as it claims, but it rattles a bit and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d be happier with a quality nail tip cutter for decades if I could justify the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems in the past with these type of nail clippers not clipping all the way through the nails, but I am actually able to even clip the acrylic nail after it has been finished with these! I am a very happy customer.</li>
            <li> It works really great ! I tried it with my real nails cuz they were sorta long and it totally word</li>
            <li> these work ok I am not sure if I got a bad pair or not because after a couple of uses the blade slanted and wouldn&#x27;t cut any longer I am getting another pair to try same brand I will find out if mine was defected or not</li>
            <li> I bought this for, like, $.65 and it was totally worth it. I&#x27;ve done a few sets of nails and clipped off my own acrylics with it and it works great - especially for the price!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend needed this because she just got her nail tech license, and she says they work great.  They cut the nail tips easily but without the bulk of bigger clippers.</li>
            <li> Works great great great great!!! you can get the perfect acrylic nails. My acrylic tips are even and perfect. I would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> Produto chegou em prazo e igual a descriÃ§Ã£o, nÃ£o utilizei mas pelo que analisei o produto Ã© bom, recomendo o produto e o vendedor.</li>
            <li> Does what its supposed to what more could you ask?</li>
            <li> Broke in one week. Pieces started snapping off.</li>
            <li> Well, these are not industrial cutters...&lt;br /&gt;for a buck-fifty, they are just fine.&lt;br /&gt;I would recomend for the low price.</li>
            <li> This nail clipper cuts my acrylics to the perfect length and doesn&#x27;t strain on my nail like regular nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Works great on acrylic tips!&lt;br /&gt;In the picture I thought it was a light shade of red.&lt;br /&gt;When I got mine, it&#x27;s a cute light baby pink color!</li>
            <li> These clippers are great.  They do a really great job.  I do my own acrylic nails at home and these trim the tips perfectly.</li>
            <li> awesome! i love it it cuts really good.. i would totally purchase from here again. and i love the color!</li>
            <li> i got these to clip fakies...and they work great...makes it easier to shape nails and get them the perfect length.</li>
            <li> Crappy nail clippers not even close to what is pictured when u order. Never again.</li>
            <li> I received the tip cutter sooner then expected. The pink handles on it are very cheaply done, its just the metal that they dipped in rubber, and its layered on very thin... it&#x27;ll probably peel off soon. But in all honesty what did I expected? The item wad very inexpensive. It does its job, no problems. Im extremely pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price.  It works well, easy to use, my daughter and I both use this and works well.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me. When it arrived at my house it was broken.</li>
            <li> So cheap the screw feel off of it and now it never cuts right save your time and money and buy something better quality</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly, and packaged well.  Mine do not have the pink grips on the handle as pictured, but they do seem to work well.</li>
            <li> It is a tiny bit cheap (but so is the price!) but one cannot beat it for chopping off acrylic talons in a pinch.</li>
            <li> not what i ordered!!!!!!! Come on... Dumb PPL. waited three weeks for something i didn&#x27;t order. i received a nail clipper but it was cheap. plastic. not what the picture looks like.</li>
            <li> I like this product o trim my false nails because it does not crack them, chip them, or ruin the nail polish. I actually love the fact that it also cuts smooth and I can go longer bu a week to have my nails done. Yeah!</li>
            <li> I ordered a big pack of plastic nails and it cuts through them very easily and lines up nicely with the shape of artificial nails.</li>
            <li> These clippers work great and are wide enough that they can clip duck tips, too (the ones that have a wide tip) and I really like that. They are great quality and don&#x27;t jam. They also haven&#x27;t lost their &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; an they are comfortable to hold. Unfortunately, the shipping took very long, almost 2 months. I had forgot I ordered them since it had been so long so when they came in the mail it was like a surprise to myself! They really are a great product, I just wish shipping wouldn&#x27;t have taken so long</li>
            <li> I use this for my natural nails and when I get acrylic nails. Comes with instructions on which direction to use for which cut you would like. Nice and light-weight, may seem flimsy, but they do a great job!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. Really stainless. Very well priced and came in early in the post.</li>
            <li> Very nice worth the buy</li>
            <li> This thing broke within four months of having it. When I tried cutting my nails, the hinge was off and wouldn&#x27;t clamp down in order to cut the nail. So, I tried fixing it by unscrewing it and readjusting the hinge. When I did this, the whole thing fell apart and I was not able to put it back together.</li>
            <li> Havent used them yet, but can tell I will have control and they cut sharp and straight. The rubber helps you cut better.</li>
            <li> This item is so cool and the best thing about it is that it came in my favorite color pink. It&#x27;s of very good quality and it arrived sooner than expected. Definitely recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy I bought this nail clipper.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really budget friendly and it&#x27;s a quality clipper I&#x27;m very happy with this clipper</li>
            <li> I just got a nail kit and needed good clippers. I have been practicing acrylic nails and these have worked great!</li>
            <li> but it came in good condition&lt;br /&gt; what is the blue bracelet for ??&lt;br /&gt;well thank you very much ill keep shopping</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, ITS SO EASY TO USE CUTS AWESOME AND BREAKS DOWN THE FILING TIME EVERYONE SHOULD TRY</li>
            <li> This is okay, its very flimpsy and you can tell it wasn&#x27;t made very well, the blade has no cover over it so you really have to watch what your doing so you dont cut someones finger off, just a heads up!</li>
            <li> This cheap ish broke the min I got it it is a piece of garbage nd I do not recommend u to get it I didn&#x27;t expect it to wrk good any way</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like the picture.  It&#x27;s all pink and looks cheap. Won&#x27;t buy again and won&#x27;t take this post down.</li>
            <li> Good does just what I needed</li>
            <li> Love them. They work great. I was a little surprised when two arrived in the mail rather than one, but that&#x27;s no problem. Great product.</li>
            <li> These clippers leave a smooth, clean cut. Don&#x27;t worry; the shape of the nail will not be as curved as the clippers. They provide a perfect slight curve to the nail.</li>
            <li> Thet are okey, for me, they do the same thing as regular nail clippers. But they havent broke yet and feel sturdy enough to hold up for a while.</li>
            <li> These nail clippers work very well. I love cutting my fake nails with them now! Soo much better than regular nail clippers!!</li>
            <li> It does what it is needed to. It cuts down acrylic nails with ease. Once again very sturdy, would recommend</li>
            <li> I got the nial cutters earlier than expected I always buy these from this distributer I get more than my moneys worth my last pair lasted 5 years</li>
            <li> Great for cutting false nails. I use it a lot and it is cutting nails sharply leaving no &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; edges on nails. Nice color too :)</li>
            <li> shipping take forever not recommended</li>
            <li> With this little guy it helps to make my manicure look like I had it done professionally. People complement my nails all the time.</li>
            <li> They work like they are supposed too and I love it. Very sturdy product for the price no complaints here.</li>
            <li> this item works good when trying to remove an old full set. works just as good as what they use in the nail shop</li>
            <li> The clipper is smooth when cutting artificial nails. Looked cheap but does the job well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping / Great item! Very happy!</li>
            <li> great for cutting acrilic nails i wouldnt know if you could use it for natural nails and good condition</li>
            <li> It gets the job done and is decent for the price. Mine arrived in an open package but I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a metal item that was shipped internationally.</li>
            <li> I hate these because they don&#x27;t even cut the name it just ben&#x27;s it n it makes it look ugly</li>
            <li> So basically, I needed an acrylic nail clipper and this one does the job... It was really cheap, but works really good. The downside and the reason I am giving this product only 4 stars is the cost of shipping- it&#x27;s more than the clipper itself. I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the shipping price, which I should have- so just a heads-up!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li> this product was great! it was in its package and it was brand new!i really recommend you to buy it! THANK YOU VERY MUCH!! :D</li>
            <li> I have yet to try them I just received them not even 5 minutes ago, so I&#x27;ll have to wait and see, they are how they were described I can&#x27;t wait to use them.&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m thankful that they came sooner than the estimated dates which were between July 9th and July 27th that would of been so long to wait.&lt;br /&gt;Again thank you.</li>
            <li> Broke as soon as I opened the package, never got to use them.</li>
            <li> I like the item the handle felt kinda cheap but it hasn&#x27;t broke n that&#x27;s wat I like about it will be buying other items from this seller</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend getting this product it&#x27;s a waste of money .. Immediately you can tell its cheap ... You have to put a lot of force to cut right and it also cuts uneven I don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> These were great they lasted me for about a year now and they cut perfect every time</li>
            <li> This acrylic nail clipper does exactly what its supposed to do. it clipps through the products without a problem. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> These clippers are good they have a square cut which is what I wanted. List one star because they are not gel type</li>
            <li> Love these helps with trimming long nail tips, I actually cut the tip in half and use both pieces</li>
            <li> Fast shipping from China - it&#x27;s what I expected - Thank you.</li>
            <li> ðŸ˜€It&#x27;s is a good tool for fake nails.ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> I gave this four stars because in the picture the handle looks pink, but when I received this, it was red. Besides that though, I love this nail clipper. I do my own acrylic nails at home and this cuts my tips SO EASILY and make a very nice sharp, clean cut. I haven&#x27;t used it on my natural nails but I assume it does a great job at that as well. I really do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This clipper is easy to use, smooth and cut with ease. I didn&#x27;t have to push down really hard like with other brands. I recommend this clipper to everyone!</li>
            <li> Very good!!! Thank you</li>
            <li> Handy nail cutter.  Glad I got it.  It arrived quickly and as advertised.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Everything you need for nail tips - cuts great!</li>
            <li> Does the job but is getting loose after only 2 uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for about a year and are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever owned and used!!! Love them!!</li>
            <li> Essesntial, to cut acrylic or artificial  nails</li>
            <li> Works great. Sharp enough to trim acrylic nails as well.</li>
            <li> The perfect tool for the job!</li>
            <li> So far it is pretty sturdy and it has not broken. It is precise in cutting half nails and it is a little smaller than other Nail clippers that I have used, but its not a problem. I got the same color as the picture, pink and make sure to cut the nail with the blade facing away from nail and skin.</li>
            <li> It is not at all useful for me. i was hesitant when i ordering this and I am totally disappointed with first usage.</li>
            <li> These acrylic nail clippers work amazing!</li>
            <li> Love these! Do my own acrylics at home, these are definite help!! Shipping was fast; came a few weeks early actually!!</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with this nail clipper. Wasn&#x27;t sure it would work this well because of it being so cheap. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Cheap and broke easily but hey you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Nice product,fast shipping!!!Thanks))</li>
            <li> Shipped fast; clippers work well with fake nails.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to buy the cutter, it is so convenient and easy to use as well as high performance of quality/cost. And it is also pretty out of my imagination.</li>
            <li> I loved these at first, but after about 5 uses, they broke on me.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just got a bad pair? I dunno but I didn&#x27;t like them all that much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright at cutting nail tips but when you clamp down on the handle, it doesn&#x27;t move smoothly. You can feel something grinding against another part, it makes it feel cheap. I ended up buying a better quality one at Sally Beauty for $12 and I threw this one away.</li>
            <li> Sucked -.- couldn&#x27;t cut anything and it looks like a toy I guess I got what I paid for</li>
            <li> Strong and sturdy. Could be a little sharper.</li>
            <li> This took a LONG time to arrive,  but when it finally did,  it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. It seems a bit on the cheap side,  but as long as it works and doesn&#x27;t break,  I&#x27;m fine with it.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am too old to adapt to innovation (My cell phone only makes and receives calls and I am totally content with that) but I tossed this novel item.  It must not be made to work on ordinary finger nails and I am a guy so that is what I have, thus in all fairness perhaps I should have paid more attention to the descriptive words in Amazon&#x27;s presentation.</li>
            <li> Cheap and cuts really well. In the store this is $17.00. Glad I ordered this.</li>
            <li> broke immediately  very cheap  junk</li>
            <li> They send the product before april 19th i was very pleased about that the clippers work good i like the grip that is on the clippers verses the metel 5 stars for service very please will buy more products from them if needed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to cut the nail and your hand has a nice comfort on the handle its just like the picture</li>
            <li> I love these so much! They are so strong and durable and for such an amazing price!</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I was looking for.....sturdy construction....would recommend.</li>
            <li> On time it came but when I recieved it I was surprised at how flimsy it looked lol but after using it works real good that I love it so much.</li>
            <li> I received ,h clippers in the mail and pulled out a red pair, even tho it says pink. On well, still works and gets the job done correctly. Veery fast shipping. I wasn&#x27;t suppose to have them for another  week and a 1/2,</li>
            <li> Been wanting one for years, but they are too expensive in the nail supply stores. Excellent price and I did not have to wait that long for delivery..</li>
            <li> Trims nails in a heart beat. I like short fake nails and this trims any length you need. Trims to square if that&#x27;s what you like or just a quick file and they are rounded.</li>
            <li> What arrived was not the same as the picture, it was all pink. However, it does do the job and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I love these.  The blade cuts the acrylic nail so smoothly! I dont have to use any muscle to use these they are just so easy to use. C:</li>
            <li> they work great, with a clean cut, however you do need to file the nail afterwords. but its okay, lol (:</li>
