            <li>This works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love this!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Take the guide off and you have a perfectly even design without having to accidentally get the stamp on areas you didn&#x27;t want it to begin with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course Konad puts the best of nail art stamping image products out there on the market.</li>
            <li>Lol</li>
            <li>Truthfully, I haven&#x27;t tried this plate yet, but I am VERY impressed with the quality of the images from Konad.  </li>
            <li>Will make very interesting manicures!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>more metal!)</li>
            <li>I love the way this plate is made just for the fingertips!</li>
            <li>but I really liked it.</li>
            <li>and I liked the designs of these plate</li>
            <li>I loved it, it is so easy to use</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite Konad plates.  </li>
            <li>, though... works a lot better for me and doesn&#x27;t scratch up the metal with...</li>
            <li>Also, be sure to pick up some Konad Stamping</li>
            <li>I love this nail art stamp image plate.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i&#x27;ve gotten so many  compilments on my nails.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite nail design item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying decorating and saving on my nails.</li>
            <li>But with the \\&quot;Tips\\&quot; plate, it seems best to use \\&quot;their\\&quot; polish because regular polish didn&#x27;t cut it, at.all.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Love, love this product it worth buying, and now I can save a lot of money and get my nails done at home. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Konads are the original, and better than the knock off brands by a mile.  </li>
            <li>like any other konad plate, practice makes perfect!!!!</li>
            <li>but once you get it it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>is easy with a cotton swab saturated in acetone (don&#x27;t use oiled nail polish, you need the image to come off the stamper cleanly) when you&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and to store.</li>
            <li>Clean up</li>
            <li>The designs are very pretty though.</li>
            <li>Very pretty designs.</li>
            <li>These designs are super fun.</li>
            <li>this product and will definitely purchase more of these plates!</li>
            <li>Obviously, works better with deeper-toned polishes, but try it with a metallic to get a cool effect too!</li>
            <li>Always a clean and consistent stamping image</li>
            <li>Very deep image, very easily transferred when used with special polish.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>(which is my right).  </li>
            <li>images are clear and easy to use, I just make sure to use a old plastic gift card to scrape the nail polish so as not to strach the plate.</li>
            <li>looked great, gave different look to nails, easy to use, dries fast, takes a little practice to get it right</li>
            <li>Would rate higher  if it worked with all nail polish.</li>
            <li>interested in stamping plates for the first time</li>
            <li>I love french manicures so this plate has the cutest designs just for that,&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>, it makes my nails look pretty.</li>
            <li>The downside is they are all one size and doesn&#x27;t fit super well on the pinky, you need to also practice to get these looking even on your opposite working hand</li>
            <li>Cool one&#x27;s for nail tips only.</li>
            <li>I do NOT suggest this particular plate.</li>
            <li>But it is worth spending extra money to buy the Konad brand.</li>
            <li>I love the stars and strips image and how you can actually use both red and blue over a previously painted white french tip and it makes an awesome flat for Independence</li>
            <li>Little messy and takes some practice, but looks great once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>I can ALWAYS get a clean sharp image each and every time with the Konad plates.  </li>
            <li>NOT easy to use, concept is easy, but I have followed instructions</li>
            <li>This plate is much easier to do because of the bigger design.  </li>
            <li>(I just use an old credit card instead</li>
            <li>BUT you really need to buy the polish that they recommend because regular polish doesn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
            <li>Try a general design before french designs.</li>

            <li> This works perfectly. I have this in a generic brand and it did not work at all! I was nervous to spend the money on this one. But it is worth spending extra money to buy the Konad brand. I will never buy generic again! I love this!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This plate is much easier to do because of the bigger design.  Would rate higher  if it worked with all nail polish.</li>
            <li> NOT easy to use, concept is easy, but I have followed instructions, they don&#x27;t show up on the nails</li>
            <li> Little messy and takes some practice, but looks great once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite Konad plates.  The downside is they are all one size and doesn&#x27;t fit super well on the pinky, you need to also practice to get these looking even on your opposite working hand (which is my right).  These designs are super fun.</li>
            <li> with this Image Plate from Konad I am like a kid in a candy store!  Love, love this product it worth buying, and now I can save a lot of money and get my nails done at home. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learnig how to use it but I really liked it. It requires a lot of practice but once you get it it&#x27;s easy. I contact the seller becouse I didn&#x27;t received my package but they sent me another one. I recommend the seller and the product!!!</li>
            <li> looked great, gave different look to nails, easy to use, dries fast, takes a little practice to get it right</li>
            <li> Konads are the original, and better than the knock off brands by a mile.  Clean up is easy with a cotton swab saturated in acetone (don&#x27;t use oiled nail polish, you need the image to come off the stamper cleanly) when you&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried to stamp these designs but have had no luck.  They don&#x27;t come out even and it&#x27;s really disappointing because they are so nice looking.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to nail art so I HAD to get this. You have to buy the stamper and scraper separately (I just use an old credit card instead, though... works a lot better for me and doesn&#x27;t scratch up the metal with... well... more metal!) if you don&#x27;t already have it. I love the stars and strips image and how you can actually use both red and blue over a previously painted white french tip and it makes an awesome flat for Independence day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that you use either tape or french manicure guides (bought at CVS, Target, Walmart, Sally&#x27;s, etc) to block off the area of your nail you do NOT want the tip design to be at and polish the free edge of your nail whatever you want the base color to be. Then LEAVE THE TAPE/GUIDE ON and stamp over it once the polish is dry. Take the guide off and you have a perfectly even design without having to accidentally get the stamp on areas you didn&#x27;t want it to begin with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product and will definitely purchase more of these plates!</li>
            <li> Cool one&#x27;s for nail tips only.</li>
            <li> If you know stamping plates you know Konad is the go to company for quality laser cut plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If interested in stamping plates for the first time I do NOT suggest this particular plate. Try a general design before french designs. Also, be sure to pick up some Konad Stamping Polish!&lt;br /&gt;This of course is no different. The french designs take practice, but can be done well once you spend hours trying them. Not for the impatient.</li>
            <li> I love the way this plate is made just for the fingertips! Will make very interesting manicures!&lt;br /&gt;Just like any other konad plate, practice makes perfect!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this nail art stamp image plate. Of course Konad puts the best of nail art stamping image products out there on the market. Always a clean and consistent stamping image</li>
            <li> images are clear and easy to use, I just make sure to use a old plastic gift card to scrape the nail polish so as not to strach the plate.</li>
            <li> It did it&#x27;s job ! Arrived on time.  Works like a charm each and every time it is put to use.</li>
            <li> I love french manicures so this plate has the cutest designs just for that,&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve gotten so many  compilments on my nails.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite nail design item. Doesn&#x27;t work well for me. I should have sent them back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying decorating and saving on my nails. I recommend Konad Stamping Art Image Plates to you and my friends..</li>
            <li> Pretty cool once you get the hang of it. But with the \\&quot;Tips\\&quot; plate, it seems best to use \\&quot;their\\&quot; polish because regular polish didn&#x27;t cut it, at.all. Lol</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this worked too well on short nails.  The designs are very pretty though.</li>
            <li> Very deep image, very easily transferred when used with special polish. Very pretty designs. Easy to clean and to store. Just as shown</li>
            <li> Works very well! Obviously, works better with deeper-toned polishes, but try it with a metallic to get a cool effect too!</li>
            <li> Truthfully, I haven&#x27;t tried this plate yet, but I am VERY impressed with the quality of the images from Konad.  I can ALWAYS get a clean sharp image each and every time with the Konad plates.  I have one Bundle Monster set and sometimes it&#x27;s a hit or miss.  I wish I could have some of the images from Bundle Monster on Konad plates!  I would higly recommend this plate to anyone considering it.</li>
            <li> For the price okay BUT you really need to buy the polish that they recommend because regular polish doesn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
            <li> doesnt transfer print</li>
            <li> I loved it, it is so easy to use and I liked the designs of these plate, it makes my nails look pretty.</li>
