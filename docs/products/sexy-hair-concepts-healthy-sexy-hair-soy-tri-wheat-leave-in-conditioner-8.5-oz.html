            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The seller delivered the item very quickly and I am so pleased.  </li>
            <li>This is another one of those products that kind of only gives the ILLUSION that it&#x27;s good for your hair, because it contains &amp;#34;cones&amp;#34; -- as in the case here, Amodimethicone, which is the #2 ingredient for this product (water is #1).</li>
            <li>Love this product...makes hair super smooth and helps aid in smoothing when blowdrying.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite must have beauty products so glad to find the large refill size</li>
            <li>My hair is so much better, worth the price.</li>
            <li>Helps keep their hair moist and tangle free.</li>
            <li>It makes my daughters hair smell good and feels soft</li>
            <li>Love it - my hair can&#x27;t live without it :)</li>
            <li>My mom tried mine and fell in love with it, so I got her some too ;)</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so much more manageable when used consistently.</li>
            <li>No residue buildup, and it works great in the winter to help control the dry frizz!</li>
            <li>It is tried, tested, and true.</li>
            <li>One of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve used on my course, thick curly hair</li>
            <li>I have used much more expensive leave-in conditioners, but this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and would note be able to function without it daily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good for making your hair soft and shiny, but man they need to put it in a spray bottle because when I first tried getting some out, it spilled all over my hand.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and cannot live without it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more economical than buying a new spray bottle each time.</li>
            <li>I was able to salvage some of the bottle and am hopeful it will at least be a good product-</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the feel , not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, fly away hair.  </li>
            <li>we liked this item but it is very runny not a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair soft, bouncy and healthy if used in small quantities and smells good.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Expensive but awesome</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this Leave in conditioner by my stylist.  </li>
            <li>After the first use I knew I would not trade it in for the world.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I thought this was the regular conditioner, but it&#x27;s okay because it still helps your hair get soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I think most Big Sexy products have a similar scent.</li>
            <li>first time ever using it.</li>
            <li>Imagine how pleased I was to find this HUGE bottle for just a few dollars more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it extra because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my super fine hair down, and it doesn&#x27;t make it look greasy or oily either.</li>
            <li>I know I owe this in large part to this conditioner the</li>
            <li>Your hair is always dry, usually frizzy, and full of fly aways.</li>
            <li>Good leave in, light weight, doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or weird</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to go again.</li>
            <li>Wife and daughters really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>I found this product to really do the job it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li>This product on Amazon seems to be the real deal.  </li>
            <li>It is much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li>What saved it from leaking too much was the bottle had a tightly-wrapped plastic around it.</li>
            <li>I have simply refilled my original bottle, and</li>
            <li>I also use it on my kids who have fine easily knotted hair to corse thick hair.</li>
            <li>So yes, it does make my hair shiny and soft and easy to comb through, but at the same time, it&#x27;s also coating my hair with Amodimethicone, which builds up over time and can really cause a lot of damage to hair.</li>
            <li>It only takes 4-5 sprays to condition my hair adequately.  </li>
            <li>Amazon Prime made it an even better buy compared to my regular local retailer.</li>
            <li>Leave in conditioner is a must when you live in the desert.</li>
            <li>I like to spray over my hair after I flat iron my hair and makes my hair super soft</li>
            <li>When my local salon couldn&#x27;t find this product for me, I was fortunate enough to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>A few sprays with this leave in conditiner and the comb glides through easily.  </li>
            <li>and it leaves your hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s no reason to continue buying the 8-12oz bottles I was getting before now that Amazon offers this option.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the thicker leave-in conditioners and they didn&#x27;t condition nearly as well as this product.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I use it as a finishing spray when I wear my hair curly (natural).</li>
            <li>when it&#x27;s actually just smoke and mirrors because they can really cause a lot of damage to your hair with continued use.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be afraid of the watery consistency - this product is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I use it after the shower, and it detangles and softens my hair like no other.</li>
            <li>product is exactly the same thing that I&#x27;d been using, minus the spray bottle.  </li>
            <li>This is a big bottle and you really do not use much after each shampoo.</li>
            <li>but....the bottle was expensive and came opened with a plastic bag around the top of the leaking cap (apparently they knew when it shipped that it was leaking).  </li>
            <li>I love the product this however came to my home opened &amp; seriously watered down</li>

            <li> product is exactly the same thing that I&#x27;d been using, minus the spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> This is a big bottle and you really do not use much after each shampoo.</li>
            <li> but....the bottle was expensive and came opened with a plastic bag around the top of the leaking cap (apparently they knew when it shipped that it was leaking).  </li>
            <li> I love the product this however came to my home opened &amp; seriously watered down</li>
            <li> Have used it for several years and always buy the big 32oz refill bottle because it&#x27;s cheaper in the long run.</li>
            <li> This acts as both a detangler and leave-in conditioner without leaving my hair flat and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> Left over once it dry</li>
            <li> I received this today with several other products, only problem that I have run into is very similar to what several other people have- half the bottle had leaked out and was literally pouring out of the box when I picked it up.</li>
            <li> I color my hair every 4 - 5 weeks, which leaves my hair extremely dry, brittle and damaged.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is dry, it doesn&#x27;t need man-made silicones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past year and it leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> but the packaging is useless and don&#x27;t expect to get a full bottle.</li>
            <li> And no cream rinse acne down my back.</li>
            <li> , just provides a little extra moisture when I need it.</li>
            <li> Wish the smell was a little different</li>
            <li> My kids are mixed half black half white...</li>
            <li> So after reading the other reviews and after a recommendation from my stylist I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> The product had gotten onto and into other products and damaged them.</li>
            <li> However, when I received it, the cap was slightly loose, so it did leak a little.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist, who used to comment that my hair was unusually dry and unhealthy started to notice a healthier change in my hair after I started using this product regularly.  </li>
            <li> I spray it on after towel drying my hair and it softens and detangles my hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not easy to comb when it is wet.  </li>
            <li> Alot of money for a product that sits there messy and unused.  </li>
            <li> saying it is bad, but for my hair-type and what I was hoping for....  it most certainly was not good :(</li>
            <li> My split ends appear to be a thing of the past</li>
            <li> I also like that I can put it in a small spray bottle and bring it on the airplane.  </li>
            <li> work just as well (if not better) and yet will not cause damage in the long-term like all these &#x27;cone-based products do.</li>
            <li> I was just a bit disappointed when I received the package and upon opening it realized that one of the 32oz bottles had an open lid and almost half of the product was spilled inside the box.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so tired of all these &#x27;cone-based products that claim to make your hair healthier,</li>
            <li> was I wrong, this was a liquid.  </li>
            <li> is your salon&#x27;s secret!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I received the conditioner and not the leave in conditioner spray refill. Will be sending back.</li>
            <li> I would like to say I like this because the product seems good...but....the bottle was expensive and came opened with a plastic bag around the top of the leaking cap (apparently they knew when it shipped that it was leaking).  I wrote immediately about packaging and the leaking product but NEVER heard from anyone.  Alot of money for a product that sits there messy and unused.  Never happened before on Amazon.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and cannot live without it.  I color my hair every 4 - 5 weeks, which leaves my hair extremely dry, brittle and damaged.  Without Sexy Hair Soy Tri-Wheat Leave in Conditioner, my hair would probably stay that way, or grow even more damaged, but it doesn&#x27;t.  I started using it when my hair stylist recommended it to me about five years ago, and I have never stopped using it.  My hair stylist, who used to comment that my hair was unusually dry and unhealthy started to notice a healthier change in my hair after I started using this product regularly.  I cannot stop raving about this product.  It is tried, tested, and true.</li>
            <li> I love this tuff. It&#x27;s smells amazing and it leaves your hair soft and silky. I also use it on my kids who have fine easily knotted hair to corse thick hair.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Perfect detangled, light and moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some years.  No flakes or white residue.  Left over once it dry</li>
            <li> When my local salon couldn&#x27;t find this product for me, I was fortunate enough to find it on Amazon.  The seller delivered the item very quickly and I am so pleased.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Switched to this hair care line about a year ago &amp; have no complaints.  My hair is so much better, worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really great taking out tangles!</li>
            <li> I use the entire product line - I love how this stuff makes my hair shine.  My split ends appear to be a thing of the past and I bleach!</li>
            <li> I use this as a refill for my spray bottle, love it!</li>
            <li> Leave in conditioner is a must when you live in the desert. Your hair is always dry, usually frizzy, and full of fly aways. This stuff is like magic in a bottle. I use it after the shower, and it detangles and softens my hair like no other. It smells great, and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. I love it extra because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my super fine hair down, and it doesn&#x27;t make it look greasy or oily either. This bottle is a wonderful value- this line of products can be pricey!</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found this on-line for such a great price!  I have been using this product for some time now, but had been purchasing it through my hair stylist.  The last time I bought it, I paid $17 for 8 ounces.  Imagine how pleased I was to find this HUGE bottle for just a few dollars more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is exactly the same thing that I&#x27;d been using, minus the spray bottle.  I have simply refilled my original bottle, and Voilá!  I&#x27;m ready to go again.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It is a bargain to buy this and refill my spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Great hair product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff every day for years. It&#x27;s really great stuff. My mom tried mine and fell in love with it, so I got her some too ;)</li>
            <li> Love it - my hair can&#x27;t live without it :)</li>
            <li> Great product, good price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! I like to spray over my hair after I flat iron my hair and makes my hair super soft</li>
            <li> Works great, this was recommended by my hair stylist.</li>
            <li> Wife and daughters really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> we liked this item but it is very runny not a deep conditioner. it is more a liquid leave in conditioner. it does a great job !!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to refil my smaller size bottle that I just finished up. This was the best value I could find for the amout of leave in conditioner you get! I absolutely love this, it smells great, and leaves my hair tangle free and feeling healthy!</li>
            <li> Gotta love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Just as ordered!</li>
            <li> I found this product to really do the job it was supposed to do. Love it and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this leave in conditioner-it de tangles my hair so easily!</li>
            <li> This spray conditioner has totally revitalized my hair and helped to fend off split ends.  By far the best leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s lightweight and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> We use this one all of our girls hair! Helps keep their hair moist and tangle free.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. I have used many products trying to get the results that this produces!&lt;br /&gt;My hair has never been healthier. I would definitely recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;This is your salon&#x27;s secret!!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so much more manageable when used consistently. Haven&#x27;t found anything else that can take it&#x27;s place.</li>
            <li> Love this product...makes hair super smooth and helps aid in smoothing when blowdrying.  I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Expensive but awesome I have VERY Cury hair and this is WAY better than Infusium and works amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner, and this is a great price for the 33.8oz bottle. You will need your own spray bottle (this is just a refill) but there&#x27;s no reason to continue buying the 8-12oz bottles I was getting before now that Amazon offers this option.</li>
            <li> Love this product and use it every day! I have a 8 oz spray bottle that I use this to refill. It&#x27;s much more economical than buying a new spray bottle each time. Love it!</li>
            <li> The Tri-wheat leave in conditioner is great.  It tames my frizzy hair and makes it look shiny.  It feels so smooth!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I was first introduced to this Leave in conditioner by my stylist.  I was unsure of it&#x27;s efficacy especially when she sold me the 16ozspray for $30.  After the first use I knew I would not trade it in for the world.  This product on Amazon seems to be the real deal.  I was just a bit disappointed when I received the package and upon opening it realized that one of the 32oz bottles had an open lid and almost half of the product was spilled inside the box.  All in all was still a great deal so I didn&#x27;t even bother contacting the seller.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner!  No residue buildup, and it works great in the winter to help control the dry frizz!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of the watery consistency - this product is amazing!  I put it in a spray bottle and use it nightly.  It only takes 4-5 sprays to condition my hair adequately.  I&#x27;ve used the thicker leave-in conditioners and they didn&#x27;t condition nearly as well as this product.  I also like that I can put it in a small spray bottle and bring it on the airplane.  I always had problems finding leave-in conditioner in the size of a carry-on.</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughters hair. Great product . It makes my daughters hair smell good and feels soft</li>
            <li> LOVE this leave in! works great and is light, adds no weight</li>
            <li> A leave tis in my shower and put on my hair just before exiting. One of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve used on my course, thick curly hair</li>
            <li> Great conditioner at a great value.&lt;br /&gt;I shall never buy this from Ulta again! Weee!</li>
            <li> Good leave in, light weight, doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or weird, just provides a little extra moisture when I need it. Sometimes I use it as a finishing spray when I wear my hair curly (natural).</li>
            <li> So after reading the other reviews and after a recommendation from my stylist I decided to try this product. I received this today with several other products, only problem that I have run into is very similar to what several other people have- half the bottle had leaked out and was literally pouring out of the box when I picked it up. The product had gotten onto and into other products and damaged them. I was able to salvage some of the bottle and am hopeful it will at least be a good product- but the packaging is useless and don&#x27;t expect to get a full bottle.</li>
            <li> Helps to better manage my hair and smells great too!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!!  I have used much more expensive leave-in conditioners, but this one is the best.  I&#x27;ve been using it for the past year and it leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Waiting for the results but it seems like its working until now !!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product and would note be able to function without it daily. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, fly away hair.  This acts as both a detangler and leave-in conditioner without leaving my hair flat and lifeless.  I use it daily as a detangler even on days when I&#x27;m just rinsing, not washing.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but I ordered it thinking it was a liquid like what I had purchased at Ulta.  This is thicker.  Although it works I prefer the liquid</li>
            <li> Great detangler for fine or curly hair. Have used it for several years and always buy the big 32oz refill bottle because it&#x27;s cheaper in the long run.</li>
            <li> This is another one of those products that kind of only gives the ILLUSION that it&#x27;s good for your hair, because it contains &amp;#34;cones&amp;#34; -- as in the case here, Amodimethicone, which is the #2 ingredient for this product (water is #1). So yes, it does make my hair shiny and soft and easy to comb through, but at the same time, it&#x27;s also coating my hair with Amodimethicone, which builds up over time and can really cause a lot of damage to hair. I&#x27;m so tired of all these &#x27;cone-based products that claim to make your hair healthier, when it&#x27;s actually just smoke and mirrors because they can really cause a lot of damage to your hair with continued use. I&#x27;ve found that oil-based products (e.g. that contain sunflower oil, argan oil, etc.) work just as well (if not better) and yet will not cause damage in the long-term like all these &#x27;cone-based products do. If your hair is dry, it doesn&#x27;t need man-made silicones. It needs oils. ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for making your hair soft and shiny, but man they need to put it in a spray bottle because when I first tried getting some out, it spilled all over my hand. I thought this was the regular conditioner, but it&#x27;s okay because it still helps your hair get soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have purchased multiple leave-in conditioners, I bought this thinking it would be like all the others I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;Boy was I wrong, this was a liquid.  I wish someone would have stated this or it was listed in the description of the item.&lt;br /&gt;Thus I am writing the review I wish someone else would have.&lt;br /&gt;Not saying it is bad, but for my hair-type and what I was hoping for....  it most certainly was not good :(</li>
            <li> My hair is not easy to comb when it is wet.  A few sprays with this leave in conditiner and the comb glides through easily.  I have this conditioner forabout 5 years.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the product this however came to my home opened &amp; seriously watered down I will stick to buying from salons where I know it hasn&#x27;t been altered</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments on the health of my hair.  I know I owe this in large part to this conditioner the I use nightly before pin setting my hair. It leaves the hair soft, bouncy and healthy if used in small quantities and smells good.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist turned me on to this some years ago. I love it. It is much cheaper on Amazon. This is a big bottle and you really do not use much after each shampoo. The hair stylist noticed the difference in my hair not knowing I continue to use it.. I hope it works for you as well. I love love it</li>
            <li> This is a great buy espessially if you have a large family.  I use it in my hair and my kids hair.  My kids are mixed half black half white... This stuff is great</li>
            <li> Nice quality product. Wish the smell was a little different but it is okay. I think most Big Sexy products have a similar scent.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  I spray it on after towel drying my hair and it softens and detangles my hair without weighing it down.  And no cream rinse acne down my back. Great value in the 33.8 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the only leave in spray I use anymore . I love the smell and the feel , not heavy at all. And I think it helps since I color treat my hair . One of my favorite must have beauty products so glad to find the large refill size</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product before and I like the result, so, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love this product. However, when I received it, the cap was slightly loose, so it did leak a little. What saved it from leaking too much was the bottle had a tightly-wrapped plastic around it.</li>
            <li> Great price for a large bottle.  Amazon Prime made it an even better buy compared to my regular local retailer.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. first time ever using it. great deal. yes its watery so do what i did and buy a spray bottle too. my hair feels amazing!</li>
