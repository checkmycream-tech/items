    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>In my opinion this is the best for the price...  </li>
            <li>Smells delicious, but I will be returning these, since I don&#x27;t use sulfates or -cones.</li>
            <li>and since I cannot find this product in the stores, I am very happy that I have found it on amazon.</li>
            <li>This is amazing, just smelling it in the store does it no justice!!!</li>
            <li>the smell is wonderful, just like I remember and the fact that it says it gives your hair shine without silicones is ALSO AWESOME.</li>
            <li>Excellent product that smells great and lasts!</li>
            <li>I am absolutley in love with it!!!!</li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>Was thrilled to see this again, smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  </li>
            <li>I too used to use this Herbal Essences shampoo in the 90s and loved it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my all time favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Light, smelling good, washing well.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>This shampoo really works great and the scent is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>My all time favorite shampoo!</li>
            <li>Love this and smells amazing a bust buy!</li>
            <li>So happy to see this is still available.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just amazing</li>
            <li>works good for all hair types,  but is better for blondes....</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to find it on the market again.</li>
            <li>I find it kind of misleading that their sulfate-containing shampoo advertises &amp;#34;0% silicone,&amp;#34; and the dimethicone-containing conditioner advertises &amp;#34;0% sulfate.&amp;#34; I figured both descriptions applied to both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>So, beware, this is not the original formula!!</li>
            <li>It really is a classic, and the aroma is perfect!...</li>
            <li>Wonderful, fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>I was sent a free sample of this from Influenster and honestly it works amazingly.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and have been using it for decades.</li>
            <li>Bought this along with the conditioner and love the product.</li>
            <li>My hair smells great, it lathers very well</li>
            <li>All I ask is for better packaging of the shampoo itself...</li>
            <li>Excellent overall :)</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells great, works well, I LOVE THE OLDER bottles</li>
            <li>Great quality shampoo that really keeps your hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this shampoo, and that its sulfate free, the fragrance lasts forever which I like</li>
            <li>both those things means it&#x27;s pretty spectacular</li>
            <li>luckily the outside of the box wasn&#x27;t soggy but it did smell good!</li>
            <li>it seems like they have changed their formula for the \\&quot;better\\&quot; (that being silicone free etc).</li>
            <li>And its a huge bottle worth the money!</li>
            <li>It is a fabulous drugstore product that compares to many higher end drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>Since it did now feel quite like the original, I checked.</li>
            <li>Well, as a shampoo and conditioner it is nothing at all special.</li>
            <li>To my great delight I found it on the shelf again the other day and bought</li>
            <li>It seems to have a stronger fragrance than the original - in fact it is so strong that I can smell it on my skin and in my hair for the whole day afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for the original scent for the longest and am happy they have finally bought it back...</li>
            <li>not foo foo or too sweet, but really outdoorsy and fresh.</li>
            <li>I bought this solely because I remember LOVING the smell of this shampoo and that was a LONG time ago</li>
            <li>First of all, there is nothing to complain about the product itself...</li>
            <li>: Please do a better job packaging hair products...like wrapping them in bubble wrap or extra bags before putting them in the box.</li>
            <li>I would really like not to smell my shampoo all day!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I have a sensitive scalp, seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis, shampoos need to clean well without leaving any residue or else I have flare-ups.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend Herbal Essences Chamomile shampoo!</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>more would you expect?&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s actually a simple and natural product.</li>
            <li>Chamomile is the main fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price here was ok, about the same as our local Harris Teeter.</li>
            <li>It lathers VERY well and feels sooooo soft on your hair!</li>
            <li>Seems to work the same as far as clean and shine.</li>
            <li>The scent is the same, fresh and aromatic as always.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Original ingredients of HE \\&quot;Moisture Balanceing for Normal</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ingredients of the new HE Shine shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;Water, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate, cocamidopropyl betaine, citric acid, passionflower (passiflora incarnata)</li>
            <li>I use this product on my daughters&#x27; hair and it makes it very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I happen to still have an old empty bottle of the original from the 90s</li>
            <li>so I compared the ingredients from the old one and the new one.  </li>
            <li>But that smell certainly takes me back.</li>
            <li>It feels soft on my hair, nothing like leaving build up on me.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo for a long time, this is the first time I have ordered online.  </li>
            <li>essences came back to their senses and are selling two of their older collections again.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair shiny, don&#x27;t need much to wash all of my very long hair.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair a few times so far with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much easier to get the product OUT of the container, I cant tell you how crappy the \\&quot;new\\&quot; tops are that dont open until you&#x27;ve broken a finger off.</li>
            <li> I think the cap became loose, there were no holes in the shampoo bottle though.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, impossible to find in retail outlets . .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal and not even half of the shampoo was gone</li>
            <li> I would only give a little tip:</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, when I received this package (which was about an hour ago), the shampoo bottle had leaked and there was shampoo all over the bottom of the box, and other items I ordered.</li>
            <li> It took me forever cleaning the other products I ordered with water and dishrag....</li>
            <li> As for my scalp and hair, it seems to make my hair a bit frizzier than what I was previously using and my scalp may not be quite as happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is slightly off from what I am used to.  </li>
            <li> A little hint Amazon</li>
            <li> HEAVY PERFUME, FRUIT and CANDY NOT HERBAL scented at all.</li>
            <li> Within just a few washes I could definiltey see a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I would of given 5 stars if this incident didn&#x27;t happen :/</li>
            <li> Not sure why.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely frustrated...</li>

            <li> This shampoo really works great and the scent is wonderful.  In my opinion this is the best for the price...  I would only give a little tip: works good for all hair types,  but is better for blondes....</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and have been using it for decades. It is the only shampoo I can use that doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch. I am thrilled to find it on the market again.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite shampoo! It doesn&#x27;t have oils or conditioners in it, so if you need that in your shampoo, then you could use a separate hair conditioner product. It really is a classic, and the aroma is perfect!...not foo foo or too sweet, but really outdoorsy and fresh. Chamomile is the main fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Herbal Essences Chamomile shampoo!</li>
            <li> I almost had a coronary when I discovered they were bringing this back. I have been sulfate &amp; silicone-free for about 8 years so for me to use something with both those things means it&#x27;s pretty spectacular (I actually only use these to wash out coconut oil after I&#x27;ve done a deep conditioning treatment, to soften the damage). Well, as a shampoo and conditioner it is nothing at all special. But that smell certainly takes me back. Now I just need to watch if Bath &amp; Body Works brings back Plumeria. Then I&#x27;ll be set.</li>
            <li> So happy to see this is still available. The scent is the same, fresh and aromatic as always.</li>
            <li> I bought this solely because I remember LOVING the smell of this shampoo and that was a LONG time ago so I thought that I had probably romanticized  the fragrance.  Nope!  Smells just like I remember it!  Wonderful, fresh and clean.  The price here was ok, about the same as our local Harris Teeter.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Leaves hair shiny, don&#x27;t need much to wash all of my very long hair. About a dime sized dollop</li>
            <li> I find it kind of misleading that their sulfate-containing shampoo advertises &amp;#34;0% silicone,&amp;#34; and the dimethicone-containing conditioner advertises &amp;#34;0% sulfate.&amp;#34; I figured both descriptions applied to both the shampoo and conditioner. Smells delicious, but I will be returning these, since I don&#x27;t use sulfates or -cones.</li>
            <li> It feels soft on my hair, nothing like leaving build up on me. This shampoo smells like camomille and your hair will look so shinny when using this</li>
            <li> Bought this along with the conditioner and love the product. My hair smells great, it lathers very well and since I cannot find this product in the stores, I am very happy that I have found it on amazon.</li>
            <li> First of all, there is nothing to complain about the product itself...I LOVE this shampoo, and that its sulfate free, the fragrance lasts forever which I like and it makes my hair so soft and shiny. HOWEVER, when I received this package (which was about an hour ago), the shampoo bottle had leaked and there was shampoo all over the bottom of the box, and other items I ordered. I think the cap became loose, there were no holes in the shampoo bottle though. I was extremely frustrated...It took me forever cleaning the other products I ordered with water and dishrag.... A little hint Amazon: Please do a better job packaging hair products...like wrapping them in bubble wrap or extra bags before putting them in the box. I&#x27;ve never had this problem before. It&#x27;s not a big deal and not even half of the shampoo was gone but a LOT got out... When you package this, please put some plastic wrap over the opening and then close the cap to prevent this from happening...luckily the outside of the box wasn&#x27;t soggy but it did smell good! haha All I ask is for better packaging of the shampoo itself...or I might have to start buying from my local Target again (and they are always out of stock of it!) I would of given 5 stars if this incident didn&#x27;t happen :/</li>
            <li> I too used to use this Herbal Essences shampoo in the 90s and loved it. I was soooo disappointed when they discontinued it.

Since it did now feel quite like the original, I checked. I happen to still have an old empty bottle of the original from the 90s (yes, I kept it) so I compared the ingredients from the old one and the new one.  Turns out that they are not the same!  So, beware, this is not the original formula!! See below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original ingredients of HE \\&quot;Moisture Balanceing for Normal Hair\\&quot; shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;Water, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate, cocamidopropyl betaine, aloe barbadensis exract, chamomile (anthemis nobilis) extract, passionflower (passiflora incarnata) extract, cocamide MEA, dihydroxypropyl PEG-5, linoleaminium chloride, fragrance, citric acid, propylene glycol, sodium chloride, DMDM hydantoin, iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, FD&amp;C yellow no.5, D&amp;C orange No. 4, ext D&amp;C violet no.2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients of the new HE Shine shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;Water, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate, cocamidopropyl betaine, citric acid, passionflower (passiflora incarnata) extract, chamomile (anthemis nobilis) extract, aloe barbadensis exract, sodium citrate, sodium xylenesulfonate, fragrance,  cocamide MEA, sodium chloride, sodium benzoate, tetrasodium EDTA, PEG-60 almond glycerides, linoleamidopropyl PG-dimonium chloride phosphate, guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, methylchloroisothiazolinone, methyl isothiazolinone, yellow no.5, orange No. 4, violet no.2.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my all time favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Light, smelling good, washing well.&lt;br /&gt;What more would you expect?&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s actually a simple and natural product.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, impossible to find in retail outlets . . why add-on item only?!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a long time, this is the first time I have ordered online.  The smell is slightly off from what I am used to.  Not sure why.  Seems to work the same as far as clean and shine.</li>
            <li> This is amazing, just smelling it in the store does it no justice!!! Took it home and it&#x27;s just amazing the smell is wonderful, just like I remember and the fact that it says it gives your hair shine without silicones is ALSO AWESOME. It lathers VERY well and feels sooooo soft on your hair! It&#x27;s also paraben free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HERBAL essences came back to their senses and are selling two of their older collections again. I stopped using Herbal essenses years ago when they switched formulas and made HERBAL essence SMELL LIKE HEAVY PERFUME, FRUIT and CANDY NOT HERBAL scented at all. Now that they are back, I&#x27;m a returning customer, should they pull this off the shelf again, I am GONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, works well, I LOVE THE OLDER bottles too it&#x27;s much easier to get the product OUT of the container, I cant tell you how crappy the \\&quot;new\\&quot; tops are that dont open until you&#x27;ve broken a finger off.</li>
            <li> Was thrilled to see this again, smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love this and smells amazing a bust buy! And its a huge bottle worth the money! Go get you some!</li>
            <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  Excellent overall :)</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. Cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great quality shampoo that really keeps your hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that smells great and lasts!</li>
            <li> I use this product on my daughters&#x27; hair and it makes it very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the original scent for the longest and am happy they have finally bought it back... it seems like they have changed their formula for the \\&quot;better\\&quot; (that being silicone free etc). Also, I wouldn&#x27;t pay the 10.99 listed here when you can buy it from the store at 3.99!</li>
            <li> I was sent a free sample of this from Influenster and honestly it works amazingly. Within just a few washes I could definiltey see a difference in my hair. It was way shinier and healthier! It is a fabulous drugstore product that compares to many higher end drugstore brands. I am absolutley in love with it!!!!</li>
