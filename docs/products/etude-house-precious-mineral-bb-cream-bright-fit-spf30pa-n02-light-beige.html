            <li>perfect bb cream!</li>
            <li>I think it looks best when stippled and buffed in with a brush.</li>
            <li>Unlike the MIssha brand which was overpowering scent which make sense if you look at all the ingredients the Perfect Cover BB cream has&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gives you a flawless look.</li>
            <li>This BB cream is the best I&#x27;ve tried and I will be sticking to this.  </li>
            <li>Very good for my skin!</li>
            <li>This BB cream is wonderful for a summer foundation with SPF.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is wonderful, the colors are abit lighter.</li>
            <li>all Korea baby best BB cream</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been to places like Macy&#x27;s where people help you to find foundations that match your skin color best by trying them out on your hand.</li>
            <li>I know but believe me, Etude House BB Cream works perfectly for a finish-touch powder/concealer.</li>
            <li>The best makeup out there, we were in Korea for 2 years</li>
            <li>I am impressed by this product!!!!</li>
            <li>Very very happy</li>
            <li>but once I kept using it once or twice, my skin adapted to the color and it matched my skin color perfectly.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>

            <li>The product itself is very good.  </li>
            <li>Plus it is a good deal!</li>
            <li>It does a great job of covering anything on my face.</li>
            <li>or so it combines with your skin for great coverage.&lt;br /&gt;The shade I purchased</li>
            <li>but I use a bronzing powder and it looks great.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I have this BB Cream.</li>
            <li>I am really happy.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m happy with the sender.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Great coverage, makes my skin look great by the end of the day, and doesn&#x27;t clump or cake or crack.</li>
            <li>The coverage is actually really great--</li>
            <li>It covers my blemishes great.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>Works great with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I use this foundation because it makes my skin look flawless and beautifully healthy.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin so the 02 light beige covers perfectly on my skin.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>and i look good.</li>
            <li>and I am fairly fair skinned</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve ever had etude house you&#x27;ve done good</li>
            <li>The product pictured is NOT what I received - I got the &amp;#34;blooming fit&amp;#34; rather than the &amp;#34;bright fit&amp;#34; that I wanted and have always loved.  </li>
            <li>When I heard about BB creams in South Korea I decided to give them a chance and chose Etude House because I&#x27;d seen someone online say they really loved</li>
            <li>was on a mission to find a replacement BB that felt as good, looked as good and provided the coverage that I need.</li>
            <li>This bb cream was good.</li>
            <li>Light weight and matches perfectly!</li>
            <li>I get really good coverage and dont need to put on tons of concealer anymore.</li>
            <li>She has beautiful skin, and as it turns out, this is her favorite &#x27;make-up&#x27; product.  </li>
            <li>This means that Asian people tend to look best under dewy finish make-up, whereas Caucasian people tend to look best under matte finish make-up.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin look clear and flawless and at the end of the day, my skin still looks beautiful, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more than happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product and price!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this BB Cream and will keep using it!</li>
            <li>I love this foundation!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>After about 7-8 hours of wear, it wore off a bit with the concealing and dewy look, so I don&#x27;t think this would be ideal if you have to go out for 7+ hours, unless you have decent skin already lol.</li>
            <li>This is a great foundation if you have fairly light skin.</li>
            <li>It looks amazing on.</li>
            <li>This BB cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>Blends amazingly.</li>
            <li>It still looked as good as the time when I put them on, still my face was soft, looking flawless.</li>
            <li>It takes years off my appearance and gives my skin a nice even tone.</li>
            <li>The BB cream on its own is a bit too oily for my skin.</li>
            <li>It blends into the Skin 79 BB cream really well, leaving my face flawless looking.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best BB cream I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Excellent highly recommended</li>
            <li>Perfectly full coverage, great natural-looking finish.</li>
            <li>Very easy to layer coverage</li>
            <li>but so far really good!!</li>
            <li>This is one of the best BB cream I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned (and caucasian) and I purchased the light beige color.</li>
            <li>As far as my acne, nothing can perfectly hide that stuff, but what I really love about this BB cream is that it&#x27;s helped my skin become clearer.</li>
            <li>This means that, on your skin areas that are much hydrated and smooth, Etude House BB creams goes over great and gives a good dewy shine.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty and bright-</li>
            <li>It offers very good coverage and isn&#x27;t greasy once absorbs.</li>
            <li>Sits on top of your skin and doesn&#x27;t sink in.  </li>
            <li>i really love the texture and</li>
            <li>my favorite</li>
            <li>love the product.</li>
            <li>I Love this.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it, unless you have oily skin, then it will just make your skin more oily by the end of the day/night.</li>
            <li>I was expecting this BB cream to be better than the 79</li>
            <li>as of yet I have not used it but antisipate that I will love it.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on my hand and am pleased with the color, texture and coverage.</li>
            <li>so I was impressed how this BB Cream actually controls my face&#x27;s oil problem).</li>
            <li>My favorite part is the spf quality, as it will help prevent any sun damage.</li>
            <li>I love how it gives a dewy glow to the skin.</li>
            <li>If I want a bit more coverage</li>
            <li>Since using this product my coworkers have commented that my skin always looks so healthy.</li>
            <li>my skin appears more even and this BB cream did not break me out.</li>
            <li>It looks more dewy that way, instead of just</li>
            <li>also has a whitening agent, and I have to say that I have noticed my skin tone is more even than it had ever been before.  </li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s a anti wrinkle, spf 30 (</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s when I got the Light Beige!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t my favorite BB Cream</li>
            <li>I have gotten SO many compliments on my complexion since using this skincare system.</li>
            <li>This is actually light weight, never greasy, and covers imperfections nicely.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many people have commented on my &amp;#34;luminous face&amp;#34; since I&#x27;ve begun using it.  </li>
            <li>Covers my pimple and freckles:)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Dr Jart (Sephora) and samples of the Urban Decay/Stila/Smashbox/etc BB creams, and I would say this gives you the best value.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for sure</li>
            <li>(Vichy is much better from this aspect).</li>
            <li>But on the areas that are dryer and flakier, this BB creamwould not hydrate it and it would end up giving those areas a more dusty-look.</li>
            <li>Then I purchased Skin 79 BB cream mini-set, and I discovered Skin 79&#x27;s VIP Gold BB cream which I wear on top of Skin Moisturizer and Hydroxatone.</li>
            <li>So I hope Mizon Snail BB Cream would give me a much better skin-care package and make my face more dewy and hydrated, and basically, more flawless-looking skin.</li>
            <li>but they didn&#x27;t seem to notice that whatsoever :)</li>
            <li>Really love it...</li>
            <li>It will conceal most things but not all.</li>
            <li>I also love the SPF 30.</li>
            <li>Works better than any BB creams that I&#x27;ve tried from the US.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of this.</li>
            <li>But this is my favorite one &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Good job that I can&#x27;t read Korean because I am pretty sure it contains a lot of questionsble ingredents</li>
            <li>It did not break me out, and gives you a pretty good shine, not so shiny</li>
            <li>I have many post-acne red and sunspots on my face and after patting this cream over my face they&#x27;ve all disappeared, leaving my face flawless looking in terms of smooth spread.</li>
            <li>great for people who wants to look natural/ light make up.</li>
            <li>I am asian but have very fair skin</li>
            <li>I am more comfortable now going without makeup (foundation) around the house since the improvement in my skin, whereas I used to get up and put my face on immediately.  </li>
            <li>After trying many bb creams, this is my favorite and the only one I will reorder, because the color is great for me.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, but I ended up giving it to my mom because she loved it.  </li>
            <li>The color matched my skin very well, and it smells good too.</li>
            <li>It does feel very nice and makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>But other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>It lasts for a very long time, and has some AMAZING coverage!!  </li>
            <li>one is very nice, the coverage is natural and gives a good natural healthy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product and very cool tightens the skin from the first use and after a month</li>
            <li>i like BB creamy because it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Even blemishes are easily covered.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not too strong and fades as the day progresses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just mix my favorite full coverage foundation into this and apply.</li>
            <li>so the light fits me well.</li>
            <li>I just wish there was a lighter option, but this is as light as it goes.</li>
            <li>It covers everything I want covered and it feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>It also has a light feeling so you don&#x27;t feel like you are wearing a mask.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>how much I enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>The brightener is too light for my complexion.  </li>
            <li>feel comfortable wearing this anywhere.</li>
            <li>I am considered as someone with light skin</li>
            <li>It feels light on the skin, and doesnt cause breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Also, the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s the bb cream for me, but it&#x27;s still a good product as a whole. :)</li>
            <li>I use the light beige color, it is a bit whiter than my original skin, but it is just fine.</li>
            <li>It provides just the right amount of coverage and luminosity to make your skin look healthy.</li>
            <li>And very fast delivery even if i am here in europe. :)</li>
            <li>(I originally have oily face</li>
            <li>But well worth the wait!</li>
            <li>It covers better than my old one and it leaves my face feeling so smooth!</li>
            <li>the package came with a lot of very nice little samples and shipping time was fantastic!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right!</li>
            <li>The next order I will not get the Bright.</li>
            <li>it has amazing coverage and makes your skin look natural.</li>
            <li>The one thing i do like is that it is truly full coverage.  </li>
            <li>If you are oily you may want to top with a powder as this BB cream is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I also like how it has a full coverage.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s medium to full coverage.</li>
            <li>Most days I set with Maybeline&#x27;s Dream Matte Powder because my face tends to get shiny throughout the day, but this brand of BB cream doesn&#x27;t add much shine</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li>It looks natural and provides a nice silky sheen that provides a glow.</li>
            <li>Has a light scent that is fresh and not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>The scent is pretty strong.</li>
            <li>super light and natural look:)</li>
            <li>Even coverage; however, i do have to work quickly before it dries to a powder/matte finish working on one area at a time&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>But of course there are lots of individual variations so if you have the resources, time and money obviously you should explore both to find your best match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the packaging is so cute and the pump is definitely a plus :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a full day of wear the BB Cream held up much better than my old foundation (without primer!)</li>
            <li>I read many reviews regarding this particular product and have found some useful tips when applying this make-up.</li>
            <li>Such a huge fan of Etude house products!!</li>
            <li>I also love the flavor:) a little whitish when first applied, but it will go away as time goes on:)</li>
            <li>I normally am between porclein and light beigh, this light beigh is really light, I had to add bronzer on top but can&#x27;t say enough</li>
            <li>I love the consistency and the fact that this BB Cream has a pretty high coverage for a BB Cream without looking cakey.</li>
            <li>It is really milky when you pump it out, but it smoothly covers my face when I apply them onto my face.</li>
            <li>Such an amazing product.</li>
            <li>, I actually have the 3 shades Light Beige, Natural Beige and Honey Beige, I have receive compliments on how good my skin looks now.</li>
            <li>For those of you who have similar kind of skin as mine I would recommend that you try the Skin 79 one over Etude House.</li>
            <li>Price is worth it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite bb cream i have tried so far</li>
            <li>Decent coverage (though you would want to use a concealer for something more than light freckles) and perfect tone for my caucasian friend (very pale with blue eyes)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more coverage than I thought, and more than I have found with other BB or CC creams.  </li>
            <li>Once it arrived, I wanted to try it out right away, but I waited until morning.</li>
            <li>Initially this is too dark for my skin (NC15 in MAC, for reference), but after oxidizing (about 10-15 minutes) the color is perfect.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to buy Hydroxatone of course but just make sure that you use some skin product that would first leave your skin completely hydrated and silky before you use either Etude House or Skin</li>
            <li>It makes your skin super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>First of all, this BB cream was delivered super fast!</li>
            <li>acne marks have faded more quickly with this product than with different BB creams.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The lightest shade is just a very very little bit too dark in Winter, but just perfect in Summer, when this gets most of its use.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This product goes a long way, and is a nice option for when I dont want to put on foundation.  </li>
            <li>One is that, like many other reviewers have said, it comes off really really easily, which I don&#x27;t like because I prefer a cream that absorbs and into your skin and dries a bit and compacts</li>
            <li>Overall great product and experience with the seller, I will definitely be purchasing the product again.</li>
            <li>product arrived quick and it is very silky when applying.</li>
            <li>but you have to be fast as it dries quickly and use a scrubbing cleanser to help remove it at night.</li>
            <li>so I guess if I purchased Natural Beige it would&#x27;ve been fine too.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised by how lightly this goes on yet provides a dewy finish and medium coverage.</li>
            <li>I really, really like this product!</li>
            <li>I loved this for the first few months of usage</li>
            <li>I used this yesterday, I washed my face, put a lotion then applied this BB Cream after I applied a face primer first.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying out Etude House&#x27;s BB Cream, and I am so thankful that I bought this BB Cream and using it.</li>
            <li>Using the teensiest amount with a light brushing of a powder helps to make the overall appearance more natural.</li>
            <li>It gives a dewey finish that you see in asian bb creams, andI do love that.  </li>
            <li>It gives better coverage than the average BB cream, while still feeling light.</li>
            <li>(but there&#x27;s more of a pearly white cast that i think has to do with the intention for a dewy look)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not oily or thick, pump lid is great.</li>
            <li>I love anything from Etude House, and their BB Cream is nothing different.</li>
            <li>Personally, it tends to just sit on top of my skin</li>
            <li>And guess what most Western foundations are?</li>
            <li>That cream is much more compact and dewy finish, but only medium coverage of my spots.</li>
            <li>A lot of BB creams are too gray but this one matches my skin pretty well.</li>
            <li>At first the BB cream didn&#x27;t match my skin</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I found that it wasn&#x27;t the best BB cream I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>or if that&#x27;s just how the product is, but I switched to a different BB cream (from Ponds) that I like a lot better...</li>
            <li>product also gives my skin a dewy appearance, which I like ;)&lt;br</li>
            <li>After over 6 years of using Cover Girl foundation I finally got the courage to try BB Cream, and I&#x27;m so glad I decided to go with this</li>
            <li>I like to use this when I just want to quickly throw on my face to do errands and such, and I use a light dusting of powder after it sets.  </li>
            <li>I have tried Skin 79 VIP Gold Collection Super Beblesh Balm and that covered good but seemed to make me break out and was a bit on the thick side.  </li>
            <li>But it does last the whole day with better coverage.</li>
            <li>It is every bit as good as the more expensive BB.</li>
            <li>and I mainly want to try them for finding a better color for me since I&#x27;m East/Oriental Asian.</li>
            <li>Western foundations in general do not have good skin color matches for Asian people, since we don&#x27;t have the same kind of skin undertone with Caucasian people, to whom Western products primarily target.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin look so natural and flawless, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I thought this product looked VERY nice on my skin, but it is definitely NOT good for the skin.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, it did seem to just highlight dry areas and my acne, but then I found a good moisturizer to put on at night and that took care of the dry problems.</li>
            <li>so dont go crazy with it, glides on to skin smooth no smell, leaves a great finished look.</li>
            <li>All in all, very satified with the product. .</li>
            <li>Its covers up my acne scars really well</li>
            <li>my T-zone VERY oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the product itself isn&#x27;t very moisturizing even as the day goes on.</li>
            <li>If you use too much, you may experience some chalkiness in the tone.</li>
            <li>It is very comparable in quality and color.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to worry too much about getting it over your clothes when you are wearing it</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t yet purchased the real 40g Skin 79 VIP Gold</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and breakouts and this BB cream really helps to hide them.</li>
            <li>You use literally one squirt for your whole face and blend it out.</li>
            <li>It literally takes one pump to do your whole face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say if you have oily skin, be careful and make sure to use a powder with this.</li>
            <li>Then, I found that it didn&#x27;t blend very well.  </li>
            <li>Nothing like the liquidy BB creams here in the US which only provide light coverage.</li>
            <li>and it got to me really fast when i ordered it</li>
            <li>It covers acne marks very well and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really recommend it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels light and airy similar to a sunscreen lotion the scent is floral like popuri</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s at least good news).</li>
            <li>I liked the results of using it enough, until I started getting big ol&#x27; blackheads on places of my face</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives a good coverage and makes my bare skin look healthier; I&#x27;ve also noticed less wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>offers a medium to full coverage and can be layered a bit for a little more coverage under the eyes and on blemishes.  </li>
            <li>but I like this BB cream so much better than the other brands I have used.</li>
            <li>I like this better than any other BB cream product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why Asian people generally strive for a more porcelain/rubber look for our face.</li>
            <li>So this so far is my perfect make-up formula especially for dry-flaky/sensitive pale skin Asian people.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using etude house bb creams for a long time now since they offer anti wrinkle properties for a cheap price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just got this and so far i really like it!</li>
            <li>I tried this on a whim, figuring what the heck.&lt;br /&gt;I am very, very fair with a little uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a little bit heavier than I like, but overall it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li>This BB cream is by far better than other BB cream I tryed very satisfide.</li>
            <li>In general, I think the beige will look more natural on asian skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>all in one and doesn&#x27;t make my face break out as it&#x27;s not real thick but covers really, really well.  </li>
            <li>So when I use Western products, the foundations are usually either too fair or too orangy for me.</li>
            <li>I normally wouldn&#x27;t use,</li>
            <li>with Etude House: this is the first Korean BB cream that I bought, and overall, it matched my skin color better than what I&#x27;ve used previously.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and requires so little to cover your entire face!</li>
            <li>can&amp;#34;t live without bb cream</li>
            <li>i have combo skin where my cheeks can get super dry and</li>
            <li>The greyish undertone (at least from the sample that I tried) looks perfectly natural for me, leaving my face kind of a shiny rubber-mask kind of look with only a slight lighter shade, which changes color a bit to match my skin shade when it completely oxidizes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m white and have fairly light skin, but a lot of bb creams were too white for me.</li>
            <li>how natural it looks on skin while covering every imperfection!</li>
            <li>Also, I was using this first time and for experiment, I stayed for 10 hours and nothing else I did to my face but only this BB Cream.</li>
            <li>I first noticed it in a Korean TV show and later asked a South Korean friend of mine about it.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using BB Cream and believe me I will not go back to foundation</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t melt off in the heat so far!</li>
            <li>Well let me just start off by saying, I am a pale greek woman and this matches my olive toned complexion perfectly and thats incredibly hard to find.</li>
            <li>That is, if I ever, since I recently purchased the Mizon Snail BB Cream which I heard is so much better, and I&#x27;ve tried the Skin 79 Snail BB sample and the snail element does tighten/compact my skin much better, although after I wash it off it seems to leave my skin with red dots that seem to prelude breakouts (I haven&#x27;t really broken out yet while using the Skin 79 Snail sample</li>
            <li>The bottom line is usually, if you are Caucasian, generally speaking Western products probably work better for you, if you are Asian, Asian products probably work better for you.</li>
            <li>was a little to light</li>
            <li>Another difference with Asian skin type versus Caucasian skin type is that Asian people tend to have much thinner and delicate skin, whereas Caucasian people tend to have much thicker, more thin-hair covered dusty-looking skin.</li>
            <li>sensitive to fragrance</li>
            <li>After trying out a couple of Western BB creams and really liking them, I started to explosively buying and trying out Korean BB creams, which are well advertised</li>
            <li>I have sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li>When I take this off at night, the next morning I look at my face and it is so much</li>
            <li>really recommend this over the Western BB creams, which are basically just tinted moisturizers and won&#x27;t help with covering blemishes and treating your face.</li>
            <li>It was recommended on one of the subreddits that I frequent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy coverage, but it covers.</li>
            <li>have scarred skin, and acne frequently pops up</li>
            <li>I had always heard Korean BB creams and American BB creams are completely different and this product totally proves that point.</li>
            <li>I am 62 and this cream only made the few wrinkles I do have look dramatically deeper and more pronounced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so sad because, if it wasn&#x27;t those problems mentioned, I would&#x27;ve loved this product.</li>
            <li>They usually fail with finding a good color with me.</li>
            <li>It is a low cost for a high quality product.</li>
            <li>Now I am going back to my 79 BB cream even though it is more expensive but it will b worth the $.</li>
            <li>but since it&#x27;s probably the only non-organic product in my bathroom, I can live with it.</li>
            <li>It would leave my skin  looking dry and it did not provide much coverage.</li>
            <li>I like this product a lot, it does dry really fast</li>
            <li>Only a week of using this product, my cheeks became saggy, causing my pores to become noticeably large.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not using it on my whole face but only on my eye lids since it shimmers.</li>
            <li>My Asian peers who saw me complimented me that I have \\&quot;flawless skin\\&quot; when in fact I have pretty terrible skin but was wearing the BB cream</li>
            <li>First, I found that the fragrance was a bit strong and old-lady-ish... like fake flowers or something.  </li>
            <li>my face became soft and white and no black spots or wrinkles</li>
            <li>I wear this cream on top of Olay sensitive skin Moisturizer AND Hydroxatone, and it still gives me flaky lines in excessively dry and dull areas on my face.</li>
            <li>because this is half BB cream, half foundation, it is my favorite BB cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more dewy than the average bb cream, but it doesn&#x27;t look greasy or anything like that.</li>
            <li>Barely feel it on my skin once blended</li>
            <li>Also, my younger nieces do not think I look &amp;#34;sickly&amp;#34; anymore with no makeup on!&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my skin is also fairly sensitive, and I have not had a problem with this cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy but gives me enough coverage that I&#x27;m not worried about it wearing off throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It does a great job covering freckles or minor skin discoloration but not a great choice for skin that has large pores or signs of age as it will only intensify the negative.</li>
            <li>Slight floral smell at first but will fade before you walk out the door.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell much the difference initially due to the lighting of the place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always approach a foundation product with a little skepticism because so many seem so heavy.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little while to oxidize into your skin tone, but the result is pretty.</li>
            <li>I really like this , but unfortunately, it is too light for my skin-makes me look like I have literally white skin.</li>
            <li>But again like I said, Asian BB creams in general don&#x27;t work as well for Caucasian people.</li>
            <li>No grey cast that the Skin79 and Missha BB creams i&#x27;ve tried had</li>
            <li>It &amp;#34;sets&amp;#34; a few minutes after application, and it blends in pretty well with my skin.  </li>
            <li>you first put it on its little white but after 10 minutes</li>
            <li>I really like it, but my only problem is it&#x27;s a slight shade darker than my skin-</li>
            <li>However, it stays very moist &amp; shiny looking (can feel a little greasy, too)</li>
            <li>I am light skinned so buying anything on the internet is always tough as it tends to always have an orange tint to it.  </li>
            <li>I love how it blends into my skin and makes it look less heavy compared to other makeup.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> Plus it is a good deal!</li>

            <li> This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> Great coverage, makes my skin look great by the end of the day, and doesn&#x27;t clump or cake or crack.</li>
            <li> The coverage is actually really great--</li>
            <li> It covers my blemishes great.</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> Works great with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I use this foundation because it makes my skin look flawless and beautifully healthy.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin so the 02 light beige covers perfectly on my skin.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> and i look good.</li>
            <li> and I am fairly fair skinned</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve ever had etude house you&#x27;ve done good</li>
            <li> The product pictured is NOT what I received - I got the &amp;#34;blooming fit&amp;#34; rather than the &amp;#34;bright fit&amp;#34; that I wanted and have always loved.  </li>
            <li> When I heard about BB creams in South Korea I decided to give them a chance and chose Etude House because I&#x27;d seen someone online say they really loved</li>
            <li> was on a mission to find a replacement BB that felt as good, looked as good and provided the coverage that I need.</li>
            <li> This bb cream was good.</li>
            <li> Light weight and matches perfectly!</li>
            <li> I get really good coverage and dont need to put on tons of concealer anymore.</li>
            <li> She has beautiful skin, and as it turns out, this is her favorite &#x27;make-up&#x27; product.  </li>
            <li> This means that Asian people tend to look best under dewy finish make-up, whereas Caucasian people tend to look best under matte finish make-up.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look clear and flawless and at the end of the day, my skin still looks beautiful, not greasy.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more than happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product and price!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this BB Cream and will keep using it!</li>
            <li> I love this foundation!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> After about 7-8 hours of wear, it wore off a bit with the concealing and dewy look, so I don&#x27;t think this would be ideal if you have to go out for 7+ hours, unless you have decent skin already lol.</li>
            <li> This is a great foundation if you have fairly light skin.</li>
            <li> It looks amazing on.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is amazing.</li>
            <li> Blends amazingly.</li>
            <li> It still looked as good as the time when I put them on, still my face was soft, looking flawless.</li>
            <li> It takes years off my appearance and gives my skin a nice even tone.</li>
            <li> The BB cream on its own is a bit too oily for my skin.</li>
            <li> It blends into the Skin 79 BB cream really well, leaving my face flawless looking.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best BB cream I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Excellent highly recommended</li>
            <li> Perfectly full coverage, great natural-looking finish.</li>
            <li> Very easy to layer coverage</li>
            <li> but so far really good!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best BB cream I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned (and caucasian) and I purchased the light beige color.</li>
            <li> As far as my acne, nothing can perfectly hide that stuff, but what I really love about this BB cream is that it&#x27;s helped my skin become clearer.</li>
            <li> This means that, on your skin areas that are much hydrated and smooth, Etude House BB creams goes over great and gives a good dewy shine.</li>
            <li> It is very pretty and bright-</li>
            <li> It offers very good coverage and isn&#x27;t greasy once absorbs.</li>
            <li> Sits on top of your skin and doesn&#x27;t sink in.  </li>
            <li> i really love the texture and</li>
            <li> my favorite</li>
            <li> love the product.</li>
            <li> I Love this.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it, unless you have oily skin, then it will just make your skin more oily by the end of the day/night.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this BB cream to be better than the 79</li>
            <li> as of yet I have not used it but antisipate that I will love it.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on my hand and am pleased with the color, texture and coverage.</li>
            <li> so I was impressed how this BB Cream actually controls my face&#x27;s oil problem).</li>
            <li> My favorite part is the spf quality, as it will help prevent any sun damage.</li>
            <li> I love how it gives a dewy glow to the skin.</li>
            <li> If I want a bit more coverage</li>
            <li> Since using this product my coworkers have commented that my skin always looks so healthy.</li>
            <li> my skin appears more even and this BB cream did not break me out.</li>
            <li> It looks more dewy that way, instead of just</li>
            <li> also has a whitening agent, and I have to say that I have noticed my skin tone is more even than it had ever been before.  </li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s a anti wrinkle, spf 30 (</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s when I got the Light Beige!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t my favorite BB Cream</li>
            <li> I have gotten SO many compliments on my complexion since using this skincare system.</li>
            <li> This is actually light weight, never greasy, and covers imperfections nicely.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many people have commented on my &amp;#34;luminous face&amp;#34; since I&#x27;ve begun using it.  </li>
            <li> Covers my pimple and freckles:)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Dr Jart (Sephora) and samples of the Urban Decay/Stila/Smashbox/etc BB creams, and I would say this gives you the best value.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know for sure</li>
            <li> (Vichy is much better from this aspect).</li>
            <li> But on the areas that are dryer and flakier, this BB creamwould not hydrate it and it would end up giving those areas a more dusty-look.</li>
            <li> Then I purchased Skin 79 BB cream mini-set, and I discovered Skin 79&#x27;s VIP Gold BB cream which I wear on top of Skin Moisturizer and Hydroxatone.</li>
            <li> So I hope Mizon Snail BB Cream would give me a much better skin-care package and make my face more dewy and hydrated, and basically, more flawless-looking skin.</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t seem to notice that whatsoever :)</li>
            <li> Really love it...</li>
            <li> It will conceal most things but not all.</li>
            <li> I also love the SPF 30.</li>
            <li> Works better than any BB creams that I&#x27;ve tried from the US.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more of this.</li>
            <li> But this is my favorite one &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Good job that I can&#x27;t read Korean because I am pretty sure it contains a lot of questionsble ingredents</li>
            <li> It did not break me out, and gives you a pretty good shine, not so shiny</li>
            <li> I have many post-acne red and sunspots on my face and after patting this cream over my face they&#x27;ve all disappeared, leaving my face flawless looking in terms of smooth spread.</li>
            <li> great for people who wants to look natural/ light make up.</li>
            <li> I am asian but have very fair skin</li>
            <li> I am more comfortable now going without makeup (foundation) around the house since the improvement in my skin, whereas I used to get up and put my face on immediately.  </li>
            <li> After trying many bb creams, this is my favorite and the only one I will reorder, because the color is great for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but I ended up giving it to my mom because she loved it.  </li>
            <li> The color matched my skin very well, and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> It does feel very nice and makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> But other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> It lasts for a very long time, and has some AMAZING coverage!!  </li>
            <li> one is very nice, the coverage is natural and gives a good natural healthy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product and very cool tightens the skin from the first use and after a month</li>
            <li> i like BB creamy because it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Even blemishes are easily covered.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too strong and fades as the day progresses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just mix my favorite full coverage foundation into this and apply.</li>
            <li> so the light fits me well.</li>
            <li> I just wish there was a lighter option, but this is as light as it goes.</li>
            <li> It covers everything I want covered and it feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> It also has a light feeling so you don&#x27;t feel like you are wearing a mask.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> how much I enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> The brightener is too light for my complexion.  </li>
            <li> feel comfortable wearing this anywhere.</li>
            <li> I am considered as someone with light skin</li>
            <li> It feels light on the skin, and doesnt cause breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Also, the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s the bb cream for me, but it&#x27;s still a good product as a whole. :)</li>
            <li> I use the light beige color, it is a bit whiter than my original skin, but it is just fine.</li>
            <li> It provides just the right amount of coverage and luminosity to make your skin look healthy.</li>
            <li> And very fast delivery even if i am here in europe. :)</li>
            <li> (I originally have oily face</li>
            <li> But well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> It covers better than my old one and it leaves my face feeling so smooth!</li>
            <li> the package came with a lot of very nice little samples and shipping time was fantastic!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right!</li>
            <li> The next order I will not get the Bright.</li>
            <li> it has amazing coverage and makes your skin look natural.</li>
            <li> The one thing i do like is that it is truly full coverage.  </li>
            <li> If you are oily you may want to top with a powder as this BB cream is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I also like how it has a full coverage.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s medium to full coverage.</li>
            <li> Most days I set with Maybeline&#x27;s Dream Matte Powder because my face tends to get shiny throughout the day, but this brand of BB cream doesn&#x27;t add much shine</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li> It looks natural and provides a nice silky sheen that provides a glow.</li>
            <li> Has a light scent that is fresh and not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> The scent is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> super light and natural look:)</li>
            <li> Even coverage; however, i do have to work quickly before it dries to a powder/matte finish working on one area at a time&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> But of course there are lots of individual variations so if you have the resources, time and money obviously you should explore both to find your best match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the packaging is so cute and the pump is definitely a plus :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a full day of wear the BB Cream held up much better than my old foundation (without primer!)</li>
            <li> I read many reviews regarding this particular product and have found some useful tips when applying this make-up.</li>
            <li> Such a huge fan of Etude house products!!</li>
            <li> I also love the flavor:) a little whitish when first applied, but it will go away as time goes on:)</li>
            <li> I normally am between porclein and light beigh, this light beigh is really light, I had to add bronzer on top but can&#x27;t say enough</li>
            <li> I love the consistency and the fact that this BB Cream has a pretty high coverage for a BB Cream without looking cakey.</li>
            <li> It is really milky when you pump it out, but it smoothly covers my face when I apply them onto my face.</li>
            <li> Such an amazing product.</li>
            <li> , I actually have the 3 shades Light Beige, Natural Beige and Honey Beige, I have receive compliments on how good my skin looks now.</li>
            <li> For those of you who have similar kind of skin as mine I would recommend that you try the Skin 79 one over Etude House.</li>
            <li> Price is worth it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bb cream i have tried so far</li>
            <li> Decent coverage (though you would want to use a concealer for something more than light freckles) and perfect tone for my caucasian friend (very pale with blue eyes)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more coverage than I thought, and more than I have found with other BB or CC creams.  </li>
            <li> Once it arrived, I wanted to try it out right away, but I waited until morning.</li>
            <li> Initially this is too dark for my skin (NC15 in MAC, for reference), but after oxidizing (about 10-15 minutes) the color is perfect.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to buy Hydroxatone of course but just make sure that you use some skin product that would first leave your skin completely hydrated and silky before you use either Etude House or Skin</li>
            <li> It makes your skin super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> First of all, this BB cream was delivered super fast!</li>
            <li> acne marks have faded more quickly with this product than with different BB creams.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The lightest shade is just a very very little bit too dark in Winter, but just perfect in Summer, when this gets most of its use.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This product goes a long way, and is a nice option for when I dont want to put on foundation.  </li>
            <li> One is that, like many other reviewers have said, it comes off really really easily, which I don&#x27;t like because I prefer a cream that absorbs and into your skin and dries a bit and compacts</li>
            <li> Overall great product and experience with the seller, I will definitely be purchasing the product again.</li>
            <li> product arrived quick and it is very silky when applying.</li>
            <li> but you have to be fast as it dries quickly and use a scrubbing cleanser to help remove it at night.</li>
            <li> so I guess if I purchased Natural Beige it would&#x27;ve been fine too.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised by how lightly this goes on yet provides a dewy finish and medium coverage.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this product!</li>
            <li> I loved this for the first few months of usage</li>
            <li> I used this yesterday, I washed my face, put a lotion then applied this BB Cream after I applied a face primer first.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying out Etude House&#x27;s BB Cream, and I am so thankful that I bought this BB Cream and using it.</li>
            <li> Using the teensiest amount with a light brushing of a powder helps to make the overall appearance more natural.</li>
            <li> It gives a dewey finish that you see in asian bb creams, andI do love that.  </li>
            <li> It gives better coverage than the average BB cream, while still feeling light.</li>
            <li> (but there&#x27;s more of a pearly white cast that i think has to do with the intention for a dewy look)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not oily or thick, pump lid is great.</li>
            <li> I love anything from Etude House, and their BB Cream is nothing different.</li>
            <li> Personally, it tends to just sit on top of my skin</li>
            <li> And guess what most Western foundations are?</li>
            <li> That cream is much more compact and dewy finish, but only medium coverage of my spots.</li>
            <li> A lot of BB creams are too gray but this one matches my skin pretty well.</li>
            <li> At first the BB cream didn&#x27;t match my skin</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found that it wasn&#x27;t the best BB cream I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> or if that&#x27;s just how the product is, but I switched to a different BB cream (from Ponds) that I like a lot better...</li>
            <li> product also gives my skin a dewy appearance, which I like ;)&lt;br</li>
            <li> After over 6 years of using Cover Girl foundation I finally got the courage to try BB Cream, and I&#x27;m so glad I decided to go with this</li>
            <li> I like to use this when I just want to quickly throw on my face to do errands and such, and I use a light dusting of powder after it sets.  </li>
            <li> I have tried Skin 79 VIP Gold Collection Super Beblesh Balm and that covered good but seemed to make me break out and was a bit on the thick side.  </li>
            <li> But it does last the whole day with better coverage.</li>
            <li> It is every bit as good as the more expensive BB.</li>
            <li> and I mainly want to try them for finding a better color for me since I&#x27;m East/Oriental Asian.</li>
            <li> Western foundations in general do not have good skin color matches for Asian people, since we don&#x27;t have the same kind of skin undertone with Caucasian people, to whom Western products primarily target.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin look so natural and flawless, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I thought this product looked VERY nice on my skin, but it is definitely NOT good for the skin.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, it did seem to just highlight dry areas and my acne, but then I found a good moisturizer to put on at night and that took care of the dry problems.</li>
            <li> so dont go crazy with it, glides on to skin smooth no smell, leaves a great finished look.</li>
            <li> All in all, very satified with the product. .</li>
            <li> Its covers up my acne scars really well</li>
            <li> my T-zone VERY oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the product itself isn&#x27;t very moisturizing even as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> If you use too much, you may experience some chalkiness in the tone.</li>
            <li> It is very comparable in quality and color.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to worry too much about getting it over your clothes when you are wearing it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet purchased the real 40g Skin 79 VIP Gold</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and breakouts and this BB cream really helps to hide them.</li>
            <li> You use literally one squirt for your whole face and blend it out.</li>
            <li> It literally takes one pump to do your whole face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say if you have oily skin, be careful and make sure to use a powder with this.</li>
            <li> Then, I found that it didn&#x27;t blend very well.  </li>
            <li> Nothing like the liquidy BB creams here in the US which only provide light coverage.</li>
            <li> and it got to me really fast when i ordered it</li>
            <li> It covers acne marks very well and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really recommend it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels light and airy similar to a sunscreen lotion the scent is floral like popuri</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s at least good news).</li>
            <li> I liked the results of using it enough, until I started getting big ol&#x27; blackheads on places of my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives a good coverage and makes my bare skin look healthier; I&#x27;ve also noticed less wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> offers a medium to full coverage and can be layered a bit for a little more coverage under the eyes and on blemishes.  </li>
            <li> but I like this BB cream so much better than the other brands I have used.</li>
            <li> I like this better than any other BB cream product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why Asian people generally strive for a more porcelain/rubber look for our face.</li>
            <li> So this so far is my perfect make-up formula especially for dry-flaky/sensitive pale skin Asian people.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using etude house bb creams for a long time now since they offer anti wrinkle properties for a cheap price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just got this and so far i really like it!</li>
            <li> I tried this on a whim, figuring what the heck.&lt;br /&gt;I am very, very fair with a little uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a little bit heavier than I like, but overall it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is by far better than other BB cream I tryed very satisfide.</li>
            <li> In general, I think the beige will look more natural on asian skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> all in one and doesn&#x27;t make my face break out as it&#x27;s not real thick but covers really, really well.  </li>
            <li> So when I use Western products, the foundations are usually either too fair or too orangy for me.</li>
            <li> I normally wouldn&#x27;t use,</li>
            <li> with Etude House: this is the first Korean BB cream that I bought, and overall, it matched my skin color better than what I&#x27;ve used previously.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and requires so little to cover your entire face!</li>
            <li> can&amp;#34;t live without bb cream</li>
            <li> i have combo skin where my cheeks can get super dry and</li>
            <li> The greyish undertone (at least from the sample that I tried) looks perfectly natural for me, leaving my face kind of a shiny rubber-mask kind of look with only a slight lighter shade, which changes color a bit to match my skin shade when it completely oxidizes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white and have fairly light skin, but a lot of bb creams were too white for me.</li>
            <li> how natural it looks on skin while covering every imperfection!</li>
            <li> Also, I was using this first time and for experiment, I stayed for 10 hours and nothing else I did to my face but only this BB Cream.</li>
            <li> I first noticed it in a Korean TV show and later asked a South Korean friend of mine about it.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using BB Cream and believe me I will not go back to foundation</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t melt off in the heat so far!</li>
            <li> Well let me just start off by saying, I am a pale greek woman and this matches my olive toned complexion perfectly and thats incredibly hard to find.</li>
            <li> That is, if I ever, since I recently purchased the Mizon Snail BB Cream which I heard is so much better, and I&#x27;ve tried the Skin 79 Snail BB sample and the snail element does tighten/compact my skin much better, although after I wash it off it seems to leave my skin with red dots that seem to prelude breakouts (I haven&#x27;t really broken out yet while using the Skin 79 Snail sample</li>
            <li> The bottom line is usually, if you are Caucasian, generally speaking Western products probably work better for you, if you are Asian, Asian products probably work better for you.</li>
            <li> was a little to light</li>
            <li> Another difference with Asian skin type versus Caucasian skin type is that Asian people tend to have much thinner and delicate skin, whereas Caucasian people tend to have much thicker, more thin-hair covered dusty-looking skin.</li>
            <li> sensitive to fragrance</li>
            <li> After trying out a couple of Western BB creams and really liking them, I started to explosively buying and trying out Korean BB creams, which are well advertised</li>
            <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li> When I take this off at night, the next morning I look at my face and it is so much</li>
            <li> really recommend this over the Western BB creams, which are basically just tinted moisturizers and won&#x27;t help with covering blemishes and treating your face.</li>
            <li> It was recommended on one of the subreddits that I frequent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy coverage, but it covers.</li>
            <li> have scarred skin, and acne frequently pops up</li>
            <li> I had always heard Korean BB creams and American BB creams are completely different and this product totally proves that point.</li>
            <li> I am 62 and this cream only made the few wrinkles I do have look dramatically deeper and more pronounced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad because, if it wasn&#x27;t those problems mentioned, I would&#x27;ve loved this product.</li>
            <li> They usually fail with finding a good color with me.</li>
            <li> It is a low cost for a high quality product.</li>
            <li> Now I am going back to my 79 BB cream even though it is more expensive but it will b worth the $.</li>
            <li> but since it&#x27;s probably the only non-organic product in my bathroom, I can live with it.</li>
            <li> It would leave my skin  looking dry and it did not provide much coverage.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot, it does dry really fast</li>
            <li> Only a week of using this product, my cheeks became saggy, causing my pores to become noticeably large.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not using it on my whole face but only on my eye lids since it shimmers.</li>
            <li> My Asian peers who saw me complimented me that I have \\&quot;flawless skin\\&quot; when in fact I have pretty terrible skin but was wearing the BB cream</li>
            <li> First, I found that the fragrance was a bit strong and old-lady-ish... like fake flowers or something.  </li>
            <li> my face became soft and white and no black spots or wrinkles</li>
            <li> I wear this cream on top of Olay sensitive skin Moisturizer AND Hydroxatone, and it still gives me flaky lines in excessively dry and dull areas on my face.</li>
            <li> because this is half BB cream, half foundation, it is my favorite BB cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more dewy than the average bb cream, but it doesn&#x27;t look greasy or anything like that.</li>
            <li> Barely feel it on my skin once blended</li>
            <li> Also, my younger nieces do not think I look &amp;#34;sickly&amp;#34; anymore with no makeup on!&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my skin is also fairly sensitive, and I have not had a problem with this cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy but gives me enough coverage that I&#x27;m not worried about it wearing off throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It does a great job covering freckles or minor skin discoloration but not a great choice for skin that has large pores or signs of age as it will only intensify the negative.</li>
            <li> Slight floral smell at first but will fade before you walk out the door.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell much the difference initially due to the lighting of the place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always approach a foundation product with a little skepticism because so many seem so heavy.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little while to oxidize into your skin tone, but the result is pretty.</li>
            <li> I really like this , but unfortunately, it is too light for my skin-makes me look like I have literally white skin.</li>
            <li> But again like I said, Asian BB creams in general don&#x27;t work as well for Caucasian people.</li>
            <li> No grey cast that the Skin79 and Missha BB creams i&#x27;ve tried had</li>
            <li> It &amp;#34;sets&amp;#34; a few minutes after application, and it blends in pretty well with my skin.  </li>
            <li> you first put it on its little white but after 10 minutes</li>
            <li> I really like it, but my only problem is it&#x27;s a slight shade darker than my skin-</li>
            <li> However, it stays very moist &amp; shiny looking (can feel a little greasy, too)</li>
            <li> I am light skinned so buying anything on the internet is always tough as it tends to always have an orange tint to it.  </li>
            <li> I love how it blends into my skin and makes it look less heavy compared to other makeup.</li>
            <li> Second of all, because the cream is so casually wore over your face, it&#x27;s more on the matte side of the dewy finish.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about that whitening agent in particular, but it hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Must ensure moisturizing prior to application because this will initially accent your dry areas and</li>
            <li> However, when I use my regular moisturizer, the conditioning cream, and the BB cream, The moisturizer keeps my skin from drying out, the Conditioning cream evens my skin tone and provides an absorbant powdery base for the oily bb cream, and the BB cream evens my skin tone and adds a pleasant glow to my face.</li>
            <li> It is difficult for me to find regular foundation light enough to match.  </li>
            <li> This is a very thick BB cream that offers medium-full coverage, depending on how much you use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smell was a little weird, like it was trying to smell nice but ended up smelling strange, if that makes sense</li>
            <li> long just got it</li>
            <li> and I notice it there all day long.</li>
            <li> So to compensate for those not completely covered spots on my face</li>
            <li> I have pale, sensitive skin with a touch a redness on one cheek.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so definitely spend the extra money to get this brand of bb cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s and Garnier&#x27;s bb creams but they were sloppy, greasy, and had minimal coverage and ran out quickly.</li>
            <li> My dry skin loves to soak up oil, so it causes break outs.</li>
            <li> But when I went outside, the ridiculously orange foundation that showed up on my hand was no where NEAR my skin color that surrounds it.</li>
            <li> There is still a slight color difference, but not enough for me to worry about.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very pale and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but I also think that Asian people tend to have dryer skin in general, which with powder and Matte finish make us look even worse because it just gives us aflaky dusted-look, making it really obvious that we are wearing make-up</li>
            <li> A bit thicker and darker than expected.</li>
            <li> Minimal coverage.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re curious what whitening means it&#x27;s for scarring and discoloration</li>
            <li> Asian people, when they are pale (like me), have yellow-ish/beige undertones.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and it was far too dark for me.  </li>
            <li> It was extremely dark and it made my face look flakey and dry.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Bad for my dry cheeks but fabulous for my Tzone.</li>
            <li> Shipping was faster than expected as well!</li>
            <li> so I usually mix it with a tinted moisturizer to add some color and only then apply.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other BB creams this color</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, because I only use one small pump and it covers my skin neatly!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even were any other makeup because it&#x27;&#x27;s all I need!</li>
            <li> I had been using a $50 BB Cream, in a tube half the size of this one....</li>
            <li> I use much less of this than I did with the Cover Girl</li>
            <li> After a few usage, I came to a conclusion that this BB itself is not good since not only it made my skin to break out, it enlarged my pores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little greasy, but that is what they make powder for</li>
            <li> would like to find a little darker shade</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little lighter than my skin color</li>
            <li> it really that hard to send me the product I ordered instead of a fake?</li>
            <li> I literally wear this everyday.</li>
            <li> Even though the cream covers well it does not feel heavy and does not look &amp;</li>
            <li> A few things to consider when you want to purchase this item:</li>
            <li> It never worked with my skin and it felt heavy</li>
            <li> after a few hours, my skin does become oily.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting the scent, and I&#x27;m not a huge fan of fragrance in my face cream.</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid that this would be noticeably too dark, but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> me look pale or like a pancake.</li>
            <li> Too heavy and thick.  </li>
            <li> I usually apply with my Bobbi Brown foundation brush or my fingers.</li>
            <li> Usually it&#x27;s 2 hours.</li>
            <li> I have tried some other creams from big name companies, and had terrible reactions (skin got very hot, red, and/or itchy &amp; painful)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting this foundation for the past 4 years now.</li>
            <li> Caucasian people tend to have pinkish undertones, and they usually tan orangy-like to goldish.</li>
            <li> but I found that it works as a base pretty well</li>
            <li> Not perfect because it accents my dry areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Subtle glow, which i usually don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I could hardly be happier with a product I tried just for the heck of it.</li>
            <li> it is often hard to find something that fits my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I know that some people complained about its overly greyish undertone.</li>
            <li> I have never liked foundation.</li>
            <li> I work as a waitress and at least once a shift one of the ladies I serve compliment me!</li>
            <li> Also, the color selection is poor.  </li>
            <li> It REALLY clogs the pores... terribly.  </li>
            <li> AND it just looks terrible in general, like we&#x27;ve just came out of a dust bowl.</li>
            <li> but boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I have used expensive brands for foundation</li>
            <li> Sadly, though, this BB made me break out.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have blamed this BB for the break outs since not all cosmetics are compatible with my skin and that my skin should be the one to be blamed, however, compatibility of the skin and cosmetic is irrelevant in this case .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lame</li>
            <li> (since I know sometimes the samples/minisets you get might be fake or contaminated).</li>
            <li> They gave me the fake product.</li>
            <li> but i broke out like crazy bc of this product !!!</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Too heavy and thick.  Sits on top of your skin and doesn&#x27;t sink in.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and wash it off.  Also, the color selection is poor.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> perfect bb cream! i really love the texture and how natural it looks on skin while covering every imperfection! my favorite</li>
            <li> I like the product but it will not last all day.  It does a great job of covering anything on my face. I just need it to stay on.</li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of foundations. I have tried all different brands from the most expensive &amp;#34;award winning&amp;#34; celebrity endorsed brands to drug store brands but have never found any that don&#x27;t have that caked on look. Until now. My sister in law brought this back from Korea as a gift and I was pleasantly surprised by how lightly this goes on yet provides a dewy finish and medium coverage. I am asian but have very fair skin so the light fits me well. In general, I think the beige will look more natural on asian skin. All in all, very satified with the product. .</li>
            <li> This BB cream is by far better than other BB cream I tryed very satisfide.</li>
            <li> love the product. And very fast delivery even if i am here in europe. :)</li>
            <li> I really, really like this product! It is a low cost for a high quality product. its department store quailty for a drug store price.&lt;br /&gt;It gives a good coverage and makes my bare skin look healthier; I&#x27;ve also noticed less wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;When you first put it on its little white but after 10 minutes or so it combines with your skin for great coverage.&lt;br /&gt;The shade I purchased was a little to light but I use a bronzing powder and it looks great. The next time I order I will order the next shade up.&lt;br /&gt;Will definately be ordering this again!!</li>
            <li> I Love this. I like to wear it to the beach. Its covers up my acne scars really well and it has spf30 in it.</li>
            <li> I loved this for the first few months of usage but i broke out like crazy bc of this product !!!</li>
            <li> I like this BB cream, and will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little greasy, but that is what they make powder for</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but I ended up giving it to my mom because she loved it.  It is very pretty and bright- it makes skin look younger.  I would recommend it, unless you have oily skin, then it will just make your skin more oily by the end of the day/night.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this BB cream to be better than the 79 but boy was I wrong. It would leave my skin  looking dry and it did not provide much coverage. Now I am going back to my 79 BB cream even though it is more expensive but it will b worth the $.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and requires so little to cover your entire face! I would definitely recommend this to others!</li>
            <li> It arrived on time well packaged but as of yet I have not used it but antisipate that I will love it.  I tried it on my hand and am pleased with the color, texture and coverage.</li>
            <li> I used this yesterday, I washed my face, put a lotion then applied this BB Cream after I applied a face primer first. I had red spots, some acnes but this BB Cream just made them gone. This is my first time trying out Etude House&#x27;s BB Cream, and I am so thankful that I bought this BB Cream and using it. It is really milky when you pump it out, but it smoothly covers my face when I apply them onto my face. I use the light beige color, it is a bit whiter than my original skin, but it is just fine. Also, this BB Cream contains 3 effects: it essence your skin, wrinkle improvement, and sun block work. It&#x27;s like BB Cream with everything is inside! Also, I was using this first time and for experiment, I stayed for 10 hours and nothing else I did to my face but only this BB Cream. My skin became a bit oily since I was wearing it for 10 hours and nothing else (I originally have oily face so I was impressed how this BB Cream actually controls my face&#x27;s oil problem). It still looked as good as the time when I put them on, still my face was soft, looking flawless. I am so happy that I have this BB Cream.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price. A bit thicker and darker than expected. But it does last the whole day with better coverage.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t blend well with my skin tone at all. It was extremely dark and it made my face look flakey and dry.</li>
            <li> I love how it blends into my skin and makes it look less heavy compared to other makeup. A little goes a long way, because I only use one small pump and it covers my skin neatly! This is a great foundation if you have fairly light skin.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews regarding this particular product and have found some useful tips when applying this make-up. Using the teensiest amount with a light brushing of a powder helps to make the overall appearance more natural. It takes years off my appearance and gives my skin a nice even tone. My favorite part is the spf quality, as it will help prevent any sun damage.</li>
            <li> This is so blend-able and moisturizing! All of the protective qualities make it a summer staple. I love how it gives a dewy glow to the skin.</li>
            <li> I didnt like this product.  I am very pale and it was far too dark for me.  The one thing i do like is that it is truly full coverage.  It gives a dewey finish that you see in asian bb creams, andI do love that.  I just wish there was a lighter option, but this is as light as it goes.</li>
            <li> I literally wear this everyday. It looks amazing on. It provides just the right amount of coverage and luminosity to make your skin look healthy. If I want a bit more coverage I just mix my favorite full coverage foundation into this and apply. I usually apply with my Bobbi Brown foundation brush or my fingers. I think it looks best when stippled and buffed in with a brush. If you are oily you may want to top with a powder as this BB cream is very moisturizing. Since using this product my coworkers have commented that my skin always looks so healthy. I love it! I will definitely repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit about my skin:&lt;br /&gt;Age 30&lt;br /&gt;Fair complexion&lt;br /&gt;Combination oily/dry&lt;br /&gt;Mild red patches&lt;br /&gt;Not sensitive to fragrance</li>
            <li> This product is everything I wanted in a BB Cream. It gives better coverage than the average BB cream, while still feeling light. I have also noticed that when I am not wearing the BB cream my skin appears more even and this BB cream did not break me out. Shipping was faster than expected as well! Overall great product and experience with the seller, I will definitely be purchasing the product again.</li>
            <li> i have combo skin where my cheeks can get super dry and my T-zone VERY oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Even coverage; however, i do have to work quickly before it dries to a powder/matte finish working on one area at a time&lt;br /&gt;- Barely feel it on my skin once blended&lt;br /&gt;- Subtle glow, which i usually don&#x27;t like but for some reason can tolerate it and sometimes like it with this cream&lt;br /&gt;- Build-able on the spot concealing&lt;br /&gt;- No grey cast that the Skin79 and Missha BB creams i&#x27;ve tried had (but there&#x27;s more of a pearly white cast that i think has to do with the intention for a dewy look)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Must ensure moisturizing prior to application because this will initially accent your dry areas and the product itself isn&#x27;t very moisturizing even as the day goes on. Bad for my dry cheeks but fabulous for my Tzone. i actually stay matte for about 6 hours at work before I even have to blot. Usually it&#x27;s 2 hours. i know, it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;- Slight floral smell at first but will fade before you walk out the door. Unlike the MIssha brand which was overpowering scent which make sense if you look at all the ingredients the Perfect Cover BB cream has&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall i rate it 4.5 because i end up using it daily and i look good. Not perfect because it accents my dry areas.</li>
            <li> I tried this on a whim, figuring what the heck.&lt;br /&gt;I am very, very fair with a little uneven skin tone.  It is difficult for me to find regular foundation light enough to match.  I was a little afraid that this would be noticeably too dark, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It &amp;#34;sets&amp;#34; a few minutes after application, and it blends in pretty well with my skin.  There is still a slight color difference, but not enough for me to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;It offers a medium to full coverage and can be layered a bit for a little more coverage under the eyes and on blemishes.  It&#x27;s more coverage than I thought, and more than I have found with other BB or CC creams.  However, it stays very moist &amp; shiny looking (can feel a little greasy, too) and that may bother some.  I like to use this when I just want to quickly throw on my face to do errands and such, and I use a light dusting of powder after it sets.  It looks more dewy that way, instead of just shiny.&lt;br /&gt;This also has a whitening agent, and I have to say that I have noticed my skin tone is more even than it had ever been before.  I&#x27;ve been using this about 2 months now, maybe 2-3 times a week.  I am more comfortable now going without makeup (foundation) around the house since the improvement in my skin, whereas I used to get up and put my face on immediately.  Also, my younger nieces do not think I look &amp;#34;sickly&amp;#34; anymore with no makeup on!&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my skin is also fairly sensitive, and I have not had a problem with this cream.  I was a little nervous about that whitening agent in particular, but it hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation at all.  I have tried some other creams from big name companies, and had terrible reactions (skin got very hot, red, and/or itchy &amp; painful) but nothing at all with this since day 1.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I could hardly be happier with a product I tried just for the heck of it.</li>
            <li> I really like this , but unfortunately, it is too light for my skin-makes me look like I have literally white skin. It does feel very nice and makes my skin feel so soft. would like to find a little darker shade</li>
            <li> I have used expensive brands for foundation but I like this BB cream so much better than the other brands I have used. It covers everything I want covered and it feels so smooth. It also has a light feeling so you don&#x27;t feel like you are wearing a mask.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency and the fact that this BB Cream has a pretty high coverage for a BB Cream without looking cakey. As I am very fair skinned it is often hard to find something that fits my skin tone. The lightest shade is just a very very little bit too dark in Winter, but just perfect in Summer, when this gets most of its use.&lt;br /&gt;Also the package came with a lot of very nice little samples and shipping time was fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love it! Such an amazing product. Thank you! I am really happy. I am going to repurchase when I run out of it.</li>
            <li> I thought this product looked VERY nice on my skin, but it is definitely NOT good for the skin. It REALLY clogs the pores... terribly.  My face started breaking out after the second day I used it.  I just threw it away.</li>
            <li> product arrived quick and it is very silky when applying. Gives you a flawless look. Gave it a 4 stars becasue I haven&#x27;t worned it long just got it but so far really good!!</li>
            <li> I am light skinned so buying anything on the internet is always tough as it tends to always have an orange tint to it.  This BB cream is the best I&#x27;ve tried and I will be sticking to this.  I love how it&#x27;s a anti wrinkle, spf 30 (which doesn&#x27;t make my face break out or oily) etc. all in one and doesn&#x27;t make my face break out as it&#x27;s not real thick but covers really, really well.  I have tried Skin 79 VIP Gold Collection Super Beblesh Balm and that covered good but seemed to make me break out and was a bit on the thick side.  I won&#x27;t buy any BB cream from the states as they just don&#x27;t seem to know what they&#x27;re doing and Korea does.  Love this product and price!</li>
            <li> Very good for my skin!</li>
            <li> First of all, this BB cream was delivered super fast! So I&#x27;m happy with the sender. Another thing I like about this BB is the color of it. I have fair skin so the 02 light beige covers perfectly on my skin. I also like how it has a full coverage. Sadly, though, this BB made me break out. I wouldn&#x27;t have blamed this BB for the break outs since not all cosmetics are compatible with my skin and that my skin should be the one to be blamed, however, compatibility of the skin and cosmetic is irrelevant in this case . After a few usage, I came to a conclusion that this BB itself is not good since not only it made my skin to break out, it enlarged my pores. Only a week of using this product, my cheeks became saggy, causing my pores to become noticeably large.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not using it on my whole face but only on my eye lids since it shimmers. It makes my eyes brighter as if I&#x27;m using a highlighter.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I don&#x27;t think I want to purchase this product again in the future. I&#x27;m so sad because, if it wasn&#x27;t those problems mentioned, I would&#x27;ve loved this product.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot, it does dry really fast so you need to put it on in sections but I found that it works as a base pretty well and I have the lightest color and I am fairly fair skinned and it worked well for me colorwise too, I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is wonderful for a summer foundation with SPF.  It&#x27;s light and non-greasy.  A little bit goes a long way.  And gives total coverage of the face.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Not oily or thick, pump lid is great. The coverage is wonderful, the colors are abit lighter. I normally am between porclein and light beigh, this light beigh is really light, I had to add bronzer on top but can&#x27;t say enough how much I enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> I love anything from Etude House, and their BB Cream is nothing different. I really like it, but my only problem is it&#x27;s a slight shade darker than my skin- and that&#x27;s when I got the Light Beige! But other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve been to South Korea I know a lot of women use this BB Cream. Personally, it tends to just sit on top of my skin and I notice it there all day long. It isn&#x27;t my favorite BB Cream but it isn&#x27;t horrible. I use this when I just feel like switching around skin products or I use it with my skin79.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the Etude House Conditioning Cream. I tried to use this for a day without the conditioning cream, and then the next day I used just the conditioning cream. I have very pale and sensitive skin, that is prone to dryness, redness, and flakeyness. The BB cream on its own is a bit too oily for my skin. My dry skin loves to soak up oil, so it causes break outs. However, when I use my regular moisturizer, the conditioning cream, and the BB cream, The moisturizer keeps my skin from drying out, the Conditioning cream evens my skin tone and provides an absorbant powdery base for the oily bb cream, and the BB cream evens my skin tone and adds a pleasant glow to my face. I have gotten SO many compliments on my complexion since using this skincare system. I work as a waitress and at least once a shift one of the ladies I serve compliment me! A little goes a long way, so definitely spend the extra money to get this brand of bb cream. I&#x27;ve tried L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s and Garnier&#x27;s bb creams but they were sloppy, greasy, and had minimal coverage and ran out quickly.</li>
            <li> I learned about this product in an indirect manner.  I first noticed it in a Korean TV show and later asked a South Korean friend of mine about it.  She has beautiful skin, and as it turns out, this is her favorite &#x27;make-up&#x27; product.  I&#x27;ve always approach a foundation product with a little skepticism because so many seem so heavy.  This is actually light weight, never greasy, and covers imperfections nicely.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many people have commented on my &amp;#34;luminous face&amp;#34; since I&#x27;ve begun using it.  I absolutely love this BB Cream and will keep using it!</li>
            <li> super light and natural look:) Covers my pimple and freckles:) I also love the flavor:) a little whitish when first applied, but it will go away as time goes on:)</li>
            <li> I did like the texture and coverage of the BB cream.  The brightener is too light for my complexion.  The cream covers with just one application and does not shine.  Even though the cream covers well it does not feel heavy and does not look &amp;#34;caked on&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like the cream.  The next order I will not get the Bright.</li>
            <li> I had always heard Korean BB creams and American BB creams are completely different and this product totally proves that point. I&#x27;m never using another American BB cream again. This stuff is great. Great coverage, makes my skin look great by the end of the day, and doesn&#x27;t clump or cake or crack.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting this foundation for the past 4 years now. The only one I buy now. It makes your skin super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t even buy from the U.S anymore all Korea baby best BB cream i&#x27;ve ever had etude house you&#x27;ve done good</li>
            <li> i have been useing this item for 3 years. i like BB creamy because it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Initially this is too dark for my skin (NC15 in MAC, for reference), but after oxidizing (about 10-15 minutes) the color is perfect. If you use too much, you may experience some chalkiness in the tone. Also, if I get it on my eyebrows they look like I&#x27;ve gone gray.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Dr Jart (Sephora) and samples of the Urban Decay/Stila/Smashbox/etc BB creams, and I would say this gives you the best value. It is very comparable in quality and color.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using BB Cream and believe me I will not go back to foundation, I actually have the 3 shades Light Beige, Natural Beige and Honey Beige, I have receive compliments on how good my skin looks now. Totally recomended.</li>
            <li> The product pictured is NOT what I received - I got the &amp;#34;blooming fit&amp;#34; rather than the &amp;#34;bright fit&amp;#34; that I wanted and have always loved.  Everything else (Etude House, bb cream, lightest shade) was the same.&lt;br /&gt;Is it really that hard to send me the product I ordered instead of a fake?</li>
            <li> I love it.  Go Etude House!</li>
            <li> I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it. I wasn&#x27;t expecting the scent, and I&#x27;m not a huge fan of fragrance in my face cream. It&#x27;s also a little bit heavier than I like, but overall it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> Color works well for me, not to overly dewy, and can be mattified with some powder.</li>
            <li> I use this foundation because it makes my skin look flawless and beautifully healthy. I am American and I have to say I prefer this Korean makeup even to Clinique or Lancome!</li>
            <li> Excellent highly recommended</li>
            <li> After trying out a couple of Western BB creams and really liking them, I started to explosively buying and trying out Korean BB creams, which are well advertised and I mainly want to try them for finding a better color for me since I&#x27;m East/Oriental Asian. Western foundations in general do not have good skin color matches for Asian people, since we don&#x27;t have the same kind of skin undertone with Caucasian people, to whom Western products primarily target. Asian people, when they are pale (like me), have yellow-ish/beige undertones. And we don&#x27;t tan the same way either, we tend to tan beige to brownish. Caucasian people tend to have pinkish undertones, and they usually tan orangy-like to goldish. So when I use Western products, the foundations are usually either too fair or too orangy for me. I&#x27;ve also been to places like Macy&#x27;s where people help you to find foundations that match your skin color best by trying them out on your hand. They usually fail with finding a good color with me. This Asian lady who works there pulled out this foundation she said is perfect for Asian colors (she looks horrible in it herself though) and swapped it on my hand. I couldn&#x27;t tell much the difference initially due to the lighting of the place. But when I went outside, the ridiculously orange foundation that showed up on my hand was no where NEAR my skin color that surrounds it. Another difference with Asian skin type versus Caucasian skin type is that Asian people tend to have much thinner and delicate skin, whereas Caucasian people tend to have much thicker, more thin-hair covered dusty-looking skin. This means that Asian people tend to look best under dewy finish make-up, whereas Caucasian people tend to look best under matte finish make-up. And guess what most Western foundations are? That&#x27;s right! MATTE. I don&#x27;t know for sure but I also think that Asian people tend to have dryer skin in general, which with powder and Matte finish make us look even worse because it just gives us aflaky dusted-look, making it really obvious that we are wearing make-up AND it just looks terrible in general, like we&#x27;ve just came out of a dust bowl. That&#x27;s why Asian people generally strive for a more porcelain/rubber look for our face. So these things are to be kept in mind when you are trying Eastern versus Western products. The bottom line is usually, if you are Caucasian, generally speaking Western products probably work better for you, if you are Asian, Asian products probably work better for you. But of course there are lots of individual variations so if you have the resources, time and money obviously you should explore both to find your best match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with Etude House: this is the first Korean BB cream that I bought, and overall, it matched my skin color better than what I&#x27;ve used previously. The color is still on the lighter side so I guess if I purchased Natural Beige it would&#x27;ve been fine too. It did not break me out, and gives you a pretty good shine, not so shiny so not like if you are wearing a highlighter. The coverage is actually really great--it&#x27;s medium to full coverage. I have many post-acne red and sunspots on my face and after patting this cream over my face they&#x27;ve all disappeared, leaving my face flawless looking in terms of smooth spread. A few things to consider when you want to purchase this item: One is that, like many other reviewers have said, it comes off really really easily, which I don&#x27;t like because I prefer a cream that absorbs and into your skin and dries a bit and compacts so you don&#x27;t have to worry too much about getting it over your clothes when you are wearing it (Vichy is much better from this aspect). Second of all, because the cream is so casually wore over your face, it&#x27;s more on the matte side of the dewy finish. This means that, on your skin areas that are much hydrated and smooth, Etude House BB creams goes over great and gives a good dewy shine. But on the areas that are dryer and flakier, this BB creamwould not hydrate it and it would end up giving those areas a more dusty-look. I wear this cream on top of Olay sensitive skin Moisturizer AND Hydroxatone, and it still gives me flaky lines in excessively dry and dull areas on my face. Then I purchased Skin 79 BB cream mini-set, and I discovered Skin 79&#x27;s VIP Gold BB cream which I wear on top of Skin Moisturizer and Hydroxatone. That cream is much more compact and dewy finish, but only medium coverage of my spots. So to compensate for those not completely covered spots on my face I use Etude House BB cream like a concealer--It&#x27;s lame I know but believe me, Etude House BB Cream works perfectly for a finish-touch powder/concealer. It blends into the Skin 79 BB cream really well, leaving my face flawless looking. So this so far is my perfect make-up formula especially for dry-flaky/sensitive pale skin Asian people. If you are one you should give the formula a try. You don&#x27;t have to buy Hydroxatone of course but just make sure that you use some skin product that would first leave your skin completely hydrated and silky before you use either Etude House or Skin 79-which I prefer. I haven&#x27;t yet purchased the real 40g Skin 79 VIP Gold so I want to hold off a review on that one until I do (since I know sometimes the samples/minisets you get might be fake or contaminated). That is, if I ever, since I recently purchased the Mizon Snail BB Cream which I heard is so much better, and I&#x27;ve tried the Skin 79 Snail BB sample and the snail element does tighten/compact my skin much better, although after I wash it off it seems to leave my skin with red dots that seem to prelude breakouts (I haven&#x27;t really broken out yet while using the Skin 79 Snail sample so that&#x27;s at least good news). So I hope Mizon Snail BB Cream would give me a much better skin-care package and make my face more dewy and hydrated, and basically, more flawless-looking skin. So I&#x27;m still searching!!! I will give updates on how that turned on in my future reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would not purchase Etude House again, but I probably will eventually purchase the Skin 79 VIP Gold BB Cream. For those of you who have similar kind of skin as mine I would recommend that you try the Skin 79 one over Etude House. I know that some people complained about its overly greyish undertone. But again like I said, Asian BB creams in general don&#x27;t work as well for Caucasian people. The greyish undertone (at least from the sample that I tried) looks perfectly natural for me, leaving my face kind of a shiny rubber-mask kind of look with only a slight lighter shade, which changes color a bit to match my skin shade when it completely oxidizes. My Asian peers who saw me complimented me that I have \\&quot;flawless skin\\&quot; when in fact I have pretty terrible skin but was wearing the BB cream but they didn&#x27;t seem to notice that whatsoever :)</li>
            <li> The best makeup out there, we were in Korea for 2 years and I rely on this BB cream!!  It lasts for a very long time, and has some AMAZING coverage!!  I will continue to use!</li>
            <li> Just got this and so far i really like it! I have sensitive acne prone skin and  it hasn&#x27;t caused me any problems/made me break out yet. A lot of BB creams are too gray but this one matches my skin pretty well. Recommend~!</li>
            <li> I have never liked foundation. It never worked with my skin and it felt heavy so I never wanted to wear it to school or work. When I heard about BB creams in South Korea I decided to give them a chance and chose Etude House because I&#x27;d seen someone online say they really loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I looove this stuff. I have rosacea and breakouts and this BB cream really helps to hide them. When I first started using it, it did seem to just highlight dry areas and my acne, but then I found a good moisturizer to put on at night and that took care of the dry problems. As far as my acne, nothing can perfectly hide that stuff, but what I really love about this BB cream is that it&#x27;s helped my skin become clearer. When I take this off at night, the next morning I look at my face and it is so much clearer.&lt;br /&gt;I feel comfortable wearing this anywhere. You use literally one squirt for your whole face and blend it out. It&#x27;s not heavy but gives me enough coverage that I&#x27;m not worried about it wearing off throughout the day. Most days I set with Maybeline&#x27;s Dream Matte Powder because my face tends to get shiny throughout the day, but this brand of BB cream doesn&#x27;t add much shine and I sometimes go without the powder.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this over the Western BB creams, which are basically just tinted moisturizers and won&#x27;t help with covering blemishes and treating your face.</li>
            <li> They gave me the fake product. Even the bottle is different from the picture. I wish I can take the picture of this bb cream for everyone can see.</li>
            <li> It covers my blemishes great. Price is worth it. Very easy to layer coverage but you have to be fast as it dries quickly and use a scrubbing cleanser to help remove it at night. After several weeks of use, my skin looks and feels firmer.</li>
            <li> I had been using a $50 BB Cream, in a tube half the size of this one....was on a mission to find a replacement BB that felt as good, looked as good and provided the coverage that I need. I am impressed by this product!!!! It is every bit as good as the more expensive BB.</li>
            <li> Well let me just start off by saying, I am a pale greek woman and this matches my olive toned complexion perfectly and thats incredibly hard to find. It literally takes one pump to do your whole face so dont go crazy with it, glides on to skin smooth no smell, leaves a great finished look. Very very happy</li>
            <li> I am considered as someone with light skin so I ordered the lightest one. At first the BB cream didn&#x27;t match my skin but once I kept using it once or twice, my skin adapted to the color and it matched my skin color perfectly. This is one of the best BB cream I&#x27;ve tried so far. I will order this product again and from the same seller.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation! It covers better than my old one and it leaves my face feeling so smooth! Even blemishes are easily covered. Great product! I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is amazing. it has amazing coverage and makes your skin look natural. i like that it covers my imperfections so there is no need to use concealer. I will definitely repurchase it.</li>
            <li> Really love it...the face look perfect with this bb cream.....</li>
            <li> Even though the writing on that back is not in English, I was not nervous about buying this product at all. Once it arrived, I wanted to try it out right away, but I waited until morning. The color matched my skin very well, and it smells good too. I like this better than any other BB cream product. Plus it is a good deal!</li>
            <li> This bb cream was good. It&#x27;s smell was a little weird, like it was trying to smell nice but ended up smelling strange, if that makes sense lol. It takes a little while to oxidize into your skin tone, but the result is pretty. It moisturizes well. It&#x27;s a little more dewy than the average bb cream, but it doesn&#x27;t look greasy or anything like that. I&#x27;d say if you have oily skin, be careful and make sure to use a powder with this. The coverage was medium. It will conceal most things but not all. After about 7-8 hours of wear, it wore off a bit with the concealing and dewy look, so I don&#x27;t think this would be ideal if you have to go out for 7+ hours, unless you have decent skin already lol. I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s the bb cream for me, but it&#x27;s still a good product as a whole. :)</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.  It was recommended on one of the subreddits that I frequent.  Unfortunately, I found that it wasn&#x27;t the best BB cream I&#x27;ve ever tried.  First, I found that the fragrance was a bit strong and old-lady-ish... like fake flowers or something.  Then, I found that it didn&#x27;t blend very well.  It remained powdery/grainy looking on my face and accentuated the lines and pores that I have instead of covering them...  It did NOT cause me to break out or anything, though.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a counterfeit product or if that&#x27;s just how the product is, but I switched to a different BB cream (from Ponds) that I like a lot better...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Makes my skin look clear and flawless and at the end of the day, my skin still looks beautiful, not greasy.  The only downside is this product comes from Korea and takes weeks to arrive.  But well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best BB cream I have ever tried. Nothing like the liquidy BB creams here in the US which only provide light coverage. This is a very thick BB cream that offers medium-full coverage, depending on how much you use. It is my go-to product for every day. I also love the SPF 30.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT non-comedogenic, which means it WILL clog your pores. I liked the results of using it enough, until I started getting big ol&#x27; blackheads on places of my face I never had them before. I&#x27;d rather wear NO make-up than have blackheads or scars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product and very cool tightens the skin from the first use and after a month I felt  my face became soft and white and no black spots or wrinkles</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bb cream i have tried so far and it got to me really fast when i ordered it, i will definetly buy it again.</li>
            <li> Decent coverage (though you would want to use a concealer for something more than light freckles) and perfect tone for my caucasian friend (very pale with blue eyes)</li>
            <li> i have oily/combination skin, i recommend having a setting power or oil control powder over it around T zone area. and maybe touch up with blotting paper, then setting powder about every 4 hours or so.  it makes my skin look so natural and flawless, a little goes a long way. great for people who wants to look natural/ light make up. the packaging is so cute and the pump is definitely a plus :)</li>
            <li> I like this cream a lot. It&#x27;s a little lighter than my skin color so I usually mix it with a tinted moisturizer to add some color and only then apply. It offers very good coverage and isn&#x27;t greasy once absorbs. Good job that I can&#x27;t read Korean because I am pretty sure it contains a lot of questionsble ingredents I normally wouldn&#x27;t use, but since it&#x27;s probably the only non-organic product in my bathroom, I can live with it.</li>
            <li> Light weight and matches perfectly!</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned (and caucasian) and I purchased the light beige color. It covers acne marks very well and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.&lt;br /&gt;The acne marks have faded more quickly with this product than with different BB creams.&lt;br /&gt;This product also gives my skin a dewy appearance, which I like ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can look chalky if not blended well, so I have invested in a beauty blender and I will see how that goes.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using etude house bb creams for a long time now since they offer anti wrinkle properties for a cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;this one is very nice, the coverage is natural and gives a good natural healthy look.&lt;br /&gt;I can&amp;#34;t live without bb cream and i find this one perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the best BB cream I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;smoothing and moisturizing. Unlike the other BB creams this color doesnt&#x27;make me look pale or like a pancake. I really recommend it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Took a while to arrive in the mail, about two weeks after Amazon said it shipped.  Seller does not provide a tracking number.  The product itself is very good.  I have pale, sensitive skin with a touch a redness on one cheek.  This product goes a long way, and is a nice option for when I dont want to put on foundation.  It feels light on the skin, and doesnt cause breakouts.  Also, the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already begun using it. I get really good coverage and dont need to put on tons of concealer anymore. The only thing is that is that it can look a tiny bit shiny, so I use a finishing powder and then I&#x27;m all set. Works better than any BB creams that I&#x27;ve tried from the US.</li>
            <li> because this is half BB cream, half foundation, it is my favorite BB cream. It&#x27;s not heavy coverage, but it covers. It looks natural and provides a nice silky sheen that provides a glow. I&#x27;m very happy with it!!! I will be ordering more of this. After trying many bb creams, this is my favorite and the only one I will reorder, because the color is great for me. I&#x27;m white and have fairly light skin, but a lot of bb creams were too white for me. But this is my favorite one &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I am 62 and this cream only made the few wrinkles I do have look dramatically deeper and more pronounced. It does a great job covering freckles or minor skin discoloration but not a great choice for skin that has large pores or signs of age as it will only intensify the negative.</li>
            <li> Perfectly full coverage, great natural-looking finish. Doesn&#x27;t melt off in the heat so far! Such a huge fan of Etude house products!!</li>
            <li> Minimal coverage. The scent is pretty strong. after a few hours, my skin does become oily.</li>
            <li> After over 6 years of using Cover Girl foundation I finally got the courage to try BB Cream, and I&#x27;m so glad I decided to go with this one!&lt;br /&gt;I have scarred skin, and acne frequently pops up but this BB Cream had no problems with coverage. I use much less of this than I did with the Cover Girl foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels light and airy similar to a sunscreen lotion the scent is floral like popuri it&#x27;s not too strong and fades as the day progresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a full day of wear the BB Cream held up much better than my old foundation (without primer!) and I couldn&#x27;t be more than happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also! If you&#x27;re curious what whitening means it&#x27;s for scarring and discoloration it will NOT bleach your skin.</li>
            <li> best BB cream in the worldüòöüëç</li>
            <li> I ordered this one after running out of the one I brought in Korea. They are TOTALLY DIFFERENT.</li>
            <li> Works great with my skin tone. Blends amazingly. Dosent even feel like you have anything on. I don&#x27;t even were any other makeup because it&#x27;&#x27;s all I need! Has a light scent that is fresh and not too overpowering. Will DEFINITELY be buying again! &amp;#60;3</li>
    </ol>
