            <li>I liked it...</li>
            <li>/&gt;We are happy to have re-discovered this soap, some may think the smell is strong  and too medicinal, we think its refreshing.</li>
            <li>it is a very wonderful soap for me as my skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>Uk formula, India formula, some say really strong medicinal smell, others say reminds em of childhood!</li>
            <li>My great great grandmother swore by it and used only it.</li>

            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for selling such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I grow up using this soap, love it</li>
            <li>Costs more to return basically.</li>
            <li>Pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>For my customer at work who could not find it in a store and more I want on line and got it for him</li>
            <li>I have yet to use this product, but I am glad to obtain it because I used this soap before more than 30 years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love the smell of the soap when I opened the box.  </li>
            <li>With an increasing immigrant population in the USA, Lifebuoy soap in bars and liquid form should be available in this country for distribution!</li>
            <li>OTHERWISE OKAY.</li>
            <li>100% authentic Lifebuoy soap made in Cyprus by Unilever.</li>
            <li>so I looked on my favorite web page,</li>
            <li>I ordered the lifebuoy UK formula and my husband said its ok but its not as he remembered it...</li>
            <li>This soap has a really nice smell that&#x27;s clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I received it faster than expected, and I appreciate the excellent service.  </li>
            <li>Frankly, the antibacterial properties are the primary feature of this soap and that&#x27;s why we wanted it, and we love it.</li>
            <li>NOT THE ORIGINAL, FOR SURE.</li>
            <li>Too medicinal, too strong not at all what we remembered.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>While it does not smell precisely as I remember Lifebuoy smelling...</li>
            <li>it was not the original</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it is NOT the soap I remember and love.  </li>
            <li>We usually find this product in the UK, wonderful we can now order it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Nothing like the original to eliminate &amp;#34;B -- O&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It ain&#x27;t nothing like the original.</li>
            <li>The original did not have the carbolic scent .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lamin</li>
            <li>I never got a chance to use the original US made product, but Mom always swore by this stuff, using it as a bath soap and as a shampoo.</li>
            <li>with that doesn&#x27;t clean well at all</li>
            <li>Not bad to buy it once in a while for some dependable soap.</li>
            <li>This is great soap in the bug season of summer; even though the flying pest are still out &amp; about they just don&#x27;t land on you as other perfumed soaps attract them in for a meal of blood</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed showering with it and will probably buy more in the future</li>
            <li>Still a good soap and didn&#x27;t dry my skin,</li>
            <li>/&gt;To get the all important, original main antiseptic carbolic acid, Lifebuoy was known for, I now shall go buy soaps with that name and ingredient!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t even use this, and it isn&#x27;t worth</li>
            <li>Still has that medicinal, fresh smell that I remember and does the job on the ol&#x27; hands.  </li>
            <li>We may keep lookin for one that hits our hot button.&lt;br /&gt;Bill</li>
            <li>I discovered this interesting red soap in a pharmacy in Gibraltar.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of an orange color and not the shiny glycerin looking red that I remember but still not too shabby.  </li>
            <li>lots more pinky red than orangey like the picture and memory.  </li>
            <li>Work for me pretty well.</li>
            <li>I should have done that in the first place.  </li>
            <li>maaaaaybe this would be good for little ones since its so gentle.</li>
            <li>I love the smell its different and very distinctive</li>
            <li>It was also made in Cyprus, so I&#x27;m almost certain this is the old Lifebuoy familiar to some in the states.  </li>
            <li>but I did find the red dye stained my tub very quickly.</li>
            <li>like medicine now rather than like pure naptha aroma.</li>
            <li>this is very much the same as the original soap, my Dad has skin problems and this controls it...</li>
            <li>Price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>and it smells like straight eucalyptus oil.</li>
            <li>Much lather, but no smell remaining on your hands afterwards which I would have preferred if it were the real Lifebuoy.  </li>
            <li>In fact it really smells like something sitting in a urinal being used to freshen the air.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Is conversely extremely gentle though, leaving your hands silky</li>
            <li>what more can you ask for other than a cheaper price????  </li>
            <li>As many other reviewers have noted, this formulation is probably not the one used in the Lifebuoy we recall and used.</li>
            <li>(I soaped my hands three time to get a tiny tad of pork off one finger) and definitely doesn&#x27;t clean or smell like the original Lifebuoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t for everybody, but for those who enjoy a change from the normal American soaps, give Lifebuoy a try.  </li>
            <li>Definitely NOT the old time aroma which was strong on coal tar.</li>
            <li>are the specification from the exterior box: The weight of the soap bar \\&quot;85 g (3 oz)\\&quot;,  making it smaller than regular bars of soap available in the US, but it&#x27;s easy to handle in the shower or next to the sink.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are:</li>
            <li>Our family loves &amp;#34;Christmas Story&amp;#34;, and I thought I was clever to get this soap as a novelty Christmas gift.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t seem to match up with the scents of the two main organic ingredients posted by one reviewer, but that&#x27;s what the soap smells like nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>somehow recall the unique aroma of Lifebuoy soap from when I was a kid, long ago.</li>
            <li>that was a long, long time ago and it is certainly close. :-)</li>
            <li>This soap has such a fresh smell.</li>
            <li>I does okay, seem like there is something missing reason why I bought the carbolic germicidal soap, also I used them both.</li>
            <li>the only redeeming aspect of this is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>Previous purchase had a more clear appearance like glycerin.</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>my skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>Not quite the same as the old soap we remember but pretty close.</li>
            <li>He was at least glad that I purchased it, but won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>The box is cleverly copied, but the scent isn&#x27;t even remotely similar.  </li>
            <li>But, since it doesn&#x27;t have the aroma I was hoping for, and since there are lots of contemporary soaps with scents I do like, I&#x27;ll just go back to using soaps I know</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t stand  the scent, it really works well, and for a very long time, as a freshener for closets or drawers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s as I expected and cleans my sensitive skin gently.  </li>
            <li>Seems to last a long time unlike others that melt away fast.  </li>
            <li>This is one time when I didn&#x27;t review the reviews well enough and missed this listing completely.  </li>
            <li>I quickly placed my order and when it arrived I just knew that I had recovered a piece of my past.  </li>
            <li>He much prefers it to any other.</li>
            <li>It works as well as any other soap, and I didn&#x27;t notice anything special about it other than the scent.  </li>
            <li>the time I was old enough to remember, the only bath soap in our house was LifeBouy.  </li>
            <li>It is the only soap that cures this strange skin condition my Dad has, his doctors give him all sorts of pills and creams but he asked me to order this soap for him and within days his face was almost completely healed.</li>
            <li>this soap though does dry the skin a-bit you do get really clean &amp; are less of a meal table for mosquitoes &amp; other blood suckers&amp;#62;</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it is very refreshing I love the smell its different and very distinctive</li>
            <li> Bought for Mom, she loves this soap.</li>
            <li> I got caught up reading about a by gone era and how folks remember this soap for back in the day.  So I couldn&#x27;t help it, and had to buy some.  The smell &amp;#34;to me&amp;#34; reminded me of the scent you smell in a poor, low rent slum tenement apartment after the hall ways have been cleaned and moped with some cheap industry cleaner.  That the smell of this soap.</li>
            <li> Not quite the same as the old soap we remember but pretty close.</li>
            <li> It is the only soap that cures this strange skin condition my Dad has, his doctors give him all sorts of pills and creams but he asked me to order this soap for him and within days his face was almost completely healed. Seriously.</li>
            <li> it was not the original</li>
            <li> Did tons of research on Lifebouy (LifeBoy). Web sites are confusing as all get out! Uk formula, India formula, some say really strong medicinal smell, others say reminds em of childhood! This formula doesn&#x27;t work well for wife and me. Too medicinal, too strong not at all what we remembered. Maybe it&#x27;s just us and our smellers are getting tired (really don&#x27;t think so), maybe we&#x27;re thinking of another olden days soap, whatever!  We&#x27;d return it but it&#x27;s not worth the hassell. Would not buy this formula again. We may keep lookin for one that hits our hot button.&lt;br /&gt;Bill N Joanie</li>
            <li> sadly, it doesn&#x27;t even smell the same any more since they took the carbolic out.  Still a good soap and didn&#x27;t dry my skin, but I did find the red dye stained my tub very quickly.</li>
            <li> it is a very wonderful soap for me as my skin is very sensitive I know when I was growing up every store had lifebuoy soap&lt;br /&gt;so it is very hard for me to understand why there are no lifebuoy soap for sale in the stores to day my skin is very sensitive&lt;br /&gt;so I am hopping that thois will help me send me your phone number so I can give you my order&lt;br /&gt;THank you Carter Galick 780 826 3923</li>
            <li> Package arrived as scheduled and in great shape.  Lifebuoy soap was part of my childhood and this soap has same odor and consistantcy.  I really enjoyed showering with it and will probably buy more in the future</li>
            <li> This soap smells great!  It works great!  It does not levee A waxy feeling on your skin when you rinse off in the shower!</li>
            <li> I have only used 1 bar but it&#x27;s as I expected and cleans my sensitive skin gently.  Seems to last a long time unlike others that melt away fast.  Smell is not as strong as years ago but still very effective.  Price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> Very good and  smells nice !</li>
            <li> There is not a lot to say about soap. I happen to like this one. I like how it smells and how it feels on my skin. While it does not smell precisely as I remember Lifebuoy smelling... that was a long, long time ago and it is certainly close. :-) My great great grandmother swore by it and used only it. That would be in the 1950s in my memory. She was also using it long before that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not competent to address serious skin conditions and the like but it does help with minor rashes and such. I admit I did not expect it to ring bells or do anything but be a good clean smelling soap; a role it fulfills perfectly. I will be buying more. All I can say is each person is going to have to try things for themselves. Sometimes it will be great and sometimes it will turn out not to be for you. Nothing ventured and all that.</li>
            <li> I discovered this interesting red soap in a pharmacy in Gibraltar.  It was in a cardboard box, with no cellophane wrap.  It was also made in Cyprus, so I&#x27;m almost certain this is the old Lifebuoy familiar to some in the states.  I&#x27;d never smelled anything quite like it, but I bought a few bars to take home as souvenirs.  It works as well as any other soap, and I didn&#x27;t notice anything special about it other than the scent.  I am not sure how to describe the odor, other there might be a hint of pine tar.  It isn&#x27;t for everybody, but for those who enjoy a change from the normal American soaps, give Lifebuoy a try.  If you can&#x27;t stand  the scent, it really works well, and for a very long time, as a freshener for closets or drawers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow up 9/17/2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I placed an order for this soap from this seller.  I received it faster than expected, and I appreciate the excellent service.  Unfortunately, it is NOT the soap I remember and love.  The box is cleverly copied, but the scent isn&#x27;t even remotely similar.  I agree with other reviewers about the confusion over this soap.  I won&#x27;t even use this, and it isn&#x27;t worth the bother to return.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed not same aroma as I was hoping to get that soap was not the authentic brand soap I am used to buy&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for asking I wish I can return them.</li>
            <li> Best soap I have ever used.  Truly makes you &amp;#34;sqweaky clean&amp;#34;!  And it has great antibacterial properties. I will. Buy it again.</li>
            <li> Not what I was wanting. Guess I&#x27;m looking for Lifebuoy Pink. Use to use it in the 70&#x27;s and loved it.</li>
            <li> My husband has been wanting it for a long time, but he thinks the formula was changed. He was at least glad that I purchased it, but won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> We usually find this product in the UK, wonderful we can now order it from Amazon.  This soap has such a fresh smell. My husband loves it.  It does have a tendency to leave a pinky red to be on the shower.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the original to eliminate &amp;#34;B -- O&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I bought this soap to use as a tool to impress upon my son the consequences of lying.He has told me its far and again the absolute worst thing he&#x27;s ever put in his pie hole.Even after brushing his teeth he can still taste this soap.He has quit lying.Thank you Amazon for selling such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> great soap has a nice oder</li>
            <li> Living in Arizona, they don&#x27;t have this soap out here anymore and I remember it from 15 years ago.  Still has that medicinal, fresh smell that I remember and does the job on the ol&#x27; hands.  It&#x27;s more of an orange color and not the shiny glycerin looking red that I remember but still not too shabby.  The soap is a little pricey for a 3 pack but a lot of todays soap are about the same price but inferior to this brand.  Not bad to buy it once in a while for some dependable soap.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, great deodorant soap. Just wish they sold it stores again.</li>
            <li> I received three bars of this stuff in the mail and it&#x27;s definitely not what I expected it to be. for one thing, it&#x27;s color is neon orange instead of red and it smells like straight eucalyptus oil. perhaps I had it confused with a different red soap from my childhood but the only redeeming aspect of this is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. I may find what I&#x27;m looking for in terms of color and fragrance with other carbolic soap brands such as Carib, Island Pride and Blue Power because this particular product is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I grow up using this soap, love it</li>
            <li> I can say that the supplier shipped this item promptly and I received it sooner that expected, but that&#x27;s where my praise ends.&lt;br /&gt;From the time I was old enough to remember, the only bath soap in our house was LifeBouy.  In a nostalgic conversation with a relative not long ago we talked about missing Lifebouy soap in our lives.  I began an internet search for it and this is what I found.  I quickly placed my order and when it arrived I just knew that I had recovered a piece of my past.  Unfortunately, this is not it.  The only resemblance is the color.  For me, this product is just an overpriced fake.  Live and learn.</li>
            <li> Not the smell I remember from 60 years ago.  This one just smells of pine tar and is pretty unpleasant. Much lather, but no smell remaining on your hands afterwards which I would have preferred if it were the real Lifebuoy.  This ad is very mixed up anyway....it actually lists as Lifebuoy buy bills as red carbolic soap whatever that is...so the listing is misleading.  Plus the color is off....lots more pinky red than orangey like the picture and memory.  All in all very disappointed, but I guess I&#x27;m stuck.  Costs more to return basically.</li>
            <li> Sounded like what I have used for years -- but, it was something else. Wierd pink color and totally wrong odor.</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT the old time aroma which was strong on coal tar.I was disappointed. Dave C.</li>
            <li> This soap has a really nice smell that&#x27;s clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband, he likes the antibacterial properties of the soap.  He much prefers it to any other.</li>
            <li> A great Christmas stocking stuffer. Our family loves &amp;#34;Christmas Story&amp;#34;, and I thought I was clever to get this soap as a novelty Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> returned for refund. account was promptly refunded.&lt;br /&gt;sent item back because formula didn&#x27; smell the same as when i was young.&lt;br /&gt;smells like medicine now rather than like pure naptha aroma.</li>
            <li> this is very much the same as the original soap, my Dad has skin problems and this controls it...what more can you ask for other than a cheaper price????  sorry I had to ask</li>
            <li> I just got some from a different source but it was the current lifebuoy. It ain&#x27;t nothing like the original. In fact it really smells like something sitting in a urinal being used to freshen the air.</li>
            <li> This is great soap in the bug season of summer; even though the flying pest are still out &amp; about they just don&#x27;t land on you as other perfumed soaps attract them in for a meal of blood this soap though does dry the skin a-bit you do get really clean &amp; are less of a meal table for mosquitoes &amp; other blood suckers&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Work for me pretty well.</li>
            <li> Not the same product as what was bought before. Previous purchase had a more clear appearance like glycerin.The scent was different as well.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the product.  It appears to have the same fragrance I remember growing up with in the fifties.</li>
            <li> Great!!! For my customer at work who could not find it in a store and more I want on line and got it for him</li>
            <li> this product has been changed from what am used to as a child , growing up in Gambia West Africa. The original did not have the carbolic scent .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lamin</li>
            <li> Great for poison Ivy !</li>
            <li> I does okay, seem like there is something missing reason why I bought the carbolic germicidal soap, also I used them both.</li>
            <li> I have yet to use this product, but I am glad to obtain it because I used this soap before more than 30 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of the soap when I opened the box.  It is still the best soap in the world and it is regretful that this product is non-existent in many of our stores.  With an increasing immigrant population in the USA, Lifebuoy soap in bars and liquid form should be available in this country for distribution!</li>
            <li> Bought this motivated by nostalgia.... somehow recall the unique aroma of Lifebuoy soap from when I was a kid, long ago. As many other reviewers have noted, this formulation is probably not the one used in the Lifebuoy we recall and used. Some have stated there is a pine tar--like scent, my nose smells something like camphor.  These don&#x27;t seem to match up with the scents of the two main organic ingredients posted by one reviewer, but that&#x27;s what the soap smells like nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a soap it&#x27;s fine. A little on the expensive side. But, since it doesn&#x27;t have the aroma I was hoping for, and since there are lots of contemporary soaps with scents I do like, I&#x27;ll just go back to using soaps I know and like, and won&#x27;t be ordering Lifebuoy -- at least not this formula -- again.</li>
            <li> Totally love this vintage product!!!!!</li>
            <li> NOT THE ORIGINAL, FOR SURE. OTHERWISE OKAY.</li>
            <li> 100% authentic Lifebuoy soap made in Cyprus by Unilever. I never got a chance to use the original US made product, but Mom always swore by this stuff, using it as a bath soap and as a shampoo. It&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side, but not too bad in comparison to other premium soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the specification from the exterior box: The weight of the soap bar \\&quot;85 g (3 oz)\\&quot;,  making it smaller than regular bars of soap available in the US, but it&#x27;s easy to handle in the shower or next to the sink.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are: \\&quot;Sodium Palmate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Aqua, Glycerin. Parfum, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Limonene, Linalool, Cl 11680, Cl 45100\\&quot;. The last two are colors FWIW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are happy to have re-discovered this soap, some may think the smell is strong  and too medicinal, we think its refreshing. Frankly, the antibacterial properties are the primary feature of this soap and that&#x27;s why we wanted it, and we love it.</li>
            <li> As a little girl lifebuoy soap was the soap we used.  My husband and I got to talking about products we missed so I looked on my favorite web page, \\&quot;Amazon.com\\&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;and I found it.  I ordered the lifebuoy UK formula and my husband said its ok but its not as he remembered it...I liked it...</li>
            <li> When I was a child, we used the bars of red Lifebuoy.  I wanted to see whether these bars were the same.  They were not.  Fragrance was different, as was the color.</li>
            <li> This is one time when I didn&#x27;t review the reviews well enough and missed this listing completely.  Viewed the Lifebuoy TOTAL item US made by accident instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap smells faintly like Ajax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is conversely extremely gentle though, leaving your hands silky soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with that doesn&#x27;t clean well at all (I soaped my hands three time to get a tiny tad of pork off one finger) and definitely doesn&#x27;t clean or smell like the original Lifebuoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the all important, original main antiseptic carbolic acid, Lifebuoy was known for, I now shall go buy soaps with that name and ingredient!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yep I should have done that in the first place.  My Bad  My Loss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS maaaaaybe this would be good for little ones since its so gentle.</li>
