            <li>Absolutely love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of all Biolage products but this literally made me run to wash it off after applying it.  </li>

            <li>Isn&#x27;t it grand when you come upon a product like this?  </li>
            <li>Blessings, Cookie  :)</li>
            <li>received it as a gift and love it.</li>
            <li>Love the clean scent!</li>
            <li>This body balm is wonderful and I would suggest it to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li>The lotion does its job - as far as a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic, definitely my favorite lotion</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s god a good texture and feels great on my super dry hands!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and creamy and easily absorbs into the skin leaving a hydrated luster, and the scent is just a clean refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>The scent is heavenly... nice and clean, smells like a crisp salon and feels like a treat to use.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and does not leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I have filled a travel size container for my purse.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>It quickly absorbs leaving skin smooth and even a bit glowing.  </li>
            <li>Bought it as a gift for my brother, who was very well pleased.</li>
            <li>But hey, the tube will last you a good 12 months.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice soft odor and absorbs quickly into the skin without having to rub it in for hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells so fresh and clean, not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>so the skin absorbs it quickly</li>
            <li>I find it even more valuable in maintaing soft, smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very Hydrating and leaves your skin feeling extremely smooth.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling fresh and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It is as good as any other I have tried.</li>
            <li>It blends right in and has no smell.  </li>
            <li>The quality is far superior than the creams found in your local pharmacy.</li>
            <li>and my skin is very soft and smooth after use.</li>
            <li>The skin on my neck burns and turns bright red and turns into a rash if I&#x27;m not careful about what I put on my skin, or if I put nothing on my skin.</li>
            <li>I tried it more recently on one of my dogs &#x27;w/a skin condition&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I love this product simply for the smell!!!!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend first got this as a gift from some costumers that he knows from his work.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to most scented products even Items scented with essential oils.</li>
            <li>When I see I&#x27;m coming down to the end of the container&#x27;s content, I always order MORE!  </li>
            <li>In fact, it&#x27;s better than any product I&#x27;ve ever used for dry skin at any age and now as a Senior</li>
            <li>care so much.  </li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>Even then, it absorbed SO well and makes my skin so extremely soft.</li>
            <li>Because it really works.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Biolage line of skincare products.  </li>
            <li>It makes my shin nice and soft and absolutely no oily feeling.  </li>
            <li>but it definitely is to me and my experience with normal cheap lotions like jergens and vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the normal fresh scent of the Biolage line - it&#x27;s got that old lotion smell.  </li>
            <li>Very watery unlike what I normally buy at the retail stores</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly reccommend this product.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>This HAD to be a five year old product - it smells absolutely putrid.  </li>
            <li>I live in AZ and there is no moisture in the air</li>
            <li>I joked with him to tell them not to give him such fancy gifts because he wouldn&#x27;t want me to fall in love with these products and would end up having to buy me more of these expensive brand names for me when I ran out.</li>
            <li>One day a young salesman at the department store suggested this new &#x27;package deal&#x27;to me.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy it in salons around town but its become hard to find.</li>
            <li>but I am not convinced that it is any better than any other body lotion for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Also if you buy it in a store he price per tube is at least $5 more than I paid from the seller at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I feel soft and moisturized all day after I put it on.</li>
            <li>I thought the lotion would smell like Biolage but this lotion smells old.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft tho.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and silky without a sticky feeling or residue to come off on my clothing.</li>
            <li>Just got my new order of this stuff from Amazon today, thank goodness; I wasn&#x27;t sure how long I could get my other one to last.</li>
            <li>The only issue is that it is not thick at all.</li>
            <li>I ordered several for Christmas gifts; they arrived early, undamaged and as advertised.</li>
            <li>I would use barely any and spread it all over my body because I regretted the day that it would run out.</li>
            <li>It goes light but works on dry skin as a heavy moisturizer would.  </li>
            <li>My skin is pretty dry, VERY dry in some spots and irritated by almost any lotion.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use it several times a day but generally once in the morning is all that is needed.  </li>
            <li>IT MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL SO SOFT AND GETS RID OF DRY SCALY LOOK.</li>

            <li> I am not generally a lotion person.</li>
            <li> Having no major use for it, he gave it to me.</li>
            <li> After using it daily for about a week my dry skin was gone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product, Biolage Hydrating Body Balm for Dry Skin for several years.  </li>
            <li> The only issue that I had with it is that is smells sort of old - I must have received lotion past</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have that sticky feeling all summer long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product as long as I can remember (at least10-15 years or so) and will never use another.  </li>
            <li> As long as you continue to make it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for a long time now, I will never go back to the plain REGULAR lotion!!!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I use it every day from head to toe when I get out of the shower to keep from having dry skin.</li>
            <li> YOU SHOULD TRY THIS LOTION IF YOU HAVE DRY SKIN.</li>
            <li> Complete disappointment as I&#x27;d used this product for years and knew what to expect - that completely fresh, not overpowering smell of just coming out of the salon.  </li>
            <li> Very little of the cream is needed to completely cover</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry skin &amp; this is a \\&quot;dream come</li>
            <li> I had severely itchy skin on my arms and very dry skin on my legs.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I also found that a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was on sale or if it was the regular price from this seller</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really scented so I would recommend it for men and women!</li>
            <li> cant wear, has a smell other than the &amp;#34;biolage&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and usually requires a lot of product, but not with this one.</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding the product again, until I came to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very thick and works well for dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> But after all else failed, I tried it on my &#x27;very dry&#x27; legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky because I hate when lotion leaves you feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> but it is watery thin.</li>
            <li> Smelled like an old bottle of some terrible lotion.</li>

            <li> Not as the product was supposed to smell. Smelled like an old bottle of some terrible lotion. Not biplane lotion at all.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way. It goes light but works on dry skin as a heavy moisturizer would.  It quickly absorbs leaving skin smooth and even a bit glowing.  I bought this product because I like the Biolage line of hair care so much.  The lotion has a similar scent.  For the price, you can&#x27;t get a better product, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The lotion does its job - as far as a great moisturizer.  The only issue that I had with it is that is smells sort of old - I must have received lotion past it&#x27;s expiration.  It doesn&#x27;t have the normal fresh scent of the Biolage line - it&#x27;s got that old lotion smell.  Sad.</li>
            <li> I love this body lotion! I have dry skin AND I hate lotions that leave my skin feeling sticky. This body balm is wonderful and I would suggest it to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry skin &amp; this is a \\&quot;dream come true\\&quot;....!!!  My skin just feels like silk!!!!  I will be purchasing more of this!</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream because a friend suggested it.  I had severely itchy skin on my arms and very dry skin on my legs.  After using it daily for about a week my dry skin was gone.  It did alleviate the itch somewhat but I think that part of the problem is allergies.  Very little of the cream is needed to completely cover and my skin is very soft and smooth after use. I sometimes use it several times a day but generally once in the morning is all that is needed.  I live in AZ and there is no moisture in the air whatsover so using a cream is essential if you don&#x27;t want to look like an alligator.  I highly recommend this product.  Also if you buy it in a store he price per tube is at least $5 more than I paid from the seller at Amazon.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was on sale or if it was the regular price from this seller but I would definitely buy from them again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it every day from head to toe when I get out of the shower to keep from having dry skin. It goes on smooth and does not leave a greasy feeling. It&#x27;s very Hydrating and leaves your skin feeling extremely smooth. It&#x27;s not really scented so I would recommend it for men and women! Love it love it love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Hydrating body balm is excellent tanning.  Would recommend this product. 5 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this lotion. I used to be able to buy it in salons around town but its become hard to find. It has a nice soft odor and absorbs quickly into the skin without having to rub it in for hours. I&#x27;m pregnant so its great for my belly and everywhere else that needs lotion. I feel soft and moisturized all day after I put it on.</li>
            <li> BIOLAGE HYDRATING BODY BALM by Matrix - I discovered quite by accident, what an awesome product this is. I have used Biolage Hair products for years. One day a young salesman at the department store suggested this new &#x27;package deal&#x27;to me. I discovered later that it contained a &#x27;body cream&#x27;, and thinking it was just another body cream, I put it up in the rack and a year went by before I tried it. As like many things, I have my favorites. But after all else failed, I tried it on my &#x27;very dry&#x27; legs. WOW!! I tried it more recently on one of my dogs &#x27;w/a skin condition&#x27;. It did what the Vet&#x27;s Med. couldn&#x27;t. It healed his skin almost immediately. I had trouble finding the product again, until I came to Amazon.com. I highly reccommend this product. Thanks Amazon!!    Louise Fickett, Brooker, Florida</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! I am not generally a lotion person.I&#x27;m very picky because I hate when lotion leaves you feeling greasy.This one doesn&#x27;t.And it smells soooooo good!</li>
            <li> Great for hydrating skin right after showering.</li>
            <li> I thought the lotion would smell like Biolage but this lotion smells old. Runny as well. It you wanted this lotion for the smell dont buy it. My skin is soft tho. Haha.</li>
            <li> I love this product simply for the smell!!!!</li>
            <li> Everyone should treat themselves to this wonderful body balm! Love it and use it every day! Can&#x27;t get enough (especially at this price)!</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance and it does feel good on the body but I am not convinced that it is any better than any other body lotion for dry skin.  It is as good as any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> This product smells just like the amazing scent of the shampoo and conditioners! It moisturizer skin well also. I have filled a travel size container for my purse. I can&#x27;t get enough.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!!! This lotion isn&#x27;t greasy it doesn&#x27;t make your hands sting when you put it on plus it smells good, it&#x27;s god a good texture and feels great on my super dry hands!</li>
            <li> I really love this cream.  It blends right in and has no smell.  It makes my shin nice and soft and absolutely no oily feeling.  Thank you Matrix.  I would recommend this to anyone.  I also found that a little goes a long way.  I will be buying this again.  A little goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the others. This is really good stuff. I sort of found it by accident while at a Ross&#x27;s store and knowing how good the Matrix products are, I decided to give it a try. OMG, I&#x27;m sooooo glad that I did. It&#x27;s not sticky or greasy at all. It&#x27;s light and creamy and easily absorbs into the skin leaving a hydrated luster, and the scent is just a clean refreshing scent. My skin is very dry and usually requires a lot of product, but not with this one. I&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
            <li> Love the clean scent! Leaves skin feeling fresh and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, that&#x27;s what I really love about it.</li>
            <li> YOU SHOULD TRY THIS LOTION IF YOU HAVE DRY SKIN. IT MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL SO SOFT AND GETS RID OF DRY SCALY LOOK.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love this product! I ordered several for Christmas gifts; they arrived early, undamaged and as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used.  It leaves my skin soft and silky without a sticky feeling or residue to come off on my clothing.</li>
            <li> cant wear, has a smell other than the &amp;#34;biolage&amp;#34; smell. Kind of smells like it it was mixed with another lotion.</li>
            <li> I have searched for this lotion for 2 years and could not find it. Absolutely love this lotion. It&#x27;s made with water rather than oil so the skin absorbs it quickly and you don&#x27;t have that sticky feeling all summer long. It&#x27;s smells so fresh and clean, not overpowering at all. I love all of the Biolage products! Definitely recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product as long as I can remember (at least10-15 years or so) and will never use another.  As long as you continue to make it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Complete disappointment as I&#x27;d used this product for years and knew what to expect - that completely fresh, not overpowering smell of just coming out of the salon.  This HAD to be a five year old product - it smells absolutely putrid.  I love the smell of all Biolage products but this literally made me run to wash it off after applying it.  Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Very watery unlike what I normally buy at the retail stores</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for a long time now, I will never go back to the plain REGULAR lotion!!! I seriously recommend this to anyone!! This body lotion is wonderful and has an awesome scent just like their line (BIOLAGE)!!!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend first got this as a gift from some costumers that he knows from his work. Having no major use for it, he gave it to me. I joked with him to tell them not to give him such fancy gifts because he wouldn&#x27;t want me to fall in love with these products and would end up having to buy me more of these expensive brand names for me when I ran out. Maybe this isn&#x27;t considered \\&quot;brand name\\&quot; or \\&quot;fancy,\\&quot; but it definitely is to me and my experience with normal cheap lotions like jergens and vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing. I would use barely any and spread it all over my body because I regretted the day that it would run out. Even then, it absorbed SO well and makes my skin so extremely soft. I just feel so much better when I use this stuff. The scent is heavenly... nice and clean, smells like a crisp salon and feels like a treat to use. My skin is pretty dry, VERY dry in some spots and irritated by almost any lotion. The skin on my neck burns and turns bright red and turns into a rash if I&#x27;m not careful about what I put on my skin, or if I put nothing on my skin. So I needed something that would help that. This stuff soaks right into my skin and just becomes a part of it, leaving it silky and hydrated and feeling flawless. It&#x27;s fantastic, definitely my favorite lotion and I don&#x27;t plan to stop using it any time soon. Just got my new order of this stuff from Amazon today, thank goodness; I wasn&#x27;t sure how long I could get my other one to last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product, Biolage Hydrating Body Balm for Dry Skin for several years.  When I see I&#x27;m coming down to the end of the container&#x27;s content, I always order MORE!  Why?  Because it really works.  In fact, it&#x27;s better than any product I&#x27;ve ever used for dry skin at any age and now as a Senior I find it even more valuable in maintaing soft, smooth skin.  Delightful!  Isn&#x27;t it grand when you come upon a product like this?  Blessings, Cookie  :)</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for my brother, who was very well pleased. Great product!</li>
            <li> I really like the Biolage line of skincare products.  This lotion is very thick and works well for dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> Yes yes yes!  This is a fantastic product.  The cream melts on your skin, without you having to rub it in vigorously.  Yes, you &#x27;ll pay over ten bucks when shipping is added in.  But hey, the tube will last you a good 12 months.  The quality is far superior than the creams found in your local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> great stuff. received it as a gift and love it. It has done wonders for my skin, especially my feet.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most scented products even Items scented with essential oils. But this items doesnt bother me. I just wish it was cheaper</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great. It smells just like their conditioner. The only issue is that it is not thick at all. I know it is not a cream but it is watery thin. I use it solely for the fragrance.</li>
