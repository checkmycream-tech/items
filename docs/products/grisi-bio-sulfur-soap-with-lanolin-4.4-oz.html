            <li>Whoever wants to use this soap should know that this is a great soap.  </li>

            <li>Had tried many products that haven&#x27;t worked and have been on doxyciclin for three years.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve been using it for more than a year.</li>
            <li>The sulfur seemed to draw out all the bacteria and dirt from more pores and then keep pimples from reforming.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I found out about this one.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>The smell is interesting, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>GREAT SOAP REALLY</li>
            <li>but this one is more updated).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s cheap and effective.</li>
            <li>It takes away most of the redness in my rosacea skin.  </li>
            <li>Use this soap every day, and love it.</li>
            <li>The results are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Every skin is different so maybe for some people it will not work, but I consider this soap the best for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>so is even better for mix to oily skin.  </li>
            <li>nice fragrance ,  good sulphur soap,  has a nice lather , seems to last a while ,  gets the job done !</li>
            <li>It works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>This has helped clear up my skin, and it leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>soap bars fall apart really easily in the shower.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s excellent and I&#x27;m looking forward for even clearer skin in a few more weeks. ^_^</li>
            <li>Does not smell strong</li>
            <li>It is fantastic for the skin.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>but I read such great reviews from this site that I was overly optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This has transformed my skin to smooth pimple free unless in on period</li>
            <li>Lemon acid can kill the bacterias on your face that can cause pimples and acne, it is also a good way to deep cleanse your face. :)</li>
            <li>I am really happy with the result so far, and I would also recommend to use lemon juice for your face with a cotton and rinse it right away.</li>
            <li>, however I noticed that as my face peeled (in a sense) that the acne scars and older pimples would kind of peel with it.</li>
            <li>This is great to help dry up the oily skin and help with the acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Grisi for nearly a month, and find it just as effective as the prescription products in controlling rosacea.  </li>
            <li>The price also of the product is not bad.</li>
            <li>Even though there isn&#x27;t fragrance the smell of the sulfur is not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>You feel so fresh and clean after your shower.  </li>
            <li>Of course every skin is different, but this one is good for acne and worth the cost.</li>
            <li>With this Sulfur soap, and Prosacea gel, my Rosacea is totally under control, better than it ever was with the prescription gel!</li>
            <li>Oh well, it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>some people might be more sensitive to the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great soap for African American skin.</li>
            <li>I wish the shipping rates were more standard when I bought them.  </li>
            <li>Very cleansing and 100% worth it.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried everything, really!</li>
            <li>Only thing that puts me off is the sulfur smell, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>For me it does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this soap</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have used that does not make me break out in hives and it works.</li>
            <li>The first time I washed with it</li>
            <li>Use it first then lye soap.</li>
            <li>hehe it makes my skin soft and oil free.</li>
            <li>To worsen matters, many insurance plans, such as Medicare Pat D, do not cover the cost.  </li>
            <li>This keeps my sensitive skin blemish free every time I wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the SAL3 soap with good results, so I thought I&#x27;d try this to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li>It seems fine - doesn&#x27;t go a long ways - that is, it is used up fairly quickly compared to regular bar soap, but I think most of the sulfur soap is that way.  </li>
            <li>The other thing to note is that it lathers a lot, and you have to work in the lather for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>Then I rinse off my loofah and then use a more gentle regular soap (non-sulfur) for the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I finally got relief from the itching and have never felt so clean from any soap in my life!</li>
            <li>He gets acne on his back, arms and chest and this soap really helps; he always wants me to buy more when he runs out.</li>
            <li>Was not sure what to expect but the soap smells really good.  </li>
            <li>They dont dry your skin that badly, love them</li>
            <li>Cheaper than less effective, name brand products out there.</li>
            <li>I tried just about every product for sensitive skin from mild detergent-free washes, to tea tree oil, to salicylic acid.</li>
            <li>It does smell quite strong and the scent they put in the soap helps, however I found after about an hour you simply can&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
            <li>Basically, this stuff is strong, and should really only be used/scrubbed in to problem areas.</li>
            <li>This is certainly harsher than the SAL3 soap.  </li>
            <li>It is much healthier looking and my make up use has dropped dramatically.</li>
            <li>I use it for my whole body even hair.</li>
            <li>It works really well for chiggers (not as much for ticks), and I have the added bonus of reducing acne breakouts.</li>
            <li>The carton says 10 minutes (which probably is too much), but I do let the loather sink in while I wash up the rest of my body.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I finally read that sulfur can help and since the price was cheap</li>
            <li>I bought it for my husband and he like it so much.</li>
            <li>Between these three products, I&#x27;ve been able to keep my back mostly clear for 3-4 months now, which has let my skin heal and acne scars start to fade.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy this at the local drugstore in the Hispanic product isle, but I moved and the drug store near us does not carry it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other sulfur products including sulfur ointment acne cream (which I love) and figured I&#x27;d give this product</li>
            <li>I also use it from time to time if I notice I am starting to have a breakout of pimples and it clears it right up!</li>
            <li>Brought it mainly for my mom for skin allergies</li>
            <li>I bought this mainly for the sulfur in it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for use on oily skin.</li>
            <li>The dryness is rough to deal with, but with a good moisturizer every other day it seems to help.</li>
            <li>IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY KEEP PIMPLES OFF MY PRETTY FACE.  </li>
            <li>SO IT IS NOT A NEGATIVE REMARK.</li>
            <li>My husband has not made a comment and he always does if something doesn&#x27;t smell right on me like when I wear a different shampoo, perfume, hairspray, body lotion.</li>
            <li>Pretty economical price in comparison with other soaps that promote clearing up acne.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t be 100% sure that this product is the culprit, but after a few days of use I started to break out on my back pretty bad&lt;</li>
            <li>He has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27; ve very sensitive skin &amp; like anything else</li>
            <li>My face is also very soft after washing with it.  </li>
            <li>What I do is, when I first step into the shower, is lather up my back with this soap and let it sit.</li>
            <li>The first (and last)timeI used it my face turned beet red and burned.</li>
            <li>So if you have really sensitive skin-beware-do not even try Grisi!</li>
            <li>Oil free skin for hours with little moisture loss after washing my face...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing a little makeup can&#x27;t hide and my skin is smooth.</li>
            <li>Cheaper way to clear skin.</li>
            <li>If you have had the same problem I have with buying everything out there and nothing working, I highly recommend that you try this!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin with rosacea.</li>
            <li>AFTER BATTLING ITCHING AND TRYING A TONS OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, THIS SOAP REALLY HELPED ME.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 26 yrs old.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear any make-up but instead use Adult Acnomel as a primer and Clearasil Tinted Acne Treatment Cream over that as a \\&quot;foundation\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Even the generics run over $80 per month, which translates to nearly $1,000 a year just to wash your face.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps new users might try it every other day at first.</li>
            <li>It does make your skin feel squeaky clean for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>it really work for the my acne , now i only use this as my facial cleanser and body saop</li>
            <li>My wife and I have very sensitive skin and order this regularly.</li>
            <li>My back is almost completely clear.  </li>
            <li>so the moisture naturally comes back.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t help much on my backne issue, but not much does.</li>
            <li>I told myself that it was going to get worse before better and to hang in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about 2 months of using this product, and I still get a small breakout here and there, but they go away quickly.</li>
            <li>It might be a little more harsh, but my face became accustomed to it in about a week.  </li>
            <li>After some time you can see the difference in your skin, is heals the pimples (dry them) and reduce the appearance of new ones.</li>
            <li>This product corrects all skin issues: dark spots, acne, rashes, sunburn, large pores, etc.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap for removing dark spots in my skin.</li>
            <li>There are just other ways to go about clear and natural skin care, IMO.</li>
            <li>One week of using this products makes a big difference on my skin, first: all my pimples were dried out, second: my blemishes became lighter, and third: it prevents my skin for being oily.</li>

            <li> Very cleansing and 100% worth it.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried everything, really!</li>
            <li> Only thing that puts me off is the sulfur smell, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> For me it does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this soap</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have used that does not make me break out in hives and it works.</li>
            <li> The first time I washed with it</li>
            <li> Use it first then lye soap.</li>
            <li> hehe it makes my skin soft and oil free.</li>
            <li> To worsen matters, many insurance plans, such as Medicare Pat D, do not cover the cost.  </li>
            <li> This keeps my sensitive skin blemish free every time I wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the SAL3 soap with good results, so I thought I&#x27;d try this to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> It seems fine - doesn&#x27;t go a long ways - that is, it is used up fairly quickly compared to regular bar soap, but I think most of the sulfur soap is that way.  </li>
            <li> The other thing to note is that it lathers a lot, and you have to work in the lather for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> Then I rinse off my loofah and then use a more gentle regular soap (non-sulfur) for the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I finally got relief from the itching and have never felt so clean from any soap in my life!</li>
            <li> He gets acne on his back, arms and chest and this soap really helps; he always wants me to buy more when he runs out.</li>
            <li> Was not sure what to expect but the soap smells really good.  </li>
            <li> They dont dry your skin that badly, love them</li>
            <li> Cheaper than less effective, name brand products out there.</li>
            <li> I tried just about every product for sensitive skin from mild detergent-free washes, to tea tree oil, to salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> It does smell quite strong and the scent they put in the soap helps, however I found after about an hour you simply can&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> Basically, this stuff is strong, and should really only be used/scrubbed in to problem areas.</li>
            <li> This is certainly harsher than the SAL3 soap.  </li>
            <li> It is much healthier looking and my make up use has dropped dramatically.</li>
            <li> I use it for my whole body even hair.</li>
            <li> It works really well for chiggers (not as much for ticks), and I have the added bonus of reducing acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> The carton says 10 minutes (which probably is too much), but I do let the loather sink in while I wash up the rest of my body.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally read that sulfur can help and since the price was cheap</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband and he like it so much.</li>
            <li> Between these three products, I&#x27;ve been able to keep my back mostly clear for 3-4 months now, which has let my skin heal and acne scars start to fade.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to buy this at the local drugstore in the Hispanic product isle, but I moved and the drug store near us does not carry it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other sulfur products including sulfur ointment acne cream (which I love) and figured I&#x27;d give this product</li>
            <li> I also use it from time to time if I notice I am starting to have a breakout of pimples and it clears it right up!</li>
            <li> Brought it mainly for my mom for skin allergies</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly for the sulfur in it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for use on oily skin.</li>
            <li> The dryness is rough to deal with, but with a good moisturizer every other day it seems to help.</li>
            <li> IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY KEEP PIMPLES OFF MY PRETTY FACE.  </li>
            <li> SO IT IS NOT A NEGATIVE REMARK.</li>
            <li> My husband has not made a comment and he always does if something doesn&#x27;t smell right on me like when I wear a different shampoo, perfume, hairspray, body lotion.</li>
            <li> Pretty economical price in comparison with other soaps that promote clearing up acne.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t be 100% sure that this product is the culprit, but after a few days of use I started to break out on my back pretty bad&lt;</li>
            <li> He has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27; ve very sensitive skin &amp; like anything else</li>
            <li> My face is also very soft after washing with it.  </li>
            <li> What I do is, when I first step into the shower, is lather up my back with this soap and let it sit.</li>
            <li> The first (and last)timeI used it my face turned beet red and burned.</li>
            <li> So if you have really sensitive skin-beware-do not even try Grisi!</li>
            <li> Oil free skin for hours with little moisture loss after washing my face...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing a little makeup can&#x27;t hide and my skin is smooth.</li>
            <li> Cheaper way to clear skin.</li>
            <li> If you have had the same problem I have with buying everything out there and nothing working, I highly recommend that you try this!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with rosacea.</li>
            <li> AFTER BATTLING ITCHING AND TRYING A TONS OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, THIS SOAP REALLY HELPED ME.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 yrs old.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear any make-up but instead use Adult Acnomel as a primer and Clearasil Tinted Acne Treatment Cream over that as a \\&quot;foundation\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Even the generics run over $80 per month, which translates to nearly $1,000 a year just to wash your face.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps new users might try it every other day at first.</li>
            <li> It does make your skin feel squeaky clean for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> it really work for the my acne , now i only use this as my facial cleanser and body saop</li>
            <li> My wife and I have very sensitive skin and order this regularly.</li>
            <li> My back is almost completely clear.  </li>
            <li> so the moisture naturally comes back.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help much on my backne issue, but not much does.</li>
            <li> I told myself that it was going to get worse before better and to hang in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 2 months of using this product, and I still get a small breakout here and there, but they go away quickly.</li>
            <li> It might be a little more harsh, but my face became accustomed to it in about a week.  </li>
            <li> After some time you can see the difference in your skin, is heals the pimples (dry them) and reduce the appearance of new ones.</li>
            <li> This product corrects all skin issues: dark spots, acne, rashes, sunburn, large pores, etc.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap for removing dark spots in my skin.</li>
            <li> There are just other ways to go about clear and natural skin care, IMO.</li>
            <li> One week of using this products makes a big difference on my skin, first: all my pimples were dried out, second: my blemishes became lighter, and third: it prevents my skin for being oily.</li>
            <li> Used this soap for the past week and already noticed a positive difference.  </li>
            <li> Would give it seven, but haven&#x27;t used it long enough.</li>
            <li> other thing is that you shouldn&#x27;t really use this on other parts of your body, or, at least, not lather/scruff too much.</li>
            <li> The next week my face got really dry</li>
            <li> The only thing I could do without is the lanolin as dry skin is NOT my problem...</li>
            <li> Like the other productive reviews it really helps with skin problems without being harsh.</li>
            <li> Until I found out that sulfur soap can actually treat acne and other skin problems such as eczema/atopic dermatitis, etc.</li>
            <li> After only a week the bar was almost completely gone and what was left was hard and gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have continued to use this soap and will continue as long as my acne stays away.</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE TOO LONG</li>
            <li> After the third week I had almost clear skin, minus one or two small pimples.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately I bought a pack of six and will likely never use the other five.</li>
            <li> &amp; I believe it helped to dry it up during the contagious stage.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This product does dry your skin so ensure that you moisturize after you wash your skin.</li>
            <li> It does dry my skin a bit after I wash</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry feeling.</li>
            <li> THOUGH AS IT WILL DRY YOUR SKIN OUT,</li>
            <li> It can dry your skin a bit</li>
            <li> you have dry skin</li>
            <li> I then washed with my trusty dermazinc soap and my face calmed down by the next day.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin, and i had tried several acne cure products that does nothing but worse.</li>
            <li> (this contains a little of it, which is why i tried it) mixed with any body wash.</li>
            <li> It is 10% sulfur and has a glycerin base, which is just fine for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Cleans my face well with minimal break outs.</li>
            <li> No more acne actually.</li>
            <li> I have had acne all my life due to stress.</li>
            <li> The second time I hardly smelled it.</li>
            <li> My dark spots have disappeared and my skin is smoother and softer.[[ASIN:B001LP64D0</li>
            <li> I bought this to help clear my rosacea but it made it worse.</li>
            <li> I estimate that this cut down outbreaks for me by around 80%.</li>
            <li> My acne has gone down drastically.</li>
            <li> Also, it has helped fade the dark spots I had on my face from previous acne outbreaks.  </li>
            <li> leaves my skin softer than other sulfur soaps and does not have that harsh smell.</li>
            <li> Before starting a daily regimen with this I had severe acne problems and none of the expensive stuff cleared it up or even helped.</li>
            <li> but the dogs ate half a bar, so it may work as a dog treat.</li>
            <li> nothing a little moisturiser can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> I had read a few reviews that said just stick with it</li>
            <li> I used this product amost everyday</li>
            <li> i love the price, but the soap smells very bad</li>
            <li> The first week of using this it seemed as though all the bad stuff already in my pores was coming out.</li>
            <li> Hopefully no more doxy.</li>
            <li> My skin is clearing up from small blemishes.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using it, I had no more acne break outs.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately Amazon doesn&#x27;t carry it, they only carry sulfur soaps with lanolin and fragrance.</li>
            <li> I still have a few red blotches on my face of where the acne was at its worst, but we all know acne takes a long time to heal, especially the cystic ones.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like the smell (worse than other sulfur products in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is having a hard time with acne.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of once time lathering up really hard all over my stomach; it then broke out in an itchy rash that took about two months to fully resolve.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s not effective in all circumstances, but it will help.</li>
            <li> BUT that&#x27;s a small price to pay for smoother, pimple-free skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not those painful giant pimples that never seem to surface.</li>
            <li> Not sure but sadly, it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I will get this product again, It is too expensive for a soap.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have insurance, so this takes away the itch and keeps it from getting worse.</li>
            <li> My face was much worse than when I began using it.</li>
            <li> I did, but it was very subtle.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out and does not have a very bad smell.</li>
            <li> I have a very bad acnee and the only thing thas has done something for me is this soap</li>
            <li> I am sorry that this product didnt do the job.</li>
            <li> but I always had the worst possible side effect.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I threw it out in the trash.  </li>
            <li> Sulfur based prescription products have become outrageously expensive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very frustrating.</li>
            <li> This soap dried out my skin severely, and then I had a horrible bout of breakouts!  </li>
            <li> Also one of my boys has bad acne &amp; this helps him too.</li>
            <li> I had really bad acne.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and get really bad breakouts on my chin.</li>
            <li> I would cry sometimes because my acne had gotten so bad and nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me feel sick.</li>
            <li> I had an awful itchy rash</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great soap for acne and tinea versicolor...i love the smell too</li>
            <li> Great product  love it</li>
            <li> Whoever wants to use this soap should know that this is a great soap.  You feel so fresh and clean after your shower.  I wish the shipping rates were more standard when I bought them.  To my shopping experience by mail, their shipping systems leave a lot to be desired!!!  Definitely, the best sulfur soap I know.</li>
            <li> Was not sure what to expect but the soap smells really good.  Brought it mainly for my mom for skin allergies and she even uses it to wash her hair.  I had some acne and used it - it cleared up.  Pretty economical price in comparison with other soaps that promote clearing up acne.</li>
            <li> They dont dry your skin that badly, love them</li>
            <li> Bought this soap at the advice of another nurse that I work with for my daughter. She has rosacea and also excema. Had tried many products that haven&#x27;t worked and have been on doxyciclin for three years. It&#x27;s takes about two weeks to notice a difference but it does work. Hopefully no more doxy. She wishes the smell could be improved upon. But tolerable</li>
            <li> I order this soap for my husband. He has very sensitive skin and this has been the only soap that works well with his skin. I also use it from time to time if I notice I am starting to have a breakout of pimples and it clears it right up! Love it</li>
            <li> it really work for the my acne , now i only use this as my facial cleanser and body saop</li>
            <li> best soap ever for problem skin.</li>
            <li> Like the other productive reviews it really helps with skin problems without being harsh. I&#x27; ve very sensitive skin &amp; like anything else if you overuse it , it can be too much,so I had to find a happy usuage amount  that worked for me.  I had a bout with shingles &amp; I believe it helped to dry it up during the contagious stage.  Also one of my boys has bad acne &amp; this helps him too. Another plus was the good price</li>
            <li> Great face soap. Cleans my face well with minimal break outs. Doesnt dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Very cleansing and 100% worth it. I had an awful itchy rash and I don&#x27;t have insurance, so this takes away the itch and keeps it from getting worse. It is fantastic for the skin. I love this and it held me off until I could go to the doctor. A wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Great soap for African American skin. This product corrects all skin issues: dark spots, acne, rashes, sunburn, large pores, etc. I use day and night. This product does dry your skin so ensure that you moisturize after you wash your skin. I also recommend the sulfur lotion to treat specfic acne spots. For the price and effectiveness, you cant beat it.</li>
            <li> I had tried every soap out there, but after switching from olive oil to coconut oil and using this soap exclusively, my skin breakouts were almost non-existant. I am italian if that helps, but it probably won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is just the perfect soap for my face I have a very bad acnee and the only thing thas has done something for me is this soap i&#x27;ve tried everything, really! everything and there&#x27;s nothing like this. You&#x27;ll see the difference within a week and i&#x27;ve been using it for more than a year. TRY IT!</li>
            <li> After a month of using this soap morning and night, I cannot begin to express how great my face and neck cleared up. Before starting a daily regimen with this I had severe acne problems and none of the expensive stuff cleared it up or even helped. I researched and researched on sulfur soap and was a bit skeptical to try it, however I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a shot. Now for the really honest part. The first week of using this it seemed as though all the bad stuff already in my pores was coming out. My face was much worse than when I began using it. I had read a few reviews that said just stick with it and you will see results. I told myself that it was going to get worse before better and to hang in. The next week my face got really dry and I had to start using Cetaphil moisturizer to combat the dryness, however I noticed that as my face peeled (in a sense) that the acne scars and older pimples would kind of peel with it. After the third week I had almost clear skin, minus one or two small pimples. The sulfur seemed to draw out all the bacteria and dirt from more pores and then keep pimples from reforming. It does smell quite strong and the scent they put in the soap helps, however I found after about an hour you simply can&#x27;t smell it anymore. I have continued to use this soap and will continue as long as my acne stays away. The dryness is rough to deal with, but with a good moisturizer every other day it seems to help. If you have had the same problem I have with buying everything out there and nothing working, I highly recommend that you try this!</li>
            <li> I used this product amost everyday and it feels like it is working. My skin is clearing up from small blemishes. The price also of the product is not bad. Only thing that puts me off is the sulfur smell, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> This product just didn&#x27;t do it for me. I&#x27;ve used other sulfur products including sulfur ointment acne cream (which I love) and figured I&#x27;d give this product a go.&lt;br /&gt;Reasons I didn&#x27;t like it:&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the smell (worse than other sulfur products in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t be 100% sure that this product is the culprit, but after a few days of use I started to break out on my back pretty bad&lt;br /&gt;The soap bars fall apart really easily in the shower. After only a week the bar was almost completely gone and what was left was hard and gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I bought a pack of six and will likely never use the other five. Oh well, it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! leaves my skin softer than other sulfur soaps and does not have that harsh smell. I used to work at a dermatologist and was so embarrassed with how red and irritated my skin always was. I quit using all products and just started using this soap. My skin looks so much better!! It is much healthier looking and my make up use has dropped dramatically.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using it, I had no more acne break outs. No more acne actually. All I have now are the acne marks I&#x27;m hoping would fade soon too. It does dry my skin a bit after I wash but I have an oily type of skin so the moisture naturally comes back. I have always used sulfur soap since and I&#x27;m so glad I found out about this one. I am from the Philippines and i just recently moved here in Texas, USA. Over-all it&#x27;s excellent and I&#x27;m looking forward for even clearer skin in a few more weeks. ^_^</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help much on my backne issue, but not much does. The best concoction I&#x27;ve come up with is some polysorbate 80 (this contains a little of it, which is why i tried it) mixed with any body wash. but the dogs ate half a bar, so it may work as a dog treat.</li>
            <li> Great soap, significantly reduces the occurrence of pimples. The only problem I have is that it has a smell that I could do without (especially when I sweat) BUT that&#x27;s a small price to pay for smoother, pimple-free skin! GET IT, try it and recommend it to others!    Had to come back and edit this review....product seems to have stopped working. Might be something related to built-up resistance? Not sure but sadly, it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly for the sulfur in it. Sulfur is really good for the skin and hair. I have noticed an improvement in my son&#x27;s acne. I use it for my whole body even hair. I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry feeling. For me it does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this soap and I really love it. You might think that it would stink because of the sulfur in it, but it doesn&#x27;t. It has a pleasant smell to it. I have had acne all my life due to stress. This is the first product I have used that does not make me break out in hives and it works. I would recommend this product to anyone who is having a hard time with acne.</li>
            <li> I think it is a gimmick.  My son thinks it works, but we are using multiple products and on an antibiotic for this acne.</li>
            <li> With this Sulfur soap, and Prosacea gel, my Rosacea is totally under control, better than it ever was with the prescription gel!</li>
            <li> I really like this soap for removing dark spots in my skin.</li>
            <li> had no problems with the soap.</li>
            <li> This has helped clear up my skin, and it leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> My grandsons use the soap and it helps control and heal their acne.</li>
            <li> Great for acne! Cheaper than less effective, name brand products out there. I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 2 years and I love it! The smell is interesting, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> nice fragrance ,  good sulphur soap,  has a nice lather , seems to last a while ,  gets the job done !</li>
            <li> Well i will start with i love the price, but the soap smells very bad, it stayed in my clothes and i still had the problem. I am sorry that this product didnt do the job. IT did not work!!</li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of products, from department store,over the counter and doctor prescribed.  Some of the doctor stuff worked but I always had the worst possible side effect. I like this. It doesn&#x27;t make me feel sick. It does make your skin feel squeaky clean for a few minutes.  It works pretty good.  I had really bad acne. I have been using it for about a month and my face is a lot clearer.  My back is almost completely clear.  Hopefully it will continue to erase my acne.  I know will leave my house without makeup.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have very sensitive skin and order this regularly. The seller always delivers promptly and the soap is great.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY KEEP PIMPLES OFF MY PRETTY FACE.  GREAT SOAP REALLY</li>
            <li> I use it to keep chiggers away and to deter ticks. It works really well for chiggers (not as much for ticks), and I have the added bonus of reducing acne breakouts. The scent is very pleasant and not at all sulfury.</li>
            <li> Cheaper way to clear skin. I gave away 4 bars. This product would be great for teens or anyone who battles blemishes.</li>
            <li> Whether you are after an alternate to acne treatments or oily T sections on your face to a Scabies treatment this is the one.  Sulfur is stinky but works wonders.  I recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 6 months for back acne (and might have a review somewhere else on Amazon...but this one is more updated).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the deal with this soap. Yes, it&#x27;s cheap and effective. It&#x27;ll cut back some percentage (not all) of body acne outbreaks. I estimate that this cut down outbreaks for me by around 80%. So it&#x27;s not effective in all circumstances, but it will help. The other thing to note is that it lathers a lot, and you have to work in the lather for it to be effective. The carton says 10 minutes (which probably is too much), but I do let the loather sink in while I wash up the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing is that you shouldn&#x27;t really use this on other parts of your body, or, at least, not lather/scruff too much. I made the mistake of once time lathering up really hard all over my stomach; it then broke out in an itchy rash that took about two months to fully resolve. Basically, this stuff is strong, and should really only be used/scrubbed in to problem areas. What I do is, when I first step into the shower, is lather up my back with this soap and let it sit. Then I rinse off my loofah and then use a more gentle regular soap (non-sulfur) for the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this along with Proactiv and a salicylic acid body spray. Between these three products, I&#x27;ve been able to keep my back mostly clear for 3-4 months now, which has let my skin heal and acne scars start to fade. I&#x27;ll continue this regime indefinitely.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.  I use it every morning and everynight.  My dark spots have disappeared and my skin is smoother and softer.[[ASIN:B001LP64D0 Sulfur Soap with Lanolin]]</li>
            <li> I buy these for my husband. He gets acne on his back, arms and chest and this soap really helps; he always wants me to buy more when he runs out. I used to be able to buy this at the local drugstore in the Hispanic product isle, but I moved and the drug store near us does not carry it. He would recommend this item</li>
            <li> Bought this and they should have paid me to try it and paid for my discomfort I suffered as a result. I have sensitive skin with rosacea. I bought this to help clear my rosacea but it made it worse. The first (and last)timeI used it my face turned beet red and burned. Needless to say I threw it out in the trash.  I then washed with my trusty dermazinc soap and my face calmed down by the next day. I did check the ingredients and found the offending ones-lanolin- an oil from sheep that creates the same allergic reaction in some individuals as wool does, and fragrance.  My fault for not checking the ingredients in advance but I read such great reviews from this site that I was overly optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;I then did the extensive research that I should have done before using Grisi and finally found one that does not contain lanolin or fragrance.  It is 10% sulfur and has a glycerin base, which is just fine for my sensitive skin.  It takes away most of the redness in my rosacea skin.  That&#x27;s what I was looking for.  My face is also very soft after washing with it.  Even though there isn&#x27;t fragrance the smell of the sulfur is not bad at all.  I don&#x27;t notice it.  The first time I washed with it I did, but it was very subtle.The second time I hardly smelled it. Now I don&#x27;t smell it at all.  My husband has not made a comment and he always does if something doesn&#x27;t smell right on me like when I wear a different shampoo, perfume, hairspray, body lotion. The name of the soap is Cuticare and unfortunately Amazon doesn&#x27;t carry it, they only carry sulfur soaps with lanolin and fragrance. So if you have really sensitive skin-beware-do not even try Grisi!</li>
            <li> This soap dried out my skin severely, and then I had a horrible bout of breakouts!  However, I understand that everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so it might not hurt to try it!</li>
            <li> This is my second 6-bar order so my repeated patronage speaks to the efficacy of the product. It works! Oil free skin for hours with little moisture loss after washing my face...nothing a little moisturiser can&#x27;t fix. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Use it first then lye soap. Then apply Triamcinlone Acetonide cream twice a day to plaque psoriasis. After a couple of weeks it made a 95% improvement on me. Raised my self-esteem and people think I&#x27;m taking some kind of pill for it. I tell everyone I know about my mixture.</li>
            <li> Used this soap for the past week and already noticed a positive difference.  Would give it seven, but haven&#x27;t used it long enough.</li>
            <li> Use this soap every day, and love it. Does not dry out and does not have a very bad smell.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  I have used 4 bars now and am very satisfied with this soap.  I am reordering another batch of 6 bars today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have used one bar of the 6 I purchased.  It seems fine - doesn&#x27;t go a long ways - that is, it is used up fairly quickly compared to regular bar soap, but I think most of the sulfur soap is that way.  You can&#x27;t feel or smell the sulfur in it.</li>
            <li> The product works and purges the snot out of your skin, but it was just SO drying and the sulfur smell was so putrid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discontinued use.  There are just other ways to go about clear and natural skin care, IMO.</li>
            <li> THE SOAP DID WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSE TO DO. AFTER BATTLING ITCHING AND TRYING A TONS OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, THIS SOAP REALLY HELPED ME. I WOULD BUY AGAIN AND I DID! DO NOT USE TOO LONG THOUGH AS IT WILL DRY YOUR SKIN OUT, BUT THAT IS WHAT IT IS SUPPOSE TO DO, SO IT IS NOT A NEGATIVE REMARK.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough about how well this soap works. I have oily skin and get really bad breakouts on my chin. I&#x27;m 26 yrs old. It&#x27;s very frustrating. I would cry sometimes because my acne had gotten so bad and nothing seemed to work. I finally read that sulfur can help and since the price was cheap I thought, well, what have I got to lose.&lt;br /&gt;So happy I tried. My acne has gone down drastically. My skin isn&#x27;t perfect but it&#x27;s about 95% better. It&#x27;s been about 2 months of using this product, and I still get a small breakout here and there, but they go away quickly. It&#x27;s also not those painful giant pimples that never seem to surface. I still have a few red blotches on my face of where the acne was at its worst, but we all know acne takes a long time to heal, especially the cystic ones. It&#x27;s nothing a little makeup can&#x27;t hide and my skin is smooth. No raised acne bumps. The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest, but it&#x27;s not that strong either. It didn&#x27;t bother me any. some people might be more sensitive to the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everyone, it&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the SAL3 soap with good results, so I thought I&#x27;d try this to save a few bucks. Big mistake.  After 2 days of using this soap, it irritated my skin, causing redness and itching.  This is certainly harsher than the SAL3 soap.  I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I will get this product again, It is too expensive for a soap. It did not smell that good and been using it since and did not notice any improvement.</li>
            <li> This is great to help dry up the oily skin and help with the acne. I highly recommend for use on oily skin.</li>
            <li> I am so grateful to learn of this soap and for its wonderful results. I finally got relief from the itching and have never felt so clean from any soap in my life!</li>
            <li> I have cystic acne that acts up from time to time.  I started using this soap about a year ago and LOVE it!  It&#x27;s the only thing that is over the counter that works for me.  I still get pimples every once and a while but nothing like I did before.  Also, it has helped fade the dark spots I had on my face from previous acne outbreaks.  I wash with it every morning and night.  I don&#x27;t wear any make-up but instead use Adult Acnomel as a primer and Clearasil Tinted Acne Treatment Cream over that as a \\&quot;foundation\\&quot;.  The results are fantastic!  :)</li>
            <li> This has transformed my skin to smooth pimple free unless in on period hehe it makes my skin soft and oil free. It doesnt make my skin smell at all. My face had pimples now not one yippe</li>
            <li> made me break out didn&#x27;t like it at all</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.  Regular soap does not work for me.  This is the only soap that works.  It gets rid of the pimples, blackheads, etc.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin, and i had tried several acne cure products that does nothing but worse. Until I found out that sulfur soap can actually treat acne and other skin problems such as eczema/atopic dermatitis, etc. therefore; i decided to buy this soap to try it out. One week of using this products makes a big difference on my skin, first: all my pimples were dried out, second: my blemishes became lighter, and third: it prevents my skin for being oily. I am really happy with the result so far, and I would also recommend to use lemon juice for your face with a cotton and rinse it right away. Lemon acid can kill the bacterias on your face that can cause pimples and acne, it is also a good way to deep cleanse your face. :)</li>
            <li> Every skin is different so maybe for some people it will not work, but I consider this soap the best for acne prone skin. It comes well wrapped in plastic inside the box, it is durable and keeps the consistency until you finish it. Does not smell strong and it&#x27;s not irritant. It can dry your skin a bit id you have dry skin so is even better for mix to oily skin.  After some time you can see the difference in your skin, is heals the pimples (dry them) and reduce the appearance of new ones. After this cleanser/soap I recommend Mandelic acid. Its is soooo good that you will not have acne again, not even one pimple with it. Of course every skin is different, but this one is good for acne and worth the cost. I wish I can buy it someday day in Amazon. I have to order it from Canada.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]%28Mama-Lotion-Formula%29.html</li>
            <li> This sulfur soap definitely does what I bought it for: Eliminating acne on my back and scalp. The only thing I could do without is the lanolin as dry skin is NOT my problem...</li>
            <li> Did some research about my itchy skin, found reviews suggesting sulfur soap&lt;br /&gt; product has worked well, not a cure but definitely helps.</li>
            <li> very good price for a good product.</li>
            <li> Working well. I bought it for my husband and he like it so much.</li>
            <li> Best product for acne.  I have suggested this item to everyone I know with skin problems.</li>
            <li> Sulfur based prescription products have become outrageously expensive.  Even the generics run over $80 per month, which translates to nearly $1,000 a year just to wash your face.  To worsen matters, many insurance plans, such as Medicare Pat D, do not cover the cost.  I&#x27;ve been using Grisi for nearly a month, and find it just as effective as the prescription products in controlling rosacea.  (I also use the topical antibiotic metronidizol.) It might be a little more harsh, but my face became accustomed to it in about a week.  Perhaps new users might try it every other day at first.</li>
            <li> Happy, happy. Joy, joy. I tried just about every product for sensitive skin from mild detergent-free washes, to tea tree oil, to salicylic acid. Nothing worked for any period of time. This keeps my sensitive skin blemish free every time I wash. And as others noted, it doesn&#x27;t have a medicinal smell.</li>
