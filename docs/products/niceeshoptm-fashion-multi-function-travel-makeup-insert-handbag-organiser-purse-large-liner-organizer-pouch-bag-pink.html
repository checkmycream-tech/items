            <li>It comes in handy since I am constantly changing purses.</li>

            <li>,what a deal,i think im going back for more,</li>
            <li>I got this smaller one just to be sure Iike the concept and it works for me.</li>
            <li>wow a great little purse bag</li>
            <li>But not sure will fit many purses.</li>
            <li>Not meant for a tiny purse, but it keeps the inside of my purse relatively more organized than it normally would be.</li>
            <li>Holds a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Many compartments to hold essential items that dont fit in handbag.</li>
            <li>This makes it much easier when switching between purses/backpacks.</li>
            <li>It is much easier to dig around for things in my bag now.</li>
            <li>Way smaller than what I need, but nice all the same.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other bag organizers that cost more</li>
            <li>Its so small it hasn&#x27;t really come in handy because it doesn&#x27;t fix well in any of my purses and falls around</li>
            <li>Makes it really simple and quick to change purses.</li>
            <li>My mess stuff gets more organized.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It should hold everyday things like hand lotion, sanitizer, etc. and easy to transfer from one bag to another.</li>
            <li>This is a cute little insert, but a bit smaller than I imagined.</li>
            <li>It makes all the little things you have to carry around quite accessible.  </li>

            <li>i sometimes carry small purses and no xtra places for items,this little helper is so nice and gives me storage to carry the xtra items i need to carry in my smaller purses</li>
            <li>so I believe in the near future I will be ordering a bigger one.</li>
            <li>I give it a four star since one of the snap cannot be snapped very well, so it is always half open of one side.</li>

            <li> This is a very handy insert to a purse, messenger bag or duffle.  It makes all the little things you have to carry around quite accessible.  The only thing I would add is a closure of some sort so the insert could be lifted out and used away from the bag without spilling anything.</li>

            <li> I imagined it bigger than what I received. Apart from that, it was a good deal (2.99$ incl shipping). It should hold everyday things like hand lotion, sanitizer, etc. and easy to transfer from one bag to another.</li>

I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> It comes in handy since I am constantly changing purses. I can always find my things in my purse now. I ordered 2 so I gave my daughter one too. She loves it.</li>

            <li> I give it a four star since one of the snap cannot be snapped very well, so it is always half open of one side. Overall I think it is a good product and recommend for those who like to bring all gadgets/accessories in an organized way.</li>
