            <li>Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat is the top quality</li>

            <li>love love love this soap, it just speaks</li>
            <li>I love the soap and recommend it without reservation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many soaps.  </li>
            <li>I know from experience than lanolin is my friend, whereas most nut butters (like shea) cause an allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries it now.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I had gotten this product on a trip to England and was extremely glad to be able to get it here.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The English are great soap makers -- it lasts forever!</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>No commercial soap maker&#x27;s dream of the perfect fragrance - - &amp;#34;Who was that lovely pomegranate</li>
            <li>Gonna order more.  </li>
            <li>I am a convert for sure, and I&#x27;ll be gifting some to friends and family.</li>
            <li>I love the old-fashioned looking label and the smell is very clean.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited about my purchase of the Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Soap.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied definitely worth the money I like it.</li>
            <li>Very nice soap...makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li>This one is simple, honest, gentle, and comes from a wonderful place in the world.  </li>
            <li>Perfume is listed as an ingredient on the label but it must be very mild because I can&#x27;t smell it.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and the scent is mild and very pleasant.</li>
            <li>The aroma is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a non-drying, non-irritating rich and smooth bath soap, this is it.  </li>
            <li>I very much enjoyed using the soap as it was cleansing while non drying and had a very subtle pleasant scent that both men and women can both enjoy, along with good lathering qualities.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price and don&#x27;t fall for the look a likes!</li>
            <li>Originally found it at a cigar shop in Cambridge.</li>
            <li>First I have to say I love Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat shaving soap.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell, and leaves my skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>clean-</li>
            <li>Great soap for winter dry skin or sun tinged summer skin.</li>
            <li>I just want to smell clean.</li>
            <li>It lathers beautifully, and there is something extremely pleasing about just holding the soap in your hands.</li>
            <li>This soap is so very gentle on the skin, and it smells divine --- just like clean should smell!  </li>
            <li>It has a simple scent, feels good on the skin, rinses clean, and just works.</li>
            <li>Delivered as promised and in very good condition we love the soap and use it daily and have for several years.</li>
            <li>It smells like true soap should and reminds me of my grandma (</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a good, simple soap but not as moisturizing as I was led to believe in the description.</li>
            <li>and the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap with shikakai are, I think, the only two soaps that have been a good balance for me.  </li>
            <li>Makes the skin nice and soft</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this if you have sensitive skin of any kind.</li>
            <li>It even leaves my hands nice and soft after a shower.</li>
            <li>This soap has a very gentle smell (for those of us allergic to strong smells).  </li>
            <li>It has a nice fresh sent and makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li>This lanolin soap has a clean fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>This gentle soap makes your skin feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Use two and give one as an extra treat to someone you love!</li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling refreshed, soft, smooth, moisturized!</li>
            <li>the quality is worth it.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>, we&#x27;re worth it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and can get away with using any ol&#x27; soap, but another aspect of MWF shaving soap that I love is how the lanolin leaves my face feeling after a shave.</li>
            <li>I have searched the world many times over (on the web) looking for high quality lanolin hand (bar) soap after many different products I have found this product to be the finest.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to get in the shower in the morning and have to take another one right before bed.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the Mitchell&#x27;s right now because of the mild, clean scent, its bar form, and because it lasts forever--seriously, these bars are huge, and this three-pack might last me a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does clean and lather well and is a high quality product.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very smooth when I use it for a facial or in the shower</li>
            <li>One of the things I really love about MWF shaving soap is the scent; it&#x27;s got a fresh, old fashioned tone to it that I really enjoy, especially in the colder months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it does not feel any more moisturizing on my skin than other soaps available on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Soap was a welcomed success in calming my sensitive skin with clean moisture.</li>
            <li>This soap is expensive, and as far as I know is the best soap on your skin available.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>used to be able to find this locally, but no longer can.  </li>
            <li>First purchased this product in the UK.  </li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m so glad I did when I finally opened up the bar and used it in my shower</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t care that it doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like the shaving cream (which I also have).</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the one higher priced shaving soap I will keep in my den.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t quite put my finger (or my nose) on what exactly their body bar smells like</li>
            <li>The body bar left my skin suit feeling OK</li>
            <li>I know that sounds a bit funny, but I almost get giddy when it&#x27;s shower time.</li>
            <li>I really does leave your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural to want to smell clean again.  </li>
            <li>I checked it out; getting three bars for myself and my girls; each girl loves the clean smell and I like the clean smell and the long time it lasts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slick, smells good, and helps my skin.</li>
            <li>My bf has dry itchy skin with most soaps</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry me out like most off the shelf soaps do from the grocery store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large bar that doesn&#x27;t go &amp;#34;mushy&amp;#34; and lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this soap!  </li>
            <li>High in quality!</li>
            <li>I got this because I felt my skin needed something gentle yet</li>
            <li>I do like lanolin based products and was really looking forward to using this</li>
            <li>There is not a whole lot more to add.  </li>
            <li>Mitchell&#x27;s is simply one of the finest soaps available.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very long-lasting soap too.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin which just seems to get more sensitive every year.  </li>
            <li>This soap is much easier on the skin even than Dove, with very creamy, smooth lather and not at all drying to the skin due to the lanolin content.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and smooth to the touch for the entire day.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to step up the quality of their soap.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>Each bar is worth the extra expense.  </li>
            <li>Nice big, heavy bar of soap.</li>
            <li>I am a life-long Zest and Irish Spring user - whichever I happened to see first at CostCo was the one I bought.</li>
            <li>The bars are big, but not uncomfortable to hold on to.</li>
            <li>We always bought fragrance free and sensitive skin soaps but he would still have the same itchy dry skin.</li>
            <li>I would give it a 10 star rating, because it helps my dry skin more than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hands so soft.</li>
            <li>Like others have said, the lanolin in it keeps skin soft and moisturized even in the winter.  </li>
            <li>Smells old fashioned.</li>
            <li>cannot recommend this for people with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>This is the only bar soap that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin itchy and flaking - very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>but I swear this soap keeps my skin almost young.</li>
            <li>For those with sensitive skin, this is your soap.</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin was.</li>
            <li>This soap is like using old fashioned lye soap.</li>
            <li>My 100-year old client used to pick this up on her vacations to NC and she told me about it.  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s worth every penny, I think 3 giant bars will last a year or two.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin,  so I&#x27;m very picky about the soaps I use.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this soap since the 80s, and note that it really helps with winter dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It seems kind of expensive, but since it&#x27;s triple milled, each bar really lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Some things are worth a little splurge.</li>
            <li>The bars are large and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I never gave it much thought until a friend whom I had introduced to wet shaving thanked me with a &#x27;man soap gift basket&#x27;.</li>
            <li>If you have issues with bath soaps making you itchy or dry, I highly recommend this Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend anyone that has dry skin to try this soap.</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin</li>
            <li>I like the mild scent (even though I would not have been disappointed with a more woolly scent.)</li>
            <li>I am over 60 and have dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin gets VERY &amp;#34;dusty&amp;#34; dry with other soaps, and this stuff leaves</li>

            <li> I love Mitchell&#x27;s wool fat soap, it&#x27;s great as a face or body soap and has a nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Just clean, and feel good skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best bath soap I have ever used, far better than anything you can get in the supermarket or drug</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t great when we first started using it</li>
            <li> This soap is great, it&#x27;s not drying, and it has a light clean fragrance, yet it does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> So I wanted more and was happy to find it available on Amazon, and at a better price than I had originally purchased it.</li>
            <li> Nice mild scent too!</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  </li>
            <li> Love Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like it better than Ivory or Dove because of the Lanolin in the soap.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat is the top quality</li>
            <li> Ok in winter.</li>
            <li> Lovely product.  </li>
            <li> love love love this soap, it just speaks</li>
            <li> I love the soap and recommend it without reservation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many soaps.  </li>
            <li> I know from experience than lanolin is my friend, whereas most nut butters (like shea) cause an allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries it now.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> you card from Mitchell&#x27;s with every order :-)</li>
            <li> Luxurious feeling, moisturizing and lovely scent.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I had gotten this product on a trip to England and was extremely glad to be able to get it here.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The English are great soap makers -- it lasts forever!</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> No commercial soap maker&#x27;s dream of the perfect fragrance - - &amp;#34;Who was that lovely pomegranate</li>
            <li> Gonna order more.  </li>
            <li> I am a convert for sure, and I&#x27;ll be gifting some to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I love the old-fashioned looking label and the smell is very clean.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited about my purchase of the Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Soap.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied definitely worth the money I like it.</li>
            <li> Very nice soap...makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li> This one is simple, honest, gentle, and comes from a wonderful place in the world.  </li>
            <li> Perfume is listed as an ingredient on the label but it must be very mild because I can&#x27;t smell it.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and the scent is mild and very pleasant.</li>
            <li> The aroma is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a non-drying, non-irritating rich and smooth bath soap, this is it.  </li>
            <li> I very much enjoyed using the soap as it was cleansing while non drying and had a very subtle pleasant scent that both men and women can both enjoy, along with good lathering qualities.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price and don&#x27;t fall for the look a likes!</li>
            <li> Originally found it at a cigar shop in Cambridge.</li>
            <li> First I have to say I love Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat shaving soap.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell, and leaves my skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> clean-</li>
            <li> Great soap for winter dry skin or sun tinged summer skin.</li>
            <li> I just want to smell clean.</li>
            <li> It lathers beautifully, and there is something extremely pleasing about just holding the soap in your hands.</li>
            <li> This soap is so very gentle on the skin, and it smells divine --- just like clean should smell!  </li>
            <li> It has a simple scent, feels good on the skin, rinses clean, and just works.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised and in very good condition we love the soap and use it daily and have for several years.</li>
            <li> It smells like true soap should and reminds me of my grandma (</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a good, simple soap but not as moisturizing as I was led to believe in the description.</li>
            <li> and the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap with shikakai are, I think, the only two soaps that have been a good balance for me.  </li>
            <li> Makes the skin nice and soft</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this if you have sensitive skin of any kind.</li>
            <li> It even leaves my hands nice and soft after a shower.</li>
            <li> This soap has a very gentle smell (for those of us allergic to strong smells).  </li>
            <li> It has a nice fresh sent and makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li> This lanolin soap has a clean fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> This gentle soap makes your skin feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Use two and give one as an extra treat to someone you love!</li>
            <li> Leaves you feeling refreshed, soft, smooth, moisturized!</li>
            <li> the quality is worth it.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> well worth the price.</li>
            <li> , we&#x27;re worth it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and can get away with using any ol&#x27; soap, but another aspect of MWF shaving soap that I love is how the lanolin leaves my face feeling after a shave.</li>
            <li> I have searched the world many times over (on the web) looking for high quality lanolin hand (bar) soap after many different products I have found this product to be the finest.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to get in the shower in the morning and have to take another one right before bed.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the Mitchell&#x27;s right now because of the mild, clean scent, its bar form, and because it lasts forever--seriously, these bars are huge, and this three-pack might last me a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does clean and lather well and is a high quality product.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very smooth when I use it for a facial or in the shower</li>
            <li> One of the things I really love about MWF shaving soap is the scent; it&#x27;s got a fresh, old fashioned tone to it that I really enjoy, especially in the colder months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it does not feel any more moisturizing on my skin than other soaps available on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Soap was a welcomed success in calming my sensitive skin with clean moisture.</li>
            <li> This soap is expensive, and as far as I know is the best soap on your skin available.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> used to be able to find this locally, but no longer can.  </li>
            <li> First purchased this product in the UK.  </li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m so glad I did when I finally opened up the bar and used it in my shower</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t care that it doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like the shaving cream (which I also have).</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the one higher priced shaving soap I will keep in my den.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t quite put my finger (or my nose) on what exactly their body bar smells like</li>
            <li> The body bar left my skin suit feeling OK</li>
            <li> I know that sounds a bit funny, but I almost get giddy when it&#x27;s shower time.</li>
            <li> I really does leave your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural to want to smell clean again.  </li>
            <li> I checked it out; getting three bars for myself and my girls; each girl loves the clean smell and I like the clean smell and the long time it lasts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slick, smells good, and helps my skin.</li>
            <li> My bf has dry itchy skin with most soaps</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry me out like most off the shelf soaps do from the grocery store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large bar that doesn&#x27;t go &amp;#34;mushy&amp;#34; and lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this soap!  </li>
            <li> High in quality!</li>
            <li> I got this because I felt my skin needed something gentle yet</li>
            <li> I do like lanolin based products and was really looking forward to using this</li>
            <li> There is not a whole lot more to add.  </li>
            <li> Mitchell&#x27;s is simply one of the finest soaps available.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very long-lasting soap too.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin which just seems to get more sensitive every year.  </li>
            <li> This soap is much easier on the skin even than Dove, with very creamy, smooth lather and not at all drying to the skin due to the lanolin content.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and smooth to the touch for the entire day.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to step up the quality of their soap.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> Each bar is worth the extra expense.  </li>
            <li> Nice big, heavy bar of soap.</li>
            <li> I am a life-long Zest and Irish Spring user - whichever I happened to see first at CostCo was the one I bought.</li>
            <li> The bars are big, but not uncomfortable to hold on to.</li>
            <li> We always bought fragrance free and sensitive skin soaps but he would still have the same itchy dry skin.</li>
            <li> I would give it a 10 star rating, because it helps my dry skin more than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hands so soft.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, the lanolin in it keeps skin soft and moisturized even in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Smells old fashioned.</li>
            <li> cannot recommend this for people with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> This is the only bar soap that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin itchy and flaking - very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> but I swear this soap keeps my skin almost young.</li>
            <li> For those with sensitive skin, this is your soap.</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin was.</li>
            <li> This soap is like using old fashioned lye soap.</li>
            <li> My 100-year old client used to pick this up on her vacations to NC and she told me about it.  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s worth every penny, I think 3 giant bars will last a year or two.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin,  so I&#x27;m very picky about the soaps I use.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this soap since the 80s, and note that it really helps with winter dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It seems kind of expensive, but since it&#x27;s triple milled, each bar really lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Some things are worth a little splurge.</li>
            <li> The bars are large and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I never gave it much thought until a friend whom I had introduced to wet shaving thanked me with a &#x27;man soap gift basket&#x27;.</li>
            <li> If you have issues with bath soaps making you itchy or dry, I highly recommend this Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend anyone that has dry skin to try this soap.</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin</li>
            <li> I like the mild scent (even though I would not have been disappointed with a more woolly scent.)</li>
            <li> I am over 60 and have dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin gets VERY &amp;#34;dusty&amp;#34; dry with other soaps, and this stuff leaves</li>
            <li> Bar is very large and hard to hold.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> Long lasting</li>
            <li> This soap last soooooooo long, it actually ends up costing not much more than the common brands that are filled with all kinds of chemicals.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After showering with this a few times, it became clear that the scent or vapors coming from this bar of soap irritates my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The bars are larger than expected.</li>
            <li> Yeah, twenty bucks seems like a lot, but for soap that lasts this long and doesn&#x27;t make your skin overreact?  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m more than a little annoyed that this stuff doesn&#x27;t stand up to bars I get for half the price at my local close-out stores.</li>
            <li> Much bigger than any other bar soap I have used.</li>
            <li> It helps that my wife adores the smell as well- and the bar lasts a LONG time!</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry skin and am always looking for moisturizing soaps to reduce my dependence on creams and lotions.  </li>
            <li> Used in conjunction with lanolin cream, the skin on my face is no longer itchy and dry.</li>
            <li> The Wool Fat (lanolin) in the soap helps keep our skin from being too dry.  </li>
            <li> but this soap was a staple in the relief of my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I work with a lot of oil, grease and solvents - after a while my hands get dry and crack.</li>
            <li> It lasts months and you will notice your dry skin doesn&#x27;t itch or flake</li>
            <li> I wanted something that I could use that wouldn&#x27;t dry my skin out and wasn&#x27;t too girly.</li>
            <li> Still had crusty heels and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Oh by the way, I paid $12 for a single bar at a tea and wool shop in Seattle.</li>
            <li> I expected the &amp;#34;pack of three&amp;#34; to come in a box but the bars came loose....</li>
            <li> I once purchased this soap while on vacation at a little English shop as per suggestion of the shop keeper.</li>
            <li> If it were a little cheaper this would be the only soap in the house.</li>
            <li> in arid Colorado, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like other soaps.</li>
            <li> This soap is extremely moisturizing on my very dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> It also lathers well, and will last a long time because it&#x27;s a hard soap that doesn&#x27;t get mushy when wet.  </li>
            <li> When you have dry and/or sensitive skin, it&#x27;s hard to find something that makes you feel clean but doesn&#x27;t strip your skin&#x27;s oils too badly.  </li>
            <li> And the bar doesn&#x27;t melt away as other soaps do in the soap dish.  </li>
            <li> Other soaps have never done this to me.  </li>
            <li> No more white heels!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry skin like soap usually does.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s bland and not a scent that will inspire me to reach for this stuff often…</li>
            <li> I suffer from serious dry skin issues (which I&#x27;m working to resolve through other avenues as well)</li>
            <li> A little harsh.</li>
            <li> (sometimes itchy from the cold winter and indoor heat) and my skin now feels soft as heck after I dry off from my shower and it even glistens!</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the old-time soap smell but</li>
            <li> There is no perfume, this is the smell of raw lanolyn.</li>
            <li> was expecting the MWF body bar to smell at least a little like their shaving soap, but it doesn&#x27;t even come close.</li>
            <li> We used to get this soap from a local English Tea shop and was so disappointed when they went out of business.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m in my late thirties.)  </li>
            <li> I complained, no one listened!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years now and yes - an expensive bar of soap but your skin feels like silk and ladies</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I bought three bars :(</li>
            <li> If it has anything moisturizing in it I would be shocked.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this soap.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The bars are larger than expected. Good smell..</li>
            <li> Been using MWF bath and shave soap for years. I really does leave your skin soft and smooth. Nice mild scent too!</li>
            <li> I have loved this soap for years and am glad to have found it here.  I expected the &amp;#34;pack of three&amp;#34; to come in a box but the bars came loose....</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  Can&#x27;t wait to get in the shower in the morning and have to take another one right before bed.  Makes my skin feel luscious...and I didn&#x27;t have to go to Australia to buy it.  Love Amazon.</li>
            <li> This soap is expensive, and as far as I know is the best soap on your skin available. Leaves you feeling refreshed, soft, smooth, moisturized! My only reason for a (4) is this ended up in my hands because the ad made it look like this was a choice for a 3-pak deal on the shaving variety! I complained, no one listened! The shaving stuff is excellent too!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied definitely worth the money I like it. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This soap has a very gentle smell (for those of us allergic to strong smells).  I like it better than Ivory or Dove because of the Lanolin in the soap.  It has a nice smell, and leaves my skin smooth and soft.  Highly recommend this soap!  We used to get this soap from a local English Tea shop and was so disappointed when they went out of business.  We are now so delighted that we can order our favorite soap again from Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I would give it a 10 star rating, because it helps my dry skin more than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap since the 80s, and note that it really helps with winter dry skin.  It keeps my hands so soft.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something about this soap that just makes me keep buying it. It seems kind of expensive, but since it&#x27;s triple milled, each bar really lasts a long time.  It has a simple scent, feels good on the skin, rinses clean, and just works.</li>
            <li> This soap last soooooooo long, it actually ends up costing not much more than the common brands that are filled with all kinds of chemicals.  And the bar doesn&#x27;t melt away as other soaps do in the soap dish.  The lather is so luxurious it feels like cream and the mild scent is very pleasant.  Like others have said, the lanolin in it keeps skin soft and moisturized even in the winter.  Use two and give one as an extra treat to someone you love!</li>
            <li> Service was excellent and I lovethe product!</li>
            <li> This soap is extremely moisturizing on my very dry winter skin. I love it. Not a huge fan of the old-time soap smell but the quality is worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using lanolin products for more than 30 years! I have searched the world many times over (on the web) looking for high quality lanolin hand (bar) soap after many different products I have found this product to be the finest. If you are a lanolin consumer like me than will you find this product to be topps ! High in quality! Well worth the price and don&#x27;t fall for the look a likes! Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat is the top quality</li>
            <li> Smells old fashioned. Ok in winter.</li>
            <li> I got this because I felt my skin needed something gentle yet moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After showering with this a few times, it became clear that the scent or vapors coming from this bar of soap irritates my eyes.  While in the shower, my eyes get a burning sensation.  Other soaps have never done this to me.  Can&#x27;t be good for my skin if it burns my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this for people with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about my purchase of the Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Soap.  I love the old-fashioned looking label and the smell is very clean.  It smells like true soap should and reminds me of my grandma (but in a good way!)  I tend to have dry skin and am always looking for moisturizing soaps to reduce my dependence on creams and lotions.

However, it does not feel any more moisturizing on my skin than other soaps available on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good, simple soap but not as moisturizing as I was led to believe in the description.</li>
            <li> This is my most  favorite soap of all time!  I will keep it in stock and also give it as gifts.</li>
            <li> Lovely product.  Lasts and lasts and feels nourishing on skin.</li>
            <li> A most excellent soap. Will purchase this again. Arrived in good time and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Soap was a welcomed success in calming my sensitive skin with clean moisture. It lathers beautifully, there is no scent leftover that clashes with a perfume you intend to wear. Just clean, and feel good skin. From head to toe, it&#x27;s the best product I have found and will buy it again. The 5.5 oz. bars are wonderfully substantial. This is an excellent product!</li>
            <li> Great smell. Long lasting. A little harsh. Requires good rinse to keep skin from drying. Will not buy again. I dont think.</li>
            <li> I bought the 3 pack of shave soap and saved some money. Once you try it you will like it.</li>
            <li> I am over 60 and have dry sensitive skin.  This is the only bar soap that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin itchy and flaking - very moisturizing.  the smell is great, as well.  It smells like soap should- pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I have never used any kind of cream on my body but I swear this soap keeps my skin almost young. Just use it in the shower or tub.  It seems to last forever.</li>
            <li> love love love this soap, it just speaks clean- in arid Colorado, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like other soaps.</li>
            <li> There is not a whole lot more to add.  I love the soap and recommend it without reservation.  For those with sensitive skin, this is your soap.</li>
            <li> Great lather and cleans well! Pleasant fragrance</li>
            <li> This lanolin soap has a clean fresh scent.  Used in conjunction with lanolin cream, the skin on my face is no longer itchy and dry. It leaves my skin soft and smooth to the touch for the entire day.  While it&#x27;s worth every penny, I think 3 giant bars will last a year or two.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many soaps.  This one is simple, honest, gentle, and comes from a wonderful place in the world.  It is very kind of all skin types.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin which just seems to get more sensitive every year.  (I&#x27;m in my late thirties.)  I don&#x27;t expect any soap to be truly &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; but, you know, we all get stinky and it&#x27;s natural to want to smell clean again.  When you have dry and/or sensitive skin, it&#x27;s hard to find something that makes you feel clean but doesn&#x27;t strip your skin&#x27;s oils too badly.  It depends a lot on the individual, of course: I know from experience than lanolin is my friend, whereas most nut butters (like shea) cause an allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This and the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap with shikakai are, I think, the only two soaps that have been a good balance for me.  I prefer the Mitchell&#x27;s right now because of the mild, clean scent, its bar form, and because it lasts forever--seriously, these bars are huge, and this three-pack might last me a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to be able to find this locally, but no longer can.  I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries it now.  Yeah, twenty bucks seems like a lot, but for soap that lasts this long and doesn&#x27;t make your skin overreact?  Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> My son bought this. The aroma is fabulous. He uses it in his bathroom, thought he had a deodorizer in there. Smells great.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The Wool Fat (lanolin) in the soap helps keep our skin from being too dry.  This really is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> This soap is great. My bf has dry itchy skin with most soaps but this is the soap we found that works perfectly. We always bought fragrance free and sensitive skin soaps but he would still have the same itchy dry skin. The Wool Fat Soap is great. The smell wasn&#x27;t great when we first started using it but now we don&#x27;t even notice it anymore. If you have issues with bath soaps making you itchy or dry, I highly recommend this Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Soap. I get a thank you card from Mitchell&#x27;s with every order :-)</li>
            <li> Exceeded expectations. Luxurious feeling, moisturizing and lovely scent. I will always use this soap now, wish I had known of it before.</li>
            <li> First purchased this product in the UK.  I was delighted to be able to purchase more.</li>
            <li> I love Mitchell&#x27;s wool fat soap, it&#x27;s great as a face or body soap and has a nice fresh scent. It makes my skin feel very smooth when I use it for a facial or in the shower</li>
            <li> This soap is BIG and luxurious. I love it. Best of all, it&#x27;s a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the soap and shampoo from Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat, as well as the shave soap on occasion. It&#x27;s slick, smells good, and helps my skin. I suffer from serious dry skin issues (which I&#x27;m working to resolve through other avenues as well) but this soap was a staple in the relief of my dry skin. It doesn&#x27;t dry me out like most off the shelf soaps do from the grocery store. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to step up the quality of their soap.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin nice and soft</li>
            <li> I have replaced my french made olive oil soap that I&#x27;ve used for years with this brand of soap. I picked up a bar while away on vacation, in a knitting shop. Well, I&#x27;m so glad I did when I finally opened up the bar and used it in my shower, I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin was. I have normal to dry skin (sometimes itchy from the cold winter and indoor heat) and my skin now feels soft as heck after I dry off from my shower and it even glistens! I&#x27;d highly recommend anyone that has dry skin to try this soap. Im back for a second shipment of it, thought I&#x27;d stick some into some Christmas stockings. Love it. Oh by the way, I paid $12 for a single bar at a tea and wool shop in Seattle. So this is a great deal!</li>
            <li> I had gotten this product on a trip to England and was extremely glad to be able to get it here.  Great soap for winter dry skin or sun tinged summer skin.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t run across this out West, but this is really good soap!! Originally found it at a cigar shop in Cambridge.</li>
            <li> I once purchased this soap while on vacation at a little English shop as per suggestion of the shop keeper. I very much enjoyed using the soap as it was cleansing while non drying and had a very subtle pleasant scent that both men and women can both enjoy, along with good lathering qualities. It&#x27;s a large bar that doesn&#x27;t go &amp;#34;mushy&amp;#34; and lasts quite a while. So I wanted more and was happy to find it available on Amazon, and at a better price than I had originally purchased it. Some things are worth a little splurge.</li>
            <li> Very nice soap...makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin,  so I&#x27;m very picky about the soaps I use.  This soap is great, it&#x27;s not drying, and it has a light clean fragrance, yet it does not irritate my skin.  It also lathers well, and will last a long time because it&#x27;s a hard soap that doesn&#x27;t get mushy when wet.  What else can I say, it&#x27;s a great soap, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love it. Keep using it.</li>
            <li> Not a fan.  Didn&#x27;t like the smell.  Bar is very large and hard to hold.</li>
            <li> This soap is so very gentle on the skin, and it smells divine --- just like clean should smell!  The English are great soap makers -- it lasts forever!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Long lasting</li>
            <li> Nice soap. Smell no so good!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this soap. If it has anything moisturizing in it I would be shocked. This soap is like using old fashioned lye soap. I made the mistake of using this on my face and it took two weeks to recover. I do not recommend this if you have sensitive skin of any kind. Unfortunately I bought three bars :(</li>
            <li> Best soap I&#x27;ve ever used. If it were a little cheaper this would be the only soap in the house. It is great for hand, body, and face.</li>
            <li> Best soap ever. I am a life-long Zest and Irish Spring user - whichever I happened to see first at CostCo was the one I bought. I never gave it much thought until a friend whom I had introduced to wet shaving thanked me with a &#x27;man soap gift basket&#x27;. I tried all the soaps (Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar is a close runner-up) and Mitchell&#x27;s won out. The bars are big! Much bigger than any other bar soap I have used. I work with a lot of oil, grease and solvents - after a while my hands get dry and crack. This soap has been wonderful for keep my hands moisturized and feeling soft.</li>
            <li> This soap is much easier on the skin even than Dove, with very creamy, smooth lather and not at all drying to the skin due to the lanolin content.  Perfume is listed as an ingredient on the label but it must be very mild because I can&#x27;t smell it.  The bars are large and last a long time.  If you are looking for a non-drying, non-irritating rich and smooth bath soap, this is it.  This is the best bath soap I have ever used, far better than anything you can get in the supermarket or drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;epops</li>
            <li> Each bar is worth the extra expense.  It lasts months and you will notice your dry skin doesn&#x27;t itch or flake</li>
            <li> Both products are very,very good!</li>
            <li> I ADORE this soap and I don&#x27;t care that it doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like the shaving cream (which I also have). It helps that my wife adores the smell as well- and the bar lasts a LONG time!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry skin like soap usually does. It even leaves my hands nice and soft after a shower. Get some.</li>
            <li> Women - you need this soap!  I&#x27;ve been using it for years now and yes - an expensive bar of soap but your skin feels like silk and ladies, we&#x27;re worth it.  This is by far the best buy I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  We have been using it for several years.  Terrific!</li>
            <li> This soap is freakin&#x27; awesome. Smells great. I wanted something that I could use that wouldn&#x27;t dry my skin out and wasn&#x27;t too girly. This fits the bill perfectly. I love this soap. I also use the shaving soap by the same name.</li>
            <li> Nice big, heavy bar of soap. Drop it on your toe ad you&#x27;&#x27;ll find out. Outlast six bars of Dove or what I call &amp;#34;airy&amp;#34; soap. No commercial soap maker&#x27;s dream of the perfect fragrance - - &amp;#34;Who was that lovely pomegranate that just walked  - did I detect undertones of cherry bark and ....?  I just want to smell clean. this will do it.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing! Love the lather and what it does for my skin! I have used L&#x27;Occitane Almond Oil bath wash for years. Still had crusty heels and dry skin. Not with this soap! No more white heels!</li>
            <li> Mitchell&#x27;s is simply one of the finest soaps available. I was raised with this soap, to me this is &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34;. I took it for granted that I could just get it anywhere. There is no perfume, this is the smell of raw lanolyn. I give this as a gift to friends that I know appreciate the finer things in life. Everyone that ask where they can get more! Perfect for face washing, but great as a whole body soap.</li>
            <li> Love the soap and it&#x27;s great for the skin!  It has a nice fresh sent and makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised and in very good condition we love the soap and use it daily and have for several years.</li>
            <li> First I have to say I love Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat shaving soap. It&#x27;s the one higher priced shaving soap I will keep in my den. One of the things I really love about MWF shaving soap is the scent; it&#x27;s got a fresh, old fashioned tone to it that I really enjoy, especially in the colder months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting the MWF body bar to smell at least a little like their shaving soap, but it doesn&#x27;t even come close. I can&#x27;t quite put my finger (or my nose) on what exactly their body bar smells like but it&#x27;s bland and not a scent that will inspire me to reach for this stuff often…if ever again. And, of course, I bought three bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any complaints about the conditioning or cleaning aspects of this soap. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and can get away with using any ol&#x27; soap, but another aspect of MWF shaving soap that I love is how the lanolin leaves my face feeling after a shave. Smooth and hydrated. The body bar left my skin suit feeling OK but I&#x27;m more than a little annoyed that this stuff doesn&#x27;t stand up to bars I get for half the price at my local close-out stores.</li>
            <li> Gonna order more.  My 100-year old client used to pick this up on her vacations to NC and she told me about it.  I checked it out; getting three bars for myself and my girls; each girl loves the clean smell and I like the clean smell and the long time it lasts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed  this in a different listing, but I&#x27;ll repeat it here briefly.  My skin gets VERY &amp;#34;dusty&amp;#34; dry with other soaps, and this stuff leaves it feeling great.  Love this soap!</li>
            <li> This gentle soap makes your skin feel smooth and clean. Highly Recommended. It lasts a long time and the scent is mild and very pleasant.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful soap! The bars are big, but not uncomfortable to hold on to. I like the mild scent (even though I would not have been disappointed with a more woolly scent.) It lathers beautifully, and there is something extremely pleasing about just holding the soap in your hands. It&#x27;s the smoothest, silkiest bar I have ever held. I know that sounds a bit funny, but I almost get giddy when it&#x27;s shower time. I have a feeling it&#x27;s a very long-lasting soap too. I am a convert for sure, and I&#x27;ll be gifting some to friends and family.</li>
