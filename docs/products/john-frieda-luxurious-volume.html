            <li>Works great and cleans hair well.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, but skinny and likes to hug my head, this helps the volume a great deal.</li>
            <li>Worked great to give my hair volume.</li>

            <li>It smells great too.</li>
            <li>This is very good shampoo and it smells nice, too.</li>
            <li>Cleans well gives nice volume, and it is also quite nourishing too!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This works good for me and smells quite pleasant without being overly stinky.  </li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>Good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This combinaion worked fairly well on my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair looks so good.  </li>
            <li>I thought he&#x27;d overpaid, but upon using it found I loved it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good shampoo.</li>
            <li>It has good body and shine.</li>
            <li>that this was good for helping hair look thicker and got it.  </li>
            <li>Not so good product.</li>
            <li>the shampoo good?</li>
            <li>The price is good when I bought it though, so No complains</li>
            <li>Word to the wise</li>
            <li>Smells good and cleans your hair...</li>
            <li>i have always loved john frieda products and i plan on buy this again.</li>
            <li>I have to wash my hair every day because it looks greasy otherwise &amp; have seen good results every day.</li>
            <li>Jon Frieda line of hair care products are exceptional.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Better still it doesn&#x27;t look or feel coated or fly away.</li>
            <li>Shampoo smells good &amp; lathers up nicely</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>and I was pretty impressed with it.</li>
            <li>glad to say John Frieda !</li>
            <li>Love that feeling!</li>
            <li>Oh my goodness, I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>I love my hair now!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: this is a pretty good shampoo (and conditioner combo) for fine/thin hair, but make sure you clarify with a silicone-free shampoo or else you&#x27;ll never get those awesome bouncy results again.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for fine, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>I could not use any kind of conditioner because then my hair would be too limp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This does the job nicely.</li>
            <li>Good bargain &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li>so I can think about that as a plus, but it also wasn&#x27;t effective either.</li>
            <li>Like the shampoo, it works well and smells nice</li>
            <li>it smells nice and lathers well</li>
            <li>i told you before its a good quality recommend for the damage hair love it if its finish i will buy more</li>
            <li>This is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Love this nice smelling, body and shine boosting miracle in a bottle</li>
            <li>Although I have used John Frieda products and liked most of them...</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells wonderful and creates soft volume.</li>
            <li>Soft shampoo, smells great!</li>
            <li>I have very fine textured hair.  </li>
            <li>The texture is pleasant and smell is mild as well.</li>
            <li>I switch shampoos regularly cause nothing seems that great to stick with, but I am super happy with john Freida!</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I love both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>and is now my favorite choice.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and feel of using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>the dozen I have tried, this Conditioner from John Frieda (used along with the Frieda Volumizing Conditioner counterpart, does a better job than anything else I have found.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE THIS.....</li>
            <li>but I do like the hair care product and plan to order more of his products.</li>
            <li>THEY work better than anything I have ever tried....</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a bit better product, but it leaves a coating on my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>Maybe this was the shampoo that would be even better than the two</li>
            <li>I needed a shampoo that cuts static electricity.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo...</li>
            <li>wonderful volume, exactly same as advertised !</li>
            <li>I thought John Frieda shampoo was much better.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by Paula Begoun for fine/thin hair, and I really love it.</li>
            <li>I am really glad I found this product</li>
            <li>This shampoo, conditioner and the John Frieda Luxurious Volume Building Mousse do a much better job at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I think this shampoo resulted in more &#x27;frizz&#x27; than volume, but a smoothing serum did help to manage that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the way this shampoo smells.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 or more years now.</li>
            <li>This works awesome too if you need an extra boost...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this shampoo..</li>
            <li>I will be buying more from the John Frieda line.</li>
            <li>This line of products really plumps up the relaxed hair, which experienced some damage.  </li>
            <li>Many make promises, but John Frieda delivers.  </li>
            <li>Many are drying, and most don&#x27;t make any difference.</li>
            <li>So for years I&#x27;ve just relied on gels etc to create more fullness.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>, it looks healthy &amp; has body &amp; bounce in it.</li>
            <li>Nice rich lather.</li>
            <li>When I rinsed my hair with luke warm water, my hair was clean and all the greasy residue was gone.</li>
            <li>I like the nice clean scent.</li>
            <li>and I feel very clean after using it.</li>
            <li>While I wouldn&#x27;t say this shampoo provides more fullness than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, it truly IS a good volumizing shampoo, and it does a great job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t mind strong perfume smells (and many people don&#x27;t mind)</li>
            <li>so I was surprised somewhat by just how good and effective it is.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair nice and full which makes them easy to style.</li>
            <li>made it feel more fine than it already is.</li>
            <li>and I like how it makes you hair feel clean and never oily!</li>
            <li>Along with many of their other wonderful products...  </li>
            <li>Another huge plus is that it&#x27;s made here in the US. :-)</li>
            <li>Makes my hair much healthier and smells really good.</li>
            <li>The best thing about it was that I got it for a super low price</li>
            <li>It gives me a lot of lather and has really done a good job of making my hair feel more full.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recomend</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m surprised by how many good reviews it has.</li>
            <li>It lathered decently when massaged into my scalp and did a good job removing the excess oil in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Nioxin shampoo which made my hair feel strong &amp; had the volume.</li>
            <li>This shampoo doesnt make my hair feel strong.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and it keeps my hair healthy and full.</li>
            <li>I get the best results by alternating this shampoo/conditioner with a cheap &#x27;cone-free shampoo to clarify my hair every other wash.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know anyone with fine hair who has ever gone to the beach for a swim and gets out of the water and goes &amp;#34;gee, this saltwater did wonders for my hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this shampoo makes it feel and look thicker.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to people with fine hair.</li>
            <li>I comb my fingers through and it untangles just fine.</li>
            <li>I like the price, I like how it works with my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had extremely fine hair and, let&#x27;s face it, once your over 65</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with how much body and volume this shampoo ( and conditioner) give my very fine hair.</li>
            <li>I will buy it again, it makes your hair really full, excellent product, I recommend it, I will try other products  from Frieda</li>
            <li>Leaved my hair smooth, wavy and &#x27;appearing&#x27; thicker.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you stuck your finger in a light socket.</li>
            <li>you stuck your finger in a light socket.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair fuller and thicker-looking without drying it out and it still looks great the next day.  </li>
            <li>Even after conditioner it wont leave hair smooth.</li>
            <li>Before using this shampoo, I&#x27;d been using a cheap silicone-free shampoo (herbal essences volumizing), and didn&#x27;t like how crunchy it made</li>
            <li>If they had a fragrance free version I&#x27;d try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m cancelling my Amazon Subscribe and Save for all John Frieda products since they are not Cruelty Free...</li>
            <li>Yes, Fekkai smells great, but that alone does not make me want to spend all that extra money.</li>
            <li>I used the old formula for years and loved it.</li>
            <li>my hair thins, I have become more interested in using &#x27;volumizing&#x27; products.</li>
            <li>If you try to brush it during the day or at night, the static electricity is overwhelming and you would never be able to get it back into any style, even a pony tail, without looking like</li>
            <li>The reviews excited me.</li>
            <li>It is soft, shiny, holds style better and seems healthy.  </li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean after I use it</li>
            <li>I also am allergic to many products and I am glad I found one that does not cause me to break out in rashes like my old shampoo.</li>
            <li>This great smelling shampoo lathers well, but doesn&#x27;t strip and dry the hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and shiny</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this shampoo or it&#x27;s conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing special</li>
            <li>It smells nice and makes hair soft.</li>
            <li>I combine it with the John Frieda Mousse and it gives my very thinning hair more volume than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I read such good reviews on this John Frieda line</li>
            <li>I have been using the John Frieda hairspray for a month or so and decided to go with the full line including Mousse and&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo and don&#x27;t regret the decision.</li>
            <li>When companies make a superior product they sometimes scale back the ingredients and just coast by on the name alone.</li>
            <li>This product is OK, but I much prefer the Loreal EverPure volume shampoo and condtioner.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say it really gives my hair more volume.</li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>and this is the best shampoo I have found to really boost the volume without weighing it down and making it greasy.</li>
            <li>If I use JF conditioner, it doesn’t really do much to untangle, but when I style my hair it feels soooo light and full!</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying this shampoo/conditioner smells great and DOES give my fine hair a little volume boost.</li>
            <li>The Nexxus Emergencee is great for stopping hair breakage due to chemical/heat damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I picked this up at CVS when they were having a super sale.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best product for everyone, but if you have a similar hair type you should definitely give it a shot!  </li>
            <li>I have very fine blonde hair, and this makes it shiny and full!</li>
            <li>my hair really didn&#x27;t feel any different, didn&#x27;t feel especially clean or special in any way.</li>
            <li>This shampoo makes my hair look thicker, super healthy, and super soft.  </li>
            <li>Another positive is the light fragrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li>(I have that wonderful problem where my hair is somehow dry but greasy at the same time).  </li>
            <li>It really thickens my fine hair.</li>
            <li>a liked the way this left after using it couple of times.</li>
            <li>This shampoo gives me volume and my hair which is naturally wavy is more manageable.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely worth a shot</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner made my hair &amp;#34;silky smooth&amp;#34; but did not add more volume as my old volumizer shampoo.</li>
            <li>I like the set, they’ve made my hair feel a lot fuller, bouncier, more alive.</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>that it really gets your hair clean.</li>
            <li>I have straight, oily hair and am not one who &amp;#34;primps&amp;#34; so I just used this to clean my hair.</li>
            <li>Overall, i&#x27;m glad i tried it because in the end i was happy to go back to my old faithful Pantene.</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo that I could find that gives my blonde angel hair volume and body that makes it look great</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first wash with this John Frieda shampoo and the matching conditioner left my hair soft, shiny, volumized, gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I have had baby fine hair my whole life, and now that I&#x27;m getting older it is thinning, as well.</li>
            <li>I have tried many many shampoos for fine and thin hair.  </li>
            <li>and you would never be able to get it back into any style, even a pony tail, without looking like</li>
            <li>I think this shampoo really works to help hair look thick and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>First ingredient is Laurel Sulfate.</li>
            <li>Probably better priced products than this that would do the same job.</li>
            <li>My hair is definitely thicker, has more body and volume.</li>
            <li>My hair feels bouncy and light but has considerable volume and softness.</li>
            <li>I picked up a small trial size tube of this in the local drugstore and am so happy I did!  </li>
            <li>Overall really pleased with the find.</li>
            <li>I dried and styled my hair and could not believe how good my hair looked.</li>
            <li>It produces a lot of foam, really leaves my hair feeling clean, and leaves my flat and fine hair with lots of volume and fullness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel clean, soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>I have tried different volume shampoos and most are very drying and don&#x27; work.  </li>
            <li>I also occasionally use the conditioner, and that is good too, but not really necessary to achieve some fullness.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, smells good and gives my poor flat fine hair more volume than when I wasn&#x27;t using anything.  </li>
            <li>have have very fine thin hair and the entire line has helped my to able to style my hair and keep the style most of the day.</li>
            <li>I so hoped i would see some positive change</li>
            <li>Great product and worth the few extra dollars in any drug store.  </li>
            <li>BOUNCY, FULL OF VOLUME, SOFT HAIR....</li>
            <li>This is just as good if not better than those 16 dollar shampoos.</li>
            <li>I have colored red hair and found the shampoo caused my color to fade very quickly.  </li>
            <li>nice keeps my hair thick full and shiny</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t justify spending nearly 60 bucks on 2 bottles of hair product when something equally good costs 10 bucks or less.</li>
            <li>The John Frieda products leave my hair soft, smooth,  full, thick and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have medium-length, fine, blonde, naturally-wavy, thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell strength daily shampoo and Folicure shampoo for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>actually makes my fine hair look and feel thicker...great lather and shine when using it&lt;br /&gt;have</li>
            <li>I have always had baby fine hair and recently it seems to be getting thinner as well.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair cut very short.  </li>
            <li>I am a female in my mid-20s with A LOT of  fine straight hair that is med-long.</li>
            <li>- thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>None of them really thicken the hair permanently.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t realize that this was going to leave my hair really greasy.</li>
            <li>Will have to use longer to see how well it really works.</li>
            <li>This conditioner really does cause your hair to look thicker.</li>
            <li>and I go through the shampoo 3x&#x27;s as fast as the conditioner, which is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should have read the ingredients more carefully instead of trusting the name.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much change in the volume</li>
            <li>I will be saving so much also.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, I really didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much after you wash it off.  </li>
            <li>and I am very selective to odor.</li>
            <li>All works very well here.</li>
            <li>I get a much nicer hairdo which lasts without hairspray..</li>
            <li>Also, I found my scalp to be very itchy.  </li>
            <li>and like it almost as much as the spray.  </li>
            <li>This product did what it said it would do - my hair really did look and feel fuller and thicker.  </li>
            <li>No different than cheap drug store products.</li>
            <li>but i didn&#x27;t see much if any.</li>
            <li>My hair looks so much healthier and fuller.</li>
            <li>His prices are extremely reasonable for salon grade products.  </li>
            <li>Their shampoo is very drying</li>
            <li>Did not show as much volume aspromised</li>
            <li>It really does the job without adding an  heaviness to the hair follicles.</li>
            <li>This product really boosts volume.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After using them my hair is pretty light although a bit dry, but what life it had is still lost within the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard for me to find a good product for a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the thick rich lather and smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than other much ballyhooed brands of high-end products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been cursed with fine hair my whole life and struggled with the flatness for too long</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t really see much volume.. not a fan of this particular line..</li>
            <li>I was so excited that maybe I&#x27;d finally found my HG.</li>
            <li>a lot better than other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I found my new shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do well with helping add volume but a decent product</li>
            <li>The main downfall here is the sea salt.</li>
            <li>Be realistic -</li>
            <li>I use the first shampoo listed for the first lather and finish the last with the folicure.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>and I had high hopes.  </li>
            <li>Too bad, because their original product was great.</li>
            <li>decided I would spend a little more and go for John Frieda.</li>
            <li>My hair is very short and now, instead of just lying there flat and sparse-looking, it actually has fullness and covers more of my scalp!  </li>
            <li>I just wrote a fairly in depth review for the John Frieda Luxurious Volume Thickening Conditioner for Thin Hair used in conjunction with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Stripped newly colored hair &amp; hair like straw</li>
            <li>Truly like this new product.</li>
            <li>Will have to wait until new hair grows in.</li>
            <li>If I use a deep conditioner, it detangles and combs out easily, but my hair is kinda flat afterwards.</li>
            <li>Normally have so much static electricity in hair during the winter time but no static with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t see much difference in volume after using the entire line.</li>
            <li>The resulting fragrance is nice and subtle.)</li>
            <li>I did notice a little more volume in my roots but nothing major.</li>
            <li>My significant other uses this shampoo</li>
            <li>Have used Nioxcin in the past, which is more costly, and have now switched to this shampoo.</li>
            <li>perfectly straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this shampoo several different ways, showering at night the day before, in the morning the day of, and right before going out.</li>
            <li>That is kind of hard to find in a volume boosting shampoo!</li>
            <li>After using it the hair is lush and soft!</li>
            <li>I only washed with it about five times before deciding to take the \\&quot;no-poo\\&quot; route (not as a result form any negatives effects from this product), but for me it really did live up to its claim of thickening the hair form the inside out.</li>
            <li>(If you want sexy smelling hair, spritz a bit ( not a lot) of your perfume on wet hair, comb through, and blow dry or not.</li>
            <li>I have used Paul Mitchell, Living Proof, Loreal Volumetry Anti-Gravity Effect Volume Shampoo For Fine Hair, Ouidad playcurl volumizing and Pantene to name a few.  </li>
            <li>I have thin fine hair so finding a good shampoo that does not leave build up is hard to find.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of shampoos from cheap to high end, western and Japanese, co-washing, going silicone free, etc, but no matter what my hair always falls into a flat helmet after a few hours.</li>
            <li>On top of it all, there is little to no volume effect compared with cheaper drugstore brands mentioned above.</li>
            <li>in all this was such a disappointment, for no other reason than it does exactly the opposite of what it claims.at night, the static electricity is overwhelming</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need additional shine as my hair naturally has that, so I steer clear of oils.</li>
            <li>It is soft instead of frizzy and crackly.</li>
            <li>but when I use this shampoo its like I just got my hair trimmed and is so soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>Actual, my hair was much flatter with J. Frieda.  </li>
            <li>it also makes my hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li>, if you have sensitive skin I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Made my hair so silky soft.</li>
            <li>My Hair feels so soft and manageable now.</li>
            <li>It has made my hair soft and voluminious</li>
            <li>My hair felt soft after shampooing.  </li>
            <li>My hair had just as much body and thickness a week later; (I shampoo weekly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My natural textured hair is stronger and thicker than the relaxed portion.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see a big difference in volume when I used this.</li>
            <li>finally figured out that this shampoo is loaded with silicones that will eventually build up and weigh down fine hair.</li>
            <li>It felt heavy and my hair did not feel clean.</li>
            <li>Have been a regular user for the past one year and love the product.</li>
            <li>In fact, it did nothing diferent to my hair, cause I have a normal hair without any specific problems.</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin hair, and this plumps it up.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine thin hair</li>
            <li>I have very fine and thin hair.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s chemically strong enough to do that, I&#x27;m not sure I want it in my hair.</li>
            <li>It certainly does that to your hair the day of washing or even the second day, but after washing with it a few times I found my hair was more oily than usual.</li>
            <li>So far haven&#x27;t used it enough to judge it.</li>
            <li>So far it doesn&#x27;t feel to coarse, and my head tolerates it.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find this one actually worked.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine, thin, super-straight Asian hair, and was on the hunt for a new volumizing shampoo.</li>
            <li>But after finishing the whole container of shampoo and conditioner, I have to say &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34;  My hair is noticeably fuller without being coarse or rough.  </li>
            <li>Does not leave residue and does not dry my hair out.</li>
            <li>The formula of the previous JF was thick and rich, while this new one was no better than the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>Before this, no other volumizing shampoo gave the same results as Fekkai.</li>
            <li>I have to use a large portion compare to other soap to wash all my hair!  </li>
            <li>In other words it does not make my hair look thick any more</li>
            <li>But, the heavy perfume smell coming off my hair was SO strong that I had a headache less than an hour after using it.  </li>
            <li>I have super thin, really oily, long hair</li>
            <li>Otherwise, my hair becomes limp and slick, and gets greasy much more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t endure a daily migraine for thick full hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this helps give me that fuller look without leaving a film behind.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I am always in search of shampoo to try out for my fine / thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have had fine / thin hair all my life.</li>
            <li>your hair is fine or thin or chemically damaged/fried, these product will help restore and give beauty and volume/thickness/body to the hair.</li>
            <li>Then they changed the formula and now this new formula does what all other shampoos do.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t really bad, but it wasn&#x27;t really good either.</li>

            <li> Smells good and cleans your hair...</li>
            <li> i have always loved john frieda products and i plan on buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have to wash my hair every day because it looks greasy otherwise &amp; have seen good results every day.</li>
            <li> Jon Frieda line of hair care products are exceptional.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Better still it doesn&#x27;t look or feel coated or fly away.</li>
            <li> Shampoo smells good &amp; lathers up nicely</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> and I was pretty impressed with it.</li>
            <li> glad to say John Frieda !</li>
            <li> Love that feeling!</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness, I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> I love my hair now!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion: this is a pretty good shampoo (and conditioner combo) for fine/thin hair, but make sure you clarify with a silicone-free shampoo or else you&#x27;ll never get those awesome bouncy results again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for fine, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> I could not use any kind of conditioner because then my hair would be too limp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> Good bargain &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li> so I can think about that as a plus, but it also wasn&#x27;t effective either.</li>
            <li> Like the shampoo, it works well and smells nice</li>
            <li> it smells nice and lathers well</li>
            <li> i told you before its a good quality recommend for the damage hair love it if its finish i will buy more</li>
            <li> This is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> Love this nice smelling, body and shine boosting miracle in a bottle</li>
            <li> Although I have used John Frieda products and liked most of them...</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells wonderful and creates soft volume.</li>
            <li> Soft shampoo, smells great!</li>
            <li> I have very fine textured hair.  </li>
            <li> The texture is pleasant and smell is mild as well.</li>
            <li> I switch shampoos regularly cause nothing seems that great to stick with, but I am super happy with john Freida!</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I love both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> and is now my favorite choice.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feel of using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> the dozen I have tried, this Conditioner from John Frieda (used along with the Frieda Volumizing Conditioner counterpart, does a better job than anything else I have found.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE THIS.....</li>
            <li> but I do like the hair care product and plan to order more of his products.</li>
            <li> THEY work better than anything I have ever tried....</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a bit better product, but it leaves a coating on my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> Maybe this was the shampoo that would be even better than the two</li>
            <li> I needed a shampoo that cuts static electricity.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo...</li>
            <li> wonderful volume, exactly same as advertised !</li>
            <li> I thought John Frieda shampoo was much better.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by Paula Begoun for fine/thin hair, and I really love it.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I found this product</li>
            <li> This shampoo, conditioner and the John Frieda Luxurious Volume Building Mousse do a much better job at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I think this shampoo resulted in more &#x27;frizz&#x27; than volume, but a smoothing serum did help to manage that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the way this shampoo smells.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 or more years now.</li>
            <li> This works awesome too if you need an extra boost...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this shampoo..</li>
            <li> I will be buying more from the John Frieda line.</li>
            <li> This line of products really plumps up the relaxed hair, which experienced some damage.  </li>
            <li> Many make promises, but John Frieda delivers.  </li>
            <li> Many are drying, and most don&#x27;t make any difference.</li>
            <li> So for years I&#x27;ve just relied on gels etc to create more fullness.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> , it looks healthy &amp; has body &amp; bounce in it.</li>
            <li> Nice rich lather.</li>
            <li> When I rinsed my hair with luke warm water, my hair was clean and all the greasy residue was gone.</li>
            <li> I like the nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> and I feel very clean after using it.</li>
            <li> While I wouldn&#x27;t say this shampoo provides more fullness than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, it truly IS a good volumizing shampoo, and it does a great job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t mind strong perfume smells (and many people don&#x27;t mind)</li>
            <li> so I was surprised somewhat by just how good and effective it is.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair nice and full which makes them easy to style.</li>
            <li> made it feel more fine than it already is.</li>
            <li> and I like how it makes you hair feel clean and never oily!</li>
            <li> Along with many of their other wonderful products...  </li>
            <li> Another huge plus is that it&#x27;s made here in the US. :-)</li>
            <li> Makes my hair much healthier and smells really good.</li>
            <li> The best thing about it was that I got it for a super low price</li>
            <li> It gives me a lot of lather and has really done a good job of making my hair feel more full.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recomend</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m surprised by how many good reviews it has.</li>
            <li> It lathered decently when massaged into my scalp and did a good job removing the excess oil in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Nioxin shampoo which made my hair feel strong &amp; had the volume.</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesnt make my hair feel strong.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and it keeps my hair healthy and full.</li>
            <li> I get the best results by alternating this shampoo/conditioner with a cheap &#x27;cone-free shampoo to clarify my hair every other wash.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anyone with fine hair who has ever gone to the beach for a swim and gets out of the water and goes &amp;#34;gee, this saltwater did wonders for my hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this shampoo makes it feel and look thicker.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to people with fine hair.</li>
            <li> I comb my fingers through and it untangles just fine.</li>
            <li> I like the price, I like how it works with my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had extremely fine hair and, let&#x27;s face it, once your over 65</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with how much body and volume this shampoo ( and conditioner) give my very fine hair.</li>
            <li> I will buy it again, it makes your hair really full, excellent product, I recommend it, I will try other products  from Frieda</li>
            <li> Leaved my hair smooth, wavy and &#x27;appearing&#x27; thicker.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you stuck your finger in a light socket.</li>
            <li> you stuck your finger in a light socket.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair fuller and thicker-looking without drying it out and it still looks great the next day.  </li>
            <li> Even after conditioner it wont leave hair smooth.</li>
            <li> Before using this shampoo, I&#x27;d been using a cheap silicone-free shampoo (herbal essences volumizing), and didn&#x27;t like how crunchy it made</li>
            <li> If they had a fragrance free version I&#x27;d try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cancelling my Amazon Subscribe and Save for all John Frieda products since they are not Cruelty Free...</li>
            <li> Yes, Fekkai smells great, but that alone does not make me want to spend all that extra money.</li>
            <li> I used the old formula for years and loved it.</li>
            <li> my hair thins, I have become more interested in using &#x27;volumizing&#x27; products.</li>
            <li> If you try to brush it during the day or at night, the static electricity is overwhelming and you would never be able to get it back into any style, even a pony tail, without looking like</li>
            <li> The reviews excited me.</li>
            <li> It is soft, shiny, holds style better and seems healthy.  </li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean after I use it</li>
            <li> I also am allergic to many products and I am glad I found one that does not cause me to break out in rashes like my old shampoo.</li>
            <li> This great smelling shampoo lathers well, but doesn&#x27;t strip and dry the hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels clean and shiny</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this shampoo or it&#x27;s conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing special</li>
            <li> It smells nice and makes hair soft.</li>
            <li> I combine it with the John Frieda Mousse and it gives my very thinning hair more volume than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I read such good reviews on this John Frieda line</li>
            <li> I have been using the John Frieda hairspray for a month or so and decided to go with the full line including Mousse and&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo and don&#x27;t regret the decision.</li>
            <li> When companies make a superior product they sometimes scale back the ingredients and just coast by on the name alone.</li>
            <li> This product is OK, but I much prefer the Loreal EverPure volume shampoo and condtioner.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say it really gives my hair more volume.</li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> and this is the best shampoo I have found to really boost the volume without weighing it down and making it greasy.</li>
            <li> If I use JF conditioner, it doesn’t really do much to untangle, but when I style my hair it feels soooo light and full!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying this shampoo/conditioner smells great and DOES give my fine hair a little volume boost.</li>
            <li> The Nexxus Emergencee is great for stopping hair breakage due to chemical/heat damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I picked this up at CVS when they were having a super sale.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best product for everyone, but if you have a similar hair type you should definitely give it a shot!  </li>
            <li> I have very fine blonde hair, and this makes it shiny and full!</li>
            <li> my hair really didn&#x27;t feel any different, didn&#x27;t feel especially clean or special in any way.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair look thicker, super healthy, and super soft.  </li>
            <li> Another positive is the light fragrance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> (I have that wonderful problem where my hair is somehow dry but greasy at the same time).  </li>
            <li> It really thickens my fine hair.</li>
            <li> a liked the way this left after using it couple of times.</li>
            <li> This shampoo gives me volume and my hair which is naturally wavy is more manageable.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely worth a shot</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner made my hair &amp;#34;silky smooth&amp;#34; but did not add more volume as my old volumizer shampoo.</li>
            <li> I like the set, they’ve made my hair feel a lot fuller, bouncier, more alive.</li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> that it really gets your hair clean.</li>
            <li> I have straight, oily hair and am not one who &amp;#34;primps&amp;#34; so I just used this to clean my hair.</li>
            <li> Overall, i&#x27;m glad i tried it because in the end i was happy to go back to my old faithful Pantene.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo that I could find that gives my blonde angel hair volume and body that makes it look great</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first wash with this John Frieda shampoo and the matching conditioner left my hair soft, shiny, volumized, gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I have had baby fine hair my whole life, and now that I&#x27;m getting older it is thinning, as well.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many shampoos for fine and thin hair.  </li>
            <li> and you would never be able to get it back into any style, even a pony tail, without looking like</li>
            <li> I think this shampoo really works to help hair look thick and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> First ingredient is Laurel Sulfate.</li>
            <li> Probably better priced products than this that would do the same job.</li>
            <li> My hair is definitely thicker, has more body and volume.</li>
            <li> My hair feels bouncy and light but has considerable volume and softness.</li>
            <li> I picked up a small trial size tube of this in the local drugstore and am so happy I did!  </li>
            <li> Overall really pleased with the find.</li>
            <li> I dried and styled my hair and could not believe how good my hair looked.</li>
            <li> It produces a lot of foam, really leaves my hair feeling clean, and leaves my flat and fine hair with lots of volume and fullness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel clean, soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> I have tried different volume shampoos and most are very drying and don&#x27; work.  </li>
            <li> I also occasionally use the conditioner, and that is good too, but not really necessary to achieve some fullness.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, smells good and gives my poor flat fine hair more volume than when I wasn&#x27;t using anything.  </li>
            <li> have have very fine thin hair and the entire line has helped my to able to style my hair and keep the style most of the day.</li>
            <li> I so hoped i would see some positive change</li>
            <li> Great product and worth the few extra dollars in any drug store.  </li>
            <li> BOUNCY, FULL OF VOLUME, SOFT HAIR....</li>
            <li> This is just as good if not better than those 16 dollar shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have colored red hair and found the shampoo caused my color to fade very quickly.  </li>
            <li> nice keeps my hair thick full and shiny</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t justify spending nearly 60 bucks on 2 bottles of hair product when something equally good costs 10 bucks or less.</li>
            <li> The John Frieda products leave my hair soft, smooth,  full, thick and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have medium-length, fine, blonde, naturally-wavy, thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell strength daily shampoo and Folicure shampoo for fine hair.  </li>
            <li> actually makes my fine hair look and feel thicker...great lather and shine when using it&lt;br /&gt;have</li>
            <li> I have always had baby fine hair and recently it seems to be getting thinner as well.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair cut very short.  </li>
            <li> I am a female in my mid-20s with A LOT of  fine straight hair that is med-long.</li>
            <li> - thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> None of them really thicken the hair permanently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t realize that this was going to leave my hair really greasy.</li>
            <li> Will have to use longer to see how well it really works.</li>
            <li> This conditioner really does cause your hair to look thicker.</li>
            <li> and I go through the shampoo 3x&#x27;s as fast as the conditioner, which is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have read the ingredients more carefully instead of trusting the name.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much change in the volume</li>
            <li> I will be saving so much also.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, I really didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much after you wash it off.  </li>
            <li> and I am very selective to odor.</li>
            <li> All works very well here.</li>
            <li> I get a much nicer hairdo which lasts without hairspray..</li>
            <li> Also, I found my scalp to be very itchy.  </li>
            <li> and like it almost as much as the spray.  </li>
            <li> This product did what it said it would do - my hair really did look and feel fuller and thicker.  </li>
            <li> No different than cheap drug store products.</li>
            <li> but i didn&#x27;t see much if any.</li>
            <li> My hair looks so much healthier and fuller.</li>
            <li> His prices are extremely reasonable for salon grade products.  </li>
            <li> Their shampoo is very drying</li>
            <li> Did not show as much volume aspromised</li>
            <li> It really does the job without adding an  heaviness to the hair follicles.</li>
            <li> This product really boosts volume.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using them my hair is pretty light although a bit dry, but what life it had is still lost within the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to find a good product for a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the thick rich lather and smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than other much ballyhooed brands of high-end products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cursed with fine hair my whole life and struggled with the flatness for too long</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t really see much volume.. not a fan of this particular line..</li>
            <li> I was so excited that maybe I&#x27;d finally found my HG.</li>
            <li> a lot better than other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I found my new shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do well with helping add volume but a decent product</li>
            <li> The main downfall here is the sea salt.</li>
            <li> Be realistic -</li>
            <li> I use the first shampoo listed for the first lather and finish the last with the folicure.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> and I had high hopes.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, because their original product was great.</li>
            <li> decided I would spend a little more and go for John Frieda.</li>
            <li> My hair is very short and now, instead of just lying there flat and sparse-looking, it actually has fullness and covers more of my scalp!  </li>
            <li> I just wrote a fairly in depth review for the John Frieda Luxurious Volume Thickening Conditioner for Thin Hair used in conjunction with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Stripped newly colored hair &amp; hair like straw</li>
            <li> Truly like this new product.</li>
            <li> Will have to wait until new hair grows in.</li>
            <li> If I use a deep conditioner, it detangles and combs out easily, but my hair is kinda flat afterwards.</li>
            <li> Normally have so much static electricity in hair during the winter time but no static with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t see much difference in volume after using the entire line.</li>
            <li> The resulting fragrance is nice and subtle.)</li>
            <li> I did notice a little more volume in my roots but nothing major.</li>
            <li> My significant other uses this shampoo</li>
            <li> Have used Nioxcin in the past, which is more costly, and have now switched to this shampoo.</li>
            <li> perfectly straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this shampoo several different ways, showering at night the day before, in the morning the day of, and right before going out.</li>
            <li> That is kind of hard to find in a volume boosting shampoo!</li>
            <li> After using it the hair is lush and soft!</li>
            <li> I only washed with it about five times before deciding to take the \\&quot;no-poo\\&quot; route (not as a result form any negatives effects from this product), but for me it really did live up to its claim of thickening the hair form the inside out.</li>
            <li> (If you want sexy smelling hair, spritz a bit ( not a lot) of your perfume on wet hair, comb through, and blow dry or not.</li>
            <li> I have used Paul Mitchell, Living Proof, Loreal Volumetry Anti-Gravity Effect Volume Shampoo For Fine Hair, Ouidad playcurl volumizing and Pantene to name a few.  </li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair so finding a good shampoo that does not leave build up is hard to find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of shampoos from cheap to high end, western and Japanese, co-washing, going silicone free, etc, but no matter what my hair always falls into a flat helmet after a few hours.</li>
            <li> On top of it all, there is little to no volume effect compared with cheaper drugstore brands mentioned above.</li>
            <li> in all this was such a disappointment, for no other reason than it does exactly the opposite of what it claims.at night, the static electricity is overwhelming</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need additional shine as my hair naturally has that, so I steer clear of oils.</li>
            <li> It is soft instead of frizzy and crackly.</li>
            <li> but when I use this shampoo its like I just got my hair trimmed and is so soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> Actual, my hair was much flatter with J. Frieda.  </li>
            <li> it also makes my hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li> , if you have sensitive skin I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Made my hair so silky soft.</li>
            <li> My Hair feels so soft and manageable now.</li>
            <li> It has made my hair soft and voluminious</li>
            <li> My hair felt soft after shampooing.  </li>
            <li> My hair had just as much body and thickness a week later; (I shampoo weekly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My natural textured hair is stronger and thicker than the relaxed portion.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see a big difference in volume when I used this.</li>
            <li> finally figured out that this shampoo is loaded with silicones that will eventually build up and weigh down fine hair.</li>
            <li> It felt heavy and my hair did not feel clean.</li>
            <li> Have been a regular user for the past one year and love the product.</li>
            <li> In fact, it did nothing diferent to my hair, cause I have a normal hair without any specific problems.</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair, and this plumps it up.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair</li>
            <li> I have very fine and thin hair.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s chemically strong enough to do that, I&#x27;m not sure I want it in my hair.</li>
            <li> It certainly does that to your hair the day of washing or even the second day, but after washing with it a few times I found my hair was more oily than usual.</li>
            <li> So far haven&#x27;t used it enough to judge it.</li>
            <li> So far it doesn&#x27;t feel to coarse, and my head tolerates it.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find this one actually worked.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, thin, super-straight Asian hair, and was on the hunt for a new volumizing shampoo.</li>
            <li> But after finishing the whole container of shampoo and conditioner, I have to say &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34;  My hair is noticeably fuller without being coarse or rough.  </li>
            <li> Does not leave residue and does not dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> The formula of the previous JF was thick and rich, while this new one was no better than the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> Before this, no other volumizing shampoo gave the same results as Fekkai.</li>
            <li> I have to use a large portion compare to other soap to wash all my hair!  </li>
            <li> In other words it does not make my hair look thick any more</li>
            <li> But, the heavy perfume smell coming off my hair was SO strong that I had a headache less than an hour after using it.  </li>
            <li> I have super thin, really oily, long hair</li>
            <li> Otherwise, my hair becomes limp and slick, and gets greasy much more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t endure a daily migraine for thick full hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this helps give me that fuller look without leaving a film behind.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I am always in search of shampoo to try out for my fine / thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have had fine / thin hair all my life.</li>
            <li> your hair is fine or thin or chemically damaged/fried, these product will help restore and give beauty and volume/thickness/body to the hair.</li>
            <li> Then they changed the formula and now this new formula does what all other shampoos do.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t really bad, but it wasn&#x27;t really good either.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my fine, thin, flat hair was not changed by this product.  </li>
            <li> So far the only other shampoo that works for me is Tresemme&#x27;s anti-buildup shampoo and conditioner (Deep Cleansing and Remoisturize range) and Pantene&#x27;s Sheer Volume shampoo (the SV conditioner makes my hair sticky and leaves loads of build-up).</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t particularly concerned about the color because my hairdresser adds a little conditioner to the hair color.</li>
            <li> However with repeated use, it goes back to being flat.</li>
            <li> I do not use a conditioner because I have yet to find one that does not leave my hair flat and greasy looking the day after or even the same day.</li>
            <li> along with Nexxus Emergencee Protein reconstructor, Nexxus Deep Moisturizing conditioner; also Chi Iron Guard 44 and Chi Silk Fusion for flat ironing.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely skeptical of shampoos claims to give my baby fine hair volume, bounce, fullness etc having tried so many which failed.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair limpy and flat.</li>
            <li> I was using Flat to Volume by Pantene</li>
            <li> It looks and feels thicker, even after flat ironing.  </li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t go flat.</li>
            <li> Mixed up shampoo over the past 2 months to verify that my reaction was to this particular John Frieda Volume Shampoo.</li>
            <li> , this shampoo caused my usually blemish free forehead to breakout in small pimples and whiteheads...</li>
            <li> each subsequent time I used this shampoo, either with or without the conditioner, it left my hair soft but slick and</li>
            <li> I am Asian and sometimes that type of hair is different from other cultures.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a new shampoo for thin, soft, flat hair that has a tendency to get oily.</li>
            <li> (I have long, curly hair)</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars only because I like how it feels in my hair when applied wet.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is very creamy and thick.  </li>
            <li> My hair was flat anun dry and unruly !</li>
            <li> in all this was such a disappointment, for no other reason than it does exactly the opposite of what it claims.</li>
            <li> other day I goofed massively when applying hair coloring to my hair.</li>
            <li> For a person with not so think hair and dry scalp</li>
            <li> Maybe it works if you blow dry and use product to get volume but just as a stand alone it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Using the complementary conditioner did not make my hair go flat like other conditioners.</li>
            <li> (I normally shampoo every other day, and can usually get two or three days out of a shampoo before my hair starts to look</li>
            <li> and it did leak, so I stored mine upside down to prevent leakage, but that was not a big deal for the results with the look of the hair.</li>
            <li> I was paying a fortune for Redken and Pureology products that worked, but eventually weighed my hair down into coarse, stick like cartoon hair.  </li>
            <li> Personally I have slightly longer than</li>
            <li> It makes hair very dry.</li>
            <li> Half of my length is relaxed and the other half is natural textured.</li>
            <li> The first few days I used this product I noticed a subtle difference in volume.</li>
            <li> And you cannot beat the price: About $5.50 here on Amazon, and also in local drugstores, but as another reviewer has pointed out, it&#x27;s often hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> For me didn&#x27;t really make a difference in my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I applied this shampoo to my wet hair and massaged it into my hair thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Not much lather, no difference in hair feel.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and using this product really does make my hair seem fuller.  </li>
            <li> To give you an idea of my hair type, I can go to bed with wet hair and wake up with</li>
            <li> But, by the next day, my hair looked limp and greasy.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected and what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I have very thin soft hear, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have pretty thin hair that is limp after a couple of hours, so purchased this and the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I only need a little bit to get the job done!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t handle heavy shampoos since they weigh my hair down instantly, or moisturizing shampoos or conditioners since they make my hair oily and never wash out.</li>
            <li> This product does the job and does it extremely well ...</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> He also uses other volumizing hair products.</li>
            <li> and I am not going to consider other brands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Later on I went back to my usual and forgot about this brand, but when I saw it in CVS</li>
            <li> Just like the conditioner, it was not like other John Frieda products I have ordered before.</li>
            <li> I am amazed by the difference this is compared to the other shampoo products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It did not provide volume like the other products I tried.  </li>
            <li> The last straw for me is that once you have washed your hair in the morning, then dried it (you have to use a hair dryer with this shampoo because of the sea salt, otherwise your hair looks dirty and sticks down on your head - the opposite of volume), you can&#x27;t really touch it again.</li>
            <li> Also, as with the spray, this shampoo can be difficult to find, and when I do find it the prices seem a little high or they only have one or two bottles.  </li>
            <li> But Tresemme&#x27;s bottles are huge and impossible to travel with</li>
            <li> A little expensive but lasts a long time as you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a &#x27;goo junky&#x27; and you would typically find at least 3 bottles each of shampoo and conditioner in my shower, and the brands would fall into various price ranges (anywhere from $2-$50 a bottle - ).</li>
            <li> The shampoo gives my hair my body and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh fine/thin hair down.</li>
            <li> My hair never feels weighed down.  </li>
            <li> It cleans the hair fine, does not seem to strip it, doesn&#x27;t have the type of harsh ingredients that over-dry or make your scalp feel bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in and out of doctor&#x27;s offices and trying natural remedies to work on the thinning itself, but in the interlude I&#x27;m also always on the hunt for products at at least make my hair look like it&#x27;s as thick as it used to be.</li>
            <li> I had to discontinue using this product in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> Animal testing is NOT Cool....</li>
            <li> In the last 6-8 months I&#x27;ve been experiencing sudden and rapid hair thinning, which as a female in my early 20&#x27;s who has always had \\&quot;too thick\\&quot; hair, I can&#x27;t overstate how devastating this has been.</li>
            <li> I don’t use a hair dryer until my hair is at least 50% dry.</li>
            <li> Some work a little - others, not at all.</li>
            <li> I think my hair felt a little bit softer and lighter but no noticeable volume.</li>
            <li> (I usually wash my hair every other day.)</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will make my hair a little thicker</li>
            <li> When I wrote my review for the matching conditioner, I was a little bit tepid.  </li>
            <li> I blow dried my hair and it looked shiny and had loads of volume.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t a night and day difference, but it made my hair fuller and \\&quot;normal\\&quot; looking versus sort of limp and scraggly</li>
            <li> It dried my hair AND my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It took all those limp locks and gave me volume.</li>
            <li> increase volume without residue or heavy perfumes.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t waste my time and money on this.</li>
            <li> I have searched my entire life for a shampoo that does not make my hair feel greasy or thin.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought a few volume enhancing shampoos to compare.  </li>
            <li> I usually use a cheaper shampoo per oz...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a small &amp;#34;bottle&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> chin length bob and a small amount, maybe 2/3 peas washes my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible idea for fine hair.</li>
            <li> it has been hard to find a shampoo product that provides the volume needed for my hair type.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite a hoarder, a prepper or a coupon clipper, but I don&#x27;t want to run out of hard to find necessities and purchased four bottles/tubes of this shampoo and received in two business days as a Prime Member from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have found that I need to change up my products for my hair at least once a year.  </li>
            <li> I have thin limp hair and this shampoo makes it seem fuller.  </li>
            <li> Works like Bumble &amp; Bumble Volumizing Shampoo but much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have thin, lifeless, dull, hair.  </li>
            <li> and it made my hair look thick!</li>
            <li> I have thin hair but a lot of it ...</li>
            <li> I was losing some hair from stress and went through a time where I felt it looked thin and not great.</li>
            <li> My hair in thin and lifeless</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my hair worse than it already was</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse, though, is the flaky scalp I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li> I have really thin hair</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> A hairy experience to say the least!!</li>
            <li> And since that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s being marketed, I give it a fail.  </li>
            <li> but this keeps my boring lack of hair from a daily &#x27;bad-hair&#x27; issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not how it worked--</li>
            <li> Useless.  </li>
            <li> My adress was wrong please my correct one is 7702 overglen</li>
            <li> I was sorry to have to give it away</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews, but unfortunately my hair didn&#x27;t do well with it.</li>
            <li> Sorry John Frieda....</li>
            <li> (I even tried the overly expensive Brazilian Blowout Acai anti frizz shampoo and conditioner).  </li>
            <li> But what a disappointment.</li>
            <li> However, this shampoo was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked at how well this worked.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried just about every volumizing products, both low-end and high-end, and everything in between, and have been disappointed or should have been until I tried this John Frieda shampoo!</li>
            <li> was very disappointed not to get the results that others got.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo along w conditioner was horrible.</li>
            <li> I think it is disgusting to test cosmetics or any products on Animals.  </li>

            <li> Nice rich lather. Cleans hair without stripping it. When used with conditioner in same line product does make hair noticeably fuller.</li>
            <li> okay. not dramastically increase the volume though. 2 times more expensive in local pharm stores. - thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> I love both the shampoo and conditioner. I have very fine thin hair, and this plumps it up.  It also makes my hair shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair but a lot of it ... it has been hard to find a shampoo product that provides the volume needed for my hair type.  This product does the job and does it extremely well ... great shampoo and is now my favorite choice.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very creamy and thick.  Smells good too. A little goes a long way!  I will stock up on this with all my Amazon purchases.</li>
            <li> LOVEEEE!! I purchase the shampoo &amp; conditioner &amp; i absalutely loved it! will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like the way it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> I used the old formula for years and loved it. I have very fine thin hair and it made my hair look thick! Then they changed the formula and now this new formula does what all other shampoos do. In other words it does not make my hair look thick any more so I will not buy anymore. I am now on the look out for another product that will work.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feel of using this shampoo. Have been a regular user for the past one year and love the product. For a person with not so think hair and dry scalp a liked the way this left after using it couple of times. It did give a feeling of volume. The texture is pleasant and smell is mild as well. I just use a tad of shampoo and it lathers well (might differ for different water types).</li>
            <li> Yes, it works!&lt;br /&gt;As my hair thins, I have become more interested in using &#x27;volumizing&#x27; products. Some work a little - others, not at all. None of them really thicken the hair permanently.&lt;br /&gt;Of the dozen I have tried, this Conditioner from John Frieda (used along with the Frieda Volumizing Conditioner counterpart, does a better job than anything else I have found. Leaved my hair smooth, wavy and &#x27;appearing&#x27; thicker.&lt;br /&gt;It was exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> For me didn&#x27;t really make a difference in my thin hair. I was hoping it would.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do well with helping add volume but a decent product</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE THIS.....BOUNCY, FULL OF VOLUME, SOFT HAIR....</li>
            <li> The first few days I used this product I noticed a subtle difference in volume. However with repeated use, it goes back to being flat.</li>
            <li> I picked this up at CVS when they were having a super sale.  I had no specific expectations so I was surprised somewhat by just how good and effective it is. It produces a lot of foam, really leaves my hair feeling clean, and leaves my flat and fine hair with lots of volume and fullness.&lt;br /&gt;The other day I goofed massively when applying hair coloring to my hair. Instead of adding colorant to the developer, I added conditioner. When I caught my goof I added the colorant. I wasn&#x27;t particularly concerned about the color because my hairdresser adds a little conditioner to the hair color. However, I didn&#x27;t realize that this was going to leave my hair really greasy. I waited a day and prayed that a couple of washes would get the residual oil out of my hair. I applied this shampoo to my wet hair and massaged it into my hair thoroughly. When I rinsed my hair with luke warm water, my hair was clean and all the greasy residue was gone. There was no need for a second wash. I blow dried my hair and it looked shiny and had loads of volume. This is very good shampoo and it smells nice, too.</li>
            <li> I have only used this twice. I did notice a little more volume in my roots but nothing major. It smells nice and makes hair soft. Good price on Amazon. Will have to use longer to see how well it really works.</li>
            <li> my hair really didn&#x27;t feel any different, didn&#x27;t feel especially clean or special in any way. i wont buy it again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo along w conditioner was horrible. Stripped newly colored hair &amp; hair like straw</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! I combine it with the John Frieda Mousse and it gives my very thinning hair more volume than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This conditioner really does cause your hair to look thicker. Since it makes my hair look fuller I do not have to shampoo as often!</li>
            <li> Excellent . I strongly recomend</li>
            <li> This shampoo gives me volume and my hair which is naturally wavy is more manageable.  Also like it tube instead of bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a new shampoo for thin, soft, flat hair that has a tendency to get oily. I can&#x27;t handle heavy shampoos since they weigh my hair down instantly, or moisturizing shampoos or conditioners since they make my hair oily and never wash out. Clarifying, anti-buildup and volumizing shampoos are the only option. I don&#x27;t need additional shine as my hair naturally has that, so I steer clear of oils. So far the only other shampoo that works for me is Tresemme&#x27;s anti-buildup shampoo and conditioner (Deep Cleansing and Remoisturize range) and Pantene&#x27;s Sheer Volume shampoo (the SV conditioner makes my hair sticky and leaves loads of build-up). But Tresemme&#x27;s bottles are huge and impossible to travel with and I go through the shampoo 3x&#x27;s as fast as the conditioner, which is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided I would spend a little more and go for John Frieda. I should have read the ingredients more carefully instead of trusting the name. The main downfall here is the sea salt. Sea salt?! This is a terrible idea for fine hair. Instead of creating natural volume by deeply cleansing the hair of any impurities and buildup, this John Frieda shampoo tries to fortify the hair with salt. SALT. I don&#x27;t know anyone with fine hair who has ever gone to the beach for a swim and gets out of the water and goes &amp;#34;gee, this saltwater did wonders for my hair&amp;#34;. No one ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this shampoo does is make the hair sticky, especially at the roots. It also dulls all natural shine so your hair looks matte which borders on looking unwashed. On top of it all, there is little to no volume effect compared with cheaper drugstore brands mentioned above. The last straw for me is that once you have washed your hair in the morning, then dried it (you have to use a hair dryer with this shampoo because of the sea salt, otherwise your hair looks dirty and sticks down on your head - the opposite of volume), you can&#x27;t really touch it again. If you try to brush it during the day or at night, the static electricity is overwhelming and you would never be able to get it back into any style, even a pony tail, without looking like you stuck your finger in a light socket. Although you can get the comb through it, it makes the hair roots feel &amp;#34;knotted&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this was such a disappointment, for no other reason than it does exactly the opposite of what it claims.at night, the static electricity is overwhelming and you would never be able to get it back into any style, even a pony tail, without looking like you stuck your finger in a light socket.

            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much change in the volume but I do like the hair care product and plan to order more of his products.</li>
            <li> The John Frieda Products are GREAT..... THEY work better than anything I have ever tried.... And, believe me I have tried alot of brands... Keep up the Good Work!!!</li>
            <li> In the last 6-8 months I&#x27;ve been experiencing sudden and rapid hair thinning, which as a female in my early 20&#x27;s who has always had \\&quot;too thick\\&quot; hair, I can&#x27;t overstate how devastating this has been. I&#x27;ve been in and out of doctor&#x27;s offices and trying natural remedies to work on the thinning itself, but in the interlude I&#x27;m also always on the hunt for products at at least make my hair look like it&#x27;s as thick as it used to be. I wanted to try out drugstore brands before moving up to salon brands because between college and the medical expenses, I&#x27;m strapped for cash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a salon brand basis of comparison for this but I&#x27;m really happy with the results I got from it. I only washed with it about five times before deciding to take the \\&quot;no-poo\\&quot; route (not as a result form any negatives effects from this product), but for me it really did live up to its claim of thickening the hair form the inside out. It didn&#x27;t just strip my hair of oils and make it fuzzy and puffy like some volumizing shampoos do. Be realistic - it wasn&#x27;t a night and day difference, but it made my hair fuller and \\&quot;normal\\&quot; looking versus sort of limp and scraggly (I have long, curly hair) like it does when I would use my regular moisturizing shampoo. This is definitely worth a shot and I was pretty impressed with it.</li>
            <li> I have medium-length, fine, blonde, naturally-wavy, thinning hair.  I am on the hunt for volumizing products.  I was hoping this shampoo would be one of them, based on some favourable reviews.  I was disappointed.  It cleans the hair fine, does not seem to strip it, doesn&#x27;t have the type of harsh ingredients that over-dry or make your scalp feel bad.  But it does not provide any volume at all.  And since that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s being marketed, I give it a fail.  I will not buy again, and the search continues.</li>
            <li> So far haven&#x27;t used it enough to judge it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a bit better product, but it leaves a coating on my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> Always been a fan of John Frieda products. My significant other uses this shampoo and he says it does add some volume to his hair. He also uses other volumizing hair products.</li>
            <li> Product works great. I have fine hair and this helps give me that fuller look without leaving a film behind. That being said I wish the bottle was bigger for the price. However, I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I had to discontinue using this product in less than a week.  It dried my hair AND my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed not to get the results that others got.  So the search continues..........</li>
            <li> I have very fine textured hair.  I have been using for years Paul Mitchell strength daily shampoo and Folicure shampoo for fine hair.  I use the first shampoo listed for the first lather and finish the last with the folicure.  This combinaion worked fairly well on my hair. I could not use any kind of conditioner because then my hair would be too limp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given the sample of John Frieda at the mall about a month ago. It sat in my bathroom drawer. I saw it and decided to look it up on Amazon and read the reviews.  The reviews excited me. Maybe this was the shampoo that would be even better than the two listed above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair this morning using JOHN FRIEDA shampoo. I dried and styled my hair and could not believe how good my hair looked. It took all those limp locks and gave me volume. My hair looks so good.  I could not believe it!  Normally have so much static electricity in hair during the winter time but no static with this shampoo. I have just bought several tubes of this and will after January sign up for  a monthly subscription of it.  I can not be without this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be the only shampoo I will buy.  I will be saving so much also.  But having said that I do not care what it cost. The cost would be no object to me - This shampoo is the best shampoo in the world. !!!  I hope Amazon never stops selling this and I hope the shampoo company does not stop making this wonderful great product!</li>
            <li> I read such good reviews on this John Frieda line and I had high hopes.  Unfortunately my fine, thin, flat hair was not changed by this product.  I used it each time I shampooed for a matter of weeks and I saw no change.  Additionally, I really didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look a lot fuller and lightweight.</li>
            <li> I needed a shampoo that cuts static electricity. I had heard that this would do that, but it is not working for me that well.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars only because I like how it feels in my hair when applied wet.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much after you wash it off.  I think my hair felt a little bit softer and lighter but no noticeable volume.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo...actually makes my fine hair look and feel thicker...great lather and shine when using it&lt;br /&gt;have had people ask what I&#x27;m using...glad to say John Frieda !</li>
            <li> There are lots of great reviews here for this shampoo, but it just didn&#x27;t do it for me. My hair is color-treated, and I detected a fading of my color. Also, I rinsed and rinsed it, but it seemed to leave what I felt was a coating on my hair. Perhaps that was the \\&quot;body\\&quot; I was expecting? It wasn&#x27;t really bad, but it wasn&#x27;t really good either.</li>
            <li> wonderful volume, exactly same as advertised ! My hair looks wonderful after using this shampoo. I like it and I am not going to consider other brands.</li>
            <li> Cleans well gives nice volume, and it is also quite nourishing too!  That is kind of hard to find in a volume boosting shampoo! I only need a little bit to get the job done!</li>
            <li> I have been using the John Frieda hairspray for a month or so and decided to go with the full line including Mousse and&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo and don&#x27;t regret the decision. The shampoo gives my hair my body and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. I am very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;I have have very fine thin hair and the entire line has helped my to able to style my hair and keep the style most of the day.</li>
            <li> i told you before its a good quality recommend for the damage hair love it if its finish i will buy more</li>
            <li> The product does not make my hair fuller. I bought it, but used it only once. I noticed I had lost lot of hair while washing my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for fine, color treated hair.  It does what it says it will do....increase volume without residue or heavy perfumes.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, smells good and gives my poor flat fine hair more volume than when I wasn&#x27;t using anything.  A little expensive but lasts a long time as you don&#x27;t need much. Also had made my hair feel softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d run out of shampoo some years ago while out of town and sent my honey to buy some. He came back with the John Frieda Luxurious Volume Shampoo and matching conditioner. I believe they cost about 8 dollars each tube. I thought he&#x27;d overpaid, but upon using it found I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Later on I went back to my usual and forgot about this brand, but when I saw it in CVS I was very happy. But what a disappointment. The formula of the previous JF was thick and rich, while this new one was no better than the cheap stuff. Not much lather, no difference in hair feel. The conditioner was also nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time and money on this. When companies make a superior product they sometimes scale back the ingredients and just coast by on the name alone. I think that&#x27;s what happened here. Too bad, because their original product was great.</li>
            <li> It gives me a lot of lather and has really done a good job of making my hair feel more full.  My husband even uses it now and likes the way it makes his hair feel.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many shampoos for fine and thin hair.  I do not use a conditioner because I have yet to find one that does not leave my hair flat and greasy looking the day after or even the same day. I have used Paul Mitchell, Living Proof, Loreal Volumetry Anti-Gravity Effect Volume Shampoo For Fine Hair, Ouidad playcurl volumizing and Pantene to name a few.  This is by far the best.  It leaves my hair fuller and thicker-looking without drying it out and it still looks great the next day.  It is soft instead of frizzy and crackly. (I usually wash my hair every other day.) I&#x27;m sticking with this one. I can&#x27;t imagine how my hair could possibly look any better no matter what product I used or how expensive it was.</li>
            <li> not a lot of difference but some volume added&lt;br /&gt;good lather and cleaning also&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this shampoo to all</li>
            <li> I thought John Frieda shampoo was much better. In fact, it did nothing diferent to my hair, cause I have a normal hair without any specific problems.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for volume, do not order this product.  It flattened my hair and if possible made it feel more fine than it already is.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. The smell is great and I feel very clean after using it. I use it every day and it keeps my hair healthy and full.</li>
            <li> Just like the conditioner, it was not like other John Frieda products I have ordered before. Won&#x27;t be ordering this one again.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by Paula Begoun for fine/thin hair, and I really love it. It is almost like a &amp;#34;clearing&amp;#34; shampoo in that it really gets your hair clean. I use this when I want to remove all the products I&#x27;ve been using. It doesn&#x27;t weigh fine/thin hair down. Great product!</li>
            <li> Good shampoo. It really thickens my fine hair. It smells great as well.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying this shampoo/conditioner smells great and DOES give my fine hair a little volume boost. However, I&#x27;m surprised by how many good reviews it has. I have noticed that ever since I began using it, my hair has been shedding extra and I seem to lose a lot in the shower. I don&#x27;t know what else it could be. My shampoo bottle also leaked in the tub and by the time I noticed, it had stripped the gloss in the tub. If it&#x27;s chemically strong enough to do that, I&#x27;m not sure I want it in my hair. Once I run out I will not be replacing it.</li>
            <li> Truly like this new product. It has good body and shine. Hopefully it will make my hair a little thicker&lt;br /&gt;in weight.&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cursed with fine hair my whole life and struggled with the flatness for too long so I decided to try this out. I am amazed by the difference this is compared to the other shampoo products I&#x27;ve tried. This is just as good if not better than those 16 dollar shampoos. My hair now feels shinier and fuller than ever before. I recommend combining this with the conditioner for the best results. It gives hair that extra oomph!</li>
            <li> I have very thin soft hear, sensitive skin and I am very selective to odor. All works very well here.</li>
            <li> With any thickener, you get a coarser feel to your hair. I also get allergic to it.  So far it doesn&#x27;t feel to coarse, and my head tolerates it. I get a much nicer hairdo which lasts without hairspray..( also allergic)  So I like it.</li>
            <li> I got a sample in the mail that I tried; like it and went on to purchase it for my hair.  I have found that I need to change up my products for my hair at least once a year.  This does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> I think this shampoo really works to help hair look thick and beautiful.  I was losing some hair from stress and went through a time where I felt it looked thin and not great. I read in a magazine (maybe Allure?) that this was good for helping hair look thicker and got it.  I think it works great.  I definitely have purchased it again and told friends about it.  I would definitely recommend the product.  One note- the packaging wasn&#x27;t great and it did leak, so I stored mine upside down to prevent leakage, but that was not a big deal for the results with the look of the hair.</li>
            <li> I switch shampoos regularly cause nothing seems that great to stick with, but I am super happy with john Freida! My hair in thin and lifeless but when I use this shampoo its like I just got my hair trimmed and is so soft and bouncy. Love that feeling!</li>
            <li> Years ago I had a similar reaction to Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Shampoo. Scalp burn felt like an allergic reaction.  Made scalp itchy.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the John Frieda Volume conditioner and found I could use that, but next day leaves my hair greasy.  Mixed up shampoo over the past 2 months to verify that my reaction was to this particular John Frieda Volume Shampoo. Overall, won&#x27;t be using it again, will continue to finish the tube of conditioner, but won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have had baby fine hair my whole life, and now that I&#x27;m getting older it is thinning, as well. I think I&#x27;ve tried just about every volumizing products, both low-end and high-end, and everything in between, and have been disappointed or should have been until I tried this John Frieda shampoo! My hairdresser recommended it after she saw what it did for one of her customers who has hair like mine. Part way through my shampoo, I kept wondering where all this hair was coming from. Seriously! Using the complementary conditioner did not make my hair go flat like other conditioners. I found my new shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and using this product really does make my hair seem fuller.  I am really glad I found this product</li>
            <li> Been using this for years and I like how it makes you hair feel clean and never oily! Smells great too!</li>
            <li> It makes hair very dry. Even after conditioner it wont leave hair smooth. Didn&#x27;t like the smell too. Not so good product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo stripped my strands of all luster and my follicles of all plumpness. My hair is ruined. Have tried leave in conditioners to restore it but nothing works. Will have to wait until new hair grows in.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair limpy and flat.</li>
            <li> I have thin, lifeless, dull, hair.  It&#x27;s hard for me to find a good product for a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works good for me and smells quite pleasant without being overly stinky.  Nothing can perform a miracle for hair a person won&#x27;t ever have but this keeps my boring lack of hair from a daily &#x27;bad-hair&#x27; issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> When I wrote my review for the matching conditioner, I was a little bit tepid.  But after finishing the whole container of shampoo and conditioner, I have to say &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34;  My hair is noticeably fuller without being coarse or rough.  It is soft, shiny, holds style better and seems healthy.  I was paying a fortune for Redken and Pureology products that worked, but eventually weighed my hair down into coarse, stick like cartoon hair.  This shampoo, conditioner and the John Frieda Luxurious Volume Building Mousse do a much better job at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I am a female in my mid-20s with A LOT of  fine straight hair that is med-long. I&#x27;m a bit of a &#x27;goo junky&#x27; and you would typically find at least 3 bottles each of shampoo and conditioner in my shower, and the brands would fall into various price ranges (anywhere from $2-$50 a bottle - ). I prefer low maintenance, but will put in the extra time if necessary. To give you an idea of my hair type, I can go to bed with wet hair and wake up with perfectly straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this shampoo several different ways, showering at night the day before, in the morning the day of, and right before going out. It lathered decently when massaged into my scalp and did a good job removing the excess oil in my hair.  I think this shampoo resulted in more &#x27;frizz&#x27; than volume, but a smoothing serum did help to manage that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the shampoo good? It is and it gets the job done. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again, though.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, thin, super-straight Asian hair, and was on the hunt for a new volumizing shampoo. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of shampoos from cheap to high end, western and Japanese, co-washing, going silicone free, etc, but no matter what my hair always falls into a flat helmet after a few hours. Before using this shampoo, I&#x27;d been using a cheap silicone-free shampoo (herbal essences volumizing), and didn&#x27;t like how crunchy it made my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first wash with this John Frieda shampoo and the matching conditioner left my hair soft, shiny, volumized, gorgeous. I was so excited that maybe I&#x27;d finally found my HG. But, by the next day, my hair looked limp and greasy. (I normally shampoo every other day, and can usually get two or three days out of a shampoo before my hair starts to look oily.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, no problem, I&#x27;ll just shampoo every day if it means I get those results. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not how it worked-- each subsequent time I used this shampoo, either with or without the conditioner, it left my hair soft but slick and flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally figured out that this shampoo is loaded with silicones that will eventually build up and weigh down fine hair. I get the best results by alternating this shampoo/conditioner with a cheap &#x27;cone-free shampoo to clarify my hair every other wash. Otherwise, my hair becomes limp and slick, and gets greasy much more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: this is a pretty good shampoo (and conditioner combo) for fine/thin hair, but make sure you clarify with a silicone-free shampoo or else you&#x27;ll never get those awesome bouncy results again.</li>
            <li> A great product! After using it the hair is lush and soft! And do not require styling!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once or twice but so far it&#x27;s pretty good. I was using Flat to Volume by Pantene but I think it was drying my hair out</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel clean, soft and silky.  I have very fine blonde hair, and this makes it shiny and full!</li>
            <li> I have never reviewed a product in my life but had to review this one..... I have searched my entire life for a shampoo that does not make my hair feel greasy or thin.  (I have that wonderful problem where my hair is somehow dry but greasy at the same time).  This shampoo makes my hair look thicker, super healthy, and super soft.  I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best product for everyone, but if you have a similar hair type you should definitely give it a shot!  It smells great too.</li>
            <li> While I wouldn&#x27;t say this shampoo provides more fullness than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, it truly IS a good volumizing shampoo, and it does a great job of cleaning.  My hair never feels weighed down.  The price is right.</li>
            <li> Works great and cleans hair well. Use it with the conditioner and mousse and am very happy. I like the nice clean scent. Does not leave residue and does not dry my hair out. I have a lot of hair, but skinny and likes to hug my head, this helps the volume a great deal.</li>
            <li> Useless.  Did nothing Suave doesn&#x27;t do.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Good bargain &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li> My adress was wrong please my correct one is 7702 overglen dr&lt;br /&gt;west chester 45069 ohio</li>
            <li> This product is OK, but I much prefer the Loreal EverPure volume shampoo and condtioner.</li>
            <li> Love this nice smelling, body and shine boosting miracle in a bottle</li>
            <li> Not every shampoo is for every hair type. This one just did not work well on my hair type. I have very fine and thin hair.  I am Asian and sometimes that type of hair is different from other cultures. This shampoo and conditioner made my hair &amp;#34;silky smooth&amp;#34; but did not add more volume as my old volumizer shampoo. Actual, my hair was much flatter with J. Frieda.  Also, I found my scalp to be very itchy.  I discontinued using it, but again, it has to do with hair type and the itchiness could have to do with body chemistry.</li>
            <li> My hair was flat anun dry and unruly !</li>
            <li> I love the way this shampoo smells. it also makes my hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li> Love the thick rich lather and smell. Worked great to give my hair volume. I used it with the same type of conditioner. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I began using this shampoo four or five years ago after my best friend introduced me to John Frieda Luxurious Volume Lavish Lift Root Booster.  Oh my goodness, I LOVE it!  Well, of course I just had to have this shampoo and like it almost as much as the spray.  Also, as with the spray, this shampoo can be difficult to find, and when I do find it the prices seem a little high or they only have one or two bottles.  I don&#x27;t want to run out.  I&#x27;m not quite a hoarder, a prepper or a coupon clipper, but I don&#x27;t want to run out of hard to find necessities and purchased four bottles/tubes of this shampoo and received in two business days as a Prime Member from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean after I use it</li>
            <li> Shampoo are good, but they&#x27;re NOT soapy !!  I have to use a large portion compare to other soap to wash all my hair!  The price is good when I bought it though, so No complains</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I am always in search of shampoo to try out for my fine / thin hair. I have had fine / thin hair all my life. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a week now. I&#x27;m still waiting to see what it can do... I used to use Nioxin shampoo which made my hair feel strong &amp; had the volume. This shampoo doesnt make my hair feel strong. And the volume... its underwhelming. I cant wait to hurry up &amp; use up this product so then I can find something else.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo looking for volume. It certainly does that to your hair the day of washing or even the second day, but after washing with it a few times I found my hair was more oily than usual. It doesn&#x27;t agree with my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this shampoo caused my usually blemish free forehead to breakout in small pimples and whiteheads...gross! Word to the wise, if you have sensitive skin I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shampoo. Won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
            <li> This product did what it said it would do - my hair really did look and feel fuller and thicker.  But, the heavy perfume smell coming off my hair was SO strong that I had a headache less than an hour after using it.  Because of that I only used it once then I gave it away.  I was sorry to have to give it away but I couldn&#x27;t endure a daily migraine for thick full hair.  If they had a fragrance free version I&#x27;d try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind strong perfume smells (and many people don&#x27;t mind) then you would probably find this to be a great product.</li>
            <li> I have super thin, really oily, long hair and this is the best shampoo I have found to really boost the volume without weighing it down and making it greasy. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 or more years now. It&#x27;s cheaper here on amazon than at my local store too. This works awesome too if you need an extra boost... [[ASIN:B001BAROMK John Frieda Luxurious Volume Booster]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this shampoo.. Made my hair so silky soft. I will be buying more from the John Frieda line.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo that I could find that gives my blonde angel hair volume and body that makes it look great</li>
            <li> So far/so good! I am using both this shampoo and John Frieda volume for after shampoo. Working and looking good!</li>
            <li> No different than cheap drug store products. I have fine hair and didn&#x27;t notice any difference. Smells good and cleans your hair...but I can find that for under a buck.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would give my hair some life and lift. I was sorely disappointed. It felt heavy and my hair did not feel clean. I had read the reviews, but unfortunately my hair didn&#x27;t do well with it.</li>
            <li> I usually use a cheaper shampoo per oz... so i thought i would try this on my thinning gray hair. I so hoped i would see some positive change but i didn&#x27;t see much if any. Overall, i&#x27;m glad i tried it because in the end i was happy to go back to my old faithful Pantene. A hairy experience to say the least!! LOL</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! Great product!</li>
            <li> hair feels a bit greasy after shampooing &amp; doesnt feel rinsed as w/reg shampoo but it does provide a fuller feel</li>
            <li> Product works wonderful. Came with the entire end opened up and product leaking all over box.</li>
            <li> My Hair feels so soft and manageable now. I have thin fine hair so finding a good shampoo that does not leave build up is hard to find. I also am allergic to many products and I am glad I found one that does not cause me to break out in rashes like my old shampoo.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change to the way my hair looked or felt.  I have straight, oily hair and am not one who &amp;#34;primps&amp;#34; so I just used this to clean my hair. Maybe it works if you blow dry and use product to get volume but just as a stand alone it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t buy again.  First ingredient is Laurel Sulfate. I don&#x27;t find any volume at all. Laurel Sulfate can cause hair falling.</li>
            <li> I have always had baby fine hair and recently it seems to be getting thinner as well.  I have tried different volume shampoos and most are very drying and don&#x27; work.  I was shocked at how well this worked.  My hair looks so much healthier and fuller.</li>
            <li> I loveeeeeeeeeeee this shampoo.. It&#x27;s done wonders to my hair and I am going to continue using this one.. It has made my hair soft and voluminious</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this shampoo or it&#x27;s conditioner.  May or may not purchase again.  Probably better priced products than this that would do the same job.</li>
            <li> Although I have used John Frieda products and liked most of them... I&#x27;m cancelling my Amazon Subscribe and Save for all John Frieda products since they are not Cruelty Free... I think it is disgusting to test cosmetics or any products on Animals.  Kiss My Face products are what I will be using for my shampoo and conditioner.  Along with many of their other wonderful products...  Sorry John Frieda.... Get with the program... Animal testing is NOT Cool.... Shame on YOU!</li>
            <li> This great smelling shampoo lathers well, but doesn&#x27;t strip and dry the hair.  My hair felt soft after shampooing.  I used in conjunction with the entire line of \\&quot;Luxurious Volume\\&quot; products.  That would be this shampoo,  the conditioner, volume building mousse, and hair spray. My hair is definitely thicker, has more body and volume. It looks and feels thicker, even after flat ironing.  The results last.  My hair doesn&#x27;t go flat. My hair had just as much body and thickness a week later; (I shampoo weekly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently, my hair is in transition; no longer using relaxers. Half of my length is relaxed and the other half is natural textured. My natural textured hair is stronger and thicker than the relaxed portion. This line of products really plumps up the relaxed hair, which experienced some damage.  The John Frieda products leave my hair soft, smooth,  full, thick and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I became a product junkie, in search of \\&quot;anything\\&quot; that would help my hair after damaging. (I even tried the overly expensive Brazilian Blowout Acai anti frizz shampoo and conditioner).  Many make promises, but John Frieda delivers.  His prices are extremely reasonable for salon grade products.  I also tried the Nexxus Volumizing line of products. Their shampoo is very drying and I really didn&#x27;t see much difference in volume after using the entire line. John Frieda works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found John Frieda is the best....along with Nexxus Emergencee Protein reconstructor, Nexxus Deep Moisturizing conditioner; also Chi Iron Guard 44 and Chi Silk Fusion for flat ironing.  The Nexxus Emergencee is great for stopping hair breakage due to chemical/heat damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is fine or thin or chemically damaged/fried, these product will help restore and give beauty and volume/thickness/body to the hair.</li>
            <li> Great product. It leaves hair nice and full which makes them easy to style. Another positive is the light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see a big difference in volume when I used this. The best thing about it was that I got it for a super low price and I always wanted to try it but now that I have, I dont think I&#x27;m going to repurchase. It&#x27;s nothing special and it&#x27;s a small &amp;#34;bottle&amp;#34;. It didn&#x27;t make my hair worse than it already was so I can think about that as a plus, but it also wasn&#x27;t effective either.</li>
            <li> great product at a great price!  i have always loved john frieda products and i plan on buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thin hair that is limp after a couple of hours, so purchased this and the conditioner. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather up enough, it feels like I have to use a lot to get it for my entire scalp.&lt;br /&gt;After using them my hair is pretty light although a bit dry, but what life it had is still lost within the day. What&#x27;s worse, though, is the flaky scalp I&#x27;ve gotten. Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> This shampoo revitalizes hair and restores body......love it!!!! Jon Frieda line of hair care products are exceptional. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair much healthier and smells really good. It&#x27;s just a bit pricey</li>
            <li> love this shampoo and conditioner! smells and works great and cheaper online here than in stores!</li>
            <li> Works like Bumble &amp; Bumble Volumizing Shampoo but much less expensive.</li>
            <li> Did not show as much volume aspromised</li>
            <li> I bought a few volume enhancing shampoos to compare.  John Frieda is usually very good.  However, this shampoo was a disappointment.  It did not provide volume like the other products I tried.  I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Like the shampoo, it works well and smells nice</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells wonderful and creates soft volume. It is best for non-colortreated hair. I switch it up with another brand of shampoo on occasion. It really does the job without adding an  heaviness to the hair follicles. My hair feels bouncy and light but has considerable volume and softness. I will definitely purchase this again. Also excellent price.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected and what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I have really thin hair and this works great...a lot better than other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried. The volumizing spray is great too.</li>
            <li> nice keeps my hair thick full and shiny</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this shampoo makes it feel and look thicker. It smells great too. I recommend it to people with fine hair.</li>
            <li> I just wrote a fairly in depth review for the John Frieda Luxurious Volume Thickening Conditioner for Thin Hair used in conjunction with this shampoo. I like the set, they’ve made my hair feel a lot fuller, bouncier, more alive. The only downfall is that I find my hair is tangled after washing. If I use a deep conditioner, it detangles and combs out easily, but my hair is kinda flat afterwards. If I use JF conditioner, it doesn’t really do much to untangle, but when I style my hair it feels soooo light and full! I don’t use a hair dryer until my hair is at least 50% dry. Then with dryer on low heat I comb my fingers through and it untangles just fine. I love my hair now!</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with how much body and volume this shampoo ( and conditioner) give my very fine hair. The best result is when using them both together. Before this, no other volumizing shampoo gave the same results as Fekkai. But I can&#x27;t justify spending nearly 60 bucks on 2 bottles of hair product when something equally good costs 10 bucks or less. Yes, Fekkai smells great, but that alone does not make me want to spend all that extra money. (If you want sexy smelling hair, spritz a bit ( not a lot) of your perfume on wet hair, comb through, and blow dry or not. The resulting fragrance is nice and subtle.)</li>
            <li> Shampoo smells good &amp; lathers up nicely but I can&#x27;t say it really gives my hair more volume.</li>
            <li> I like the price, I like how it works with my fine hair. I like that it is Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> Great product and worth the few extra dollars in any drug store.  It&#x27;s better than other much ballyhooed brands of high-end products.  I have fine hair cut very short.  This product really boosts volume.  I even take it to the salon with me.</li>
            <li> I have colored red hair and found the shampoo caused my color to fade very quickly.  I need volume but I also need the color protected.  I will try the shampoo for colored hair next purchase..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had extremely fine hair and, let&#x27;s face it, once your over 65 it gets finer and thinner. Over the years I&#x27;ve used every volumizing shampoo out there. Many are drying, and most don&#x27;t make any difference. So for years I&#x27;ve just relied on gels etc to create more fullness. I picked up a small trial size tube of this in the local drugstore and am so happy I did!  My hair is very short and now, instead of just lying there flat and sparse-looking, it actually has fullness and covers more of my scalp!  I also occasionally use the conditioner, and that is good too, but not really necessary to achieve some fullness. And you cannot beat the price: About $5.50 here on Amazon, and also in local drugstores, but as another reviewer has pointed out, it&#x27;s often hard to find locally. Another huge plus is that it&#x27;s made here in the US. :-)</li>
            <li> Soft shampoo, smells great!</li>
            <li> Voluminous beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin limp hair and this shampoo makes it seem fuller.  Have used Nioxcin in the past, which is more costly, and have now switched to this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Wish it came in a bigger size.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I ever used.  Please always keep it!!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo as it was discounted in Rite Aid. I am extremely skeptical of shampoos claims to give my baby fine hair volume, bounce, fullness etc having tried so many which failed. I was pleasantly surprised to find this one actually worked. My hair feels clean and shiny, it looks healthy &amp; has body &amp; bounce in it. Better still it doesn&#x27;t look or feel coated or fly away. I have to wash my hair every day because it looks greasy otherwise &amp; have seen good results every day. Personally I have slightly longer than chin length bob and a small amount, maybe 2/3 peas washes my hair. Overall really pleased with the find.</li>
            <li> I will buy it again, it makes your hair really full, excellent product, I recommend it, I will try other products  from Frieda</li>
            <li> it smells nice and lathers well but i don&#x27;t really see much volume.. not a fan of this particular line..</li>
