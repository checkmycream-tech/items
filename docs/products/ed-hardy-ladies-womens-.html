            <li> I love this perfume, its so feminine and sweet smelling but not too overbearing. I always get compliments on how nice I smell and I love it! I bought this product from AAA Merchants and they had the best price for my budget. The company has superb customer service and will notify you of your shipment. Just ask them and they will provide the tracking information. I will definitely buy from them again through Amazon marketplace. Thank you Amazon and AAA Merchants! God bless! :-)</li>
            <li> Nice scent but not as clean as some of the other Ed Hardy fragrances.  To me, it&#x27;s a little stronger.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a gift for my daughter and she loves this perfume. It must not be in production anymore because I can&#x27;t find it in ANY retail stores.</li>
            <li> My parfume arrived in excellent time, I was very surprised! When it got here though i unwrapped the package and discovered that the parfume was everywhere in the case as well as the bag it was mailed in, I later discovered that there seemed to be something wrong with the spray nozzle.I contacted the store I ordered it from and sent them pics of the broken product, They were quick about responding and gave me no hassle whatsoever and got a replacement back in the mail the same day!! Pretty awesome! I just received the replacement bottle in record time and it was in perfect condition, I dont think it was the sellers fault for the first bottle being broken I think the problem lied in the shipping process.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this perfume</li>
            <li> Smells great! Arrived earlier than I thought it would!</li>
            <li> Nothing else smells quite like this, it is unique and if needed a great gag gift.  Attractive skulls on pink packaging.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. It is my favorite out of all the perfumes u wear. It is very sweet smelling but not overpowering. It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t wear out. I wear it almost every day and I always get compliments on how good I smell. Great job!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves Ed Hardy it was a great price.And she was surprise it also smells good nice Christmas present</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m VERY picky about scents ... I don&#x27;t do flower, STRONG , take your breath away can smell you a mile away..... This STUFF IS AWESOME!!!!!! I found a new fragrance that is just right for me.  I use to wear the imposter body spray and I LOVED IT ,,, so I decided to try the real thing.... I&#x27;m SOOOOO glad I did....</li>
            <li> I always wondered about this perfume, and it really smells great!</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast Shipping!!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. And I also live that it&#x27;s cheaper than buying it in the department store. I really hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this scent. I get SO MANY compliments on it. It came on time and the price was great. So I would def recommend and I give it 2 üëç&#x27;s up!</li>
            <li> I love Ed Hardy perfume! It smells wonderful, and it&#x27;s amazing, I would recommend the perfume to anyone... just not the seller. My package was supposed to be delivered to me on September 19th, and it&#x27;s now October 18th. I noticed that it had to be sent back to the seller and was delivered to them on October 1st, but it hasn&#x27;t been sent back out nor have I gotten my money back. They never tried to contact me to let me know what&#x27;s going on with it, and  I&#x27;m very disappointed with them. So, yes, the perfume is amazing! But next time I try to order it, I&#x27;ll pay the few extra dollars to try to get it from somewhere a little more reliable.</li>
            <li> Fast transaction. Love the product</li>
            <li> Great price for a wonderful smelling perfume</li>
            <li> yes I lover it matter in fact I&#x27;m almost out I need to order more</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume. I love the case that it comes in and the smell is beautiful. I wear it everyday. Much cheaper on Amazon than it was to go to the store to buy it. Will purchase again when I run out.</li>
            <li> may not be original but I cannot tell the difference&lt;br /&gt;it is worth the price and I get compliments on the smell</li>
            <li> This perfume is definitely not for me as it does not mix well with my chemistry.  I don&#x27;t recommend buying perfume on line unless you have tried it first.  Everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different.</li>
            <li> I am usually not keen on perfume cause some fragrance are to strong, but this is not at all. It has a sweet, feminine, and flowery smell to it. I came upon it because my neighbor had one and I had to get it. :) It&#x27;s a acquired smell and give it a try. The shipping was decent it arrive on time and it was nicely wrapped in the bubble wrap for protection. That was a nice touch to it.</li>
            <li> Received the product in good time and in excellent condition, thank you so much.  Have always received good service from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This item is a knock off of Christian audigier Ed hardy perfume! It is not the real perfume and I was very disappointed that I did not receive the real thing! Looks like ill have to make a special trip to Macy&#x27;s to get it.... They give you a large bottle a small travel size bottle lotion and body wash for $50 and even includes a free Ed hardy purse with purchase!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume. I have worn it for years and I always get a ton of comments on how good I smell. It has a nice fruity smell, and it stays with you a long time.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Fast shipping. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Just what she wanted!</li>
            <li> If I could have chose 0 stars I would have. This is an imposter. It would have been nice to know this before I spent my money on something I am not able to return. Very, very upset about this. People should be honest about what they are selling.</li>
            <li> omg I was so surprised about the size of the perfume. I was so happy and I enjoy the smell very much!</li>
            <li> loved it, got more than I thought I was getting!</li>
            <li> I have always loved this scent and bought the knock offs, but the scent always faded very quickly. This stuff is much stronger and does not fade. Just a spray or two will do!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s so convenient shopping on Amazon</li>
            <li> I get lot&#x27;s of compliments when wearing \\&quot;Christian Audigier Ed Hardy\\&quot;....If you love a clean, citrus, smell then this is the one for you. It&#x27;s not a heavy smell, very light. If you like \\&quot;Happy\\&quot; by Clinique, then this is in the same family...Try it for valentines, my husband loves the smell on me.</li>
            <li> great price and love this scent</li>

            <li> I love this perfume I used to buy it at Ulta but it costed me $30 to $35 dollars. I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t do it sooner but I decided to look on Amazon for it to see if I could get a better deal. I did &amp; I&#x27;m very happy I found my favorite perfume for less.</li>
