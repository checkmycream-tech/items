            <li>doesnt smell the greatest..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years and always looking for the best deals on it and found it here.  </li>
            <li>Great dandruff shampoo!</li>
            <li>great price.  </li>
            <li>GREAT</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t very effective; I had to shampoo twice and leave it on my head each time for longer than the 2-3 minutes the directions instructed.  </li>
            <li>works great, the best shampoo for dandruff and other conditions.  </li>
            <li>We were glad to be able to get it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have used Medidan shampoo for many yrs.</li>
            <li>IT SEEMS TO BE OK..</li>
            <li>BUT PRICE WAS OK</li>
            <li>and you get more for your money.</li>
            <li>Has performed much better than most of the over the counters I have tried.</li>
            <li>It is a much better deal that</li>
            <li>I kept having to add more shampoo to feel it on the whole of my head.  </li>
            <li>So far better than anything I&#x27;ve found in stores.</li>
            <li>It works, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money I&#x27;m saving.  </li>
            <li>so I just apply it right to my head.</li>
            <li>glad to be able to find it online because i&#x27;m not able to find it in the store anymore.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>how much shampoo I&#x27;m using.  </li>
            <li>It is so much better then other dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li>I like it better than regular strength because the regular won&#x27;t lather up at all</li>
            <li>Also, it reeks to high heaven and the menthol does not seem to help.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this a little more than a week.</li>
            <li>and this is the only product I have found to eliminate flakes and itching, far better than Head and Shoulders or even Selsan Blue.  </li>
            <li>With this product I am able to tame (not cure)</li>
            <li>AND it is gentle enough to use every day.  </li>
            <li>far as I can tell, the product&#x27;s name is Medi Dan and has nothing to do with the Clubman brand.&lt;br /&gt;In summary</li>
            <li>I have used this twice so far.</li>
            <li>I like this more then the Neutrogena T-Gel because it&#x27;s not so thick</li>
            <li>The shampoo has the same consistency as water and so therefore I have to pour the shampoo directly on my head, meaning I have no idea</li>

            <li> It isn&#x27;t harsh, and therefiore, exactl6 what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He was disappointed. It didn&#x27;t help with the itchy scalp. He stopped using it.</li>
            <li> This shampoos is AWSOME! My hair and scalp doesn&#x27;t flake or itch for a week. I would recommend this shampoo to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> doesnt smell the greatest..but it seems to have cleared up my dandruff within a couple weeks....</li>
            <li> The only product that works for my scalp..</li>
            <li> I have used Medidan Extra Strength Shampoo EVERY day for 25 years.  I have pshorias of the scalp and this is the only product I have found to eliminate flakes and itching, far better than Head and Shoulders or even Selsan Blue.  It was recommended by a hair stylist and I have used it ever since AND it is gentle enough to use every day.  I like it better than regular strength because the regular won&#x27;t lather up at all and it just takess a little bit (less than a capfull) of the extra strength.  It disappoints me that I hear Medi-Dan is discontinuing this product.</li>
            <li> works great, the best shampoo for dandruff and other conditions.  great price.  glad to be able to find it online because i&#x27;m not able to find it in the store anymore.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that works for my husband.  He has been using it for years but was unable to find it at our local beauty supply recently.  We were glad to be able to get it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used Medidan shampoo for many yrs. It is so much better then other dandruff shampoos. If given the choice of several shampoos,I would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> IT SEEMS TO BE OK..NOTHING GREAT BUT PRICE WAS OK</li>
            <li> Coal tar is the only thing that has worked for me. I like this more then the Neutrogena T-Gel because it&#x27;s not so thick and you get more for your money. It is like pouring water into your hands so I just apply it right to my head. It does dry my hair so sometimes I&#x27;ll but conditioner on my ends while I shampoo my scalp. With this product I am able to tame (not cure) my psoriasis. I also apply it to my face when I have a random flare up. I use to get this at Sally&#x27;s but they discontinued it (at least in stores) thank goodness Amazon had it.</li>
            <li> It works wonders on the scalp esp if u have scalp problems.  Follow the directions and u will c its a God sent</li>
            <li> Has performed much better than most of the over the counters I have tried. My daughter recommended it to me and I in turn have recommended it to others including my son.</li>
            <li> Sheer garbage.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it three times in an effort to be objective, no go.&lt;br /&gt;When I poured it into my cupped palms, it came out so stringy I lost half of what I poured.&lt;br /&gt;It does not lather up, and it has had no noticeable effect on my hair/scalp.&lt;br /&gt;As far as I can tell, the product&#x27;s name is Medi Dan and has nothing to do with the Clubman brand.&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this seems like a scam instead of a tar-based shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a little more than a week. So far better than anything I&#x27;ve found in stores. I have it pretty bad - I basically avoided wearing black and it was such a nuisance. It&#x27;s not completely gone, but definitely an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weird:&lt;br /&gt;The texture! it smells like paint and looks like wood stain. I feel like I have to use a lot to get it to &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Sally&#x27;s for $10.  It is a much better deal that Neutrogena T-Gel.  I get oily flakes on my scalp.  My scalp also itches.  I have used this twice so far. The menthol is cooling and takes care of the itch.  It works so well that when I went to wash my hair three days later I still had no itch or flakes. Usually within a couple of days my scalp is itchy and flakey.  I scrubbed my scalp for three minutes as the directions state to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years and always looking for the best deals on it and found it here.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years!!  Great dandruff shampoo!</li>
            <li> I gave this shampoo a shot wondering how it stacked up to another, more expensive brand.  It works, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money I&#x27;m saving.  The shampoo has the same consistency as water and so therefore I have to pour the shampoo directly on my head, meaning I have no idea how much shampoo I&#x27;m using.  I kept having to add more shampoo to feel it on the whole of my head.  When I followed the instructions of shampooing once  it wasn&#x27;t very effective; I had to shampoo twice and leave it on my head each time for longer than the 2-3 minutes the directions instructed.  Also, it reeks to high heaven and the menthol does not seem to help.  When this runs out I will go back to the other brand.</li>
