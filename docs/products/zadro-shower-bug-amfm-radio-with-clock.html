            <li>I thought this would be just the perfect size for a radio in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having said that, it&#x27;s still probably the best shower radio</li>
            <li>Absolutely wonderful item to have.</li>
            <li>bug feature is great and he can get his time updates with some tunes to get him</li>
            <li>Otherwise a great product for the price.</li>
            <li>I just bought this shower radio because I thought the price was good</li>
            <li>We happened to go into a store called JR&#x27;s - which has everything at a really good price.</li>
            <li>so I liked that</li>
            <li>I loved how it looked, I thought it was so cute</li>
            <li>Nice having clock to keep time in shower.</li>
            <li>He won&#x27;t even listen to it any more because he has to reset the station every time he turns it on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute, but it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>It has just a scan button to search for stations and sometimes cant find the station that you want but for the price it was ok</li>
            <li>so be prepared to hope that your favorite station is either playing music or broadcasting thier name when you get to it.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $7 - $10 for something like this though.ave had.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $7 - $10 for something like this though.</li>
            <li>I lived on the top floor of my apartment building, had a window in my shower, and would get very good radio signals from NYC radio stations in the area on other radios - but the shower bug often wouldn&#x27;t find the very strong radio station signals.  </li>
            <li>Although the volume is good, shower radios aren&#x27;t meant for really large rooms.</li>
            <li>It stopped working after about 10 minutes of static filled reception.</li>
            <li>I thought it would look cute, it just looks cheap.</li>
            <li>The ability to adjust the volume is easy - there&#x27;s a dial on the side to adjust the volume.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it were digital, not analog, but I can&#x27;t complain because the price was so good</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it were digital, not analog, but I can&#x27;t complain because the price was so good</li>
            <li>I think the acoustics in our bathroom are good because of the size and we have a high sloping</li>
            <li>In any case, all was fine until my wife went to remove it from the shower wall.</li>
            <li>But, that&#x27;s not enough to give it a good rating.  </li>
            <li>The major problem was the radio - the shower bug is primarily a RADIO, so one would expect to be able to use that functionality relatively easy.  </li>
            <li>The Shower Bugs were super inexpensive -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cute little radio, nice and compact.  </li>
            <li>The whole thing looks really cheap.</li>
            <li>If I thought it was worth the effort, I would return it.</li>
            <li>But when I forget to hook something up before hopping in the shower, the shower bug is always there - right inside our shower; on a glass wall furthest from the stream of water.</li>
            <li>And since there is a button to scan to the next available radio station (instead of an old fashioned tuner-dial), you might need to press it 10 times or more each morning to get to your preferred station.</li>
            <li>The suction cups also work, unlike most, but it does come with a short line to hang it from just in case.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;d expect to pay more for digital.  </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;d expect to pay more for digital.  </li>
            <li>I would appreciate a better product that actually works thanks for nothing</li>
            <li>The radio&#x27;s digital time was clear, making watching time in the shower quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>It was very inexpensive...</li>
            <li>Batteries are used up fast.  </li>
            <li>As it uses too much power to run.</li>
            <li>so it actually picks up more than two stations and even plays them clearly.</li>
            <li>The radio station resets itself to the beginning of the radio dial when you turn it off; you can only move the tuner forward, not back, so you have to reset to the beginning if you miss a station; and now that I&#x27;ve had it for a few months, it has started changing stations on its own without me touching it.</li>
            <li>Sound was not great, but good enough for listening to the news while taking a shower.     </li>
            <li>If I would have known I would need a new battery I would have spent a little more money on his shower radio and clock and got a better one...</li>
            <li>/&gt;We&#x27;ve found that radio stations come in really clearly, and we&#x27;ve had no real problems with static.</li>
            <li>Where there is the occasional static, it&#x27;s only on stations</li>
            <li>we wouldn&#x27;t normally get anyway -</li>
            <li>The clock wasn&#x27;t even that good, falling behind over a couple of months.</li>
            <li>Zadro offered to send me a new Shower Bug.</li>
            <li>Had to go out and spend over $6 to get a new battery to replace the one that came with it...  </li>
            <li>We have no problem hearing music or talk radio - they both come in very clearly.</li>
            <li>It is not expensive enough to return.</li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t had any problems with it staying on the wall, possibly because it&#x27;s adhered to glass, as opposed to tile, and the wall stays pretty</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been perfect in our bathroom - which is approximately 12 x 15 (not an exact rectangle) with a separate toilet area - which is approximately 4 x 8.</li>
            <li>The buttons are VERY hard to press and there&#x27;s no indicator of any kind telling what station it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it did last much longer than the Sony.</li>
            <li>gave the Zadro Shower Bug Radios a solid 3 stars because you really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>Our 10 year old doesn&#x27;t like it for this reason.</li>

            <li>Our 10 year old doesn&#x27;t like it for this reason.</li>
            <li>Right now its only purpose in our bathroom is for the tiny time display.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these very inexpensively after two far more expensive Sony shower radios died.</li>
            <li>I had a hard time being able to tell if it was on the right station or not, since it wasn&#x27;t a digital dial (if I remember correctly, the dial didn&#x27;t even have the station numbers on it) and the radio wouldn&#x27;t pick up the radio stations at the same strengths as other radios (sometimes a station that had a bad signal on other radios would pick up better on this than a good signaled station).  </li>
            <li>The only thing which made it tolerable was that the station I used was near the bottom of the dial.</li>
            <li>As other said, the tuner would reset itself to the beginning of the dial when turned off and retuning it to a station was very difficult/time consuming.  </li>
            <li>There are two reason this is bad: you might not be able to listen to your favorite radio station every day and you could waste a LOT of time trying to tune the thing every time you use it (which, for me, defeated the purpose of having it as it was to help me keep my time in the shower to a minimum).    </li>
            <li>The main reason he quit listening is because after I spent time trying to set the station in the morning, during his shower the station would automatically change to another one, give me a break!</li>
            <li>Amazon should remove items after so many negative comments!!</li>

            <li> My husband and I picked up a couple of these little Zadro Shower Bug Radios - one in blue and one in purple.</li>
            <li> No thanks!</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t retain your usual station, and start there when you turn it back on.</li>
            <li> We have other devices we can listen to when we&#x27;re in the bathroom - music, audio books, etc...</li>
            <li> /&gt;We haven&#x27;t had any problems with rusting - like some other people seem to have had.</li>
            <li> But it was such a pain to even take off the screws for the batteries (not provided) - and the sound is really annoying - it does not pick up reception well.</li>
            <li> The button to adjust the station is on the front of the shower bug, and it&#x27;s really small; making it a bit hard to go to the next station.</li>

            <li> I just bought this shower radio because I thought the price was good and all I needed it for was the clock and radio functions.  Well what a mistake!  I agree with the other reviewers that it is EXTREMELY ANNOYING to have to keep pressing the scan button in order to find the channel you usually listen to.  What really upsets me is that you don&#x27;t know if you have reached your usual channel since there isn&#x27;t a dial for you to see what channel you&#x27;re currently on.  I have to listen to another radio in another room for me to know what is playing on my usual channel, and then run into the bathroom and try to find that channel on this radio before I jump in the shower.  Whoever made this product is an idiot!</li>
            <li> My girls bought this for their step dad for his birthday. He won&#x27;t even listen to it any more because he has to reset the station every time he turns it on. We can never find the station we like without having another radio on to find it. The main reason he quit listening is because after I spent time trying to set the station in the morning, during his shower the station would automatically change to another one, give me a break! This is a worthless radio, it doesn&#x27;t even deserve 1 star!</li>
            <li> I would have given it zero stars but that is not an option. It stopped working after about 10 minutes of static filled reception. It was difficult to get a station. And it was not a problem with the batteries. Run, don&#x27;t walk, *away* from this!</li>
            <li> I wish I had read reviews before I purchased this item. Radio gets very poor reception, and you have to search to find your station every time you turn off the radio. It&#x27;s cute, but it doesn&#x27;t work. If I thought it was worth the effort, I would return it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His apartment is a bit cramped and the bathroom is small so he does not like bringing the smart phone in when he showers in the am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bug feature is great and he can get his time updates with some tunes to get him started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The display could be just a little bigger. Otherwise a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> It has just a scan button to search for stations and sometimes cant find the station that you want but for the price it was ok</li>
            <li> My daughters received this radio for Christmas. It is a little short on features with regards to how annoying it is to tune. But, for little kids, they just like to play with it. In any case, all was fine until my wife went to remove it from the shower wall. It turns out that the rubber suction cups that come with the shower bug reacted (rather badly) with the wall of my tub surround. I now have four 1\\&quot; cicles melted into my shower wall. Zadro offered to send me a new Shower Bug. I guess they think I need eight 1\\&quot; circles on my wall. No thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cute little radio, nice and compact.  The clock can keep time.  That&#x27;s where the usefullness ends.  It is difficult to tune.  The antenna got rusted.  It was very inexpensive... but in this case, you get what you pay for.  Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be just the perfect size for a radio in my bathroom. It is. However, the FM tuner on the radio automatically resets to 88.1 FM EVERY time you turn it off. It won&#x27;t retain your usual station, and start there when you turn it back on. And since there is a button to scan to the next available radio station (instead of an old fashioned tuner-dial), you might need to press it 10 times or more each morning to get to your preferred station. It&#x27;s really quite annoying, and I end up listening to NPR for traffic instead of my favorite station, which is much farther down the dial. I would not have bought this product if I knew that ahead of time.</li>
            <li> I always check reviews before buying something but in this case I totally forgot to because my old radio died after 7 years and i desperately needed a new one. It tells time so I liked that but the radio is worthless! There is no tuner dial so be prepared to hope that your favorite station is either playing music or broadcasting thier name when you get to it. You&#x27;re screwed if it&#x27;s a commercial break. And it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if I found my station and it stayed there but nooooo every time you turn it off it goes back to the beginning of the FM dial which means that, yes, you have to search for your station before each and every single solitary shower. Very frustrating. Amazon should remove items after so many negative comments!!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these very inexpensively after two far more expensive Sony shower radios died. On the plus side, it did last much longer than the Sony. On the negative side, it is difficult to tune in radio stations, and it doesn&#x27;t hold the station once tuned in. You have to push one button to move thru the stations and it doesn&#x27;t display where it was. The only thing which made it tolerable was that the station I used was near the bottom of the dial. The clock wasn&#x27;t even that good, falling behind over a couple of months. Sound was not great, but good enough for listening to the news while taking a shower.     The antenna came off today and it will need to be replaced. I&#x27;ve decided to try a more expensive one (different from the Sony). If that one doesn&#x27;t work out, I might consider buying one of these again only because they are inexpensive and it lasted longer than any other shower radios I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> The radio station resets itself to the beginning of the radio dial when you turn it off; you can only move the tuner forward, not back, so you have to reset to the beginning if you miss a station; and now that I&#x27;ve had it for a few months, it has started changing stations on its own without me touching it.</li>
            <li> I cann&#x27;t get the radio to work. It is not expensive enough to return. I&#x27;ll look for another brand. The description says AM/FM but it is only FM.</li>
            <li> I received one of these shower bugs as a gift years ago...I loved how it looked, I thought it was so cute (read: cheesy, sometimes, I love cheesy). :)  But, that&#x27;s not enough to give it a good rating.  The radio&#x27;s digital time was clear, making watching time in the shower quick and easy.  The major problem was the radio - the shower bug is primarily a RADIO, so one would expect to be able to use that functionality relatively easy.  Not the case!    As other said, the tuner would reset itself to the beginning of the dial when turned off and retuning it to a station was very difficult/time consuming.  I lived on the top floor of my apartment building, had a window in my shower, and would get very good radio signals from NYC radio stations in the area on other radios - but the shower bug often wouldn&#x27;t find the very strong radio station signals.  I had a hard time being able to tell if it was on the right station or not, since it wasn&#x27;t a digital dial (if I remember correctly, the dial didn&#x27;t even have the station numbers on it) and the radio wouldn&#x27;t pick up the radio stations at the same strengths as other radios (sometimes a station that had a bad signal on other radios would pick up better on this than a good signaled station).  There are two reason this is bad: you might not be able to listen to your favorite radio station every day and you could waste a LOT of time trying to tune the thing every time you use it (which, for me, defeated the purpose of having it as it was to help me keep my time in the shower to a minimum).    The bug needs major improvements - I&#x27;d purchase it again if it functioned as expected!</li>
            <li> Batteries are used up fast.  As it uses too much power to run.</li>
            <li> The buttons are VERY hard to press and there&#x27;s no indicator of any kind telling what station it&#x27;s on. It always starts at the lowest frequency station it can find and then you have to press Scan over and over, stopping to listen each time to try to guess what station it found.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, it&#x27;s still probably the best shower radio I&#x27;ve ever used simply because IT HAS AN ANTENNA so it actually picks up more than two stations and even plays them clearly. The suction cups also work, unlike most, but it does come with a short line to hang it from just in case.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all period I lost my money for nothing! I would appreciate a better product that actually works thanks for nothing</li>
            <li> My son opened this gift Christmas Eve and he got it all set up but the clock wouldn&#x27;t work.  Had to go out and spend over $6 to get a new battery to replace the one that came with it...  If I would have known I would need a new battery I would have spent a little more money on his shower radio and clock and got a better one...</li>
            <li> I thought it would look cute, it just looks cheap. Bought it for time and radio entertainment in the bathroom. But it was such a pain to even take off the screws for the batteries (not provided) - and the sound is really annoying - it does not pick up reception well. Right now its only purpose in our bathroom is for the tiny time display. The whole thing looks really cheap.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful item to have. Nice having clock to keep time in shower. Keeps kids awake in the morning instead of their usual falling asleep in the shower. Will definitely be buying one for second bathroom.</li>
            <li> My husband and I picked up a couple of these little Zadro Shower Bug Radios - one in blue and one in purple. [[ASIN:B000BOCUUI Zadro Shower Bug FM Radio with Clock, Purple, Model SB01PR]] We have other devices we can listen to when we&#x27;re in the bathroom - music, audio books, etc... But when I forget to hook something up before hopping in the shower, the shower bug is always there - right inside our shower; on a glass wall furthest from the stream of water. We haven&#x27;t had any problems with it staying on the wall, possibly because it&#x27;s adhered to glass, as opposed to tile, and the wall stays pretty dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We picked up the Zadro Shower Bug Radios while were traveling through NC. We happened to go into a store called JR&#x27;s - which has everything at a really good price. The Shower Bugs were super inexpensive - which is why I picked them up (2 for $10!). We got one for our shower, and one for our teenagers&#x27; shower. Our teenagers don&#x27;t use them as often as we do because they have their music, on their Kindles or phones, where ever they go. Every once in awhile I&#x27;ll hear their shower bug playing in their bathroom - so I know they&#x27;re using it from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve found that radio stations come in really clearly, and we&#x27;ve had no real problems with static. Where there is the occasional static, it&#x27;s only on stations we wouldn&#x27;t normally get anyway - so it&#x27;s not an issue. The ability to adjust the volume is easy - there&#x27;s a dial on the side to adjust the volume. Although the volume is good, shower radios aren&#x27;t meant for really large rooms. It&#x27;s been perfect in our bathroom - which is approximately 12 x 15 (not an exact rectangle) with a separate toilet area - which is approximately 4 x 8. We have no problem hearing music or talk radio - they both come in very clearly. I think the acoustics in our bathroom are good because of the size and we have a high sloping ceiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We haven&#x27;t had any problems with rusting - like some other people seem to have had. We try not to let our bathroom get too humid - so maybe it has something to do with that. Or, it could be that our shower bug stays dry on the wall to which it&#x27;s attached - which is furthest from the stream of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the Zadro Shower Bug Radios a solid 3 stars because you really can&#x27;t beat the price. It IS a bit HARD to tune because the button you push to tune it is hard to push - has to be pushed down HARD - so it&#x27;s not for some kids, or people with arthritic fingers. Our 10 year old doesn&#x27;t like it for this reason. Also, you can only tune/adjust it one way. If you accidentally pass the station you&#x27;re looking for, you have to go all the way through the radio stations again. The button to adjust the station is on the front of the shower bug, and it&#x27;s really small; making it a bit hard to go to the next station. It would be nice if it were digital, not analog, but I can&#x27;t complain because the price was so good - I&#x27;d expect to pay more for digital.  BUT, for such inexpensive radios 2 for $10... I can&#x27;t complain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for those who want an inexpensive small shower radio.  I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $7 - $10 for something like this though.ave had.
