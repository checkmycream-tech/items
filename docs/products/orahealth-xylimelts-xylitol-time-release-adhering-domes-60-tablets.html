    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>But since then, very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>This is a great product!</li>
            <li>They taste fairly well, too!</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>They are also great at night</li>
            <li>It lasts about an hour, so I don&#x27;t think it would be good for night time use, but it&#x27;s great for daytime.    </li>
            <li>I found that these work fairly well for keeping your mouth \\&quot;wet\\&quot; during the night.</li>
            <li>this product works good</li>
            <li>I give the product 4 stars because it is definitely superior to substitutes.</li>
            <li>No taste which was good.</li>
            <li>They have a pleasant taste, the adhesive works nicely.  </li>
            <li>I am never without them and love Amazon&#x27;s one click buy!</li>
            <li>For me, one was perfect, so I tried two...way too much and had to get rid of one during the night.  </li>
            <li>and this one is the best by far.</li>
            <li>Has a pleasant, mild flavor.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more XyliMelt.</li>
            <li>No doubt everyone is different, the point is that there is a time range and you want to experiment for best results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is that you can use as many \\&quot;as needed\\&quot; for saliva stimulation, with no caution about the abrasiveness inherent in xylitol and its irritant effects.</li>
            <li>I am ordering more of these.</li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>So glad my hygienist recommended I try this product out.</li>
            <li>The main ingredient, xylitol, is a plant sugar which stimulates saliva production; your own saliva is vastly superior to any substitute.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They have a mild mint flavor that is nice without being distracting.</li>
            <li>These &#x27;melts&#x27; work superbly at staving off dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>and I love that they are mint free.</li>
            <li>The Xylimelts on the other hand are wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, and works well.  </li>
            <li>These mints are very good in alleviating the symptoms of dry mouth.</li>
            <li>I found that the 2 primary determinants of time length are whether day vs night, and where in the mouth they are placed.  </li>
            <li>With my light usage, I have not had any problems with irritation from the adhesive.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think that they are interested in being more ecologically friendly.  </li>
            <li>Great for people with dry mouth!</li>
            <li>They are wonderful and the only product out of many I have tried other than chewing gum that works.  </li>
            <li>The Salese work, but leave a bit too much slime in my mouth and the flavor is too strong.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it were more readily available in local drug stores, etc.  </li>
            <li>and so far, it&#x27;s brought me the most amount of relief since my mouth dryness has started.</li>
            <li>Get some right away.</li>
            <li>MINGUS&#x27; review is right on spot.  </li>
            <li>These work pretty well, but I find that I go through them pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>The most effective spot for me (as with another reviewer) is about 2/3 of the way back on the outside lower gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>or you have something important the next day and need to sleep comfortably through the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can easily talk and read out loud while using one of these.  </li>
            <li>Some last a bit longer or add a bit more moisture than others,</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;mint-free\\&quot; are exactly that.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Keeps me sleeping and takes away the crabbiness that comes from missing a good night&#x27;s sleep.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I prefer these to the \\&quot;mild mint\\&quot; which, while mild, still have a distinctive amount of mint.  </li>
            <li>I really love these mints for night time dry mouth relief for Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome.</li>
            <li>These things work really well for dry mouth, better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and since they are xylitol they won&#x27;t rot your teeth and may even help your digestion, without introducing any sugars into your system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They last about 40-60 minutes for me, but that&#x27;s a huge improvement over the 5 minutes of relief with Biotene.  </li>
            <li>I tried another brand and didn&#x27;t like it as much.  </li>
            <li>I am allergic to mint so to find a mint-free product was a real plus.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the &#x27;mint&#x27; sticks somewhere in the mouth out of the way, and hence the 2 stars, but other than that I didn&#x27;t get any relief.</li>
            <li>This brand works much better for me than the other brand you can buy at the drugstore chains.</li>
            <li>I found everything in the review to be accurate except that this product didn&#x27;t alleviate my dry mouth at all.  </li>
            <li>For me, on the lower outside gum line near the back is not only most comfortable but lasts the longest, too.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Before that I had to chew gum in order to talk and besides making my jaw hurt it really does not look professional.</li>
            <li>It is the ONLY thing that I have been able to find that truly solves dry mouth.</li>
            <li>I really wish the vendor would sell larger numbers of the tablets without so much packaging (the packing is a box for every 60 or so tabs, complete with a hanger for store use--</li>
            <li>I just use one at bedtime, which seems to last for the first 2-3 hours anyway, though not all night.</li>
            <li>During the daytime, the discs will not last more than 2 hours and quite possibly much less because . .</li>
            <li>few important specifics:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>brochure also states to use \\&quot;at least 3 or 4 more discs\\&quot; during the day \\&quot;and as needed\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>They stick on the gums and dissolve completely.</li>
            <li>Works ok but the tabs are very small... and do not last very long at all - to justify the very HIGH price $$$ !!</li>
            <li>You will really benefit from using this product if you suffer from night-time dry mouth.</li>
            <li>This product works really well for sufferers of dry mouth like me.  </li>
            <li>It  really didn&#x27;t help my dry mouth.</li>
            <li>but basically all the same and pretty short lasting.  </li>
            <li>Very mild taste and works in a subtle way</li>
            <li>Worked wonders at high altitudes and in dry exercise environments.  </li>
            <li>Frequent use in the same spot causes irritation from the adhesive, so I suggest rotating them between different points in your mouth if you use them regularly.</li>
            <li>Also, the xylitol has a very slight graininess to it asit dissolves; not noticeable at first</li>
            <li>At night saliva product is decreased, hence dry mouth is usually more severe then.  </li>
            <li>but if you use the discs frequently you may experience general tissue irritation as I have, and as other reviewers have.  </li>

            <li> They gradually melt and help some but are really sweet and when they are finished I have a very sticky mouth that is nasty sweet!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those who suffer from dry mouth due to medications.</li>
            <li> The price is a little high for what they do for me.</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first, but it really works.</li>
            <li> just doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> They do not last as long as Oramoist lozenges, which I use at night.</li>
            <li> Having read other reviews, I rotate the placement of the melt, using several spots on the outside of my teeth/gums, upper and lower.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely buy some of these, even if you don&#x27;t use them every night, just so that you can have them nights where it&#x27;s abnormally dry</li>
            <li> bought these about 2 months ago and have been using them at night only, just to mitigate the dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Placing the disks on my upper outside gum line results in them dissolving quickly, much less than an hour.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various mints, sprays and other discs for dry mouth</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll use them before a meeting or when I will have to speak to customers to keep the dry cough away.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry mouth at night.</li>
            <li> But at the same time, one&#x27;s mouth and tongue are not moving and in sleep our metabolism slows; with my severe condition the disks last no more than 2-3 hours</li>
            <li> Product did not really do much for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I get really dry mouth due to medications.  </li>
            <li> XyliMelts are the only product that I&#x27;ve found that helps me get through the night without experiencing very uncomfortable symptoms when I wake up (either during the night or after a full night&#x27;s sleep).  </li>
            <li> In particular, I was annoyed by the inference</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I&#x27;ve tried everything OTC plus a prescription spray.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really my only complaint.</li>
            <li> No more waking to have to have a drink because my mouth is so dry.  </li>
            <li> and he said the irritant characteristic of xylitol is common knowledge among health</li>
            <li> I have rheumatoid arthritis but have quite a few side conditions.</li>
            <li> I have trouble swallowing foods and heartburn.</li>
            <li> this and the instruction sheet makes a lot of waste for someone who uses a package every two weeks or so.  </li>
            <li> This abrasive irritation actually became painful for me - no doubt because the dry mouth itself is also an irritant - and I had to stop using the xylimelts for several days, and thereafter resign myself to using no more than about 4 per day plus the 2 at night.  </li>
            <li> I have a severe case of dry mouth due to an autoimmune disease, and I tutor children, and it would be impossible for me to do so without XyliMelts.  </li>
            <li> I buy from this vendor because they are very expensive to use (2 or 3 at a time) on a daily basis, and you did get a small price break.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stayed away from drugs like Evoxac and Salagen because of common, serious side-effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish they were less expensive.</li>
            <li> The dryness in my mouth has gotten so bad that my mouth has a constant soap-like taste to it.</li>
            <li> I hate for my mouth to be so dry that it is hard to speak.  </li>
            <li> and I can have a conversation without being uncomfortable or embarrassed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various mints, sprays and other discs for dry mouth and this one is the best by far. Has a pleasant, mild flavor.  It lasts about an hour, so I don&#x27;t think it would be good for night time use, but it&#x27;s great for daytime.    I just wish it were more readily available in local drug stores, etc.  As it is, I have to order online.</li>
            <li> I have rheumatoid arthritis but have quite a few side conditions. I had to have tear duct plusgs installed awhile ago for eye dryness. The dryness in my mouth has gotten so bad that my mouth has a constant soap-like taste to it. I have trouble swallowing foods and heartburn. I just started using these and so far, it&#x27;s brought me the most amount of relief since my mouth dryness has started.</li>
            <li> Works ok but the tabs are very small... and do not last very long at all - to justify the very HIGH price $$$ !!&lt;br /&gt;Would try again if the price was about one THIRD what it is now.</li>
            <li> I found that these work fairly well for keeping your mouth \\&quot;wet\\&quot; during the night. They taste fairly well, too! I will say that some days it seems that they won&#x27;t last but 4-6 hours. That&#x27;s really my only complaint. I sleep longer than that. The price is a little high for what they do for me. I would definitely buy some of these, even if you don&#x27;t use them every night, just so that you can have them nights where it&#x27;s abnormally dry or you have something important the next day and need to sleep comfortably through the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I also add a nasal saline gel to my nose to help keep my mouth from getting dry as well. I think both of these together work well. I haven&#x27;t tried these with a sleep apnea machine, though.</li>
            <li> this product works good just doesn&#x27;t last long therefore you need to use several in a day. the gum still seems tom last the longest</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and works well.  I tried another brand and didn&#x27;t like it as much.  I will be ordering more XyliMelt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dealing with a severe dry mouth side-effect from medication. Like other reviewers, I&#x27;ve tried everything OTC plus a prescription spray. I&#x27;ve stayed away from drugs like Evoxac and Salagen because of common, serious side-effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found is that saliva substitutes are, well, just that, substitutes. Some last a bit longer or add a bit more moisture than others, but basically all the same and pretty short lasting.  Xylimelts are not a substitute.  The main ingredient, xylitol, is a plant sugar which stimulates saliva production; your own saliva is vastly superior to any substitute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few important specifics:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brochure states that the discs last 1-6 hours. I found that the 2 primary determinants of time length are whether day vs night, and where in the mouth they are placed.  At night saliva product is decreased, hence dry mouth is usually more severe then.  But at the same time, one&#x27;s mouth and tongue are not moving and in sleep our metabolism slows; with my severe condition the disks last no more than 2-3 hours but the residual saliva continues and I don&#x27;t awake for about 4 hours.  So I need to use 2 pair through the night.  During the daytime, the discs will not last more than 2 hours and quite possibly much less because . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second factor is where they are placed. For me, on the lower outside gum line near the back is not only most comfortable but lasts the longest, too.  Placing the disks on my upper outside gum line results in them dissolving quickly, much less than an hour.  No doubt everyone is different, the point is that there is a time range and you want to experiment for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brochure also states to use \\&quot;at least 3 or 4 more discs\\&quot; during the day \\&quot;and as needed\\&quot;. Frequent use in the same spot causes irritation from the adhesive, so I suggest rotating them between different points in your mouth if you use them regularly. Also, the xylitol has a very slight graininess to it asit dissolves; not noticeable at first but if you use the discs frequently you may experience general tissue irritation as I have, and as other reviewers have.  This abrasive irritation actually became painful for me - no doubt because the dry mouth itself is also an irritant - and I had to stop using the xylimelts for several days, and thereafter resign myself to using no more than about 4 per day plus the 2 at night.  I asked my pharmacist about this and he said the irritant characteristic of xylitol is common knowledge among health professionals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the taste: The \\&quot;mint-free\\&quot; are exactly that. Some reviewers thought there was a hint of mint; not so. They&#x27;re just tasting the sugar itself.  Personally, I prefer these to the \\&quot;mild mint\\&quot; which, while mild, still have a distinctive amount of mint.  If you use a lot of the discs, all that mint may wear on you or bother your stomach.  Again, everyone is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I give the product 4 stars because it is definitely superior to substitutes. I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it does have its limitations which one discovers only through use.  In particular, I was annoyed by the inference is that you can use as many \\&quot;as needed\\&quot; for saliva stimulation, with no caution about the abrasiveness inherent in xylitol and its irritant effects.</li>
            <li> XyliMelts are the only product that I&#x27;ve found that helps me get through the night without experiencing very uncomfortable symptoms when I wake up (either during the night or after a full night&#x27;s sleep).  I buy from this vendor because they are very expensive to use (2 or 3 at a time) on a daily basis, and you did get a small price break.  I really wish the vendor would sell larger numbers of the tablets without so much packaging (the packing is a box for every 60 or so tabs, complete with a hanger for store use--this and the instruction sheet makes a lot of waste for someone who uses a package every two weeks or so.  I have contained the vendor regarding this, but I get no response so I don&#x27;t think that they are interested in being more ecologically friendly.  That&#x27;s a shame.</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first, but it really works. Dry mouth at night: cured. Great product. Highly recommended for those who suffer from dry mouth due to medications.</li>
            <li> These things work really well for dry mouth, better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and since they are xylitol they won&#x27;t rot your teeth and may even help your digestion, without introducing any sugars into your system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these about 2 months ago and have been using them at night only, just to mitigate the dry mouth. I just use one at bedtime, which seems to last for the first 2-3 hours anyway, though not all night. They have a pleasant taste, the adhesive works nicely.  Having read other reviews, I rotate the placement of the melt, using several spots on the outside of my teeth/gums, upper and lower.  With my light usage, I have not had any problems with irritation from the adhesive. The most effective spot for me (as with another reviewer) is about 2/3 of the way back on the outside lower gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> These mints are very good in alleviating the symptoms of dry mouth. Especially for the short term. They have a mild mint flavor that is nice without being distracting. They stick on the gums and dissolve completely. You can use one on each side on your mouth. They do not last as long as Oramoist lozenges, which I use at night. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is the ONLY thing that I have been able to find that truly solves dry mouth. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I had burning mouth for almost a year and now just chronic dry mouth.  I have been using Biotene spray and mouthrinse, but the effects are gone too soon.  I recently ordered Xylimelts and Salese.  The Salese work, but leave a bit too much slime in my mouth and the flavor is too strong.  The Xylimelts on the other hand are wonderful!  Very mild taste and works in a subtle way so my mouth feels moist but not slimy.  I can easily talk and read out loud while using one of these.  They last about 40-60 minutes for me, but that&#x27;s a huge improvement over the 5 minutes of relief with Biotene.  I am ordering more of these.</li>
            <li> I get really dry mouth due to medications.  These work pretty well, but I find that I go through them pretty quickly.  I wish they were less expensive.</li>
            <li> Recommended to me by my dentist.  It is a mouth saver.  No more waking to have to have a drink because my mouth is so dry.  Keeps me sleeping and takes away the crabbiness that comes from missing a good night&#x27;s sleep.  Get some right away. You will really benefit from using this product if you suffer from night-time dry mouth.</li>
            <li> MINGUS&#x27; review is right on spot.  I found everything in the review to be accurate except that this product didn&#x27;t alleviate my dry mouth at all.  I love the fact that the &#x27;mint&#x27; sticks somewhere in the mouth out of the way, and hence the 2 stars, but other than that I didn&#x27;t get any relief.</li>
            <li> They keep my mouth from drying out while I sleep. I am allergic to mint so to find a mint-free product was a real plus.</li>
            <li> I hate for my mouth to be so dry that it is hard to speak.  I tried these XyliMelts that are placed on the gums.  They gradually melt and help some but are really sweet and when they are finished I have a very sticky mouth that is nasty sweet!</li>
            <li> This product works really well for sufferers of dry mouth like me.  Just don&#x27;t overdo the number you take.  For me, one was perfect, so I tried two...way too much and had to get rid of one during the night.  But since then, very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Product did not really do much for dry mouth. It did stick to side of jaw as described. No taste which was good.</li>
            <li> It  really didn&#x27;t help my dry mouth. All can say you can try it  may work for you  but it didn&#x27;t for me</li>
            <li> I really love these mints for night time dry mouth relief for Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome. I use them throughout the day, but especially when I need to talk extensively with the public or [[ASIN:B001A42R1A XyliMelts for Dry Mouth, Mint-Free, 80-Count Boxes]]give a speech etc. Without anything my mouth gets too dry and I can&#x27;t talk. Before that I had to chew gum in order to talk and besides making my jaw hurt it really does not look professional. No one can see the mints in my mouth and I can have a conversation without being uncomfortable or embarrassed. I am never without them and love Amazon&#x27;s one click buy!</li>
            <li> These &#x27;melts&#x27; work superbly at staving off dry mouth.  I&#x27;ll use them before a meeting or when I will have to speak to customers to keep the dry cough away.  They are also great at night so I don&#x27;t have to wake up for sips of water.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry mouth at night. Without these I feel like I have velcro attaching my tongue to the roof of my mouth. One of these tucked into the check at bedtime does the trick. This brand works much better for me than the other brand you can buy at the drugstore chains. I love these and I love that they are mint free.</li>
            <li> Great for people with dry mouth! I use it at night so I don&#x27;t need to get a drink of water.</li>
            <li> I have a severe case of dry mouth due to an autoimmune disease, and I tutor children, and it would be impossible for me to do so without XyliMelts.  They are wonderful and the only product out of many I have tried other than chewing gum that works.  This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Worked wonders at high altitudes and in dry exercise environments.  So glad my hygienist recommended I try this product out.</li>
