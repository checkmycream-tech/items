            <li>The stone size is small and it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks Vktech! :)</li>
            <li>I was excited for these to come in.</li>
            <li>Love them just what I was lookin for  Thanks much!!!</li>
            <li>If I lose them or stones fall out, they&#x27;re cheap enough that I can easily get more.</li>
            <li>The ones I bought after that first time were nowhere near as good as the first ones and these.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have a tracking number, but it&#x27;s totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>In the pic the one on the right is a 16g and</li>
            <li>Several colors to choose from, easy to insert!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pleased with these cute little studs.</li>
            <li>I only got 19 in my package, but customer service was excellent and quick to respond, and at that price I could hardly complain anyway.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li>Overall I was pleased.</li>
            <li>but they are mostly of pretty colors</li>
            <li>These are just like the ones I ordered when I first pierced my nose.</li>
            <li>Love them but there nor very noticeable once there in your boss there tiny.</li>
            <li>Overall they where really cute I will say they&#x27;re 18g but fit in a 16g needle they&#x27;re small but still cute.</li>
            <li>Easy to put in, even tho the gems are tiny.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>But I contact customer service and they explain everything very helpful.</li>
            <li>This really isn&#x27;t noticeable when the studs are in your nose.</li>
            <li>and they come fast as it says..</li>
            <li>Thanks, I would recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I ordered these hoping they&#x27;d be better than the last ones I ordered from a different seller.</li>
            <li>Decent quality.</li>
            <li>they were smaller gauged then expected most  have stones</li>
            <li>The quality of mine were fine, no loose stones or sharp edges.</li>
            <li>But they arrived early, and for the price?</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and they still haven&#x27;t bothered me at all.</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>Pretty much what I was expecting, 4 stars bc one stud was missing a gem</li>
            <li>My complaint is that the rhinestones come off easily.</li>
            <li>The metal is not silver, but more a dark silver, almost gunmetal but not quite that dark.</li>
            <li>They were a bit odd to twist into my piercing, but with some minor adjustments with my trusty pliers, they fit into the piercing</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t sit right on my nose, which may just be the way my nose in particular is shaped.</li>
            <li>and I put clear nail polish over the other jewels so they wouldn&#x27;t fall out so far</li>
            <li>There were a few repeats of certain colors, but that was not a problem for me.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> There were a few repeats of certain colors, but that was not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> 3 of them didn&#x27;t have a stone, then i got 3 of the same purple and 3 of the same pink...</li>
            <li> They arrived a week earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had them for very long, so I cannot yet comment on how well they do or do not hold up.</li>
            <li> It was a little smaller then expecte .</li>
            <li> I expected soe of the gems to be gone, but that never happened.</li>
            <li> I only got 18 and 2 of the 18 gems where missing.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s absolutely no way to get it inside</li>
            <li> I only got 19 and 1 was missing a jewel</li>
            <li> then I expected</li>
            <li> Just what I expected!</li>
            <li> Some were already off when I opened the package, some came off during wearing, and other fell off as I was putting it in.</li>
            <li> A little bit longer than expected</li>
            <li> Although the screw is hard to get in, I totally changed it to make it L shaped.</li>
            <li> then any other I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> But one of the stones on one popped off after a few hours of use.  </li>
            <li> were missing out of them.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re way too thick for a nose piercing.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re impossible to get in your nose until you cut the end off with wire cutters, but then they come out even easier than a regular nose stud</li>
            <li> For the price I paid it wasn&#x27;t bad they are just smaller</li>
            <li> came with twice the colors,  one was broken.</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Fast delivery. I expected soe of the gems to be gone, but that never happened. Super excited!</li>
            <li> What gauge are these?</li>
            <li> My nose rings fits and I like the different colors</li>
            <li> Some colors didn&#x27;t come in my order</li>
            <li> Garbage they are flimsy and fell apart before I took them out of the bag.</li>
            <li> Very cute and lots of colors.  But one of the stones on one popped off after a few hours of use.  So now I have 19. But they arrived early, and for the price? Pretty great.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t to happy diaminds kept falling out</li>
            <li> Love them just what I was lookin for  Thanks much!!!</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re impossible to get in your nose until you cut the end off with wire cutters, but then they come out even easier than a regular nose stud</li>
            <li> I received the nose rings on June 27th. They came packaged very nicely and there are several beautiful colors as promised. The stone size is small and it&#x27;s perfect for me. Thanks Vktech! :)</li>
            <li> I only got 18 and 2 of the 18 gems where missing. But I contact customer service and they explain everything very helpful. They came 3 week to my home. Overall they where really cute I will say they&#x27;re 18g but fit in a 16g needle they&#x27;re small but still cute.</li>
            <li> Great for the price! I have sensitive skin and they still haven&#x27;t bothered me at all. They are quite a bit smaller than the 16g  that I got pierced with, and I wish I knew what gage they are, but I wanted something smaller so I&#x27;m happy. Paid like $1.50 or something like that for 20 so I&#x27;m pleased with these cute little studs. If I lose them or stones fall out, they&#x27;re cheap enough that I can easily get more.</li>
            <li> The selection is good, with many colors to choose from. There were a few repeats of certain colors, but that was not a problem for me. My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t sit right on my nose, which may just be the way my nose in particular is shaped. I haven&#x27;t had them for very long, so I cannot yet comment on how well they do or do not hold up. The metal is not silver, but more a dark silver, almost gunmetal but not quite that dark. This really isn&#x27;t noticeable when the studs are in your nose. They were a bit odd to twist into my piercing, but with some minor adjustments with my trusty pliers, they fit into the piercing just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a great purchase for the price and I know I won&#x27;t run out of options any time soon.</li>
            <li> Rhinestones fell off after a couple of days, you definitely get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I like them but I didn&#x27;t get 20 like they say only got 17...got a lot of same color one didn&#x27;t get some of the colors I wanted. But they&#x27;ll do. Can&#x27;t complain for the price.</li>
            <li> they were smaller gauged then expected most  have stones were missing out of them.</li>
            <li> Greeeeat. Exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li> great deal great quality</li>
            <li> Love them but there nor very noticeable once there in your boss there tiny.</li>
            <li> Too big to put In my nose bought 80 of these. Can&#x27;t even wear them. Disappointed</li>
            <li> Hey its nice I love the colors and I haven&#x27;t used it yet .  and they come fast as it says.. Thank u</li>
            <li> A couple of the stones were missin . It was a little smaller then expecte . But they stay in nicely and look cute.</li>
            <li> This wouldn&#x27;t even fight inside my piercing hole. There&#x27;s absolutely no way to get it inside and they&#x27;re way too thick for a nose piercing. Also the gems were already off before I even opened the packet.</li>
            <li> Easy to put in, even tho the gems are tiny.</li>
            <li> I actually got these for my triple helix piercings. They work perfectly! Several colors to choose from, easy to insert! Very happy I got these</li>
            <li> Very nice and super great value.  I am going to order more just because the product was such a great deal.</li>
            <li> Overall I was pleased. I received all 20, and only 1 was missing the gem stone, can&#x27;t really complain because of the price though. They arrived a week earlier than expected. Got a nice variety of colors and 2 or 3 of them were duplicates. The gauge is a bit smaller than 16g, possibly 18g. In the pic the one on the right is a 16g and the one on the left is what I received. Good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> I love them! I&#x27;ll never run out and lots of colors too!</li>
            <li> Pretty much what I was expecting, 4 stars bc one stud was missing a gem but all else good. It is the correct gauge size, and doesn&#x27;t pop out like many studs tend to do. I recommend buying this, great deal.</li>
            <li> Love them. Their are a lot more than I though I would get</li>
            <li> came with twice the colors,  one was broken.</li>
            <li> No complaints so far. i love the variety of colors.</li>
            <li> I only got 19 and 1 was missing a jewel and I got a a couple doubles but they are mostly of pretty colors so its fine and I put clear nail polish over the other jewels so they wouldn&#x27;t fall out so far so good shipping was early but it still doesn&#x27;t say they delivered even tho they have but that doesn&#x27;t matter. Good for the price so 4 stars.</li>
            <li> The Jewelry looks kind of cheap, but for the price i guess you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the nose rings I received. I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;m always losing them so to get 20 at a very reasonable price is awesome. They all came no issues they are perfect! Just what I expected!</li>
            <li> I agev them away to my friedn , she loved them</li>
            <li> Had multiple of the same colors</li>
            <li> I ordered these hoping they&#x27;d be better than the last ones I ordered from a different seller. These are just like the ones I ordered when I first pierced my nose. The ones I bought after that first time were nowhere near as good as the first ones and these.</li>
            <li> I got multiple of the same color and one of them didn&#x27;t have a stone</li>
            <li> these came really early, and they are the perfect size I wanted, and in perfect condition. Thanks, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid it wasn&#x27;t bad they are just smaller then I expected</li>
            <li> A little bit longer than expected</li>
            <li> I love them they fit and r more secure then any other I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> I only got 19 in my package, but customer service was excellent and quick to respond, and at that price I could hardly complain anyway. It&#x27;s a good mix of colors with some repeats, and the stones have decent sparkle to them. The quality of mine were fine, no loose stones or sharp edges. I think that they are 18g but I&#x27;m not 100% on that. They fit well and stay put, even during sleep and showers. Overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> What guage are these 18?... 20?...</li>
            <li> Came quicker than I thought they would. Awesome colors!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have a tracking number, but it&#x27;s totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> 3 of them didn&#x27;t have a stone, then i got 3 of the same purple and 3 of the same pink... so instead of 20 different color studs I really only got 13</li>
            <li> They were cheap material</li>
            <li> Some of the same colors but a steal for the price. Decent quality. I thought the stones would fall out easily but they are very nice for the price. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was excited for these to come in. Although the screw is hard to get in, I totally changed it to make it L shaped. My complaint is that the rhinestones come off easily. Some were already off when I opened the package, some came off during wearing, and other fell off as I was putting it in. I would just spend the money to get something better. I&#x27;ve had them about 3 days and 7 rhinestones are already gone.</li>
            <li> Just buy it(: I love them</li>
            <li> Great product nice price</li>
