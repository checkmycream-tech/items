            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy at all, which is great for the face.</li>

            <li>It applies smoothly with great coverage.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with the sun protection factor, as well as the fact that it&#x27;s very waterproof.  </li>
            <li>But as far as effectiveness, this stuff is great!  </li>
            <li>This is definitely strong!</li>
            <li>I love Tizo products, but this one leaves me looking ash-white</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>My skin looks much better now that I use this.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product regularly for about three weeks and have been most impressed.  </li>
            <li>The skin also looks more even.</li>
            <li>I also love that it is made in USA.</li>
            <li>It has a silky texture and goes on very smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li>Other than the tint, it feels great on my skin and works good even with sweating.</li>
            <li>I am naturally very fair, but this is ridiculously white.</li>
            <li>This product offers great protection.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s light and silky -</li>
            <li>I have VERY fair skin and seem to burn whenever I go outside, so I wanted to get a strong sunscreen for my face.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin so am always looking for a good sunblock that doesn&#x27;t cause break outs.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It goes on so silkily smooth and gives my skin a sort of photoshopped look.  </li>
            <li>It goes on so silky and feels so light....</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy putting this on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It glides on silky smooth, and dries to a matte finish...</li>
            <li>Left me looking kind of ghostly!</li>
            <li>Had to mix it with a higher viscosity sunblock to make it go on smooth and lighten it up.  </li>
            <li>NO FRAGRANCE!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not everyone will find this cream as cosmetically elegant as I do, and if you have very, very dry skin, I suggest you apply your moisturizer first -- make sure it absorbs -- before you apply this cream.</li>
            <li>As someone with mild rosacea, very sensitive skin, and a desire for high sun protection I am always looking for the next great find.  </li>
            <li>It feels very pure and protective.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to us much for full coverage.</li>
            <li>I got this sunscreen from my dr first</li>
            <li>However, when I finally got up the courage to put this on my skin, I fell in love.  </li>
            <li>I applied this sunblock to my face, arms, and hands before working in the garden all day in the hot Florida sun.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to active people who don&#x27;t like to wear make up although if you do wear make up I am guessing this would be good for that as well.</li>
            <li>But if you are pale and want to stay that way, and if you are looking for a product that offers great protection and feel, then you should give this a try.</li>
            <li>The ingredients of titanium and zinc are the ones that my doctor recommends for the best protection and it doesn&#x27;t seem as heavy as other products that have those ingredients.</li>
            <li>no matter how much I rub it in.</li>
            <li>As a primer, this sunscreen fills in tiny wrinkles and gives a smooth appearance to the skin.  </li>
            <li>It DRIES out your skin really really</li>
            <li>so I really advise anyone to take reviews with a grain of salt.</li>
            <li>I actually mixed it half and half in my palm with my foundation and it worked perfectly under makeup .  </li>
            <li>I am very glad I bought this, especially after the trouble I&#x27;ve had finding decent sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I use two tubes, one light and one natural - mix small amounts on my fingers - for the right shade of an easy-apply high quality sunscreen on my face.  </li>
            <li>I live in the Carreviean and work out in the ocean</li>
            <li>This is a natural sunscreen -- not chemical -- and Titanium Dixoide and Zinc are the main ingredients.</li>
            <li>The only drawbacks for me were that the sunblock contains aluminum, and you don&#x27;t get very much for the price.  </li>
            <li>I tried the tinted one at first and everything about it is the same except with my skin tone</li>
            <li>Amazing mineral sunscreen, no harsh ingredients, applies easily, no oily residue, sheer matte finish!</li>
            <li>Only takes a dot to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li>With my light skin tone, I need it everyday.</li>
            <li>It also lasts a long time and is really water resistant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very thick and leaves the skin distinctly whiter, but it&#x27;s worth it because of how well it protects your skin.</li>
            <li>The tinted facial sunscreen is much darker than a typical \\&quot;light\\&quot; tint.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It does have an odd, blueish-white cast that does not completely dissipate, but since I like a pale look I really don&#x27;t mind at all.  </li>
            <li> Not tinted as expected.</li>
            <li> I had expected this to be tinted - it is not.</li>
            <li> If you like a bit of bronze to your skin or simply do not care for the pale look, you might want to try TIZO 3, which has a flesh tint.  </li>
            <li> was WAY too dark and really dry.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a sunscreen for a long time that I could use everyday on my skin but would not cause breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the cream didn&#x27;t easily blend into my skin.  </li>
            <li> none of that heavy, greasy feeling you get with other sunblocks.  </li>
            <li> I have slightly oily/combination skin, and this provides a matte finish without clogging pores.  </li>
            <li> I have been wearing it everyday for about 3 weeks now</li>
            <li> Pale. 2.  </li>
            <li> If you use it alone, it does leave a very slight whitish-bluish tinge to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I had tried Proactiv sunscreen on my face, but it was too thick for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product because I have tried other Fallene sunblocks and disliked either the look or feel of the products.  </li>
            <li> Hey -- reviewing skincare is hard.</li>
            <li> it gave me a weird look.</li>
            <li> I admit that after I bought this product, I was still afraid to use it because I have acne prone skin and didn&#x27;t want to break out.  </li>
            <li> I hate having any make up on my face</li>
            <li> It works as a makeup base, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m three things that hate the sun.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love Tizo products, but this one leaves me looking ash-white no matter how much I rub it in.</li>
            <li> Not tinted as expected.</li>
            <li> This product offers great protection. The ingredients of titanium and zinc are the ones that my doctor recommends for the best protection and it doesn&#x27;t seem as heavy as other products that have those ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have VERY fair skin and seem to burn whenever I go outside, so I wanted to get a strong sunscreen for my face. This is definitely strong! It has a silky texture and goes on very smoothly and easily. It&#x27;s also very thick and leaves the skin distinctly whiter, but it&#x27;s worth it because of how well it protects your skin. It also lasts a long time and is really water resistant. I am very glad I bought this, especially after the trouble I&#x27;ve had finding decent sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is my second tube..I love this!  It applies smoothly with great coverage.  I even mix a bit in my foundation.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin so am always looking for a good sunblock that doesn&#x27;t cause break outs. This is perfect and it&#x27;s got a nice matte finish to take care of any shine. It feels like silk going on and you don&#x27;t even know you are wearing it. I hate having any make up on my face so it&#x27;s perfect. I tried the tinted one at first and everything about it is the same except with my skin tone it gave me a weird look. So I prefer the non-tinted one (Tizo2). I would highly recommend this product to active people who don&#x27;t like to wear make up although if you do wear make up I am guessing this would be good for that as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it goes on like excellent make up,modes nor smudge, stays on all day and it works.  I live in the Carreviean and work out in the ocean so I should be a great test model.</li>
            <li> It is a great product.  Feels good on my face and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  It arrived on time and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in only 2 days and is everything I expected with the exception of it not being tinted. Other than the tint, it feels great on my skin and works good even with sweating.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen was recommended by my dermatologist. I play a lot of tennis and need something sweat resistant.  It&#x27;s not greasy at all, which is great for the face.</li>
            <li> Amazing mineral sunscreen, no harsh ingredients, applies easily, no oily residue, sheer matte finish! I love it</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I have slightly oily/combination skin, and this provides a matte finish without clogging pores.  It feels very pure and protective.  My skin looks much better now that I use this.  It works as a makeup base, too.</li>
            <li> Only sunscreen that works for my face</li>
            <li> It works well on very fair skin that burns easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m three things that hate the sun. 1. Pale. 2.  Ginger. 3.  A makeup artist. I got this sunscreen from my dr first and now I won&#x27;t use anything else. It stays out. Never runs in to your eyes. I often wear just this with some mascara because of the matte finish it leaves. It works great as a makeup primer as well. Has the consistency of smashbox primer. Only takes a dot to cover your whole face. And NEVER has made me break out ever.</li>
            <li> Would be 5 stars if they actually stocked and shipped the water resistant version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have tried to buy this twice (myself and wife each) and have received versions that say &amp;#34;rinse with water to remove&amp;#34; on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product sold is NOT WATER RESISTANT, despite the description. Otherwise, it&#x27;s great sunscreen</li>
            <li> I have been using this product regularly for about three weeks and have been most impressed.  As someone with mild rosacea, very sensitive skin, and a desire for high sun protection I am always looking for the next great find.  I was skeptical about this product because I have tried other Fallene sunblocks and disliked either the look or feel of the products.  But this?  Fantastic.  It goes on so silkily smooth and gives my skin a sort of photoshopped look.  It does have an odd, blueish-white cast that does not completely dissipate, but since I like a pale look I really don&#x27;t mind at all.  If you like a bit of bronze to your skin or simply do not care for the pale look, you might want to try TIZO 3, which has a flesh tint.  But if you are pale and want to stay that way, and if you are looking for a product that offers great protection and feel, then you should give this a try.</li>
            <li> I use two tubes, one light and one natural - mix small amounts on my fingers - for the right shade of an easy-apply high quality sunscreen on my face.  You don&#x27;t have to us much for full coverage.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen. The cream is silky and not at all greasy.It also doubles as a foundation primer! If you have olive skin, go with the &amp;#34;tinted&amp;#34; version. This version does look slightly white when it is applied. This is not a problem for me because I always use foundation over it. As a primer, this sunscreen fills in tiny wrinkles and gives a smooth appearance to the skin.  In fact, this reminds me to order more today!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a sunscreen for a long time that I could use everyday on my skin but would not cause breakouts.  I admit that after I bought this product, I was still afraid to use it because I have acne prone skin and didn&#x27;t want to break out.  However, when I finally got up the courage to put this on my skin, I fell in love.  It goes on so silky and feels so light.... I actually enjoy putting this on my skin.  I have been wearing it everyday for about 3 weeks now and I have no breakouts.  I love that it&#x27;s light and silky - I had tried Proactiv sunscreen on my face, but it was too thick for everyday use.  I hope they never stop making this.  I love it!</li>
            <li> 1. I had expected this to be tinted - it is not. I am naturally very fair, but this is ridiculously white. Someone jokingly asked me if I arose from the dead.&lt;br /&gt;2. It DRIES out your skin really really bad.&lt;br /&gt;3. It has alumina, which may be linked to Alzheimer&#x27;s (may be).</li>
            <li> I have been using TIZO2 for almost 1 year and has worked well in protecting my skin from the tropical sun.</li>
            <li> I am using TIZO since years. With my light skin tone, I need it everyday. It is the perfect formula, because it is light and does not lay like a mask on your face. The skin also looks more even. I also love that it is made in USA. I would recommend TIZO (and have) to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Hey -- reviewing skincare is hard. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so I really advise anyone to take reviews with a grain of salt. This is a natural sunscreen -- not chemical -- and Titanium Dixoide and Zinc are the main ingredients. The cream is very, very white, but it absorbs into my skin very quickly, gives it a flawless appearance, and provides excellent sun protection. Also NO NO NO FRAGRANCE!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not everyone will find this cream as cosmetically elegant as I do, and if you have very, very dry skin, I suggest you apply your moisturizer first -- make sure it absorbs -- before you apply this cream.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the cream didn&#x27;t easily blend into my skin.  Left me looking kind of ghostly!</li>
            <li> I applied this sunblock to my face, arms, and hands before working in the garden all day in the hot Florida sun.  This stuff protected me just like an umbrella.  I was very happy with the sun protection factor, as well as the fact that it&#x27;s very waterproof.  It glides on silky smooth, and dries to a matte finish...none of that heavy, greasy feeling you get with other sunblocks.  I actually mixed it half and half in my palm with my foundation and it worked perfectly under makeup .  If you use it alone, it does leave a very slight whitish-bluish tinge to the skin.  The only drawbacks for me were that the sunblock contains aluminum, and you don&#x27;t get very much for the price.  But as far as effectiveness, this stuff is great!  Works like a charm!</li>
            <li> The tinted facial sunscreen is much darker than a typical \\&quot;light\\&quot; tint.  I have what would be classified as Fitzpatrick II skin color and the color was WAY too dark and really dry.  Had to mix it with a higher viscosity sunblock to make it go on smooth and lighten it up.  Would rec. either no tint or another product.</li>
