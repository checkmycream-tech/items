    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>the best one on the market is benzaderm wash with aloe vera a product of derma topix.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>I heard Benzoyl was the best for acne.</li>
            <li>Anything by Jan Marini is great!  </li>
            <li>Jan Marini is the best line out there for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I will be happy to rep a product that truly works.</li>
            <li>It worked so great, I bought it for my cousin to try</li>
            <li>So happy I found Jan Marini products.</li>
            <li>Amazon makes it convenient to purchase, received in great condition, and the product is what we are looking for.</li>
            <li>Great product at a great price</li>
            <li>best at keeping my face acne free and great price!</li>
            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>and she loved it</li>
            <li>The Reviews for Jan Marini Benzoyl Peroxide seemed to be good and it had a stronger percentage of benzyol, so I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>Itwould do great for sure.</li>
            <li>im loving</li>
            <li>After I wash my face, I used Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel with aloe vera and rose pedals as a toner, I then pat my face with my finger tips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now about to turn 40, I have not one wrinkle (except for when I smile) and my skin is beautiful.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think it works better than, say, AcneFree or something like that.  </li>
            <li>But, when I attempted to by more, every store was sold out or did not carry this item unless it was purchased in an acne treatment pack, which I did not want.</li>
            <li>BP is also what most Dermatologists with put you on for acne.</li>
            <li>The 10% benzoyl peroxide is extremely strong, if I get it too close to my eyes they start to burn.</li>
            <li>this product needs a true spokes person they can surely contact me.</li>
            <li>The 5-step skin care kit works wonders on fine lines and puffy eyes!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I wish this product was available over the counter in my country.</li>
            <li>I have been using primarily her C&#x27;Esta products faithfully all these years.</li>
            <li>Okay, JM products absolutely rock!</li>
            <li>Before using this products breakouts would be six and seven bumps and they would be huge bumps and they would take a whole week or more to go away.</li>
            <li>And use a good facial wash,</li>
            <li>Be patient and give it a few weeks, and use a cetaphil facial mositurizer (make sure its a moisturiser for your face, and that its non-comedogenic and fragrance free) the best one to use is from cetaphil.</li>
            <li>surely glad I gave it the time to work as I can say that of the last month ive gone from every day acne to one bump or two the most.</li>
            <li>This stuff dries up acne quickly.  </li>
            <li>A place which is always very hot and humid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some degree of success with each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right now my face is</li>
            <li>and it came right on time as requested.</li>
            <li>Great product, used to purchase locally from an independent distributor</li>
            <li>, however you spell that, to wash my face first.</li>
            <li>first used this one (in combination with the Jan Marini Bioclear cream) about 7 years ago on the advice of my doctor.</li>
            <li>I feel blessed I got turned onto them by my first Skin Care Pro when I was just 21.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this!</li>
            <li>This combination will give you clean clear skin.</li>
            <li>acne free, not a single bump and</li>
            <li>This cream seems to work about the same as the AcneFree Benzoyl Peroxide...which is fine, but the AcneFree is cheaper.</li>
            <li>On the BP product, it is by far THE only one I&#x27;ve tried that not only works the best, but does NOT over dry my skin!</li>
            <li>you really are wondering if this product works, trust me it does.</li>
            <li>I had to purchases these products from amazon and thanks to amazon and these products my face is clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so much bought a bottle for one of her friends.</li>
            <li>Before I was introduced to Jan Marini, I hid my very acne prone skin, by never leaving home, or if I had to, I caked on the makeup.</li>
            <li>It really cleared my skin up for my wedding.</li>
            <li>I apply a dime sized amount on a cotton swab after washing my face with a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>I wll continue using it, since works better than other OTC.</li>
            <li>It is quite strong and it will dry out your skin if you don&#x27;t use moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I put this on every morning before my moisturizer, and it keeps my face pretty clear.</li>
            <li>I will say that I do get one or two bumps every now and then, but they only last for two to three days the most.</li>
            <li>It also was not available individually online, so I began to look for a good substitute.</li>
            <li>I got my hopes up too high.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a little bit more of a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; I guess, based on reviews....</li>
            <li>As a sufferer of mild to moderate adult acne, I&#x27;ve used many different BP products, including several well-known brand name formulations.</li>
            <li>Dries up any little blemish spots pretty quickly but doesn&#x27;t leave me flaky.</li>
            <li>However, after much experimentation I&#x27;ve returned to Jan Marini as I&#x27;ve found that the BP/Bioclear combination keeps my skin nearly 100% clear with consistent use -- something I can&#x27;t say of any other product or product combination</li>
            <li>Although I was very pleased with the results, I wasn&#x27;t convinced it was significantly different than other BP products and it was significantly more expensive.</li>
            <li>I have used countless acne products in the past, including very strong prescription creams.</li>
            <li>This combination has given me clear skin once again.</li>
            <li>This product did not give me clear skin</li>
            <li>I tried this lotion and my face cleared up in a week and has remained clear.</li>
            <li>I recommend all their products to my friends and family members who ask what I use to keep my face clear.</li>
            <li>I was fighting adult acne for a year trying everything, even ProActiv, and nothing was working.</li>
            <li>My face cleared up completely and now I just put it on the spots that I tend to have pimples.  </li>
            <li>It helps keep my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>It has cleared up my adult acne</li>
            <li>I am 47 years old</li>
            <li>I struggle with adult acne, so I decided to try a benzoyl peroxide lotion that I had seen at Walmart (Equate Repairing Lotion), and after about a week my acne was almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Also, from a budget perspective I&#x27;ve found that the bottle goes such a long way (easily lasts me several months) that the price per use is negligible.</li>
            <li>but this product does not dry my skin out and my skin remains clear with no breakouts.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that keeps my skin consistently clear.</li>
            <li>i would definitely recommend to anyone who has had problems getting rid of ALL their adult acne and keeping it there.</li>
            <li>but I still struggle with my adult acne just the same as always.  </li>
            <li>Let me first say that im a black man</li>
            <li>It truly has changed my acne problem from bad to good.  </li>

            <li> It truly has changed my acne problem from bad to good.  </li>
            <li> No smell, no color, LASTS SO LONG!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only cream that has been able to keep my bad acne under control.</li>
            <li> Also, every time I applied it to my face it would simply dry then roll/flake off.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and this product helps to dry it out.</li>
            <li> but of a brown complexion aged 27</li>
            <li> , I think due to the season change, and when that happens I just don&#x27;t put any Benzoyl Peroxide on for a day or two.</li>
            <li> However, if your acne does not respond to other treatments this strength is probably just what you need.</li>
            <li> Like, have you tried other acne products and tried to wear make up over them?</li>
            <li> i had high hopes but it failed to treat my cystic acne problem</li>
            <li> Im from a little island in the Caribbean called Barbados.</li>
            <li> After my face has dried, I apply Jan Marini Benzoyl Peroxide 10%, then moisturize with Olay&#x27;s beauty lotion.</li>
            <li> It would leave thick residue no matter if I used a little or a lot.</li>
            <li> The only other thing that can be done is to take antibiotics all the time, which I hated.</li>
            <li> During the week that I used it, my acne came back, just as bad as it was before.</li>
            <li> get my hands on including &amp;#34;proactive&amp;#34;, that only made my acne worst.</li>
            <li> And the consistency isn&#x27;t too difficult to deal with, if you wear makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every product I cold</li>
            <li> I have bad acne which comes up from under my skin that sometimes turns into cystic acne and this helped a lot.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> best at keeping my face acne free and great price! i would definitely recommend to anyone who has had problems getting rid of ALL their adult acne and keeping it there.</li>
            <li> This product definitely works. It truly has changed my acne problem from bad to good.  Let me first say that im a black man but of a brown complexion aged 27 and have been having acne issues for over 10 years. I&#x27;ve tried almost every product I cold get my hands on including &amp;#34;proactive&amp;#34;, that only made my acne worst. Im from the Caribbean island of Barbados. A place which is always very hot and humid. I&#x27;ve been using this product combined with a facial wash and cetaphil facial moisturizer. This combination has given me clear skin once again. I will say that I do get one or two bumps every now and then, but they only last for two to three days the most. Before using this products breakouts would be six and seven bumps and they would be huge bumps and they would take a whole week or more to go away. This product did not give me clear skin immediately it took a couple of weeks to work but im surely glad I gave it the time to work as I can say that of the last month ive gone from every day acne to one bump or two the most. Right now my face is acne free, not a single bump and im loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really are wondering if this product works, trust me it does. Be patient and give it a few weeks, and use a cetaphil facial mositurizer (make sure its a moisturiser for your face, and that its non-comedogenic and fragrance free) the best one to use is from cetaphil. And use a good facial wash, the best one on the market is benzaderm wash with aloe vera a product of derma topix. This combination will give you clean clear skin. I am no spokes person for any of these products but I can tell you they work. Im from a little island in the Caribbean called Barbados. I had to purchases these products from amazon and thanks to amazon and these products my face is clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this product needs a true spokes person they can surely contact me. I will be happy to rep a product that truly works. I wish this product was available over the counter in my country. Itwould do great for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had tiny white heads around my nose and chin. My chin breaks out constantly, even though this is drying, it got rid of the problems!</li>
            <li> i had high hopes but it failed to treat my cystic acne problem</li>
            <li> This lotion works wonders. I was fighting adult acne for a year trying everything, even ProActiv, and nothing was working. I tried this lotion and my face cleared up in a week and has remained clear. It worked so great, I bought it for my cousin to try and she loved it so much bought a bottle for one of her friends.</li>
            <li> Before I was introduced to Jan Marini, I hid my very acne prone skin, by never leaving home, or if I had to, I caked on the makeup. This stuff has cleared up my skin!!! I use Jan Marini Glycolic, however you spell that, to wash my face first. After I wash my face, I used Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel with aloe vera and rose pedals as a toner, I then pat my face with my finger tips. After my face has dried, I apply Jan Marini Benzoyl Peroxide 10%, then moisturize with Olay&#x27;s beauty lotion. I&#x27;ve never gotten compliments on my skin, but now I do. So happy I found Jan Marini products. I recommend all their products to my friends and family members who ask what I use to keep my face clear. AMAZING!</li>
            <li> As a sufferer of mild to moderate adult acne, I&#x27;ve used many different BP products, including several well-known brand name formulations. I&#x27;ve had some degree of success with each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used this one (in combination with the Jan Marini Bioclear cream) about 7 years ago on the advice of my doctor. It really cleared my skin up for my wedding. Although I was very pleased with the results, I wasn&#x27;t convinced it was significantly different than other BP products and it was significantly more expensive.

            <li> I wash my face with Glycolix Elite Gly-Sal 10 Percent-2 Percent Acne Medicated Cleanser and put this Benzoyl Peroxide on afterwards morning and night.  My face cleared up completely and now I just put it on the spots that I tend to have pimples.  I get the occasional dryness, I think due to the season change, and when that happens I just don&#x27;t put any Benzoyl Peroxide on for a day or two. Works well for me!</li>
            <li> Dries up any little blemish spots pretty quickly but doesn&#x27;t leave me flaky. No smell, no color, LASTS SO LONG!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that keeps my skin consistently clear. I have used countless acne products in the past, including very strong prescription creams. I have extremely oily skin and this product helps to dry it out. The 10% benzoyl peroxide is extremely strong, if I get it too close to my eyes they start to burn. However, if your acne does not respond to other treatments this strength is probably just what you need. I apply a dime sized amount on a cotton swab after washing my face with a gentle cleanser. It does tend to bleach clothing, towels, and hair so it is essential to wash your hands thoroughly after applying.</li>
            <li> I like this cream. It&#x27;s the only cream that has been able to keep my bad acne under control. I have bad acne which comes up from under my skin that sometimes turns into cystic acne and this helped a lot. It is quite strong and it will dry out your skin if you don&#x27;t use moisturizer. I recommend using it once a day. My routine is to wash my face twice a day, moisturizing after every wash, and using the 10% only at the end of the day before bed. After I use the 10% in the evening, I moisturize with lotion added with drops of jojoba oil. It helps keep my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I put this on every morning before my moisturizer, and it keeps my face pretty clear.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin oily.  Guess i am going back to Skin Medica.  Won&#x27;t buy any of this brand anymore.</li>
            <li> I got my hopes up too high. I heard Benzoyl was the best for acne. I have been using it for a month now. It has cleared up my adult acne abt 50%. I wll continue using it, since works better than other OTC.</li>
            <li> Anything by Jan Marini is great!  I have used all of her products for two years now.  The 5-step skin care kit works wonders on fine lines and puffy eyes!&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to use her products and now my daughters do.</li>
            <li> Great product, used to purchase locally from an independent distributor but it was more expensive.  Amazon makes it convenient to purchase, received in great condition, and the product is what we are looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about three weeks now, and while it works okay, I don&#x27;t think it works better than, say, AcneFree or something like that.  I was expecting a little bit more of a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; I guess, based on reviews....but I still struggle with my adult acne just the same as always.  This cream seems to work about the same as the AcneFree Benzoyl Peroxide...which is fine, but the AcneFree is cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price and it came right on time as requested. I used it twice a day to help with breakouts. I am 47 years old and I still have to use acne medicine daily but this product does not dry my skin out and my skin remains clear with no breakouts. I&#x27;ve been using this product for four years and I recommend it to all my friends and family. Jan Marini is the best line out there for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff dries up acne quickly.  It does cause some dryness and flaking, but it seems to help the zit heal faster.</li>
            <li> I struggle with adult acne, so I decided to try a benzoyl peroxide lotion that I had seen at Walmart (Equate Repairing Lotion), and after about a week my acne was almost completely gone. But, when I attempted to by more, every store was sold out or did not carry this item unless it was purchased in an acne treatment pack, which I did not want. It also was not available individually online, so I began to look for a good substitute. The Reviews for Jan Marini Benzoyl Peroxide seemed to be good and it had a stronger percentage of benzyol, so I decided to try it. I gave up on using it after only a week. During the week that I used it, my acne came back, just as bad as it was before. It did not work at all. Also, every time I applied it to my face it would simply dry then roll/flake off. It would leave thick residue no matter if I used a little or a lot. It simply did not work. So, now I have purchased Proactive&#x27;s benzoyl lotion (individually, online), since Walmart&#x27;s Equate benzoyl lotion was just a generic version of Proactive anyways.</li>
            <li> Okay, JM products absolutely rock! I feel blessed I got turned onto them by my first Skin Care Pro when I was just 21. I have been using primarily her C&#x27;Esta products faithfully all these years. I&#x27;m now about to turn 40, I have not one wrinkle (except for when I smile) and my skin is beautiful. On the BP product, it is by far THE only one I&#x27;ve tried that not only works the best, but does NOT over dry my skin! And the consistency isn&#x27;t too difficult to deal with, if you wear makeup. Like, have you tried other acne products and tried to wear make up over them? What a joke, huh? Anyways, I&#x27;ve battled acne proned skin all my life and so I should know my products. BP is also what most Dermatologists with put you on for acne. The only other thing that can be done is to take antibiotics all the time, which I hated. Or birth control pills help some people. I absolutely recommend this!</li>
