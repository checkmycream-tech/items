            <li>when i got it i was absolutely thrilled with the makeup brush belt.</li>
            <li>This is one item I feel every makeup artist should own.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re ok with this kind of material, this belt might just work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly, 2 weeks before ETA!  </li>
            <li>whether it is TV or exterior, it is very important for you to have one of this.</li>
            <li>If you have more than one job a week you may want something more sturdy...</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my grand niece since she had just started working as a make-up artist.</li>
            <li>Love this belt, it&#x27;s still holding on strong.</li>
            <li>Very cool and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I would get a leather one for prolonged use but this product worked fine for me.</li>
            <li>As a starting free lance makeup artist, this is a great belt.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean as well, I use alcohol and cotton pads and wipe it clean ever time I use it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>I also liked that it doesn&#x27;t come branded with one specific name on it</li>
            <li>Keeps my brushes organizatized and right where I need them to grab and move on.</li>
            <li>It shipped right away</li>
            <li>But if fits 95% of what I need it to, so I can&#x27;t complain too much!</li>
            <li>Looks great, good price and quick shipping but the SMELL is horrible!</li>
            <li>This is  a very high quality well made product.</li>
            <li>This belt is going to get a work out since I work in the salon industry, but so far it has held up through consistent use after 4 months!</li>
            <li>the buckle is very cheep and wont stand up to the life of a busy artist.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I still use it on clients because it is such a time saver to have everything right there.</li>
            <li>i had to get a new one...</li>
            <li>i am a busy makeup artist!</li>
            <li>I would give it a higher score because it does hold my brushes well , but the buckle is essential</li>
            <li>(hey, it&#x27;s only $20, so you can&#x27;t expect much).  </li>
            <li>the belt is ok, like every other belt you will have to stuff it with cotton but other than that the belt is ok.&lt;br /&gt;my reason for giving it a 3/5 is</li>
            <li>I use standard sized professional brushes, Bobbi Brown, MAC, BD etc.</li>
            <li>The only complaint that I have is that the top brush areas are so deep that I can not use them or my brushes would fall down into them.</li>

            <li> :/ if anyone has suggestions please post!</li>
            <li> It looks to be made of some sort of synthetic material, attempting to be pleather (yes, pleather) but failed to do so.  </li>

            <li> I just received this item and it looks a lot more expensive than it actually costs!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how it will hold up being i am a busy makeup artist! We shall see.</li>
            <li> This is  a very high quality well made product. when i got it i was absolutely thrilled with the makeup brush belt.

It looks to be made of some sort of synthetic material, attempting to be pleather (yes, pleather) but failed to do so.  Lots of pockets, so if you&#x27;re ok with this kind of material, this belt might just work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this from The Brush Company, and their service is wonderful.  Arrived very quickly, 2 weeks before ETA!  I contacted them for a refund because the belt is too big on me (I&#x27;m rather petite, so this belt looks ridiculously ginormous on me, and pretty darn heavy with my brushes) and they responded immediately!  But I&#x27;m thinking I might just keep this because I&#x27;m so lazy to return this.</li>

            <li> I CANT GO TO WORK WITH IT!!</li>
            <li> Looks great, good price and quick shipping but the SMELL is horrible! Left outside in hopes to air out for several days but the smell remains...feel like my brushes will absorb the odor so haven&#x27;t put them in :/ if anyone has suggestions please post!</li>
            <li> Love this belt, it&#x27;s still holding on strong. Will buy again</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Good quality and you cant beat the price. I also liked that it doesn&#x27;t come branded with one specific name on it like &amp;#34;nyx&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;mac&amp;#34;. Just plain black&lt;br /&gt;Fits all my brushes! I def. recommend</li>
            <li> As a starting free lance makeup artist, this is a great belt. I would get a leather one for prolonged use but this product worked fine for me. If you have more than one job a week you may want something more sturdy... otherwise this is great.</li>
            <li> It is very handy for those working in the fashion industry. whether it is TV or exterior, it is very important for you to have one of this. Long enough to any type of waist.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my grand niece since she had just started working as a make-up artist. She loves it.</li>
            <li> This has seen me through several stressful days where I was running back and forth from a studio to a set to get bridal images together. I still use it on clients because it is such a time saver to have everything right there. It is easy to clean as well, I use alcohol and cotton pads and wipe it clean ever time I use it. The only complaint that I have is that the top brush areas are so deep that I can not use them or my brushes would fall down into them. I use standard sized professional brushes, Bobbi Brown, MAC, BD etc.</li>
