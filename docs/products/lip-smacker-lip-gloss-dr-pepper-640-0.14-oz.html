            <li>Wonderful</li>
            <li>Not the best chapstick, but it will work.</li>
            <li>Now, let me say that I am in LOVE with this stuff!!!</li>
            <li>Tastes great and gives just a hint of color.</li>
            <li>I order 10 at a time on Amazon, and at a great price.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise everything is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a win win.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased that the product came to me promptly and that my friend loved it!  </li>
            <li>Dr. Pepper is my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite soda flavor, so this works out perfectly.</li>
            <li>Good flavor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more a chapstick person, then purses or shoes, so if a chapstick can give me a happy boost, I will stick with this.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t even tell you how many years I&#x27;ve been using this lip gloss!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it on Amazon as I think just about every brick and mortar shop has given it</li>
            <li>it was more than id have liked to pay, but i guess value is determined by demand and i DEMAND</li>
            <li>Moisturizes my lips while making them look and ;) taste great.</li>
            <li>I am no longer able to buy in stores</li>
            <li>And sooooo cheap!</li>
            <li>so glad i found it here.</li>
            <li>*love</li>
            <li>This is my all-time favorite of Bonne bell.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get away with most lipstick, and frankly I don&#x27;t like lipstick anyways,</li>
            <li>Taste, texture is nice and smooth, tint of color, hint of shine, no chapped lips.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>I used to use this when I was young...not quite the same delicious Dr Pepper that I remember.</li>
            <li>we love this  product</li>
            <li>There were tons of flavors, but the Dr. Pepper was always the best, This is an amusing, frivolous item, but it provides lip protection for a few hours.</li>
            <li>It also gives a light reddish tint, and like most lipsmackers is quite moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>On top of that it lasts and effectively keeps lips moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the fragrance and the taste, and appreciate the balm that soothes chapped lips.</li>
            <li>Great stocking stuffers, fun little add-on to gifts, just because, and of course, to keep stashed in your own purse, desk, car, or nightstand.</li>
            <li>great formula - same flavor and just the right hint of color.</li>
            <li>She used it right away!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t bother with lipstick at all anymore, as this gives me a light tint/color to my lips, and just the right amount of moisture and gloss.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, but wanted to post a quick review.</li>
            <li>its so hard to find the good stuff that works on your lips ,tastes like your favorite drink.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no fan of Dr. Pepper as a soda, but as a lipbalm this is really fun.  </li>
            <li>hope that Bonnie Bell once again changes its formula, back to something more like when it used to taste better and not act as an allergen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still that nice shade of pink, though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this, and love lipsmackers because they bring me back to my junior high days.</li>
            <li>It glides on my lips with just the right consistency for my preferences.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Smells like the real thing, it tastes like Dr. Pepper, but just a hint of sweetness.</li>
            <li>My lips are left feeling smooth and conditoned.</li>
            <li>but i can say it arrived very promptly which i appreciated</li>
            <li>This also was a gift to my grandaughter, which she really loves.</li>
            <li>Awesome scent and doesn&#x27;t taste nasty like most chapstick does.</li>
            <li>but next time I will make sure it is the really big one.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of high school in the 70s.</li>
            <li>What I also love about this, it gives a little tint of</li>
            <li>Very natural looking.</li>
            <li>and she says it makes her lips very soft.</li>
            <li>Really soft!</li>
            <li>flavor not ideal, but good</li>
            <li>so for chapstick I have almost always gone with clear, no tint.</li>
            <li>This is not the old Dr. Pepper lip gloss I have used for 40 years.</li>
            <li>i been using this since i was a child until i was an adult like 21</li>
            <li>but I thought this particular lip gloss that I purchased was the really big size.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it not only gives a little hint of raspberry color, but a tiny bit of shine.</li>
            <li>This was, for years, my favorite and only cosmetic, with its light, natural pink tint, and it doesn&#x27;t taste and feel nasty like most lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells like Dr. Pepper, has a little bit of a sweet taste to it, and brings back impressions and memories of the 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Please go back to old way of making Dr. Pepper lip gloss.</li>
            <li>It has a different consistently, different smell, and different color than the old Dr. Pepper lip gloss.</li>
            <li>I will keep anyway because I love it (small or big) - not worth sending it back</li>

            <li> it is my absolute favorite and i was desperate!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, over the last few months, I began to observe that I had an allergic reaction after I used the new tubes I purchased: my lips began to sting, blister, swell, and peel.</li>
            <li> This one is the same as the other flavors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this stuff for as long as I can remember!</li>
            <li> No wonder this stuff has been around for so long!</li>
            <li> I isolated the source of this allergic reaction by eliminating, on a weekly basis, each of the few skin care products I use, and found this reaction occurs only if and when I used my Dr Pepper</li>
            <li> At less than $2/pop, what is there to lose?</li>
            <li> I would have given this a 5/5, but I was missing a cap on the one.</li>
            <li> She puts it on her lips every few minutes</li>
            <li> This chapstick, with just a tiny bit of eyeliner is very subtle.</li>
            <li> It was the small one which I can get for $2 at the store</li>
            <li> Let me also just say that I am a fanatic for quality lip balms.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bonnie Bell Dr. Pepper lip smacker for at least 40 years.  </li>
            <li> Not too thick, not too thin, and it lasts!!!</li>
            <li> Too bad Bonnie Bell.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> so I was disappointed (because I paid 3x that amount).  </li>
            <li> Wish I could find locally as it&#x27;s very expensive here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that they changed it.</li>
            <li> I am so sad that Bonne Bell has gone out of manufacturing this product!!!</li>

            <li> This is not the old Dr. Pepper lip gloss I have used for 40 years. This one is the same as the other flavors. I was very disappointed that they changed it. It has a different consistently, different smell, and different color than the old Dr. Pepper lip gloss. I am no longer able to buy in stores so I bought a bunch and they are all the same. Too bad Bonnie Bell. Please go back to old way of making Dr. Pepper lip gloss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this stuff for as long as I can remember! Tastes yummy, moisturizing, and adds a sheer, reddish color. And sooooo cheap! No wonder this stuff has been around for so long! Great stocking stuffers, fun little add-on to gifts, just because, and of course, to keep stashed in your own purse, desk, car, or nightstand. At less than $2/pop, what is there to lose? Try it!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I am so sad that Bonne Bell has gone out of manufacturing this product!!! I&#x27;ve been using it since I was a teenager. It&#x27;s the only gloss that gives you long lasting moisture and a hint of color for me!</li>
            <li> Tastes great and gives just a hint of color. Very natural looking. I always keep one in my bag, one in my desk, one in the car... Moisturizes my lips while making them look and ;) taste great.</li>
            <li> lips taste like DP. cant get enuf.</li>

            <li> i couldnt find this in ANY store! it is my absolute favorite and i was desperate! so glad i found it here. it was more than id have liked to pay, but i guess value is determined by demand and i DEMAND i have bonnie bell dr. pepper lip gloss! ; }</li>
            <li> i been using this since i was a child until i was an adult like 21 but here in cali. its so hard to find the good stuff that works on your lips ,tastes like your favorite drink.</li>
            <li> Product seemed like it might be old/turned.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> Wonderful I used this since HSchool. Grateful to find it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Pepper Lip Smacker Lip Gloss by Bonne Bell for 40 years now...can&#x27;t believe it!  I don&#x27;t bother with lipstick at all anymore, as this gives me a light tint/color to my lips, and just the right amount of moisture and gloss.  I don&#x27;t know what I would do if they ever stopped making it!  I order 10 at a time on Amazon, and at a great price.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no fan of Dr. Pepper as a soda, but as a lipbalm this is really fun.  It also gives a light reddish tint, and like most lipsmackers is quite moisturizing.  I&#x27;m pleased with this, and love lipsmackers because they bring me back to my junior high days.</li>
            <li> OMG! Let me just say that I *love* Dr. Pepper. Let me also just say that I am a fanatic for quality lip balms. Now, let me say that I am in LOVE with this stuff!!! Smells like the real thing, it tastes like Dr. Pepper, but just a hint of sweetness. It glides on my lips with just the right consistency for my preferences. Not too thick, not too thin, and it lasts!!! My lips are left feeling smooth and conditoned. I adore it!</li>
            <li> This was, for years, my favorite and only cosmetic, with its light, natural pink tint, and it doesn&#x27;t taste and feel nasty like most lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, over the last few months, I began to observe that I had an allergic reaction after I used the new tubes I purchased: my lips began to sting, blister, swell, and peel. I isolated the source of this allergic reaction by eliminating, on a weekly basis, each of the few skin care products I use, and found this reaction occurs only if and when I used my Dr Pepper chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that Bonnie Bell once again changes its formula, back to something more like when it used to taste better and not act as an allergen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still that nice shade of pink, though.</li>
            <li> Got this for my friend who loves Dr. Pepper and she loves it. She says it smells and tastes (not that she eats it) just like the soda and she says it makes her lips very soft.</li>
            <li> love this stuff! Really soft!</li>
            <li> Good flavor.  a touch cloying.  Not the best chapstick, but it will work.</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite of Bonne bell. Wish I could find locally as it&#x27;s very expensive here on Amazon! If you see if Buy it!</li>
            <li> I would have given this a 5/5, but I was missing a cap on the one. Otherwise everything is great.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased that the product came to me promptly and that my friend loved it!  She used it right away!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, but wanted to post a quick review. Awesome scent and doesn&#x27;t taste nasty like most chapstick does. What I also love about this, it gives a little tint of I&#x27;d describe as a raspberry tint of color. I can&#x27;t get away with most lipstick, and frankly I don&#x27;t like lipstick anyways, so for chapstick I have almost always gone with clear, no tint. This chapstick, with just a tiny bit of eyeliner is very subtle. Aside from this scent, I also love the bubblegum scent which is so difficult to find, so the bubblegum one I did order on Amazon. I also love that it not only gives a little hint of raspberry color, but a tiny bit of shine. It&#x27;s a win win. Taste, texture is nice and smooth, tint of color, hint of shine, no chapped lips. I cannot rave enough about these Bonne Bell chapsticks. I&#x27;m more a chapstick person, then purses or shoes, so if a chapstick can give me a happy boost, I will stick with this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lip gloss that tastes smells/tastes like Dr. Pepper. Dr. Pepper is my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite soda flavor, so this works out perfectly. That said...don&#x27;t eat it, no matter how tempting...</li>
            <li> flavor not ideal, but good</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend so i didn&#x27;t actually get to use it but i can say it arrived very promptly which i appreciated</li>
            <li> I have been using Bonnie Bell Dr. Pepper lip smacker for at least 40 years.  I absolutely love it but I thought this particular lip gloss that I purchased was the really big size.  It was the small one which I can get for $2 at the store so I was disappointed (because I paid 3x that amount).  I will keep anyway because I love it (small or big) - not worth sending it back but next time I will make sure it is the really big one.</li>
            <li> I used to use this when I was young...not quite the same delicious Dr Pepper that I remember.</li>
            <li> we love this  product</li>
            <li> This also was a gift to my grandaughter, which she really loves. She puts it on her lips every few minutes</li>
            <li> Reminds me of high school in the 70s. There were tons of flavors, but the Dr. Pepper was always the best, This is an amusing, frivolous item, but it provides lip protection for a few hours. Enjoy the fragrance and the taste, and appreciate the balm that soothes chapped lips. As they used to say in Highlights magazine, &amp;#34;fun with a purpose.&amp;#34;</li>
