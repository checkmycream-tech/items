            <li>It is such a luxurious treat, and it smells soooo good!!</li>
            <li>I love using this during the winter, wearing socks overnight after application to soften up my feet.  </li>

            <li>This product is okay.</li>
            <li>Calous Remover - I highly recommend!!!!!  </li>
            <li>instead I use hotel body lotion which while great, not natural or as good for my feet.</li>
            <li>This cream is so wonderful for my dry feet.  </li>
            <li>Best thing ever for dry cracked feet.</li>
            <li>She loved it so much that i had to buy her more tubes.</li>

            <li>Excellent for keeping feet and heels super smooth and soft</li>
            <li>Best treat for dry feet! )</li>
            <li>the other hand, the smell is wonderful - coconut and mint mostly.</li>
            <li>R.I.P Burt thank you for the high quality amazing products you have made!</li>
            <li>I had a high hope on this based on many good reviews.  </li>
            <li>But the most important thing to me is that it WORKS.  </li>
            <li>This had great reviews and it was all natural.</li>
            <li>I really do like Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and this foot creme received overwhelmingly good reviews.  </li>
            <li>Smells really good and very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I love how it absorbs easily and it leaves my feet feeling silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Smells delicious; dries super gross.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other foot creams and this is THE BEST.</li>
            <li>It eased the dryness but doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb very quickly and felt too greasy.  </li>
            <li>Your feet will smell so good and be lovely and soft after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The peppermint foot creme obviously smells great, but the coconut creme has a consistency which is thicker and more luxurious, hence why I use it to nourish my feet at night.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply with the foot creme of Coconut.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit sticky, smells rather strong and has worked well for me.</li>
            <li>also don&#x27;t like the overly strong synthetic fragrance.</li>
            <li>Strong scent, but not offensive.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy or doesn&#x27;t have any strong smell.</li>
            <li>hands down the best foot cream ever.  </li>
            <li>This is hand&#x27;s down the best cream I have used.</li>
            <li>Healthy Feet/Working Hands - It soaks into your skin really quickly.  </li>
            <li>My feet never smelled so good and soft!</li>
            <li>The heavenly scent will leave your feet smelling so good, and feeling so so so soft!</li>
            <li>Goes on very greasy, must put on a sock, but my feet are so lovely!</li>
            <li>Smells great, and makes my feet super soft.  </li>
            <li>Best way to soften dry heels; lightly massage Burt&#x27;s Bees Creme into your whole foot, put on a light pair of 100% cotton socks and go to bed!  </li>
            <li>My feet feel amazing and The smell is also very soothing.</li>
            <li>It was silky smooth going on</li>
            <li>So if you don&#x27;t like that, you won&#x27;t enjoy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t expect the cr&amp;egrave;me to be a silky smooth, experience.  </li>
            <li>The quality and genuine naturalness of this product line has gone south since the sale of the company.</li>
            <li>It keeps my feet smooth for almost a week.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for 3 years and it keeps heels smooth and crack free year round.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suppose if you don&#x27;t mind doing a spa day with this you might enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Without question, the product is far superior in every respect.</li>
            <li>Its also a natural product that I feel good about using on my skin.</li>
            <li>why.&lt;br /&gt;First most creams if they worked at all had to be applied 3 - 4 times a day to cause any good improvement, and if I missed a day the reversal of skin condition was not only felt it was visible.</li>
            <li>I like Burt&#x27;s Bees products because they are natural and was hoping for good results with this foot cream.</li>
            <li>and It works better if you put in some socks right after application.</li>
            <li>great!!!very very  nice!!!I like it!!!</li>
            <li>My daughter love it very much.</li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>After a bath, she puts on this cream, then puts the socks (that came in her original kit) on.  </li>
            <li>You apply it before going to bed and need to wear socks with it which at first isn&#x27;t something I wanted to do, but I got over that real quickly when I saw the results.  </li>
            <li>Never disappointed with this provider</li>
            <li>IN A COUPLE OF DAYS HAVE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT</li>
            <li>Just a friendly warning if you&#x27;re attached to your sheets and you apply liberally.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>winter coming,,I&#x27;m sure it will work out pretty well.</li>
            <li>First, the smell is not too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s great if yo have 30 minutes and the steam to rub your feet to dry and flaking.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Unbelievable-so great for healing dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li>Feels great on the feet, and even my elbows which tend to get really dry.  </li>
            <li>I cannot fathom trying to clean the greasy footprints that would result from not wearing socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t add anything to the many positive reviews shown.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am usually a positive reviewer, and I attempt to find redeeming qualities even of things I was not keen on.  </li>
            <li>rich, thick and wonderful</li>
            <li>My hands look amazing and feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>No one wants to hear about callused feet, so I&#x27;ll spare you the details, but I will say that my husband&#x27;s feet have gone from being like the cracks in the Grand Canyon to being like a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this foot creme.  </li>
            <li>The peppermint and coconut smells sweet and it almost tempts me to give it a lick.  </li>
            <li>My feet are nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>my full review of this product at: myreallifereviews  .  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be purchasing burts bees foot creme again, I found that straight coconut oil works much better.</li>
            <li>I worked on making my feet, especially my heals looking good for spring to no avail until I used this creme.  </li>
            <li>but that is the only good thing about it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find good products for feet, and this one is pretty good at the job it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>As a regular user I totally recommend this foot cream for its effectiveness and wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the color and consistency of honey when putting it on, but soaks in/disappears fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I did not find that it helped a whole bunch on softening my feet as much as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>Does the trick on keeping my feet smelling good even after a long shoe-ful day.</li>
            <li>The coconut smell is minty too, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>Firstly, it works!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>This product is super effective at softening the feet and especially heels.</li>
            <li>Little pricey in my opinion but the person I gave it to said it worked great on her feet.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and is very thick and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>If it gets the Mom stamp of approval then it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>İ am glad that İ could find her a cure that is also 99.6% natural.</li>
            <li>love that Burt&#x27;s Bees uses primarily natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I have been going much more natural these days so that is a necessity for me.  </li>
            <li>feet have become so much more soft.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that this is Burt&#x27;s Bees and that they use natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the ingredients are natural, too.  </li>
            <li>It has a texture that is like Vaseline or petroleum jelly; however, the cr&amp;egrave;me is absorbed into your foot so that you don&#x27;t walk around with greasy feet all day.</li>
            <li>Every time showered ,she wanna it for fun</li>
            <li>You put the stuff on at night, the grease gets absorbed</li>
            <li>After applying this product to a freshly washed and pumiced foot, I feel like there is immediate improvement in the skin softness.  </li>
            <li>, I really can&#x27;t say enough good about this.</li>
            <li>By the morning, my skin has absorbed it and when I take off the socks, my feet are softer and aren&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li>You only thought you liked foot massages.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>but I live in California where its hot most of the year and socks are just not going to cut it when I sleep.</li>
            <li>On one hand it does a good job moisturizing my feet but on the other hand, the texture of it is too greasy and gel like.  </li>
            <li>I have an issue with the skin on my right foot.  </li>
            <li>So I put this cream on my right foot, not even right out of the shower or anything, and went to bed without socks.  </li>
            <li>and it comes right off.  </li>
            <li>It soaks right into my skin.  </li>
            <li>I use it in the morning after my shower, and apply it again at nighttime right before bed.</li>
            <li>I put it on right before bed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly certain the socks absorbed far more product than my feet did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal Burt&#x27;s Bees consumer for several years, and this is bar none my favorite BB product.  </li>
            <li>Very moist, absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>Most lotions just don&#x27;t seem to provide enough moisture to really make a difference but this stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Eventually, after about 6 weeks of my soaking, tea tree oil and Burt&#x27;s Coconut Foot Crème regime ---- for the first time in years and years ALL of my foot surface, toes, heels, ankles were as soft and smooth as my 2 year old grand daughters feet.</li>
            <li>its amazing for dry feet.</li>
            <li>However, the scent is really nice, at least to me, as it&#x27;s an interesting combination of mint and coconut.</li>
            <li>Her feet get chapped easily and Burt&#x27;s bees helps her keep them soft.</li>
            <li>This foot cream smells great and relaxes my feet after a hard day at work.  </li>
            <li>Calling this product a &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; is pretty misleading.</li>
            <li>That really hurts!  </li>
            <li>After the first couple of nights I got used to it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smith and Nephew Moisturizing Cream - I first tried this lotion when in the hospital after a surgery.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Next morning my heels looked so much better wasn&#x27;t all cracky</li>
            <li>Kinda sticky at first, I put on socks after applying.</li>
            <li>This is more like a rather fluid ointment then a creme.</li>
            <li>My feet (I used the pumice stone first)</li>
            <li>The only downside is that is oily, so be sure to use it with socks.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind this as it feels like it penetrates more deeply.  </li>
            <li>If your feet are as soft and smooth as the day you were born, then this may not be for you.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it would feel gooshy and slippery</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product, and I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>It contains vegetable glycerin, olive oil, oat protein, lanolin, water, coconut oil (the real stuff!), tocopheral (vitamin E), peppermint oil, rosemary extract, and fragrance.</li>
            <li>the foot balm is amazing,my father likes it sooo much!</li>
            <li>There are no weird fragrances or ingredients.</li>
            <li>Smooth soft feet.</li>
            <li>For 15 years I have tried so many different foot cremes -</li>
            <li>I agree with others in that its consistency is similar to a slightly more viscous Vaseline.</li>
            <li>I love anything coconut, especially when it really works!  </li>
            <li>I wish I used this more regularly… when I put this on at night with socks, my feet are noticeably softer the next day.</li>
            <li>But I saw Improvements of my feet just after the first night.</li>
            <li>After consistent use my feet have been made heavenly.</li>
            <li>However, it did leave my feet soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this morning, and already my feet are softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The only thing i have found that does the magic.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;s great but a bit thick.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely NOT a creme, it is better described as an ointment.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely very oily, so you want to have your socks right at hand to put on as soon as you finish rubbing it</li>
            <li>(and I did have to put it on right before bed and stick my feet under the covers, so I can&#x27;t really fault his assessment).</li>
            <li>That said, the texture, which is kind of like first aid ointment, is not a pleasure to rub in, like a body butter or other lotion would be.</li>
            <li>(I suspect it&#x27;s absorbed into my socks, not my feet) and what&#x27;s left is a fine powder.</li>
            <li>I massage this into my clean feet and then put on soft cotton</li>
            <li>This is great, my feet are silky soft after just a few days of use.  </li>
            <li>First of all, the scent is coconutt-y and peppermint-y, very luscious.</li>
            <li>I have tried various products to soften up my feet but this one is the only one that worked incredibly well, and after only two nights!</li>
            <li>and I was able to use it for a long time on each foot for my girlfriend.  </li>
            <li>I looked at the ingredients and thought it would be more moisturizing seemed to dry out my heels.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worked better than lotion to relieve dry areas.</li>
            <li>It corrected the problem so quickly and completely</li>
            <li>quickly restoring soft, supple skin in those area as well.</li>
            <li>This keeps my feet nice and pretty throughout the harsh winter months.</li>
            <li>It does have a rather loud but not unpleasant smell which goes</li>
            <li>It is super thick and kind of like Vaseline, but thicker than that.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Works its magic really well on dry elbows and knees  </li>
            <li>THis is the only thing that adequately hydrates my skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little bit too greasy for me but the smell is really nice.</li>
            <li>The product says its a cream but should really be labeled as a balm.</li>
            <li>and you really do need to wear the socks.  </li>
            <li>it on your feet, but just didn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>It is not so much a creme as a salve, as another reviewer mentioned.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this really improved the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is sticky, but it really works.</li>
            <li>of it&#x27;s oiliness, I wouldn&#x27;t put this on so much for summer time when I am wearing sandals,</li>
            <li>I put socks on after rubbing some into my feet (either during the day or overnight), and it really helps keep my heels from cracking.</li>
            <li>my feet feel so much softer.</li>
            <li>Really stays on the foot, just massage into foot then put on socks and go.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li>tried Eucerin foot cream for a couple of days in between, and boy, that really works on my feet.</li>
            <li>I use it nightly after my shower and my feet are always ready for sandals or heels.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Had two broken bones in ankle so after months of the cast, the leg and foot were not in great condition.</li>
            <li>This product worked but was really &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I used Vaseline for my feet, I really needed some moistore.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a real treat to use this foot</li>
            <li>VERY WELL, TO USE AT NIGHT UNDER SOCKS TO SLEEP</li>
            <li>The next morning, your hands slide smoothly over your feet and you think they&#x27;re softer, but I think they&#x27;re just sliding over powder residue.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like this foot cream</li>
            <li>But the stuff works really well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not really a cream, it&#x27;s more like a salve.  </li>
            <li>At the very beginning, I though it is too creamy.  </li>
            <li>Of course this will depend on how much you use.</li>
            <li>product is very greasy and sticky.  </li>
            <li>This was what i was looking for and it works really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very \\&quot;creamy\\&quot;, more like a salve in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THEN, it does work and very well.</li>
            <li>This one lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good as a moisturizer, although not amazing in my experience.</li>
            <li>Also, the stuff is so thick and greasy that it forces you to massage your feet for a while, and pampering feels really good.</li>
            <li>Unlike a lot of lotions and creams, this really does make a significant improvement in the look of your feet, and in a relatively short period of time too.</li>
            <li>It was just a miracle that her foot improved significantly in a day after starting to use this cream.</li>
            <li>other reviewers have mentioned, the texture is more like an ointment than a cream.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for tired feet!!</li>
            <li>My feet have always been dry, and they crack easily.</li>
            <li>I am a Sandals 75% of the year, Loves being bare foot, Military wife always changing climates, who walks miles a day or is always up and running around either way kind of girl.</li>
            <li>But is not powerful as to where you can not use it if you have a headache or potent smell sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I try to do the full routine--bath, foot file, then the foot creme--but even when I can only put the creme on under a pair of socks, it does noticeably soften my feet a bit.  </li>
            <li>I decided that coconut would be a rather innocuous smell, as I am generally pretty scent sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Putting socks on first fixed that problem.  </li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend bare feet right after applying, as it&#x27;s slippery.  </li>
            <li>but I am sure I could use less.</li>
            <li>Dry feet lightly and apply.</li>
            <li>Thought it was better than it is, had a tiny sample, this does not seem the same.</li>
            <li>The only suggestion I would have is to put it on just as you are turning in for the night - if you are anything like me, the last thing you need is to get coconut creamy footprints all over the floor. :)</li>
            <li>It works fast and leave my feet very soft.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing, and makes my feet really soft &amp; supple!  </li>
            <li>I always have this handy all year long, because my hands and foot are always dry and cracks.  </li>
            <li>Friends had recommended it to me and I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little greasy, but I love it</li>
            <li>The best way I have found to use it is after a serious removal of dead skin around my heels, etc.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing thick lotion - a dense cream.  </li>
            <li>I personally wouldn&#x27;t get it again, as I am not crazy about the texture of it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The consistency is thicker than Vaseline being thicker and similar to a golden honey color and thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves a strange greasy feeling, not a fan of this product, but love the Burts Bees line overall,  Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>Thick, gooey, and effective.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, it does great things for my poor tired feet, makes them softer and revives them.</li>
            <li>and my feet have become so much more dry especially in the winter months.  </li>
            <li>And I love it for my hands, especially around the dry cuticles and feet too.</li>
            <li>Much better than different ways as soak in water for hours or chip off dry skin.</li>
            <li>I only deducted one star for the actual feeling and strong scent of the creme.</li>
            <li>She cringes when I sit next to her after applying it to my feet as she can smell it right away.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised by the consistency when I squeezed the first bit out of the tube, but as soon as it hit my first dry heel, I was sold.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t help that I live in Minnesota.  </li>
            <li>I cannot live without this.</li>
            <li>This is going to be a new part of my evening foot regimen.</li>
            <li>Only requires a few nights of use to be effective.  </li>
            <li>She is only 1+years old ,it&#x27;s worth .</li>
            <li>Have the effect very much A week later after use The heel of the crack is resolved</li>
            <li>And to be able to touch my hubbies feet with my bare feet without fear of what he thought.&lt;br /&gt;I find this cream to be greasy, and after I use it I put my feet up and don&#x27;t walk at all until all the crème is soaked in, about an hour to and hour and a half.</li>
            <li>If it had a different feel it would give it a higher rating.</li>
            <li>I put a small amount on each foot in the morning after I shower, making sure to massage it underneath and between each toe</li>
            <li>This is the only one that consistently works.</li>
            <li>With consistent use and proper foot care this product does work and shows results after 1.5 to 2 months</li>
            <li>This product makes my feet really soft!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for the past couple of years and I love how my feet look like now.</li>
            <li>As a previous loyal Burt&#x27;s Bees customer, I&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li>I live near the beach and spend hours walking by the shore barefoot.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really help my dry heels too much, but</li>
            <li>thought the grit was to slough off dead skin, but it&#x27;s too fine.</li>
            <li>I usually take the socks off sometime in the middle of the night because my feet get hot, and by that time they are fine.</li>
            <li>My feet are not a pretty sight unless dry and rough look good to you.</li>
            <li>, so I try to stay clear of that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s brownish clear with flecks.</li>
            <li>Makes her feet so soft.  </li>
            <li>my feet are so soft now.</li>
            <li>,They was so soft.</li>
            <li>But, since my aim is to have soft feet, I will continue to use it because it works so well.</li>
            <li>My feet feel soft and young after each time I use this.  </li>
            <li>Both me and my sister use it and our feet are as soft as can be.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind, but was surprised.  </li>
            <li>When you order, you receive a 4.3 ounce tube of 99.4% natural foot cream.</li>
            <li>It refreshes your skin with naturally derived rosemary extracts.</li>
            <li>Unexpectedly.</li>
            <li>I slather it on, yes slather, and then put soft socks on before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li>I tried this at my daughters house and like the way it kept my heels soft.</li>
            <li>works well and restores the moisture and keeps my feet soft.</li>
            <li>My feet stay refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li>But my feet are far from my nose, so I gave it a chance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Three stars for the pee smelling gunk are for the fact that it&#x27;s natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>And really, you must wear socks because you WILL be channeling your inner figure skater on any non-carpeted surface.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my feet soft.</li>
            <li>99% natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This really works if you use it regularly .....</li>
            <li>My adult children are runners....</li>
            <li>Noticeable from a far.</li>
            <li>found it didnt absorb fast, and left my feet feeling greasy &amp; sticky until I wiped it off.</li>
            <li>I continue to buy this for this old dancer&#x27;s cracked</li>
            <li>Recommend putting on cotton socks directly after applying it.</li>
            <li>Left feet very sticky and did not smell of coconuts.</li>
            <li>I bought her lots of different products, but nothing really worked except this.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother hiring a professional, just use this creme.  </li>
            <li>Last winter, I had scrubbed the house so much with bleach water, I had blood that came to the surface of the pours on my hands.  </li>
            <li>I love this for my body, but still prefer Burt&#x27;s Bees overnight foot cream to intensely moisturize my poor heals.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The consistency is more like a thick tacky gel.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more an ointment, or thick, greasy gel.</li>
            <li>I literally put it on nice and thick, and then put a sock back on, and go to sleep.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, by the next day, the foot looks much better - even on my husband&#x27;s man feet!  </li>
            <li>I have tried quite a few OTC creams but this was the first and only thing that worked so quickly and well.  </li>
            <li>She uses this regularly, and her feet are now soft and all the cracks are gone... normal feet!  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything on my right foot because if I don&#x27;t tend to it fairly often, painful cracks develop on my heel.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin right away, so I would only use it at night and definitely not before putting on sandals.  </li>
            <li>Extremely sticky and did not have a smooth feeling, only yucky feeling.  </li>
            <li>I decided to make war on my dry heels and this was one of my first purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s solidly good, and the scent puts it ahead of other products for me at least.</li>
            <li>I have tried other cocomut creme products without much success.</li>
            <li>Last year for the first time in my life, the heels on my feet actually cracked.  </li>
            <li>Weeks of  regular use (and yes, I actually wore socks in spite of the hot weather just to give this cream a chance) and there has been no visible effect on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First product I am reviewing.&lt;br /&gt;I have not seen a skin product make a difference in such short time.</li>
            <li>If you slightly diluted Vaseline and added a bit of fine grit to it, you&#x27;d have something very similar to this</li>
            <li>I wish I had thought to wear two pairs of socks the first night because it leaked through one pair of thinner socks and stained my favorite, expensive sheet set.  </li>
            <li>True, the consistency is a little gelatinous, but who cares?</li>
            <li>It smells great and moisturizes my feet well, but feels greasy and unpleasant.</li>
            <li>Within three days, most dead skin were gone and finally a week later it seems that her foot is recovered 90%.</li>
            <li>Normal hand creme (or even the fancy stuff) wont touch it for healing DEEP cracks on your feet.</li>
            <li>The first night I ignored that advice, and when I put my feet under the covers there was quite a bit of drag.</li>
            <li>This product is very reasonably priced compared to other options on the market.</li>
            <li>Really works well for dry feet</li>
            <li>It helps so much with dry cracked skin.  </li>
            <li>but it will really help with dry or cracked feet.</li>
            <li>From then on I have decided to do whatever I can to avoid this problem in the future which lead me to buying an assortment of extra intense moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and a small amount will last forever, making it a great value.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As some other people said, it&#x27;s exactly like putting honey and molasses on your feet.  </li>
            <li>I will use no other foot cream after using this.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works like no other for me.</li>
            <li>Works like no other cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It has the consistency of a thick vaseline with a touch of fine grit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tolerated beat up and calloused feet since far too long, and it was completely unnecessary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So Far this is the only thing that has worked for me ever!!</li>
            <li>Regular use has nearly restored my feet to their youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only need to apply once a day and my feet are soft.  </li>
            <li>I think I expected too much of the cream.</li>
            <li>Even though I do not like this product, I will say the next day my feet are incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li>A friend got this for me for Christmas in a gift set, and I had forgotten I had it, because I was certain that it was like every other cream I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find the smell to be unpleasant or pleasant.  </li>
            <li>You fee a slight warming sensation when you rub the creme in your hands first.</li>
            <li>Love this thick cream for dry feet!</li>
            <li>I have tried all kinds of regular body lotions as well as specialized lotions for extra dry skin or for feet, but nothing ever seemed to make much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>Usually have to reapply lotion to feet several times a day to avoid them becoming dry and chalky looking.</li>
            <li>This is much thicker than expected, but works well, definitely use it with socks or you&#x27;ll get fibers stuck on your feet and the gel-like cream on the floor!</li>
            <li>I have had trouble with dry, cracked feet year-round for as long as I can remember, and becoming a runner only exacerbated the problem.  </li>
            <li>I was embarrassed to get a pedicure because my own feet were so awful, but now they are smooth and soft.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to find safe and natural beauty products that actually perform.</li>
            <li>Recommend using a foot file for dead skin first.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so although it can be pricey in some stores it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s oily, hard to absorb, but also dries out quickly making your feet even drier.</li>
            <li>Very little goes a long way with this stuff, more so than other lotions and moisturizers.</li>
            <li>very oily and has a odd smell, nothing like coconut</li>
            <li>I have been using this stuff for less than a week, and the effect is very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>but I have used it a couple of times and this really smooths rough dry heels.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product to use to help get the dry thick skin off your feet - whatever the season.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through several tubes over the years and especially when you&#x27;re near the end, it&#x27;s hard to control how much cream comes out.</li>
            <li>I have really dry feet, and live in a dry area.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m on my feet all day and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found to pamper my achy feet and keep them soft.</li>
            <li> Incredible stuff, really is.  </li>
            <li> This has an amazing coconut scent too which is great to smell each evening as I get ready for bed.</li>
            <li> the oil is so greasy and leaves your feet so soft and it is very nice and good smell also</li>
            <li> The creme is super good.</li>
            <li> I saw a huge difference overnight!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely more like a balm.</li>
            <li> Better then lotion.  </li>
            <li> I use this when I need something more to work on the tougher areas.</li>
            <li> It is ok.  </li>
            <li> and my feet are now silky smooth after 3 applications!</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t do better.</li>
            <li> I also love the smell of it - peppermint.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I will not be able to use this product</li>
            <li> Love that it has vitamin E in it.</li>
            <li> It smells like coconuts which i love the smell of coconuts.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is actually appealing, not medicinal.</li>
            <li> tubes) sells at a notably lower price.</li>
            <li> My feet love this foot creme.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is more like Vaseline than it is like creme.</li>
            <li> And Burt&#x27;s Bees is fantastic for not over-packaging their products!</li>
            <li> She asked me to order more.</li>
            <li> She says her feet feel better after using it.</li>
            <li> I no longer believe there is much &amp;#34;truth in advertising&amp;#34;, so it is great to be able to have this venue to recommend or warn people about products.  </li>
            <li> Will buy again :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>

            <li> If you like a coconut smell you will love this foot cream.  </li>
            <li> Had I known that it was more like Vicks vapor rub</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> My feet feel and look SO much better.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell and ingredients however.</li>
            <li> I love using this foot cream.  </li>
            <li> If I could give this product more than five stars, I would.  </li>
            <li> Almost everyone needs some extra smoothness in the winter and this is perfect for.dried cracked feet.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite foot cream.</li>
            <li> I LOVE WITH NO TOXIC INGREDIENTS..</li>
            <li> What more could I ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the  aroma of the coconut foot creme.</li>
            <li> Mmmm I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Not creamy, more gel like.</li>
            <li> My favorite foot cream.</li>
            <li> Actually it is more like a salve.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t SOUND like a nice combination, but it works somehow.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cream.</li>
            <li> It was like magic.  </li>
            <li> I love Burt Bees products.  </li>
            <li> , however I wish it wasn&#x27;t quite so potent as my daughter hates the smell.  </li>
            <li> Then when I started to use this product I noticed it was keeping my feet softer, and healing better than anything I had ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this foot creme.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product and its results.</li>
            <li> I *love* it for my hands.  </li>
            <li> Would buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Be sure to put on socks, as it takes a while for the oils to soak in.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this product.  </li>
            <li> It is such a luxurious treat, and it smells soooo good!!</li>
            <li> I love using this during the winter, wearing socks overnight after application to soften up my feet.  </li>
            <li> Make sure this is not on your feet when taking a shower.  </li>
            <li> The next morning, my feet and heals look perfect!  </li>
            <li> This product is okay.</li>
            <li> Calous Remover - I highly recommend!!!!!  </li>
            <li> instead I use hotel body lotion which while great, not natural or as good for my feet.</li>
            <li> This cream is so wonderful for my dry feet.  </li>
            <li> Best thing ever for dry cracked feet.</li>
            <li> She loved it so much that i had to buy her more tubes.</li>
            <li> Most certainly would recommend this project!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent for keeping feet and heels super smooth and soft</li>
            <li> Best treat for dry feet! )</li>
            <li> the other hand, the smell is wonderful - coconut and mint mostly.</li>
            <li> R.I.P Burt thank you for the high quality amazing products you have made!</li>
            <li> I had a high hope on this based on many good reviews.  </li>
            <li> But the most important thing to me is that it WORKS.  </li>
            <li> This had great reviews and it was all natural.</li>
            <li> I really do like Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and this foot creme received overwhelmingly good reviews.  </li>
            <li> Smells really good and very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I love how it absorbs easily and it leaves my feet feeling silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious; dries super gross.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other foot creams and this is THE BEST.</li>
            <li> It eased the dryness but doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb very quickly and felt too greasy.  </li>
            <li> Your feet will smell so good and be lovely and soft after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The peppermint foot creme obviously smells great, but the coconut creme has a consistency which is thicker and more luxurious, hence why I use it to nourish my feet at night.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply with the foot creme of Coconut.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit sticky, smells rather strong and has worked well for me.</li>
            <li> also don&#x27;t like the overly strong synthetic fragrance.</li>
            <li> Strong scent, but not offensive.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy or doesn&#x27;t have any strong smell.</li>
            <li> hands down the best foot cream ever.  </li>
            <li> This is hand&#x27;s down the best cream I have used.</li>
            <li> Healthy Feet/Working Hands - It soaks into your skin really quickly.  </li>
            <li> My feet never smelled so good and soft!</li>
            <li> The heavenly scent will leave your feet smelling so good, and feeling so so so soft!</li>
            <li> Goes on very greasy, must put on a sock, but my feet are so lovely!</li>
            <li> Smells great, and makes my feet super soft.  </li>
            <li> Best way to soften dry heels; lightly massage Burt&#x27;s Bees Creme into your whole foot, put on a light pair of 100% cotton socks and go to bed!  </li>
            <li> My feet feel amazing and The smell is also very soothing.</li>
            <li> It was silky smooth going on</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t like that, you won&#x27;t enjoy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t expect the cr&amp;egrave;me to be a silky smooth, experience.  </li>
            <li> The quality and genuine naturalness of this product line has gone south since the sale of the company.</li>
            <li> It keeps my feet smooth for almost a week.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for 3 years and it keeps heels smooth and crack free year round.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suppose if you don&#x27;t mind doing a spa day with this you might enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Without question, the product is far superior in every respect.</li>
            <li> Its also a natural product that I feel good about using on my skin.</li>
            <li> why.&lt;br /&gt;First most creams if they worked at all had to be applied 3 - 4 times a day to cause any good improvement, and if I missed a day the reversal of skin condition was not only felt it was visible.</li>
            <li> I like Burt&#x27;s Bees products because they are natural and was hoping for good results with this foot cream.</li>
            <li> and It works better if you put in some socks right after application.</li>
            <li> great!!!very very  nice!!!I like it!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter love it very much.</li>
            <li> but overall it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> After a bath, she puts on this cream, then puts the socks (that came in her original kit) on.  </li>
            <li> You apply it before going to bed and need to wear socks with it which at first isn&#x27;t something I wanted to do, but I got over that real quickly when I saw the results.  </li>
            <li> Never disappointed with this provider</li>
            <li> IN A COUPLE OF DAYS HAVE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT</li>
            <li> Just a friendly warning if you&#x27;re attached to your sheets and you apply liberally.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> winter coming,,I&#x27;m sure it will work out pretty well.</li>
            <li> First, the smell is not too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s great if yo have 30 minutes and the steam to rub your feet to dry and flaking.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Unbelievable-so great for healing dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Feels great on the feet, and even my elbows which tend to get really dry.  </li>
            <li> I cannot fathom trying to clean the greasy footprints that would result from not wearing socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t add anything to the many positive reviews shown.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am usually a positive reviewer, and I attempt to find redeeming qualities even of things I was not keen on.  </li>
            <li> rich, thick and wonderful</li>
            <li> My hands look amazing and feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> No one wants to hear about callused feet, so I&#x27;ll spare you the details, but I will say that my husband&#x27;s feet have gone from being like the cracks in the Grand Canyon to being like a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this foot creme.  </li>
            <li> The peppermint and coconut smells sweet and it almost tempts me to give it a lick.  </li>
            <li> My feet are nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> my full review of this product at: myreallifereviews  .  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be purchasing burts bees foot creme again, I found that straight coconut oil works much better.</li>
            <li> I worked on making my feet, especially my heals looking good for spring to no avail until I used this creme.  </li>
            <li> but that is the only good thing about it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find good products for feet, and this one is pretty good at the job it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> As a regular user I totally recommend this foot cream for its effectiveness and wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the color and consistency of honey when putting it on, but soaks in/disappears fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I did not find that it helped a whole bunch on softening my feet as much as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Does the trick on keeping my feet smelling good even after a long shoe-ful day.</li>
            <li> The coconut smell is minty too, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Firstly, it works!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This product is super effective at softening the feet and especially heels.</li>
            <li> Little pricey in my opinion but the person I gave it to said it worked great on her feet.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and is very thick and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> If it gets the Mom stamp of approval then it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> İ am glad that İ could find her a cure that is also 99.6% natural.</li>
            <li> love that Burt&#x27;s Bees uses primarily natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I have been going much more natural these days so that is a necessity for me.  </li>
            <li> feet have become so much more soft.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is Burt&#x27;s Bees and that they use natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the ingredients are natural, too.  </li>
            <li> It has a texture that is like Vaseline or petroleum jelly; however, the cr&amp;egrave;me is absorbed into your foot so that you don&#x27;t walk around with greasy feet all day.</li>
            <li> Every time showered ,she wanna it for fun</li>
            <li> You put the stuff on at night, the grease gets absorbed</li>
            <li> After applying this product to a freshly washed and pumiced foot, I feel like there is immediate improvement in the skin softness.  </li>
            <li> , I really can&#x27;t say enough good about this.</li>
            <li> By the morning, my skin has absorbed it and when I take off the socks, my feet are softer and aren&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li> You only thought you liked foot massages.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> but I live in California where its hot most of the year and socks are just not going to cut it when I sleep.</li>
            <li> On one hand it does a good job moisturizing my feet but on the other hand, the texture of it is too greasy and gel like.  </li>
            <li> I have an issue with the skin on my right foot.  </li>
            <li> So I put this cream on my right foot, not even right out of the shower or anything, and went to bed without socks.  </li>
            <li> and it comes right off.  </li>
            <li> It soaks right into my skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the morning after my shower, and apply it again at nighttime right before bed.</li>
            <li> I put it on right before bed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly certain the socks absorbed far more product than my feet did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Burt&#x27;s Bees consumer for several years, and this is bar none my favorite BB product.  </li>
            <li> Very moist, absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> Most lotions just don&#x27;t seem to provide enough moisture to really make a difference but this stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Eventually, after about 6 weeks of my soaking, tea tree oil and Burt&#x27;s Coconut Foot Crème regime ---- for the first time in years and years ALL of my foot surface, toes, heels, ankles were as soft and smooth as my 2 year old grand daughters feet.</li>
            <li> its amazing for dry feet.</li>
            <li> However, the scent is really nice, at least to me, as it&#x27;s an interesting combination of mint and coconut.</li>
            <li> Her feet get chapped easily and Burt&#x27;s bees helps her keep them soft.</li>
            <li> This foot cream smells great and relaxes my feet after a hard day at work.  </li>
            <li> Calling this product a &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; is pretty misleading.</li>
            <li> That really hurts!  </li>
            <li> After the first couple of nights I got used to it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smith and Nephew Moisturizing Cream - I first tried this lotion when in the hospital after a surgery.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Next morning my heels looked so much better wasn&#x27;t all cracky</li>
            <li> Kinda sticky at first, I put on socks after applying.</li>
            <li> This is more like a rather fluid ointment then a creme.</li>
            <li> My feet (I used the pumice stone first)</li>
            <li> The only downside is that is oily, so be sure to use it with socks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind this as it feels like it penetrates more deeply.  </li>
            <li> If your feet are as soft and smooth as the day you were born, then this may not be for you.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it would feel gooshy and slippery</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product, and I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> It contains vegetable glycerin, olive oil, oat protein, lanolin, water, coconut oil (the real stuff!), tocopheral (vitamin E), peppermint oil, rosemary extract, and fragrance.</li>
            <li> the foot balm is amazing,my father likes it sooo much!</li>
            <li> There are no weird fragrances or ingredients.</li>
            <li> Smooth soft feet.</li>
            <li> For 15 years I have tried so many different foot cremes -</li>
            <li> I agree with others in that its consistency is similar to a slightly more viscous Vaseline.</li>
            <li> I love anything coconut, especially when it really works!  </li>
            <li> I wish I used this more regularly… when I put this on at night with socks, my feet are noticeably softer the next day.</li>
            <li> But I saw Improvements of my feet just after the first night.</li>
            <li> After consistent use my feet have been made heavenly.</li>
            <li> However, it did leave my feet soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this morning, and already my feet are softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only thing i have found that does the magic.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;s great but a bit thick.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely NOT a creme, it is better described as an ointment.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely very oily, so you want to have your socks right at hand to put on as soon as you finish rubbing it</li>
            <li> (and I did have to put it on right before bed and stick my feet under the covers, so I can&#x27;t really fault his assessment).</li>
            <li> That said, the texture, which is kind of like first aid ointment, is not a pleasure to rub in, like a body butter or other lotion would be.</li>
            <li> (I suspect it&#x27;s absorbed into my socks, not my feet) and what&#x27;s left is a fine powder.</li>
            <li> I massage this into my clean feet and then put on soft cotton</li>
            <li> This is great, my feet are silky soft after just a few days of use.  </li>
            <li> First of all, the scent is coconutt-y and peppermint-y, very luscious.</li>
            <li> I have tried various products to soften up my feet but this one is the only one that worked incredibly well, and after only two nights!</li>
            <li> and I was able to use it for a long time on each foot for my girlfriend.  </li>
            <li> I looked at the ingredients and thought it would be more moisturizing seemed to dry out my heels.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worked better than lotion to relieve dry areas.</li>
            <li> It corrected the problem so quickly and completely</li>
            <li> quickly restoring soft, supple skin in those area as well.</li>
            <li> This keeps my feet nice and pretty throughout the harsh winter months.</li>
            <li> It does have a rather loud but not unpleasant smell which goes</li>
            <li> It is super thick and kind of like Vaseline, but thicker than that.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Works its magic really well on dry elbows and knees  </li>
            <li> THis is the only thing that adequately hydrates my skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit too greasy for me but the smell is really nice.</li>
            <li> The product says its a cream but should really be labeled as a balm.</li>
            <li> and you really do need to wear the socks.  </li>
            <li> it on your feet, but just didn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> It is not so much a creme as a salve, as another reviewer mentioned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this really improved the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is sticky, but it really works.</li>
            <li> of it&#x27;s oiliness, I wouldn&#x27;t put this on so much for summer time when I am wearing sandals,</li>
            <li> I put socks on after rubbing some into my feet (either during the day or overnight), and it really helps keep my heels from cracking.</li>
            <li> my feet feel so much softer.</li>
            <li> Really stays on the foot, just massage into foot then put on socks and go.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> tried Eucerin foot cream for a couple of days in between, and boy, that really works on my feet.</li>
            <li> I use it nightly after my shower and my feet are always ready for sandals or heels.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Had two broken bones in ankle so after months of the cast, the leg and foot were not in great condition.</li>
            <li> This product worked but was really &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I used Vaseline for my feet, I really needed some moistore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a real treat to use this foot</li>
            <li> VERY WELL, TO USE AT NIGHT UNDER SOCKS TO SLEEP</li>
            <li> The next morning, your hands slide smoothly over your feet and you think they&#x27;re softer, but I think they&#x27;re just sliding over powder residue.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this foot cream</li>
            <li> But the stuff works really well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not really a cream, it&#x27;s more like a salve.  </li>
            <li> At the very beginning, I though it is too creamy.  </li>
            <li> Of course this will depend on how much you use.</li>
            <li> product is very greasy and sticky.  </li>
            <li> This was what i was looking for and it works really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very \\&quot;creamy\\&quot;, more like a salve in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THEN, it does work and very well.</li>
            <li> This one lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good as a moisturizer, although not amazing in my experience.</li>
            <li> Also, the stuff is so thick and greasy that it forces you to massage your feet for a while, and pampering feels really good.</li>
            <li> Unlike a lot of lotions and creams, this really does make a significant improvement in the look of your feet, and in a relatively short period of time too.</li>
            <li> It was just a miracle that her foot improved significantly in a day after starting to use this cream.</li>
            <li> other reviewers have mentioned, the texture is more like an ointment than a cream.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for tired feet!!</li>
            <li> My feet have always been dry, and they crack easily.</li>
            <li> I am a Sandals 75% of the year, Loves being bare foot, Military wife always changing climates, who walks miles a day or is always up and running around either way kind of girl.</li>
            <li> But is not powerful as to where you can not use it if you have a headache or potent smell sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I try to do the full routine--bath, foot file, then the foot creme--but even when I can only put the creme on under a pair of socks, it does noticeably soften my feet a bit.  </li>
            <li> I decided that coconut would be a rather innocuous smell, as I am generally pretty scent sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Putting socks on first fixed that problem.  </li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend bare feet right after applying, as it&#x27;s slippery.  </li>
            <li> but I am sure I could use less.</li>
            <li> Dry feet lightly and apply.</li>
            <li> Thought it was better than it is, had a tiny sample, this does not seem the same.</li>
            <li> The only suggestion I would have is to put it on just as you are turning in for the night - if you are anything like me, the last thing you need is to get coconut creamy footprints all over the floor. :)</li>
            <li> It works fast and leave my feet very soft.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing, and makes my feet really soft &amp; supple!  </li>
            <li> I always have this handy all year long, because my hands and foot are always dry and cracks.  </li>
            <li> Friends had recommended it to me and I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy, but I love it</li>
            <li> The best way I have found to use it is after a serious removal of dead skin around my heels, etc.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing thick lotion - a dense cream.  </li>
            <li> I personally wouldn&#x27;t get it again, as I am not crazy about the texture of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The consistency is thicker than Vaseline being thicker and similar to a golden honey color and thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves a strange greasy feeling, not a fan of this product, but love the Burts Bees line overall,  Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Thick, gooey, and effective.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, it does great things for my poor tired feet, makes them softer and revives them.</li>
            <li> and my feet have become so much more dry especially in the winter months.  </li>
            <li> And I love it for my hands, especially around the dry cuticles and feet too.</li>
            <li> Much better than different ways as soak in water for hours or chip off dry skin.</li>
            <li> I only deducted one star for the actual feeling and strong scent of the creme.</li>
            <li> She cringes when I sit next to her after applying it to my feet as she can smell it right away.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised by the consistency when I squeezed the first bit out of the tube, but as soon as it hit my first dry heel, I was sold.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help that I live in Minnesota.  </li>
            <li> I cannot live without this.</li>
            <li> This is going to be a new part of my evening foot regimen.</li>
            <li> Only requires a few nights of use to be effective.  </li>
            <li> She is only 1+years old ,it&#x27;s worth .</li>
            <li> Have the effect very much A week later after use The heel of the crack is resolved</li>
            <li> And to be able to touch my hubbies feet with my bare feet without fear of what he thought.&lt;br /&gt;I find this cream to be greasy, and after I use it I put my feet up and don&#x27;t walk at all until all the crème is soaked in, about an hour to and hour and a half.</li>
            <li> If it had a different feel it would give it a higher rating.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount on each foot in the morning after I shower, making sure to massage it underneath and between each toe</li>
            <li> This is the only one that consistently works.</li>
            <li> With consistent use and proper foot care this product does work and shows results after 1.5 to 2 months</li>
            <li> This product makes my feet really soft!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past couple of years and I love how my feet look like now.</li>
            <li> As a previous loyal Burt&#x27;s Bees customer, I&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li> I live near the beach and spend hours walking by the shore barefoot.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really help my dry heels too much, but</li>
            <li> thought the grit was to slough off dead skin, but it&#x27;s too fine.</li>
            <li> I usually take the socks off sometime in the middle of the night because my feet get hot, and by that time they are fine.</li>
            <li> My feet are not a pretty sight unless dry and rough look good to you.</li>
            <li> , so I try to stay clear of that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s brownish clear with flecks.</li>
            <li> Makes her feet so soft.  </li>
            <li> my feet are so soft now.</li>
            <li> ,They was so soft.</li>
            <li> But, since my aim is to have soft feet, I will continue to use it because it works so well.</li>
            <li> My feet feel soft and young after each time I use this.  </li>
            <li> Both me and my sister use it and our feet are as soft as can be.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind, but was surprised.  </li>
            <li> When you order, you receive a 4.3 ounce tube of 99.4% natural foot cream.</li>
            <li> It refreshes your skin with naturally derived rosemary extracts.</li>
            <li> Unexpectedly.</li>
            <li> I slather it on, yes slather, and then put soft socks on before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li> I tried this at my daughters house and like the way it kept my heels soft.</li>
            <li> works well and restores the moisture and keeps my feet soft.</li>
            <li> My feet stay refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li> But my feet are far from my nose, so I gave it a chance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Three stars for the pee smelling gunk are for the fact that it&#x27;s natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> And really, you must wear socks because you WILL be channeling your inner figure skater on any non-carpeted surface.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my feet soft.</li>
            <li> 99% natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> This really works if you use it regularly .....</li>
            <li> My adult children are runners....</li>
            <li> Noticeable from a far.</li>
            <li> found it didnt absorb fast, and left my feet feeling greasy &amp; sticky until I wiped it off.</li>
            <li> I continue to buy this for this old dancer&#x27;s cracked</li>
            <li> Recommend putting on cotton socks directly after applying it.</li>
            <li> Left feet very sticky and did not smell of coconuts.</li>
            <li> I bought her lots of different products, but nothing really worked except this.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother hiring a professional, just use this creme.  </li>
            <li> Last winter, I had scrubbed the house so much with bleach water, I had blood that came to the surface of the pours on my hands.  </li>
            <li> I love this for my body, but still prefer Burt&#x27;s Bees overnight foot cream to intensely moisturize my poor heals.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The consistency is more like a thick tacky gel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more an ointment, or thick, greasy gel.</li>
            <li> I literally put it on nice and thick, and then put a sock back on, and go to sleep.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, by the next day, the foot looks much better - even on my husband&#x27;s man feet!  </li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few OTC creams but this was the first and only thing that worked so quickly and well.  </li>
            <li> She uses this regularly, and her feet are now soft and all the cracks are gone... normal feet!  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything on my right foot because if I don&#x27;t tend to it fairly often, painful cracks develop on my heel.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin right away, so I would only use it at night and definitely not before putting on sandals.  </li>
            <li> Extremely sticky and did not have a smooth feeling, only yucky feeling.  </li>
            <li> I decided to make war on my dry heels and this was one of my first purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s solidly good, and the scent puts it ahead of other products for me at least.</li>
            <li> I have tried other cocomut creme products without much success.</li>
            <li> Last year for the first time in my life, the heels on my feet actually cracked.  </li>
            <li> Weeks of  regular use (and yes, I actually wore socks in spite of the hot weather just to give this cream a chance) and there has been no visible effect on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First product I am reviewing.&lt;br /&gt;I have not seen a skin product make a difference in such short time.</li>
            <li> If you slightly diluted Vaseline and added a bit of fine grit to it, you&#x27;d have something very similar to this</li>
            <li> I wish I had thought to wear two pairs of socks the first night because it leaked through one pair of thinner socks and stained my favorite, expensive sheet set.  </li>
            <li> True, the consistency is a little gelatinous, but who cares?</li>
            <li> It smells great and moisturizes my feet well, but feels greasy and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Within three days, most dead skin were gone and finally a week later it seems that her foot is recovered 90%.</li>
            <li> Normal hand creme (or even the fancy stuff) wont touch it for healing DEEP cracks on your feet.</li>
            <li> The first night I ignored that advice, and when I put my feet under the covers there was quite a bit of drag.</li>
            <li> This product is very reasonably priced compared to other options on the market.</li>
            <li> Really works well for dry feet</li>
            <li> It helps so much with dry cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> but it will really help with dry or cracked feet.</li>
            <li> From then on I have decided to do whatever I can to avoid this problem in the future which lead me to buying an assortment of extra intense moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and a small amount will last forever, making it a great value.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As some other people said, it&#x27;s exactly like putting honey and molasses on your feet.  </li>
            <li> I will use no other foot cream after using this.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works like no other for me.</li>
            <li> Works like no other cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It has the consistency of a thick vaseline with a touch of fine grit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tolerated beat up and calloused feet since far too long, and it was completely unnecessary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So Far this is the only thing that has worked for me ever!!</li>
            <li> Regular use has nearly restored my feet to their youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only need to apply once a day and my feet are soft.  </li>
            <li> I think I expected too much of the cream.</li>
            <li> Even though I do not like this product, I will say the next day my feet are incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> A friend got this for me for Christmas in a gift set, and I had forgotten I had it, because I was certain that it was like every other cream I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the smell to be unpleasant or pleasant.  </li>
            <li> You fee a slight warming sensation when you rub the creme in your hands first.</li>
            <li> Love this thick cream for dry feet!</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of regular body lotions as well as specialized lotions for extra dry skin or for feet, but nothing ever seemed to make much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> Usually have to reapply lotion to feet several times a day to avoid them becoming dry and chalky looking.</li>
            <li> This is much thicker than expected, but works well, definitely use it with socks or you&#x27;ll get fibers stuck on your feet and the gel-like cream on the floor!</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with dry, cracked feet year-round for as long as I can remember, and becoming a runner only exacerbated the problem.  </li>
            <li> I was embarrassed to get a pedicure because my own feet were so awful, but now they are smooth and soft.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find safe and natural beauty products that actually perform.</li>
            <li> Recommend using a foot file for dead skin first.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so although it can be pricey in some stores it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oily, hard to absorb, but also dries out quickly making your feet even drier.</li>
            <li> Very little goes a long way with this stuff, more so than other lotions and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> very oily and has a odd smell, nothing like coconut</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for less than a week, and the effect is very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> but I have used it a couple of times and this really smooths rough dry heels.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product to use to help get the dry thick skin off your feet - whatever the season.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several tubes over the years and especially when you&#x27;re near the end, it&#x27;s hard to control how much cream comes out.</li>
            <li> I have really dry feet, and live in a dry area.  </li>
            <li> so you have to be a little careful where you put your feet right after applying it.</li>
            <li> Worked in less than a week - I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I generally like Burt&#x27;s Bees products and wanted to het help for my dry feet.</li>
            <li> As a hint, I take an amount about the size of a large pea and mix it with a small bit of regular Burt&#x27;s Bees lotion and spread it over my feet.  </li>
            <li> -- it takes a little while to soak into the soles of my feet, but because it takes a little longer than many of the creams out there, it seems to last a little longer too.</li>
            <li> The next evening I noticed that the callous on the bottom of my foot was separating from the normal skin, and after only a few days a lot of it is gone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very greasy, doesn&#x27;t absorb well and is not very effective.</li>
            <li> She only has to use a tiny bit, so a tube lasts quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s necessary to wash your hands after applying as it&#x27;s pretty thick, and</li>
            <li> One coat of this stuff, and my feet are noticeably less scaly and soft; regular use, and my feet stay supple.  </li>
            <li> My extraordinarily rough, scratchy feet barely responded to a pumice stone, so I didn&#x27;t hold out hope with this creme.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it works or not, but I don&#x27;t want to give it a try.</li>
            <li> The smell is intoxicating, and the cream itself is very thick and super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> recommended it to my mother (from whom I inherited my bad feet), and she has had the same amazing results.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is so sticky and gooey, but that&#x27;s a tradeoff for a product that works really well.</li>
            <li> I struggle with dry skin, especially on my hands and feet in the wintertime.</li>
            <li> If marketing a &#x27;natural product&#x27; then at least use Non-GMO ingredients and natural fragrances rather than synthetic chemicals.</li>
            <li> My feet have always been really dry with deep cracks.</li>
            <li> Bought this foot creme after recent bouts with dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps those dry heels from wearing sandals.</li>
            <li> All the dry, cracked skin has vanished and I have only been using it for one week.</li>
            <li> The skin on our feet is now soft and pink rather than rough, cracked, and covered with dry white lines.  </li>
            <li> My right foot is very dry and develops thick callouses.  </li>
            <li> I really lay it on thick about 2 days out of the week and the other 5 days use less and rub it in really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What a blessing and relief and so nice not to have those ugly, embarrassing feet to hide in the summer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a life long fan of Burt&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> With regular use, I think it seems the skin supple and the rough skin patches at bay.</li>
            <li> Before trying this, I couldn&#x27;t find anything that would properly moisturize my rough, cracked soles.  </li>
            <li> Amazingly thick and keeps my feet and heels soft; need only a tiny amount</li>
            <li> I give it three stars simply because I get similar results from using store brand cocoa butter lotion (and for less money).</li>
            <li> I have tried at least a dozen other brands and they just smooth your feet for a few hours</li>
            <li> At bedtime, I covered my hands with this creme, put on thin rubber type gloves, and in the morning, my hands not only looked completely healed, but they actually even looked younger.</li>
            <li> Great foot cream, gets rid of those ugly cracked heels and soothes your feet after a long hard day.</li>
            <li> Airflow goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Sadly enough, other than liking the smell, this has turned out to be a dud for me.</li>
            <li> I have also used it on my elbows, and other extremely dry areas of skin with the same results.  </li>
            <li> I have very rough heels, and this is the only thing that works.  </li>
            <li> Use it on dry feet at night and put on socks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on rashes and dry spots all over my skin.</li>
            <li> I allow it to dry for a couple of minutes before I put on socks.  </li>
            <li> If your feet are dry and calloused, you should give this a try.</li>
            <li> It rejuvenates dry feet with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> My heels get dry in the summer.</li>
            <li> Living by the beach in year around flip flops meant dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li> I put it on the dry area a couple of days in a row.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry, cracked skin on your feet, Burt&#x27;s Bees Coconut Foot Cr&amp;egrave;me is one you might want to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gave these as gifts to my in-laws who I have dry feet.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> She has really dry cracked feet.  </li>
            <li> Dry feet are so resistant to any sort of moisture, but not this one.</li>
            <li> My feet are softer, and not cracked or dry.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised when I opened it though because I was expecting a thick, white cream</li>
            <li> Too thick to wear in high heel sandals.</li>
            <li> (She probably used too much, it only takes a dine size amount) and went down.  </li>
            <li> and sometimes I can skip a day, hands down the best crème I have used for my disgusting calloused and previously cracked feet.  </li>
            <li> I only use a small drop per foot daily and it adds moisture as it heals.  </li>
            <li> And it only takes a little squeeze - a pea-sized amount</li>
            <li> The little bit of regular lotion mixes well with the coconut foot cream and it spreads around easier.  </li>
            <li> You need only a little bit.</li>
            <li> This is not as much a creme as it is a very thick gel.  </li>
            <li> Before this creme, I would feel the sheets get caught on sharp, dry pieces of my heels.  </li>
            <li> I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and live in MN where the winters get cold and the air really dry &#x3D; extra dry skin in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Not really for daytime use, but a dab at night does wonders.</li>
            <li> I have spent tons of money on stuff that stays gunky, slimy, makes me slide in my sandals, ect.</li>
            <li> I have really rough, calloused feet.  </li>
            <li> I only use this a few times a week, but when I do, I layer it on generously and then put on socks for the night.</li>
            <li> I also put this on my rough knuckles on my hands and it has helped that.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time on my feet, which get a bit rough from going barefoot around the house</li>
            <li> The edge/palm of my hand below the little finger became dry, hard and rough (not usual for me).  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> But This Put it on at night with some socks by morning other than the sagey coconut smell</li>
            <li> But you can smell the other herbs in it and it helps with the sleep.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day now</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend any other product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I usually love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and was really disappointed with this.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful that you don&#x27;t walk around on anything slippery, it leaves footprints and you&#x27;ll fall down.</li>
            <li> I put it on at the end of an active day (hiking, working in the yard, etc.)</li>
            <li> I like how it is thick, but not as thick as I would hope, and pours a bit too much out of the tube.</li>
            <li> product has the bees wax base which makes it a very smooth application.</li>
            <li> This is very greasy and difficult to remove from my hands.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is with the tube which maintains its shape even if you&#x27;re almost out of the product.</li>
            <li> Lately I have become a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; products.  </li>
            <li> have continued to use Burt&#x27;s Bees foot cream this winter (usually every other night) and haven&#x27;t had a single crack in my heels!</li>
            <li> I bought this expecting a typical &amp;#34;Creme&amp;#34;, thick and white.  </li>
            <li> (and since it takes only a small amount, the 4-oz tube lasts for months!).  </li>
            <li> So I figure -- why choose one or the other when you can use both!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, with this and any other dry skin cream, it is not forever, but must be done one to two times daily.</li>
            <li> As long as Burt&#x27;s Bees does not change its non chemical formula they have at least one customer for life with this product.</li>
            <li> This foot creme is just a gooey gelatinous mess.  </li>
            <li> you have a hard, dry area of skin, give it a try.</li>
            <li> Every step I take the crack splits a little and it just hurts.  </li>
            <li> I must have touched the area my lips came into contact with because I could taste it a little bit.  </li>
            <li> If you were going to wear sandals or go without socks, you might want to let it soak in a little longer or dab your feet with a towel before putting on footwear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After my shower, I spread a little of this on my feet and then put on socks.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a little bit of grit in it, to help emolliate I assume, but it&#x27;s not like a scrub or anything.</li>
            <li> Once on the foot, your foot can get a little greasy as it absorbs.  </li>
            <li> so that I don&#x27;t pick up dirt since it is a little greasy.</li>
            <li> If you are serious about treating cracked heels and dry feet, this product will do the job.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic, but I only used it once after feeling how disgusting it was.  </li>
            <li> Its a bit messy and</li>
            <li> One of the side effects of her treatment has been cracked and dead skin in her feet.</li>
            <li> I do need to use a callouse remover while in the shower to shave the dead skin away, but this creme helps to soften it so that it is easier to use the Ped Egg (the callous remover - check it out if you don&#x27;t have one) and shave it off.  </li>
            <li> I had calluses on both feet (that hurt) and this softened all of them after a few applications.</li>
            <li> It is a heavy, ointment-like consistency.  </li>
            <li> I had never been able to totally rid my feet of at least some nasty  places.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It reminds me of heavily scented petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> It also works on any part of your body that is dried or chapped or cracked..</li>
            <li> Very thick this is what you need for repairing intensely dry or cracked feet.  </li>
            <li> I have always had troubles with dry skin, but of course, in the winter it gets so much worse.  </li>
            <li> Use very little of this.  </li>
            <li> This is going to sound a little weird, but it doesn&#x27;t taste bad either.  </li>
            <li> It is way too greasy, sticky and uncomfortable on your feet and does not provide enough moisture.</li>
            <li> In fact, I usually go rinse my hands off after applying.  </li>
            <li> but usually I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is not overwhelming; I find it pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you wear socks, it&#x27;s not as big of a deal, but the texture of this foot \\&quot;cream\\&quot; is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and stays on longer than any other creme I used before.  </li>
            <li> I find it very heavy and does not absorb well.</li>
            <li> Given all the positive reviews, I have to say I was really disappointed of this product.</li>
            <li> It is sticky, feels uncomfortable and should only be used on a winter day when you plan on wearing thick socks all day.  </li>
            <li> I had bad cracks and they didn&#x27;t go away with scrubbing and other oils such as sesame and coconut.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work at the long run</li>
            <li> The past few winters my heels have become so bad that they have actually cracked</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick &amp; a little sticky</li>
            <li> I did find out the hard waythough that if I use it after my feet are already cracked it is going to cause them to crack even more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stock up because it seems to be hard to get at times.</li>
            <li> WELL, THIS PRODUCT HAS SOFTENED MY HARD, BRITTLE SOLES,</li>
            <li> and my feet actually prefer the warmth on these cold nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lather on your feet and def put on a pair of sucks</li>
            <li> Vaseline didn&#x27;t give me that, but at least kept my body&#x27;s moisture for some time.</li>
            <li> It is a bit &amp;#34;fragrant&amp;#34;, but at least it is coconut, and not old-lady floral.</li>
            <li> It leaves a greasy yet grainy texture initially, then dries and leaves your feet feeling awkward.</li>
            <li> something that thick on.</li>
            <li> However, this creme is like thick honey</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the thick sticky consistency at all.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a thick &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; like lotion, so I returned.</li>
            <li> Thick, thick thick.</li>
            <li> Too thick and waxy.  </li>
            <li> When I think of creme, I think of a thick lotion.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t really see a difference and hate</li>
            <li> I mean nothing helped her.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is greasy though and when I use it on my feet, I usually apply it at night and then pull on some thin socks to wear overnight, so that it can absorb thoroughly.</li>
            <li> After years of trying foot creams to get through the cold and dry winters, I came upon Burt&#x27;s Bees Coconut Foot Creme.  </li>
            <li> I have awful dryness on my feet, due to my health issues and multiple medications.  </li>
            <li> My feet get ugly dry in the winter, but this foot creme works wonders.  </li>
            <li> Diamancel Tough Buffer #11]]</li>
            <li> Very thick, and too gooey.</li>
            <li> This is a very thick creme.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thick vaseline type creme, brown in color, and it does smell a bit like coconut.  </li>
            <li> cr&amp;egrave;me to moisturize and just to pamper my poor callused, pummeled feet.</li>
            <li> Its color is a stale brown, not a nice &#x27;creme&#x27; color.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for tired feet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to just dispense a little.</li>
            <li> The smell is very subtle and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Alas, relief!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sorry that I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> To me, it smells faintly of pet urine with a touch of mint.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I am unable to do so with this</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with this foot cream at all.  </li>
            <li> I am obsessed with coconuts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any horrible, deep cracks on my feet that needed intensive care.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> as I said, I think creme is the wrong word to use.  </li>
            <li> It is greasy and feels weird on my hands</li>
            <li> They also itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with Burt&#x27;s Bees products!  </li>
            <li> Definitely hate wearing it to sleep because my feet feel uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> When I opened the tube I thought it had gone bad because there is no cream quality to it.</li>
            <li> Too bad Burt&#x27;s Bees sold out to Clorox.</li>
            <li> , maybe I got a bad tube of it?</li>
            <li> I can not afford my feet to be slimy but the cracking gets so painful.</li>
            <li> I had no idea how painful this can be.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how to finish it :(</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on some recommendations, and I was highly disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I hate ointments and the greasiness it leaves my hands</li>
            <li> I hate the texture of this.</li>
            <li> I myself hate coconut smells, but this one does not bother me.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because my husband hated the smell of the Rescue Me lemongrass foot cream I have been using for years.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> it has a horrible oily consistency.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent for keeping feet and heels super smooth and soft</li>
            <li> Thick, gooey, and effective.</li>
            <li> Looks great! Can&#x27;t wait to try it!</li>
            <li> I had a high hope on this based on many good reviews.  Very disappointed.  Extremely sticky and did not have a smooth feeling, only yucky feeling.  As some other people said, it&#x27;s exactly like putting honey and molasses on your feet.  Must wear socks after putting it on since it&#x27;s so greasy.  Did not find any help with the feet.  Don&#x27;t know how to finish it :(</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. The smell is intoxicating, and the cream itself is very thick and super moisturizing. If you love the smell of coconut, you&#x27;ll be obsessed with this product. Using this, along with regular exfoliating, has kept my feet healthier and softer than they&#x27;ve ever been.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it! Enough said.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am amazed. No one wants to hear about callused feet, so I&#x27;ll spare you the details, but I will say that my husband&#x27;s feet have gone from being like the cracks in the Grand Canyon to being like a baby&#x27;s bottom. I was embarrassed to get a pedicure because my own feet were so awful, but now they are smooth and soft.   This stuff smells good and begins working immediately. True, the consistency is a little gelatinous, but who cares? It softens your cuticles too while you rub it in. It&#x27;s just great.</li>
            <li> Have the effect very much A week later after use The heel of the crack is resolved</li>
            <li> I work in a profession that requires a LOT of hand washing. I know it says for feet, but my knuckles are a happy recipient of this cream as well. Not really for daytime use, but a dab at night does wonders.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. Not exactly what I was looking for. Very thick, and too gooey. I personally wouldn&#x27;t get it again, as I am not crazy about the texture of it.</li>
            <li> Thank you&lt;br /&gt;I recommend a very good seller fast shipping good product.</li>
            <li> Calling this product a &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; is pretty misleading. It&#x27;s definitely more like a balm. When I opened the tube I thought it had gone bad because there is no cream quality to it. That&#x27;s the only reason for four stars. Otherwise, this &amp;#34;balm,&amp;#34; we&#x27;ll call it, is delightful!! Use it on dry feet at night and put on socks. I&#x27;ve used it four nights and there is a big difference in how my tootsies feel. Most certainly would recommend this project!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  My mother swears by it!  After a bath, she puts on this cream, then puts the socks (that came in her original kit) on.  Makes her feet so soft.  Sometimes she sleeps that way, amazing results!</li>
            <li> Does the trick on keeping my feet smelling good even after a long shoe-ful day.</li>
            <li> Like it! Emolient and aroma</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good and begins working immediately</li>
            <li> Grabbed this as a gift for my Mom &amp; she loves it.  If it gets the Mom stamp of approval then it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Little pricey in my opinion but the person I gave it to said it worked great on her feet.</li>
            <li> Better then lotion.  Its a bit messy and the instructions tell you to put it on and then socks over it.  You need to because it takes a while for it to soak in and stays moist.  I use this when I need something more to work on the tougher areas.</li>
            <li> So Far this is the only thing that has worked for me ever!! I am a Sandals 75% of the year, Loves being bare foot, Military wife always changing climates, who walks miles a day or is always up and running around either way kind of girl. I can not afford my feet to be slimy but the cracking gets so painful. I saw the reviews and was still even further amazed when I tried it. I have spent tons of money on stuff that stays gunky, slimy, makes me slide in my sandals, ect. But This Put it on at night with some socks by morning other than the sagey coconut smell you would never tell you but something that thick on. And in 1 use the cracks healed. My feet feel amazing and The smell is also very soothing. I love coconut! But you can smell the other herbs in it and it helps with the sleep. But is not powerful as to where you can not use it if you have a headache or potent smell sensitivity. I use it every other day now but I am sure I could use less. I just love the stuff!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Burt&#x27;s Bees consumer for several years, and this is bar none my favorite BB product.  I have really dry feet, and live in a dry area.  One coat of this stuff, and my feet are noticeably less scaly and soft; regular use, and my feet stay supple.  And it only takes a little squeeze - a pea-sized amount is all I need for each foot.  One tube lasts me 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> It is ok.  Suggested by a Massage Therapist,  I find it very heavy and does not absorb well.</li>
            <li> Really works well for dry feet</li>
            <li> This is great, my feet are silky soft after just a few days of use.  I have tried other cocomut creme products without much success. One product you had to rub in and rub in so it would exfoliate everything off your feet.  That&#x27;s great if yo have 30 minutes and the steam to rub your feet to dry and flaking.&lt;br /&gt;This product has the bees wax base which makes it a very smooth application. I followed the directions, rubbed it on my feet at night, wore cotton socks. It was silky smooth going on and my feet are now silky smooth after 3 applications! Great Product!</li>
            <li> hands down the best foot cream ever.  my feet are so soft now. it took about a month to work if you use it every day.  also it smells great so if you have foot odor this will also take care of it</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few OTC creams but this was the first and only thing that worked so quickly and well.  Friends had recommended it to me and I would highly recommend it to others. Alas, relief!</li>
            <li> This is hand&#x27;s down the best cream I have used.</li>
            <li> This is the Best Product I have ever used one my feet, I will use the for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> My mom is going through chemotherapy. One of the side effects of her treatment has been cracked and dead skin in her feet. I mean nothing helped her. Even her doctors prescribed some medication that did not work at all. Finally, I decided to take her this cream when I visited her overseas. It was just a miracle that her foot improved significantly in a day after starting to use this cream. Within three days, most dead skin were gone and finally a week later it seems that her foot is recovered 90%. She is so relieved and happy. İ am glad that İ could find her a cure that is also 99.6% natural. Thank you Burt!!</li>
            <li> Smells great but is incredibly greasy and did nothing to help soften or condition my feet. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Graet foot lotion. Love it</li>
            <li> nothing else compares to this.</li>
            <li> I generally like Burt&#x27;s Bees products and wanted to het help for my dry feet. It eased the dryness but doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb very quickly and felt too greasy.  If it had a different feel it would give it a higher rating.</li>
            <li> The product says its a cream but should really be labeled as a balm. It is way too greasy, sticky and uncomfortable on your feet and does not provide enough moisture.</li>
            <li> Very strong coconut flavor. Very moist, absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this foot creme.  I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and my feet have become so much more dry especially in the winter months.  It doesn&#x27;t help that I live in Minnesota.  The past few winters my heels have become so bad that they have actually cracked and oh boy! That really hurts!  Every step I take the crack splits a little and it just hurts.  I decided to make war on my dry heels and this was one of my first purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;l love that Burt&#x27;s Bees uses primarily natural ingredients.  I have been going much more natural these days so that is a necessity for me.  I also love the smell iod this creme!  The peppermint and coconut smells sweet and it almost tempts me to give it a lick.  Lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the idea of wearing socks to bed though.  I have never done that and was hoping I could get by without having to do this.  However, this creme is like thick honey and you really do need to wear the socks.  After the first couple of nights I got used to it and my feet actually prefer the warmth on these cold nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feet have become so much more soft.  I do need to use a callouse remover while in the shower to shave the dead skin away, but this creme helps to soften it so that it is easier to use the Ped Egg (the callous remover - check it out if you don&#x27;t have one) and shave it off.  I haven&#x27;t had cracked heels since starting this regime.  I use it 2-3 nights per week.</li>
            <li> This foot cream smells great and relaxes my feet after a hard day at work.  For the price, you can&#x27;t do better.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and smells good too. Recommend using a foot file for dead skin first.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and live in MN where the winters get cold and the air really dry &#x3D; extra dry skin in the winter.  I have always had troubles with dry skin, but of course, in the winter it gets so much worse.  Last year for the first time in my life, the heels on my feet actually cracked.  I had no idea how painful this can be.  From then on I have decided to do whatever I can to avoid this problem in the future which lead me to buying an assortment of extra intense moisturizers.  This buy far was the best and I continue to buy it.  It is super thick and kind of like Vaseline, but thicker than that.  You apply it before going to bed and need to wear socks with it which at first isn&#x27;t something I wanted to do, but I got over that real quickly when I saw the results.  I also love the smell of it - peppermint.  This is going to sound a little weird, but it doesn&#x27;t taste bad either.  LOL!  Not that I intended to taste it.....  After putting some on my feet I picked up my cup and when I drank out of it I must have touched the area my lips came into contact with because I could taste it a little bit.  Nothing chemically.  I love the fact that this is Burt&#x27;s Bees and that they use natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other items I have tried:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heel tastic Intensive Therapy - I like that it is in a tube, like a big fat chapstick and you can &amp;#34;roll&amp;#34; it on your feet, but just didn&#x27;t do much for me.  Also, I don&#x27;t like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;O&#x27;Keefes Healthy Feet/Working Hands - It soaks into your skin really quickly.  I like it for my hands during the day, but still wasn&#x27;t as great as Burt&#x27;s Bees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ProLinc Calous Remover - I highly recommend!!!!!  This is a fantastic product to use to help get the dry thick skin off your feet - whatever the season.  You use it while showering - best to do it after you&#x27;ve been in there for a while and your skin is softened.  Put it on your feet and use a pumice stone (or preferably a Ped Egg).  I did find out the hard waythough that if I use it after my feet are already cracked it is going to cause them to crack even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smith and Nephew Moisturizing Cream - I first tried this lotion when in the hospital after a surgery.  This is an amazing thick lotion - a dense cream.  I love this for my body, but still prefer Burt&#x27;s Bees overnight foot cream to intensely moisturize my poor heals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have continued to use Burt&#x27;s Bees foot cream this winter (usually every other night) and haven&#x27;t had a single crack in my heels!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable-so great for healing dry cracked heels. Worked in less than a week - I highly recommend. ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on rashes and dry spots all over my skin. I remember being told or reading about the anti fungal anti bacterial properties of coconut oil, which is why I decided to try it on an all over body rash / allergic hives. It worked wonders.  My only complaint is that it is so sticky and gooey, but that&#x27;s a tradeoff for a product that works really well.</li>
            <li> rich, thick and wonderful</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with dry, cracked feet year-round for as long as I can remember, and becoming a runner only exacerbated the problem.  I have tried all kinds of regular body lotions as well as specialized lotions for extra dry skin or for feet, but nothing ever seemed to make much of a difference.  Then I was given a sample of this coconut foot cream as part of a gift set, and now I will never put anything else on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have mentioned, the texture is more like an ointment than a cream.  Because it contains oils and glycerin, it IS greasy.  Some people like the scent, I feel kind of &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; about it.  But the most important thing to me is that it WORKS.  I put a small amount on each foot in the morning after I shower, making sure to massage it underneath and between each toe (and since it takes only a small amount, the 4-oz tube lasts for months!).  I allow it to dry for a couple of minutes before I put on socks.  If you were going to wear sandals or go without socks, you might want to let it soak in a little longer or dab your feet with a towel before putting on footwear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended it to my mother (from whom I inherited my bad feet), and she has had the same amazing results.  The skin on our feet is now soft and pink rather than rough, cracked, and covered with dry white lines.  Give it a try, and I hope you will be equally delighted.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I use it every day.  My feet are in great shape.  Even my doctor noticed and asked what I do to keep them is such shape.</li>
            <li> This should not be called a cream....it has a horrible oily consistency.  I was very disappointed.  I will not be able to use this product and I&#x27;m sorry that I ordered it.</li>
            <li> It workes great,It smells very good but is kind of greasy.Love that it has vitamin E in it.It smells like coconuts which i love the smell of coconuts.I used as it said.I took a bath and rub on my feet and put cotton socks on.Next morning my heels looked so much better wasn&#x27;t all cracky,They was so soft.I recieved a discount code for in exchange for my honest review.I would recommend to everyone that has cracked heels.This is truly a blessing to my feet.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this product. It&#x27;s good as a moisturizer, although not amazing in my experience. And it does leave your feet greasy, as the reviews say. It is not so much a creme as a salve, as another reviewer mentioned. But it&#x27;s solidly good, and the scent puts it ahead of other products for me at least.</li>
            <li> This foot cream has transformed my feet.  They are now soft and feel wonderful.  I love the fact that the ingredients are natural, too.  I consider this foot cream to be a staple in my bathroom....I will use no other foot cream after using this.  As a hint, I take an amount about the size of a large pea and mix it with a small bit of regular Burt&#x27;s Bees lotion and spread it over my feet.  The little bit of regular lotion mixes well with the coconut foot cream and it spreads around easier.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This product is very reasonably priced compared to other options on the market. The fragrance is actually appealing, not medicinal. Having some good results on my cracked heels.</li>
            <li> I did like this foot balm. I looked at the ingredients and thought it would be more moisturizing seemed to dry out my heels.</li>
            <li> I have tried many foot cremes but this is the best.  A little goes a long way.  I put it on after a bath, followed by socks to hold it in and let the warmth soak it in.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend bare feet right after applying, as it&#x27;s slippery.  The effects last hours longer than the competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this really improved the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is super effective at softening the feet and especially heels. I follow the directions on the label, slathering on and wearing socks to bed. That said, the texture, which is kind of like first aid ointment, is not a pleasure to rub in, like a body butter or other lotion would be. In fact, I usually go rinse my hands off after applying.  But, since my aim is to have soft feet, I will continue to use it because it works so well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soothing but the oil stays on the skin for quite a while. For some that might be beneficial but I think I will return to the peppermint with its cooling effect.  I guess I can see why the coconut (judging on 4.3 oz. tubes) sells at a notably lower price.</li>
            <li> Kinda sticky at first, I put on socks after applying.</li>
            <li> Great price and quality! Works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;Use it at night with a pair of cotton socks.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is sticky, but it really works. Lather on your feet and def put on a pair of sucks otherwise everything will stick to it</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter but I have used it a couple of times and this really smooths rough dry heels.</li>
            <li> Good but kinda greasy</li>
            <li> This cream is so wonderful for my dry feet.  I only use a small drop per foot daily and it adds moisture as it heals.  I&#x27;m a life long fan of Burt&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> Great foot cream, gets rid of those ugly cracked heels and soothes your feet after a long hard day.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff! Airflow goes a long way! I had my bottle for 6 months and this is a great price.</li>
            <li> This is more like a rather fluid ointment then a creme. It&#x27;s a bit sticky, smells rather strong and has worked well for me. Personally, I like the smell. I followed the recommendation of putting on socks after applying it. It&#x27;s worked better than lotion to relieve dry areas.</li>
            <li> My feet love this foot creme.  I put it on at the end of an active day (hiking, working in the yard, etc.) after a shower and then put socks over my feet until I go to bed.  My feet feel soft and young after each time I use this.  It smells good, too.</li>
            <li> Highly effective, wonderful fragrance, and affordable.  I wish I had known about Burt&#x27;s Bees when I started working in 2001.  I&#x27;ve tolerated beat up and calloused feet since far too long, and it was completely unnecessary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to rub this on to my feet just before bed; just be sure to wear socks when you sleep!  It&#x27;s amazing how effective this stuff is after just 3 or 4 nights.  Regular use has nearly restored my feet to their youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it!</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Very little goes a long way with this stuff, more so than other lotions and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Very thick this is what you need for repairing intensely dry or cracked feet.  I wouldn&#x27;t use this as a daily moisturizer for that get the Burts bees peppermint foot creme</li>
            <li> Yes, it is greasy. The consistency is more like Vaseline than it is like creme. So if you don&#x27;t like that, you won&#x27;t enjoy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the smell is wonderful - coconut and mint mostly. And I love it for my hands, especially around the dry cuticles and feet too. The best way I have found to use it is after a serious removal of dead skin around my heels, etc. in the bath or shower. Dry feet lightly and apply. Put your socks on and go! Your feet will smell so good and be lovely and soft after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of it&#x27;s oiliness, I wouldn&#x27;t put this on so much for summer time when I am wearing sandals, unless I had some time for it to sink in before going out - otherwise, I think it would attract dirt a bit. Also wouldn&#x27;t wear it in sandals that have the suede-like lining, as I think it would stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With those caveats, this is my favourite food treatment. And Burt&#x27;s Bees is fantastic for not over-packaging their products!</li>
            <li> Smells nice. Not too greasy. Hope it works. Will update in a week.</li>
            <li> My wife liked it as it was a stocking stuffer for Christmas. She asked me to order more. She says her feet feel better after using it. I have not used it so I can not comment on whether or not it is effective. I am a man. Men do not use foot creams. Ever.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Coconut Foot Creme ACTUALLY WORKS!!!  My extraordinarily rough, scratchy feet barely responded to a pumice stone, so I didn&#x27;t hold out hope with this creme.  My daughter had it so I tried it.  I saw a huge difference overnight!  My feet (I used the pumice stone first) no longer feel like sandpaper.  Before this creme, I would feel the sheets get caught on sharp, dry pieces of my heels.  I no longer believe there is much &amp;#34;truth in advertising&amp;#34;, so it is great to be able to have this venue to recommend or warn people about products.  I RECOMMEND THIS!</li>
            <li> My feet never smelled so good and soft!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so although it can be pricey in some stores it is well worth the money. I&#x27;m prone to cracked heels (especially in the winter), and have tried a lot of different products. This is the only one that consistently works. I put socks on after rubbing some into my feet (either during the day or overnight), and it really helps keep my heels from cracking.</li>
            <li> I like this cream for my feet. Has a nice smell to it. I put it on my feet and put on my socks work boots and go to work with this cream on my feet. I am on my feet for over 8 hours wearing red wing boots. The cream does not feel greasy or anything while at work. When I get home take off my boots and socks my feet feel so much softer. I do this about once a week and my feet stay smother for that week. Will buy again :)</li>
            <li> It irritates me that this is an ointment, rather than a cream/lotion as it&#x27;s listed. I hate ointments and the greasiness it leaves my hands and/or feet when I apply it, so I try to stay clear of that. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it works or not, but I don&#x27;t want to give it a try.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical. Both me and my sister use it and our feet are as soft as can be. Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit too greasy for me but the smell is really nice. I wanted to get rid of some cracks in my heels and unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work at the long run but it solved the problem for a couple of days before the cracks reappeared. I&#x27;ve been using O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s healthy creme now and it&#x27;s been working so well that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Love this thick cream for dry feet!</li>
            <li> Great foot cream. The best</li>
            <li> I had bad cracks and they didn&#x27;t go away with scrubbing and other oils such as sesame and coconut. I used this product and it healed the cracks overnight! Now I use it every night. Definitely recommend it! It smells nice too!</li>
            <li> It works!  Only requires a few nights of use to be effective.  Nice coconut smell.  But don&#x27;t expect the cr&amp;egrave;me to be a silky smooth, experience.  The consistency is more like a thick tacky gel.  But it works.  If you are serious about treating cracked heels and dry feet, this product will do the job.</li>
            <li> It seems good,and I hope it will helpful.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this. It is the only foot cream that will take your feet back to feeling like a babies foot. I put it on every night before I get in bed.</li>
            <li> Great creme, love the scent. Really stays on the foot, just massage into foot then put on socks and go.</li>
            <li> I wa ssurprised this wasn&#x27;t creamy colored, but rather looks like brown petroleum jelly (translucent).  I didn&#x27;t mind, but was surprised.  It goes on very smoothly, smells great, and absorbs well.  I keep it on the edge of my tub to put on as I get out of the tub after using a pummice stone on my heels and big toe joint.  If i coudl find it in trial size I could get it for my travel bag... instead I use hotel body lotion which while great, not natural or as good for my feet.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  I only need to apply once a day and my feet are soft.  I have also used it on my elbows, and other extremely dry areas of skin with the same results.  The only downside is that is oily, so be sure to use it with socks. It also has a nice scent to help with sweaty feet.</li>
            <li> If you like a coconut smell you will love this foot cream.  Note: It has a vaseline like texture and is not a creamy lotion texture.  I don&#x27;t mind this as it feels like it penetrates more deeply.  Nothing better than getting a foot rub with this creme!</li>
            <li> This is an ointment, not a cream .  Had I known that it was more like Vicks vapor rub I would not have purchased.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face, hands and feet at night. When I wake up everything feels great!</li>
            <li> I love this foot creme! Smells great and if you follow directions, it does a great job smoothing.  I also use it on my hands on occasion.</li>
            <li> I would give this product 10 stars if I could. Firstly, it works! I had calluses on both feet (that hurt) and this softened all of them after a few applications. It  absorbs well and has a nice aroma. I am VERY glad that I bought this product.</li>
            <li> If your feet are as soft and smooth as the day you were born, then this may not be for you.  If your feet are dry and calloused, you should give this a try. It is a heavy, ointment-like consistency.  I don&#x27;t find the smell to be unpleasant or pleasant.  I have an issue with the skin on my right foot.  My right foot is very dry and develops thick callouses.  My left foot doesn&#x27;t, oddly enough.  I have tried everything on my right foot because if I don&#x27;t tend to it fairly often, painful cracks develop on my heel.  So I put this cream on my right foot, not even right out of the shower or anything, and went to bed without socks.  The next evening I noticed that the callous on the bottom of my foot was separating from the normal skin, and after only a few days a lot of it is gone.  This stuff just loosens it up and it comes right off.  Love it.</li>
            <li> works great and is non greast</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this stuff.  I have really rough, calloused feet.  After my shower, I spread a little of this on my feet and then put on socks.  At first I thought it would feel gooshy and slippery but it doesn&#x27;t.  It soaks right into my skin.  My feet feel and look SO much better.  The coconut scent is yummy too. I&#x27;ve tried other foot creams and this is THE BEST.</li>
            <li> Feels great on the feet, and even my elbows which tend to get really dry.  You fee a slight warming sensation when you rub the creme in your hands first.</li>
            <li> I think I expected too much of the cream. I really wanted to like it. Sadly enough, other than liking the smell, this has turned out to be a dud for me. Weeks of  regular use (and yes, I actually wore socks in spite of the hot weather just to give this cream a chance) and there has been no visible effect on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Eucerin foot cream for a couple of days in between, and boy, that really works on my feet. Unfortunately, this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Nothing heals like this stuff.Normal hand creme (or even the fancy stuff) wont touch it for healing DEEP cracks on your feet. Or your hands. Stock up because it seems to be hard to get at times.</li>
            <li> I hate the texture of this. It smells great and moisturizes my feet well, but feels greasy and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t add anything to the many positive reviews shown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works for me, and it smells quite nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is thicker than Vaseline being thicker and similar to a golden honey color and thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it...you&#x27;ll like it !</li>
            <li> The best foot creme ever! I have used this product for several months. I&#x27;ve tried many of the popular brands including petroleum jelly, coconut oil, shea butter, the list goes on. I use it nightly after my shower and my feet are always ready for sandals or heels. The smell is not overbearing, but it will linger until the product fully absorbs.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me, but I may be overusing it. I love the smell and ingredients however.</li>
            <li> My feet have always been dry, and they crack easily. For a woman who loves to wear sandals, this isn&#x27;t a good thing. I started using Burt&#x27;s Bees Coconut Foot Crème, and I am so glad I did! When you order, you receive a 4.3 ounce tube of 99.4% natural foot cream. It rejuvenates dry feet with coconut oil. It refreshes your skin with naturally derived rosemary extracts. I use it in the morning after my shower, and apply it again at nighttime right before bed. I love how it absorbs easily and it leaves my feet feeling silky and smooth. I am pleased with this product, and I would definitely recommend it! *I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees! This Coconut Foot Creme is beyond Amazing! The heavenly scent will leave your feet smelling so good, and feeling so so so soft! I highly recommend! Burt&#x27;s Bees will forever be one of my favorite brands! R.I.P Burt thank you for the high quality amazing products you have made! The world is truly a better place because of your exsistance, you will be greatly missed!&lt;br /&gt;I received this Burt&#x27;s Bees Coconut Foot Creme at a discounted price for my honest, unbiased review, and opinion, and it was an Honor to do so! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I rub this onto my feet in the  morning before I put my sox on.  That way it blends into my skin.  Yes, and I will use it again.</li>
            <li> Had two broken bones in ankle so after months of the cast, the leg and foot were not in great condition. This product worked but was really &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34;. Used it short term and then transitioned to another product. The bottom line is that it works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the thick sticky consistency at all. It smells great, like coconut and honey. With consistent use and proper foot care this product does work and shows results after 1.5 to 2 months</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to feel about this foot creme that should be called foot vaseline.  On one hand it does a good job moisturizing my feet but on the other hand, the texture of it is too greasy and gel like.  The directions state that you should put on a pair of socks after applying this cream but I live in California where its hot most of the year and socks are just not going to cut it when I sleep.</li>
            <li> Thought it was better than it is, had a tiny sample, this does not seem the same.</li>
            <li> The cream is a bit greasy</li>
            <li> My mother don&#x27;t like the smell of it. But it&#x27;s good to her foots, I think so.</li>
            <li> I love using this foot cream.  It smells wonderful and is very thick and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Amazing  product. within 3-4days you will see the difference and I am not kidding. It is just amazing. First product I am reviewing.&lt;br /&gt;I have not seen a skin product make a difference in such short time.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I used Vaseline for my feet, I really needed some moistore. Vaseline didn&#x27;t give me that, but at least kept my body&#x27;s moisture for some time.This product makes my feet really soft! Unexpectedly. This is something u use before bed with socks on. If u don&#x27;t like sleeping with socks, then just use it an hour or so before bed. I love it! I could never imagine thee is something out there that would make wonders like this . Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> *****&lt;br /&gt;Wow, is this foot cream amazing! First of all, the scent is coconutt-y and peppermint-y, very luscious. It contains vegetable glycerin, olive oil, oat protein, lanolin, water, coconut oil (the real stuff!), tocopheral (vitamin E), peppermint oil, rosemary extract, and fragrance. It has a texture that is like Vaseline or petroleum jelly; however, the cr&amp;egrave;me is absorbed into your foot so that you don&#x27;t walk around with greasy feet all day. And it feels sooo good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a real treat to use this foot cr&amp;egrave;me to moisturize and just to pamper my poor callused, pummeled feet. The directions say to put it on your feet before bed and to then to wear cotton socks. Since I don&#x27;t wear socks to bed, I&#x27;ve just put the foot creme on after my bath in the morning and I&#x27;ve had wonderful results. I wait about 5 minutes for it to soak in and just r-e-l-a-x.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s Bees Coconut Foot Cr&amp;egrave;me is not tested on animals. A little goes a long way, and a small amount will last forever, making it a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended---the best!&lt;br /&gt;*****</li>
            <li> the foot balm is amazing,my father likes it sooo much!</li>
            <li> If I could give this product more than five stars, I would.  There are no weird fragrances or ingredients. I struggle with dry skin, especially on my hands and feet in the wintertime. THis is the only thing that adequately hydrates my skin!</li>
            <li> The problem I have with this product is that it contains soya and canola oils. Both of which are GMO products.&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t like the overly strong synthetic fragrance. If marketing a &#x27;natural product&#x27; then at least use Non-GMO ingredients and natural fragrances rather than synthetic chemicals. Too bad Burt&#x27;s Bees sold out to Clorox. The quality and genuine naturalness of this product line has gone south since the sale of the company. As a previous loyal Burt&#x27;s Bees customer, I&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li> Best foot hydration there is. Almost everyone needs some extra smoothness in the winter and this is perfect for.dried cracked feet. Slather it on put your socks on and go. Smooth soft feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this stuff twice and it works. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend any other product. I&#x27;ve tried them all and this one works the best. It even smells good. I put it on when I get out of the shower and it simply works.</li>
            <li> My feet get ugly dry in the winter, but this foot creme works wonders.  I slather it on, yes slather, and then put soft socks on before I go to bed.  This keeps my feet nice and pretty throughout the harsh winter months.</li>
            <li> I bought it for the second time. The quality is still good.</li>
            <li> I tried this at my daughters house and like the way it kept my heels soft.</li>
            <li> Feels like you&#x27;re rubbing honey or molasses on your feet. I was looking for a thick &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; like lotion, so I returned.</li>
            <li> I live near the beach and spend hours walking by the shore barefoot. My feet are not a pretty sight unless dry and rough look good to you. They also itch like crazy. I use this daily after I thoroughly wash my feet with peppermint soap. I massage this into my clean feet and then put on soft cotton socks.&lt;br /&gt;This works well and restores the moisture and keeps my feet soft. It has a wonderful coconut scent which I absolutely love. As a regular user I totally recommend this foot cream for its effectiveness and wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> My daughter love it very much.Every time showered ,she wanna it for fun and  let us kiss her feet.She is only 1+years old ,it&#x27;s worth .</li>
            <li> Good product good brand-name good price</li>
            <li> This is very greasy and difficult to remove from my hands.</li>
            <li> For 15 years I have tried so many different foot cremes - I have very rough heels, and this is the only thing that works.  It keeps my feet smooth for almost a week.  Just be careful that you don&#x27;t walk around on anything slippery, it leaves footprints and you&#x27;ll fall down.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on some recommendations, and I was highly disappointed with this product. It smelt like acrid coconut. Its color is a stale brown, not a nice &#x27;creme&#x27; color. Its consistency is not a crème but a gooooey slime. I threw it out almost immediately after I tried it, maybe I got a bad tube of it?</li>
            <li> This is my favorite foot cream. My feet stay refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. I agree with others in that its consistency is similar to a slightly more viscous Vaseline. However, the scent is really nice, at least to me, as it&#x27;s an interesting combination of mint and coconut. I only use this a few times a week, but when I do, I layer it on generously and then put on socks for the night.</li>
            <li> Never disappointed with this provider</li>
            <li> I have tried various products to soften up my feet but this one is the only one that worked incredibly well, and after only two nights!</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST FOOT CREAM I LOVE WITH NO TOXIC INGREDIENTS..&lt;br /&gt;IT WORKS VERY WELL, TO USE AT NIGHT UNDER SOCKS TO SLEEP IN..&lt;br /&gt;AND IT IS WONDERFUL..</li>
            <li> Best thing ever for dry cracked feet. BUT be warned it has a consistency similar to Vaseline so you have to be a little careful where you put your feet right after applying it.</li>
            <li> Smells good, have kind of impulse to want to eat it</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT CREAM FOR FOOT.  THIS IS MY SECOND ORDER.</li>
            <li> I also use Burt&#x27;s Bees Peppermint Foot Creme -- this one at night, that one in the daytime. I cannot decide which formula I prefer, because they&#x27;re both so perfect. The peppermint foot creme obviously smells great, but the coconut creme has a consistency which is thicker and more luxurious, hence why I use it to nourish my feet at night. So I figure -- why choose one or the other when you can use both!</li>
            <li> My heels get dry in the summer. Living by the beach in year around flip flops meant dry cracked heels. I use  [[ASIN:B00113FENI Ped Egg Pedicure Foot File, Colors may vary]] and [[ASIN:B0000Y3FQC Diamancel Tough Buffer #11]] to keep them under control. I was looking for additional softening. This had great reviews and it was all natural. What more could I ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it&#x27;s not a &#x27;creme.&#x27; It&#x27;s more an ointment, or thick, greasy gel. It has the consistency of a thick vaseline with a touch of fine grit. It&#x27;s brownish clear with flecks. I was expecting a coconut fragrance. To me, it smells faintly of pet urine with a touch of mint. But my feet are far from my nose, so I gave it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the grit was to slough off dead skin, but it&#x27;s too fine. I think it&#x27;s the oat powder. You put the stuff on at night, the grease gets absorbed (I suspect it&#x27;s absorbed into my socks, not my feet) and what&#x27;s left is a fine powder. The next morning, your hands slide smoothly over your feet and you think they&#x27;re softer, but I think they&#x27;re just sliding over powder residue. Imagine putting a tiny bit of baby powder on your foot, and sliding your hand over it. I did not notice any softening effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three stars for the pee smelling gunk are for the fact that it&#x27;s natural ingredients. Also, the stuff is so thick and greasy that it forces you to massage your feet for a while, and pampering feels really good. I think for that reason alone, I will use what i have left.</li>
            <li> Burts Bees Coconut foot creme arrived in perfect condition. This stuff works like no other for me. I have used it for 3 years and it keeps heels smooth and crack free year round.&lt;br /&gt;speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> Much better than different ways as soak in water for hours or chip off dry skin. Easy to apply with the foot creme of Coconut.</li>
            <li> I love anything coconut, especially when it really works!  It really makes my feet feel great!  It is very moisturizing, and makes my feet really soft &amp; supple!  I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Absolutely The Best Product on the Market</li>
            <li> Best cream ever. It works fast and leave my feet very soft. Works like no other cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It is a bit messy but It works really well. I use it when I put on my work-out socks before I exercise. I love the  aroma of the coconut foot creme.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm on my feet. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this foot cream -- it takes a little while to soak into the soles of my feet, but because it takes a little longer than many of the creams out there, it seems to last a little longer too. The only suggestion I would have is to put it on just as you are turning in for the night - if you are anything like me, the last thing you need is to get coconut creamy footprints all over the floor. :)</li>
            <li> Smells delicious; dries super gross.  It&#x27;s like a sticky, grainy, greasy texture.  Won&#x27;t purchase again.  It&#x27;s a miss, Burt.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and makes my feet super soft.  I wear it before bed and then put socks on, and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past couple of years and I love how my feet look like now. I walk barefoot a lot in my backyard so this works great.</li>
            <li> We rubbed this everywhere, it&#x27;s even good for diaper rash. It heals hands, good for rubbing on your back (for massage) all kinds of stuff, very great product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I had cracks in my heals. Even getting regular pedicures did not help. This product is helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Very effective&lt;br /&gt;Easy to dispense&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It is not a cream, it is an emollient&lt;br /&gt;Consistency makes it feel like you need to use a lot</li>
            <li> Goes on very greasy, must put on a sock, but my feet are so lovely!</li>
            <li> The best foot cream. Smells great, and leaves your feet smooth.</li>
            <li> I wish I used this more regularly… when I put this on at night with socks, my feet are noticeably softer the next day. Strong scent, but not offensive. It&#x27;s necessary to wash your hands after applying as it&#x27;s pretty thick, and clingy creme… but overall it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> This is the best foot creme I have EVER used! Alhough it is more like a salve than a creme, it is not petroleum based, so I am very happy with this.</li>
            <li> Mmmm I love this stuff.  It smells and feels good.  My feet are nice and soft.  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The texture of this creme is not what I imagined. Not creamy, more gel like. But the stuff works really well. I also put this on my rough knuckles on my hands and it has helped that.</li>
            <li> I really do like Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and this foot creme received overwhelmingly good reviews.  I am usually a positive reviewer, and I attempt to find redeeming qualities even of things I was not keen on.  Sadly, I am unable to do so with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize this goes against the great majority of reviewers, but I could not stand the smell.  It immediately reminded me of a medicinal cream my mom used on us kids years ago.  I wish I could remember the name of it, but I think it&#x27;s one of those memories not meant to ever resurface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an ointment, not a creme.  If you slightly diluted Vaseline and added a bit of fine grit to it, you&#x27;d have something very similar to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not absorb even after several minutes of rubbing it in.  As instructed, I did wear socks all night (yuck!).  And really, you must wear socks because you WILL be channeling your inner figure skater on any non-carpeted surface.  I cannot fathom trying to clean the greasy footprints that would result from not wearing socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, it took a bit of forceful loofah-ing with soap to fully remove the residue.  I&#x27;m fairly certain the socks absorbed far more product than my feet did.  It took two washings with Tide and softener to remove the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased Gold Bond Ultimate Softening Food Cream with Shea Butter.  Without question, the product is far superior in every respect.</li>
            <li> My favorite foot cream. Actually it is more like a salve. Thick, thick thick. You need only a little bit. Nice soothing feeling. I put it on at night and sleep with socks on. Too thick to wear in high heel sandals. My feet just slide forward.</li>
            <li> HAVE NEVER USED A PRODUCT SPECIFICALLY FOR MY FEET.  WELL, THIS PRODUCT HAS SOFTENED MY HARD, BRITTLE SOLES, AS WELL AS OF THE FRONT AND BACK.  IN A COUPLE OF DAYS HAVE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT</li>
            <li> I put this on my feet before bed every night after pumicing in the shower.  It keeps my feet soft. It is not greasy, and smells nice.  Its also a natural product that I feel good about using on my skin.</li>
            <li> Given all the positive reviews, I have to say I was really disappointed of this product. It&#x27;s oily, hard to absorb, but also dries out quickly making your feet even drier. Definitely not going to recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I started using this stuff in earnest after my pregnancy, which basically left me with dragon paws at the ends of my legs.  I try to do the full routine--bath, foot file, then the foot creme--but even when I can only put the creme on under a pair of socks, it does noticeably soften my feet a bit.  It&#x27;s definitely very oily, so you want to have your socks right at hand to put on as soon as you finish rubbing it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent has a minty element to it, although the coconut is also discernible.  That doesn&#x27;t SOUND like a nice combination, but it works somehow. There&#x27;s also a little bit of grit in it, to help emolliate I assume, but it&#x27;s not like a scrub or anything.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cream. It works especially well if I put it on my feet after a shower and then put on socks. My only complaint is with the tube which maintains its shape even if you&#x27;re almost out of the product. I&#x27;ve gone through several tubes over the years and especially when you&#x27;re near the end, it&#x27;s hard to control how much cream comes out. It&#x27;s very difficult to just dispense a little.</li>
            <li> Leaves a strange greasy feeling, not a fan of this product, but love the Burts Bees line overall,  Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> The edge/palm of my hand below the little finger became dry, hard and rough (not usual for me).  My wife had a tube of this on the bureau and suggested I try it.  It was like magic.  I put it on the dry area a couple of days in a row.  It corrected the problem so quickly and completely I forgot I&#x27;d had the problem.  Several months later an area on the side of my foot got like this and was beginning to crack.  Same routine, same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not really a cream, it&#x27;s more like a salve.  It&#x27;s the color and consistency of honey when putting it on, but soaks in/disappears fairly quickly. It does have a rather loud but not unpleasant smell which goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a hard, dry area of skin, give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best foot creams I have ever tried.  I wear pumps (and no socks) for work and flip flops and flats on the weekends almost exclusively which results in me never wearing socks.  The heels of my feet get calloused and roughed.  After applying this product to a freshly washed and pumiced foot, I feel like there is immediate improvement in the skin softness.  The cream is not &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; -like.  It is not white in color or creamy in feel.  Rather, it&#x27;s sort of a honey/amber color and oily.  There is coconut oil in the product but a lot of lanolin too, which explains the consistency.  Once on the foot, your foot can get a little greasy as it absorbs.  I&#x27;ve seen my foot prints on hardwood floors.  The best thing to do is to put on some indoor shoes or a pair of socks.  Seriously, by the next day, the foot looks much better - even on my husband&#x27;s man feet!  With regular use, I think it seems the skin supple and the rough skin patches at bay.</li>
            <li> My favourite foot cream for winter for several seasons now. It works well and has delightful aroma! Best treat for dry feet! )</li>
            <li> I love Burt Bees products.  They do what they claim to do.  I like the smell and the results I receive when I use this foot cream.</li>
            <li> Lather this on and put on your comfiest socks and your feet will thank you. I&#x27;m on my feet all day and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found to pamper my achy feet and keep them soft. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful foot creme!  It helps so much with dry cracked skin.  I do like the scent, however I wish it wasn&#x27;t quite so potent as my daughter hates the smell.  She cringes when I sit next to her after applying it to my feet as she can smell it right away.  I also prefer that products I use on my body aren&#x27;t so overpowering that others have to smell it as well.&lt;br /&gt;However it does the job and I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Great product again from Burt&#x27;s Bees.  This is not as much a creme as it is a very thick gel.  Use very little of this.  99% natural ingredients.  Incredible stuff, really is.  Just a dab and I was able to use it for a long time on each foot for my girlfriend.  Great smell, I really can&#x27;t say enough good about this.</li>
            <li> Works great and the dogs love it.</li>
            <li> Best foot creme I ever used. At the very beginning, I though it is too creamy.  But I saw Improvements of my feet just after the first night. Really love it!!</li>
            <li> Amazingly thick and keeps my feet and heels soft; need only a tiny amount</li>
            <li> Once a day and sometimes I can skip a day, hands down the best crème I have used for my disgusting calloused and previously cracked feet.  Having had problems with my feet for about 10-12 years, I have tried all kinds of foot creams. This one is heads above anything I have used, and here is why.&lt;br /&gt;First most creams if they worked at all had to be applied 3 - 4 times a day to cause any good improvement, and if I missed a day the reversal of skin condition was not only felt it was visible. I have to soak my feet once a week in tea tree oil, and then use a pumice stone, then I apply this product.  I had never been able to totally rid my feet of at least some nasty  places. Then when I started to use this product I noticed it was keeping my feet softer, and healing better than anything I had ever used. Eventually, after about 6 weeks of my soaking, tea tree oil and Burt&#x27;s Coconut Foot Crème regime ---- for the first time in years and years ALL of my foot surface, toes, heels, ankles were as soft and smooth as my 2 year old grand daughters feet. What a blessing and relief and so nice not to have those ugly, embarrassing feet to hide in the summer.  And to be able to touch my hubbies feet with my bare feet without fear of what he thought.&lt;br /&gt;I find this cream to be greasy, and after I use it I put my feet up and don&#x27;t walk at all until all the crème is soaked in, about an hour to and hour and a half. Of course this will depend on how much you use. I really lay it on thick about 2 days out of the week and the other 5 days use less and rub it in really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works its magic really well on dry elbows and knees  quickly restoring soft, supple skin in those area as well. As long as Burt&#x27;s Bees does not change its non chemical formula they have at least one customer for life with this product.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with this foot cream at all.  I give it three stars simply because I get similar results from using store brand cocoa butter lotion (and for less money).</li>
            <li> Love this foot creme.  It&#x27;s very thick and stays on longer than any other creme I used before.  The smell is very subtle and not overpowering.  I always have this handy all year long, because my hands and foot are always dry and cracks.  I use this for my hands and foot and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> My feet have always been really dry with deep cracks. Most lotions just don&#x27;t seem to provide enough moisture to really make a difference but this stuff is fantastic. I was really surprised when I opened it though because I was expecting a thick, white cream but it&#x27;s completely different... the closest comparison I could make of the consistency is a mix of honey and Vaseline. It&#x27;s very thick &amp; a little sticky but I&#x27;ve found that if I press it to my foot and wait a few seconds before spreading it, it&#x27;ll heat up and spread very well. As others have said, it&#x27;s not something you&#x27;re going to put on before going out but it will really help with dry or cracked feet. I put it on in bed and then put socks on before going to bed. By the morning, my skin has absorbed it and when I take off the socks, my feet are softer and aren&#x27;t sticky. I have had a couple of mornings where some sticky residue was left but usually I don&#x27;t. This has an amazing coconut scent too which is great to smell each evening as I get ready for bed. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product and its results.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with coconuts. I used to use coconut oil on my feet, but have switched to this. I use it 2-3 times a week at night and exfoliate with a pumice stone. My feet are softer than ever.</li>
            <li> This is much thicker than expected, but works well, definitely use it with socks or you&#x27;ll get fibers stuck on your feet and the gel-like cream on the floor! The smell is delicious, I can smell it even when walking or sitting around &#x3D;) After consistent use my feet have been made heavenly.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time on my feet, which get a bit rough from going barefoot around the house</li>
            <li> This is the best thing ever to put onto your feet since socks.  You only thought you liked foot massages.  Trust me, you haven&#x27;t even had one yet.</li>
            <li> This works well, and I also use it on my hands from time to time.  It is a bit &amp;#34;fragrant&amp;#34;, but at least it is coconut, and not old-lady floral.</li>
            <li> great!!!very very  nice!!!I like it!!!</li>
            <li> very oily and has a odd smell, nothing like coconut</li>
            <li> Love it, good product</li>
            <li> Bought this because of the name, Burt&#x27;s Bees, and I will basically try ANYTHING with coconut!  Great product!</li>
            <li> If you have dry, cracked skin on your feet, Burt&#x27;s Bees Coconut Foot Cr&amp;egrave;me is one you might want to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is very rich and soothing and has a pleasant smell too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is greasy though and when I use it on my feet, I usually apply it at night and then pull on some thin socks to wear overnight, so that it can absorb thoroughly. Unlike a lot of lotions and creams, this really does make a significant improvement in the look of your feet, and in a relatively short period of time too. Great to use all year round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read my full review of this product at: myreallifereviews  .  com</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any horrible, deep cracks on my feet that needed intensive care.  I was just looking for a product that would soften my feet and help them look their best for sandal/pedicure season (FL gal here!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not overwhelming; I find it pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very greasy and sticky.  I wish I had thought to wear two pairs of socks the first night because it leaked through one pair of thinner socks and stained my favorite, expensive sheet set.  (That was my own fault, I&#x27;m not blaming the product!  Just a friendly warning if you&#x27;re attached to your sheets and you apply liberally.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t really help my dry heels too much, but I *love* it for my hands.  I&#x27;ve been using it every night for a week on both my hands and feet along with Burt Bee&#x27;s cuticle cream on my nails/cuticles.  My hands look amazing and feel so soft.  I&#x27;m ordering a couple tubes to use for an overnight hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still looking for a product to help my heels look perfect for girls day spa/pedis and beach trips.  I&#x27;m giving it four stars because it didn&#x27;t help my heel dryness.  It would have gotten five stars for an overnight *hand* cream.</li>
            <li> I am a fan!  This really works if you use it regularly .....I have heard that using just coconut oil will do the same thing.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with Burt&#x27;s Bees products!  My adult children are runners....and I knew this would be very good for their feet!  Not to my surprise, it is something they buy for themselves!</li>
            <li> This was what i was looking for and it works really well. i will definitely recommend to others. love it!</li>
            <li> I like Burt&#x27;s Bees products because they are natural and was hoping for good results with this foot cream. I don&#x27;t think I would be purchasing it again. I did not find that it helped a whole bunch on softening my feet as much as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom as one of her stocking stuffers.  She loves is!  Smells really good and very moisturizing.  Would buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Husband uses this as his heels crack and this prevents the cracking.</li>
            <li> The skin around my heels was beginning to crack.  I like Burt&#x27;s Bees products, so I decided to give this a try.  It works well, leaves your feet noticeably softer, and they smell good.  Be sure to put on socks, as it takes a while for the oils to soak in.</li>
            <li> I use my tube of burts bees coconut foot creme once in awhile. I would say, dont let the name fool you. It&#x27;s not very \\&quot;creamy\\&quot;, more like a salve in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me of heavily scented petroleum jelly. The coconut smell is minty too, but not unpleasant. Noticeable from a far. I only use this creme at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it didnt absorb fast, and left my feet feeling greasy &amp; sticky until I wiped it off. However, it did leave my feet soft and smooth. I suppose if you don&#x27;t mind doing a spa day with this you might enjoy it. I would not suggest putting it on and then placing socks on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it works so well at moisturizing my feet I only deducted one star for the actual feeling and strong scent of the creme. It&#x27;s hard to find good products for feet, and this one is pretty good at the job it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> the oil is so greasy and leaves your feet so soft and it is very nice and good smell also</li>
            <li> I have awful dryness on my feet, due to my health issues and multiple medications.  Before trying this, I couldn&#x27;t find anything that would properly moisturize my rough, cracked soles.  A friend got this for me for Christmas in a gift set, and I had forgotten I had it, because I was certain that it was like every other cream I&#x27;ve tried.  I was wrong.  I used it for the first time this morning, and already my feet are softer and smoother.  It&#x27;s a little greasy, but I love it and I will definitely be using this from now on!</li>
            <li> I like how it is thick, but not as thick as I would hope, and pours a bit too much out of the tube. I suppose refrigerating it could help. Otherwise, great product as always by this company.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this product.  It smells nice, it does great things for my poor tired feet, makes them softer and revives them.</li>
            <li> The creme is super good.</li>
            <li> Too thick and waxy.  Didn&#x27;t feel refreshed from using the creme and didn&#x27;t dare walk on carpet or anything. Doesn&#x27;t smell as coconut-y as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products! It&#x27;s difficult to find safe and natural beauty products that actually perform. This is a must have for tired feet. It is such a luxurious treat, and it smells soooo good!! I like to slather it on my feet before bed and put on a pair of socks. In the morning your feet will feel incredible. It works on the driest cracked skin of the heels of your feet. It is just wonderful. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Can you say awesome! This Foot Cr&amp;egrave;me smell good and works. I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s Bees product for years and have never had any problems. This cr&amp;egrave;me absorbs well and like with most foot cr&amp;egrave;me you will need to use it every day for the best results.</li>
            <li> Gave these as gifts to my in-laws who I have dry feet.  The delivery was prompt and it arrived just in time to give them.  I love using this during the winter, wearing socks overnight after application to soften up my feet.  My feet smell great, too, with the coconut smell!  Highly recommend for those who want their feet to smell great and feel good!</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin. my doc said to use Nivea lotion. It is a great lotion.  I am a nurse and the hospitals supply it! But I had a tube of this in my purse and while the doc was out writing scripts, i put this on my hands and heels. She was amazed at how rapidly it worked. &amp;#34;And it smells good too,&amp;#34; she said. Unfortunately, with this and any other dry skin cream, it is not forever, but must be done one to two times daily. THEN, it does work and very well. I recommend it highly. It is kind of like Mikey and the cereal:  MY DOC LIKES IT..MUST BE GOOD!!!</li>
            <li> I continue to buy this for this old dancer&#x27;s cracked heels.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i have found that does the magic.</li>
            <li> Perfect for tired feet!! I put it on right before bed so that I don&#x27;t pick up dirt since it is a little greasy. Has a hint of menthol or something that is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Wonderful feeling of skin after it is applied.</li>
            <li> Great for softening ones calloused heels and ball of foot.  Recommend putting on cotton socks directly after applying it.</li>
            <li> I like a lot of burt&#x27;s bees products, but this isn&#x27;t one of them. It&#x27;s very greasy, doesn&#x27;t absorb well and is not very effective. I would never buy it again, or recommend it.</li>
            <li> Lately I have become a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; products.  When I saw this product on Amazon, I had to try it.  i&#x27;s great but a bit thick.  With winter coming,,I&#x27;m sure it will work out pretty well.</li>
            <li> Bought this foot creme after recent bouts with dry cracked heels. I did not notice any difference after daily repeated use. The product was not what I was expecting, it was greasy and gross. Left feet very sticky and did not smell of coconuts. I won&#x27;t be purchasing burts bees foot creme again, I found that straight coconut oil works much better.</li>
            <li> This is a very thick creme. It may feel greasy but it works! I recommend using before bed to give it a chance to soak in. Definitely helps those dry heels from wearing sandals.</li>
            <li> After years of trying foot creams to get through the cold and dry winters, I came upon Burt&#x27;s Bees Coconut Foot Creme.  I have shared it with friends and everyone is hooked on it.  It is the only foot creme I spend money for because it works.  It works almost overnight.  Best way to soften dry heels; lightly massage Burt&#x27;s Bees Creme into your whole foot, put on a light pair of 100% cotton socks and go to bed!  In the morning you will be amazed at the difference in just one application.  Keep using it.  CAUTION:  Make sure this is not on your feet when taking a shower.  A friend had followed the directions of applying, putting on sock and then went about her daily activities of cleaning house and decorating for the holidays.  At the end of the day she stepped into the shower and her foot slipped because she still had a layer of the creme that had not worn off (She probably used too much, it only takes a dine size amount) and went down.  End of story, she met some nice Firemen and had an interesting visit to the ER!  Don&#x27;t go around barefoot with any creme on your feet unless you are wearing socks or shoes.</li>
            <li> I received this in a gift basket and didn&#x27;t even know that I needed a specific product for my feet until I started using this. I put it on at night after I take a shower and then put socks. I&#x27;ve found that I get the best results when I sleep with my socks on overnight. I wake up and my feet feel amazing. Sometimes I use it on my hands in the winter if regular moisturizer isn&#x27;t doing the trick.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend swears by this stuff.  She has really dry cracked feet.  I bought her lots of different products, but nothing really worked except this.  It&#x27;s a bit on the oily side, so you have to take a break when you use it.  Rub it in, then go watch TV with your feet in the air.  She uses this regularly, and her feet are now soft and all the cracks are gone... normal feet!  She only has to use a tiny bit, so a tube lasts quite a long time.  Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this expecting a typical &amp;#34;Creme&amp;#34;, thick and white.  This is definitely NOT a creme, it is better described as an ointment.  That said, it is wonderful.  First, the smell is not too overwhelming.  I bought this because my husband hated the smell of the Rescue Me lemongrass foot cream I have been using for years.  He said it was &amp;#34;overpowering&amp;#34; (and I did have to put it on right before bed and stick my feet under the covers, so I can&#x27;t really fault his assessment). I decided that coconut would be a rather innocuous smell, as I am generally pretty scent sensitive.  I was very surprised by the consistency when I squeezed the first bit out of the tube, but as soon as it hit my first dry heel, I was sold.  It doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin right away, so I would only use it at night and definitely not before putting on sandals.  And they say to put cotton socks on over it, and I agree with that.  The first night I ignored that advice, and when I put my feet under the covers there was quite a bit of drag. Sort of like I had glue on my feet.  Putting socks on first fixed that problem.  I usually take the socks off sometime in the middle of the night because my feet get hot, and by that time they are fine. I have been using this stuff for less than a week, and the effect is very noticeable.  This is going to be a new part of my evening foot regimen.</li>
            <li> This product should be called foot repair cream, it has transformed my feet. All the dry, cracked skin has vanished and I have only been using it for one week. Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I feel very satisfied with this foot cream. It does it&#x27;s work.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars, as it&#x27;s the best for cracked and/or chapped heals.  I worked on making my feet, especially my heals looking good for spring to no avail until I used this creme.  It&#x27;s a very thick vaseline type creme, brown in color, and it does smell a bit like coconut.  I myself hate coconut smells, but this one does not bother me.  I literally put it on nice and thick, and then put a sock back on, and go to sleep.  The next morning, my feet and heals look perfect!  Don&#x27;t bother hiring a professional, just use this creme.  It also works on any part of your body that is dried or chapped or cracked.. I also use it on my hands.  Last winter, I had scrubbed the house so much with bleach water, I had blood that came to the surface of the pours on my hands.  At bedtime, I covered my hands with this creme, put on thin rubber type gloves, and in the morning, my hands not only looked completely healed, but they actually even looked younger.</li>
            <li> When I think of creme, I think of a thick lotion.  This foot creme is just a gooey gelatinous mess.  It smells fantastic, but I only used it once after feeling how disgusting it was.  It left oil all over my feet and hands after application.  I suppose the oil is  supposed to be good for your skin, but I had to immediately go wash my hands over and over so I could even touch anything without leaving a smear.  I usually love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and was really disappointed with this.  I suppose it&#x27;s just a matter of me misunderstanding what the product was, but, as I said, I think creme is the wrong word to use.  Just wanted to warn those of you that are thinking of buying!</li>
            <li> Dry feet are so resistant to any sort of moisture, but not this one. Usually have to reapply lotion to feet several times a day to avoid them becoming dry and chalky looking. This one lasts the whole day. It is greasy and feels weird on my hands but if you just wash it off your hands after you rub it in to your heels, the problem is solved. My feet are softer, and not cracked or dry.</li>
            <li> Too greasy . Gets everywhere .</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Mom and she loves it. Her feet get chapped easily and Burt&#x27;s bees helps her keep them soft. She loved it so much that i had to buy her more tubes.</li>
            <li> This product is okay. i don&#x27;t really see a difference and hate how  waxy it feels. I will continue to try ways to make this product work for me.  However, i found a solution which is SHEA BUTTER! its amazing for dry feet.</li>
            <li> Fantástic product. I have tried at least a dozen other brands and they just smooth your feet for a few hours but they don&#x27;t actually heal. This Burt&#x27;s bee works great on my cracked heels. You will still have to use almost every day and It works better if you put in some socks right after application.</li>
            <li> It works really well. Moistens feet well and Wipes the dryness away. It is not greasy or doesn&#x27;t have any strong smell.</li>
            <li> An incredible foot cream!  I use it during the winter, at night, sleep with socks and my feet remain sort.</li>
            <li> If you wear socks, it&#x27;s not as big of a deal, but the texture of this foot \\&quot;cream\\&quot; is uncomfortable. It leaves a greasy yet grainy texture initially, then dries and leaves your feet feeling awkward. Definitely hate wearing it to sleep because my feet feel uncomfortable. The discomfort is gone once washed off though. As for moisturizing power, I&#x27;d say it does an alright job (better than most) but not the best. Keep looking!</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;creme&amp;#34; smells wonderful but that is the only good thing about it.  It is an oily ointment, not a creme.  I&#x27;ve used it twice and am going to give it away.  It is sticky, feels uncomfortable and should only be used on a winter day when you plan on wearing thick socks all day.  You could not wear sandles after applying this creme.  I like Burt&#x27;s Bees products - but not this one.  UPDATE:  Even though I do not like this product, I will say the next day my feet are incredibly soft.  I works as advertised.</li>
