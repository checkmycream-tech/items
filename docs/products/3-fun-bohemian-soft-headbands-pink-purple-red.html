            <li>so these got put aside because of their cheap feel.</li>
            <li>The fabric has shiny metallic threads running throughout, which adds to the cheap look.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t like the way they fit.</li>
            <li>The product is colorfast, but I can tell that the cheap fabric may not hold up well under repeated washes.</li>
            <li>Wonderful colors and instant style for this natural head!</li>
            <li>This is particularly awesome, because it&#x27;s hard to find lightweight and cool headwear</li>
            <li>These are fun and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I love these so much.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend! :)</li>
            <li>These headbands are excellent for both the bad and good hair days.</li>
            <li>They are very pretty and versatile.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s washable, everything is usually so hot to wear!</li>
            <li>three plus the colors are so pretty!</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick delivery too!</li>
            <li>These fit really well</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve discovered Natural Life&#x27;s bandeaus and like those so much better.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also nice as regular headbands as well.</li>
            <li>They are economical for the price.  </li>
            <li>Has a chemical smell when you take it out the package but fun to wear</li>
            <li>love it on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>They are &#x27;cute&#x27;, but adult.  </li>
            <li>If the price continues to increase...  not quite worth it.  </li>
            <li>Also, the material is very cheap to the point it has loose threads and could easily tear.  </li>
            <li>material.and is very large size.if</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really cute, comfy and super simple, but I don&#x27;t feel like they would hold up through being machine</li>
            <li>I think they would be comfortable for someone with a normal sized head.</li>
            <li>They stay in place very nicely &amp; you can leave them pleated to wear as a narrower headband or open them up for an entirely different look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all, it is a good little headband</li>
            <li>Both the purple and red bands (which I wore most) started coming apart the first week of wear.  </li>
            <li>I like the Buff headband I purchased at the same time much better.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors.</li>
            <li>We will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>washed multiple times, which I prefer to be able to do.</li>
            <li>I first saw this on a website</li>
            <li>/&gt;After ordering the first set and being so pleased, I ordered another set in different colors.  </li>
            <li>Great for both short and long hair</li>
            <li>Can be matched up with pretty much anything.</li>
            <li>They are great to where with my hair down or pulled back.</li>
            <li>Fit is nice and headband stays put without being too tight and pinning my ears back like some others.  </li>
            <li>I just bought an organic cotton one that is so much nicer</li>
            <li>My daughter seems to really like them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest hand washing because as others have said its thin material (great for summer heat</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very snug.</li>
            <li>$  increased to $19.+  too much for 3.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more colors in near future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m dreading my hair via neglect method, so headwear is often a must, and I love these headbands, I just wish the material was a little higher quality.</li>
            <li>I could have spent a couple of bucks and made some far better headbands, myself.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m of average size and have straight, fine hair, so that&#x27;s not the issue.  </li>
            <li>I still really love them, I just feel like they&#x27;re a little more fancy-wear, not so everyday-</li>
            <li>They make a bad hair day great!</li>
            <li>The price is great on these so if you think you want to try them, go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin, curly hair that is naturally very, very blonde.</li>
            <li>, I was surprised!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Check stitching when you receive&lt;br /&gt;Smell out of Package - fixed with a quick wash and air dry</li>
            <li>However, if you have an average size head or larger, you won&#x27;t be able to tolerate this headband all day.  </li>
            <li>While these are cute, they run so tight that I actually get headaches from wearing these.  </li>
            <li>I have searched long and hard for a headband that would be both comfortable, as well as one that can contain my head full of hair.  </li>
            <li>I have been &#x27;natural&#x27; for almost a year.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t even touch them since I&#x27;m so chemically sensitive.</li>
            <li>so that the costumer can stretch it how much they want and it not already be too big before i wear it at all!</li>
            <li>Smaller and thinner material than I thought yet very serviceable.</li>
            <li>I ordered these for my 8 year old.</li>
            <li>have in fact washed these several times now, and they are holding up very well</li>
            <li>colors are really neat because they are not solid but a variety of shades.  </li>
            <li>While colorful, these headbands feel rough and scratchy to me.</li>
            <li>I have really thick hair and most headbands will not work on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Pity, as the style is exactly what I had wanted.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just my super round head, but they tend to slide off gradually.</li>
            <li>However I have a very large head and these are not nearly large enough.</li>
            <li>Also this set and the other colored set came out of the packaging very stiff with a strong chemical smell.</li>

            <li> /&gt;You won&#x27;t be unhappy with these comfortable headbands that stay in place!</li>
            <li> I suspect the elastic won&#x27;t hold up long either.</li>
            <li> I still have not worn one of these because they are all stretched out and just fall off my head.</li>
            <li> generally wear my hair down, with no product in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed them.by hand, pleated them to dry</li>
            <li> These are not very well made, with loose threads and very thin (not &amp;#34;soft,&amp;#34; as in the description), cheap looking fabric.  </li>
            <li> Also, they come in one size only and feel pretty small to me, at least for adults.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m only giving them 4 starts due to the fact that the pink one had to be resewn when I got it.</li>
            <li> The stitching on one side of the elastic area was loose which means it would have unraveled.</li>
            <li> little smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> They have a thin metallic strip which provides a little bit of a fun</li>
            <li> They have shiny metallic threads that are too glittery for me and add to the rough feeling.</li>
            <li> They offer a wide range of width choices for the band depending on the day and the mood.  </li>
            <li> No matter which shade of red (or purple or pink or green, etc.)</li>
            <li> Tight and itchy, not soft.</li>
            <li> Judging by the other comments complaining that they&#x27;re either too big or too small, I wonder if there is no uniform size among these.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the other 3-band set as well.</li>
            <li> I luckily don&#x27;t get bad fuzz going on.</li>
            <li> I use these in between dying because my hair is so thin and so blonde</li>
            <li> Is very annoying, the clothe is very cheap</li>
            <li> They might be too small for an adult&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 - balding, thin hair is just not fun at my age.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have extremely long, very thick hair and have found it impossible to wear a standard headband without having it sliding off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hard scratchy fabric,</li>
            <li> too late to return.</li>
            <li> - hopefully you understand what I mean</li>
            <li> So far, washed them 3 times and they still are horribly offensive -- and the smell migrated into the other clothes washed with them!  </li>
            <li> The sizes were also not consistent and these have a bad smell to them, like the smell of an auto repair shop.  </li>
            <li> expensive for what they are...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These headbands were as described. They were beautiful in colors and they fit perfectly. I have enjoyed wearing them a lot.</li>
            <li> I have been &#x27;natural&#x27; for almost a year. These headbands are excellent for both the bad and good hair days. Well worth the money. No headaches or unecessary traction on my hair.</li>
            <li> I love these headbands. They come in so handy.  They make a bad hair day great!</li>
            <li> upon delivery these emitted a strong odor of machine oil.  After one washing they have improved, but i can still detect it.  too late to return.</li>
            <li> Tight and itchy, not soft. Ripped before I even wore it.</li>
            <li> Nice colors needs motor stretch.</li>
            <li> They reek like goo gone!! They smell so bad I don&#x27;t want to wear them!! Otherwise it&#x27;s really nice looking</li>
            <li> Granddaughters love them</li>
            <li> Smells horrible -- like they were soaked in kerosene!  So far, washed them 3 times and they still are horribly offensive -- and the smell migrated into the other clothes washed with them!  Haven&#x27;t even tried them on to see if they were handy for what I wanted them for.  Can&#x27;t even touch them since I&#x27;m so chemically sensitive.</li>
            <li> These are ok. The material is very thin and feels synthetic so it has a king of cheap feel. I suspect the elastic won&#x27;t hold up long either. I just bought an organic cotton one that is so much nicer so these got put aside because of their cheap feel.</li>
            <li> Both the purple and red bands (which I wore most) started coming apart the first week of wear.  The sizes were also not consistent and these have a bad smell to them, like the smell of an auto repair shop.  I&#x27;ve discovered Natural Life&#x27;s bandeaus and like those so much better.  They don&#x27;t ride up and are so much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> These are a great alternative to the sport bands that always slide off my head! They are great to where with my hair down or pulled back. Super cute and comfy.</li>
            <li> I still have not worn one of these because they are all stretched out and just fall off my head. It should have been made tighter &#x3D;so that the costumer can stretch it how much they want and it not already be too big before i wear it at all!</li>
            <li> Colors are cute and bright.  Fit is nice and headband stays put without being too tight and pinning my ears back like some others.  Material is a little cheap feeling and stiff, but I guess that&#x27;s what you get for the price.</li>
            <li> I love these headbands! I bought them for my daughter. They are very pretty and versatile. I will be making future purchases for myself.</li>
            <li> These are not very well made, with loose threads and very thin (not &amp;#34;soft,&amp;#34; as in the description), cheap looking fabric.  The fabric has shiny metallic threads running throughout, which adds to the cheap look.</li>
            <li> I am happy to get them.</li>
            <li> They are so cute! Just wish it had more elasticity.</li>
            <li> These headbands are really cute! I use them to add extra decoration to my head wraps, and they are perfect for this purpose! They&#x27;re also nice as regular headbands as well.</li>
            <li> These are super cute. Colors are bright. Maybe it&#x27;s just my super round head, but they tend to slide off gradually. Still super happy I ordered them though.</li>
            <li> hard scratchy fabric,</li>
            <li> These are fun and comfortable.  Love them!</li>
            <li> They were fine - I just didn&#x27;t like the way they fit. I like the Buff headband I purchased at the same time much better.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors. Can be matched up with pretty much anything. Smaller and thinner material than I thought yet very serviceable. Can&#x27;t beat &#x27;em if you have to answer door before you&#x27;re fully dressed.</li>
            <li> They are economical for the price.  Comfortable and can be styled fully expanded or just a thin hair band.  During the winter this helps me keep my hair contained.</li>
            <li> Very pretty.  My daughter seems to really like them.</li>
            <li> I have searched long and hard for a headband that would be both comfortable, as well as one that can contain my head full of hair.  I have really thick hair and most headbands will not work on my hair.  These work great and I have received a lot of compliments on them as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my 8 year old. She loves them. They might be too small for an adult&lt;br /&gt;  We will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> Has a chemical smell when you take it out the package but fun to wear</li>
            <li> I purchased two packages of these headbands (one from each of two sellers), now wishing I had only purchased one package.  The material slides on my hair.  All in all, it is a good little headband and I&#x27;m happy to own 3 of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dreading my hair via neglect method, so headwear is often a must, and I love these headbands, I just wish the material was a little higher quality. They&#x27;re really cute, comfy and super simple, but I don&#x27;t feel like they would hold up through being machine washed multiple times, which I prefer to be able to do. I still really love them, I just feel like they&#x27;re a little more fancy-wear, not so everyday-wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[UPDATE]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have in fact washed these several times now, and they are holding up very well, I was surprised! This is particularly awesome, because it&#x27;s hard to find lightweight and cool headwear that&#x27;s washable, everything is usually so hot to wear! These are not, they make for a great summer wear. I love these so much.</li>
            <li> They are very comfortable and I like the colors !</li>
            <li> While colorful, these headbands feel rough and scratchy to me. They have shiny metallic threads that are too glittery for me and add to the rough feeling. Also, they come in one size only and feel pretty small to me, at least for adults. They might work better for kids.</li>
            <li> This head bands works as depicted and looks nice on. I was just mystified, however, by the pesticide odor on the fabric. After several washings, the smell was gone. The product is colorfast, but I can tell that the cheap fabric may not hold up well under repeated washes.</li>
            <li> I first saw this on a website but I didn&#x27;t feel like paying $15 for one. This one comes with three plus the colors are so pretty! Yes there is a smell but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I wish these came in solid colors but I plan on purchasing the Green/Blue/Grey set soon. Would highly recommend! :)</li>
            <li> I got these to go with some of my regular outfits, for those days I just want my hair up and out of my face.  While these are cute, they run so tight that I actually get headaches from wearing these.  I&#x27;m of average size and have straight, fine hair, so that&#x27;s not the issue.  Judging by the other comments complaining that they&#x27;re either too big or too small, I wonder if there is no uniform size among these.  Also, the material is very cheap to the point it has loose threads and could easily tear.  I could have spent a couple of bucks and made some far better headbands, myself.  Pity, as the style is exactly what I had wanted.</li>
            <li> I have extremely long, very thick hair and have found it impossible to wear a standard headband without having it sliding off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have resolved my frustrations!  They stay in place very nicely &amp; you can leave them pleated to wear as a narrower headband or open them up for an entirely different look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are really neat because they are not solid but a variety of shades.  No matter which shade of red (or purple or pink or green, etc.) you are wearing, they are sure to blend.  They have a thin metallic strip which provides a little bit of a fun accent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After ordering the first set and being so pleased, I ordered another set in different colors.  I&#x27;ve washed them.by hand, pleated them to dry and they came out looking great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be unhappy with these comfortable headbands that stay in place!</li>
            <li> Is very annoying, the clothe is very cheap material.and is very large size.if you have regular size head this is not for you.</li>
            <li> little smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> These are wonderful! I love the design and quality. I ordered the other 3-band set as well. Wonderful colors and instant style for this natural head! Great for both short and long hair and it can be work with elastic band in front or back.</li>
            <li> love it on my natural hair. I will buy more colors in near future.</li>
            <li> These are muted, but still colorful and fit perfectly- stay in place, and keep hair out of my face.  They offer a wide range of width choices for the band depending on the day and the mood.  They are &#x27;cute&#x27;, but adult.  I so appreciate that.</li>
            <li> Fit perfect!  Looks good!  I liked them so much that I just purchased three more. I guess you can call me a very satisfied customer.  Thanks for the quick delivery too!</li>
            <li> expensive for what they are...but they do stay on your head and do come in some nice colors that make outfit coordination easier</li>
            <li> These are bright and colorful and are well made. However I have a very large head and these are not nearly large enough. I think they would be comfortable for someone with a normal sized head.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors. I have have a big head and they fit great!</li>
            <li> I ordered these and another set in different colors. I love this style of headband. I have several I&#x27;ve collected over the years. The price is great on these so if you think you want to try them, go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin, curly hair that is naturally very, very blonde. I use these in between dying because my hair is so thin and so blonde the crown of my head looks like its balding as the roots start to show. I&#x27;m 28 - balding, thin hair is just not fun at my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally wear my hair down, with no product in it. My hair comes to the middle of my back. So these headbands can handle controlling that weight of hair. I luckily don&#x27;t get bad fuzz going on. However I do have my days and these headbands help keep my hair under control. Added bonus of looking cute. The red one is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only giving them 4 starts due to the fact that the pink one had to be resewn when I got it. The stitching on one side of the elastic area was loose which means it would have unraveled. Also this set and the other colored set came out of the packaging very stiff with a strong chemical smell. I had to wash them before I could put them with the rest of my headbands. I&#x27;d suggest hand washing because as others have said its thin material (great for summer heat though)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets sum it up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Colors are great&lt;br /&gt;Light weight&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable&lt;br /&gt;Good fit&lt;br /&gt;Non-pinchy - hopefully you understand what I mean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Check stitching when you receive&lt;br /&gt;Smell out of Package - fixed with a quick wash and air dry</li>
            <li> These headbands are really cute, nice assortment of colors.  However, if you have an average size head or larger, you won&#x27;t be able to tolerate this headband all day.  It&#x27;s very snug.</li>
            <li> Ok quality.  Received 2 reds and 0 purple. They reimbursed me for the error.</li>
            <li> Cheap, thin, no stretch.  Disappointed!!</li>
            <li> These fit really well and I love the colors!</li>
            <li> If the price continues to increase...  not quite worth it.  The quality is just on the border.  I was about to order the 2nd set of colors  - $  increased to $19.+  too much for 3.  $5. per was close to crossing the line.</li>
            <li> I want more colors! I love these!</li>
