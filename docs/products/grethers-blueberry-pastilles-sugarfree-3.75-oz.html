    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>We both find it delightful.</li>
            <li>These are excellent.</li>
            <li>Works great on those night when you have a bit of a scratchy voice and 2 hours of show to do.</li>
            <li>I have loved the blackberry ones for years and just discovered the blueberries.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with these.</li>
            <li>is even better!</li>
            <li>But they are perfect and work well and are very soothing to the throat.  </li>
            <li>to know that Amazon carries this long-time favorite.</li>
            <li>Does not taste like blueberry tastes more medicinal.  </li>
            <li>So glad I don&#x27;t have to go to Switzerland to buy these anymore!&lt;br /&gt;Kids</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>Re-ordered MANY times.</li>
            <li>My good friend recommended these and said they were &amp;#34;a miracle for singers&amp;#34; and she was right.</li>
            <li>Delicious and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>This is a really wonderful product if you have dry mouth.</li>
            <li>I have a family full of performers who swear by these to soothe the throat on performance days!</li>
            <li>These are very tasty, with a nice blueberry flavor.</li>
            <li>Not only are they great tasting, but i also lost ths tickle in my throat.</li>
            <li>I take it when I have a cough, and find it most useful.  </li>
            <li>So for anyone who sings, they help you go longer, and sound smoother.</li>
            <li>I like the blueberry flavor &amp; the fact that they are sugar free</li>
            <li>Just when you are up next to sing, pop in one of these pastilles, and your throat becomes perfectly moist and gets you ready to sing.</li>
            <li>Since Pine Bros. Honey Cough Drops re-introduced their &amp;#34;original formula&amp;#34; drops, which are nothing like the original formula, I&#x27;ve begun using these to sooth my throat when I&#x27;m working.</li>
            <li>They melt in the mouth and cure one&#x27;s scratchy throat right away!</li>
            <li>It tastes great &amp; can last the whole night!</li>
            <li>These are really tasty sugar free treats.  </li>
            <li>and it was so worth it.</li>
            <li>long lasting, loved texture and flavor and mild blueberry not too strong</li>
            <li>I also suffer from dry mouth, and I find popping one of these babies when this starts to happen, even when I&#x27;m not singing, has an excellent long lasting effect; more so than those specialized mouth washes and tooth pastes.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy these again and it is most definitely worth the high price.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how much they help my voice for singing, however they do taste pretty good.</li>
            <li>They are very pricey for what they are and I would like it better if they sold for less</li>
            <li>I am down in Miami for a couple of months from Canada, and just ordered the big black currant box, and several more of these blueberries because they will cost a lot more in Canada, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>Fairly tasty;  they are supposed to help your throat, but I am not sure they do any more than hard candy for that.  </li>
            <li>There are times when I can comfortably sing a song, and times when I struggle to not sound like someone going through puberty.</li>
            <li>love them, great for that tickle before the cold,  stop it before it gets bad.</li>

            <li> Expensive but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but each lasts a long time in the mouth.</li>
            <li> , however it was a little expensive for the quantity</li>
            <li> I have a weak singing voice.</li>

            <li> As an actress/singer who is auditioning for Juilliard in a few weeks I desperately needed something to prep myself in case something happened.</li>
            <li> I would continue to order these if they weren&#x27;t so darn expensive.  </li>
            <li> The texture is a bit odd, but considering they are glycerine... not too bad!</li>
            <li> Always wonderful...especially during cold season!  </li>
            <li> Was very disappointed in the taste and won&#x27;t finish them</li>

            <li> Always wonderful...especially during cold season!  Delicious and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Nice to know that Amazon carries this long-time favorite.</li>
            <li> Works great on those night when you have a bit of a scratchy voice and 2 hours of show to do.</li>
            <li> Am still trying this product.</li>
            <li> Does not taste like blueberry tastes more medicinal.  Was very disappointed in the taste and won&#x27;t finish them</li>
            <li> So glad I don&#x27;t have to go to Switzerland to buy these anymore!&lt;br /&gt;Kids love them, great for that tickle before the cold,  stop it before it gets bad.</li>
            <li> Finally a sugarless candy with no after taste and it tastes like there is sugar in it&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> I have a family full of performers who swear by these to soothe the throat on performance days! Re-ordered MANY times. Expensive but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> These are very tasty, with a nice blueberry flavor. They melt in the mouth and cure one&#x27;s scratchy throat right away!</li>
            <li> As an actress/singer who is auditioning for Juilliard in a few weeks I desperately needed something to prep myself in case something happened. My good friend recommended these and said they were &amp;#34;a miracle for singers&amp;#34; and she was right. I had a tickle in my throat and I have an audition coming up. I ordered them overnight and it was so worth it. Not only are they great tasting, but i also lost ths tickle in my throat. I will definitely buy these again and it is most definitely worth the high price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who regularly enjoys it.  I take it when I have a cough, and find it most useful.  We both find it delightful.</li>
            <li> Just when you are up next to sing, pop in one of these pastilles, and your throat becomes perfectly moist and gets you ready to sing.</li>
            <li> I would continue to order these if they weren&#x27;t so darn expensive.  I get a lot of sore throats and these would be way too costly for what I need.  But they are perfect and work well and are very soothing to the throat.  I have to go with a cheaper version of the same.</li>
            <li> Since Pine Bros. Honey Cough Drops re-introduced their &amp;#34;original formula&amp;#34; drops, which are nothing like the original formula, I&#x27;ve begun using these to sooth my throat when I&#x27;m working. (I&#x27;m a singer/songwriter by trade.) Expensive, but each lasts a long time in the mouth. The sugarfree don&#x27;t have that weird undertaste so many sugarfree items have. Very pleased with these.</li>
            <li> Fairly tasty;  they are supposed to help your throat, but I am not sure they do any more than hard candy for that.  They are very pricey for what they are and I would like it better if they sold for less</li>
            <li> These are really tasty sugar free treats.  I have loved the blackberry ones for years and just discovered the blueberries.</li>
            <li> I have a weak singing voice. There are times when I can comfortably sing a song, and times when I struggle to not sound like someone going through puberty. These lozenges reduce the number of times, and the level to which this happens. So for anyone who sings, they help you go longer, and sound smoother. I also suffer from dry mouth, and I find popping one of these babies when this starts to happen, even when I&#x27;m not singing, has an excellent long lasting effect; more so than those specialized mouth washes and tooth pastes. You can also pop a lozenge any time. I usually don&#x27;t carry around those expensive mouth washes and tooth pastes when I&#x27;m out and about. I am down in Miami for a couple of months from Canada, and just ordered the big black currant box, and several more of these blueberries because they will cost a lot more in Canada, I&#x27;m sure. They don&#x27;t carry them on Amazon.ca.  So I&#x27;ve got about a 9 month supply to go home. These are excellent.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how much they help my voice for singing, however they do taste pretty good. The texture is a bit odd, but considering they are glycerine... not too bad! I like the blueberry flavor &amp; the fact that they are sugar free is even better!</li>
            <li> long lasting, loved texture and flavor and mild blueberry not too strong, however it was a little expensive for the quantity</li>
            <li> As a performer I swear by Grether&#x27;s, if I&#x27;m going on auditions or performing I always pop one of these in. I don&#x27;t just use this for singing, this also helps prevent dryness when you are performing in plays as well.</li>
            <li> This is a really wonderful product if you have dry mouth. It tastes great &amp; can last the whole night!</li>
