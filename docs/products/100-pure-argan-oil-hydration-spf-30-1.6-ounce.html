            <li>This is awesome for a sunscreen and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews before buying this product and thought I would go ahead and try it anyway because it was also rated one of the best on another website...</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t moisturizer my skin at all unless I added some of my own Emu oil to it!!!</li>
            <li>Love 100%, excellent product, very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer and sunscreen for combination acne-prone skin</li>
            <li>I. Both of us are happy with the results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Feels great on the skin too.</li>
            <li>- I mix it with another 100%pure moisturizer to get great coverage.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t quite pleasant</li>
            <li>It is perfect for the face not too oily at all and provides great hydration in the winter months I will purchase this item many more times</li>
            <li>any good facialist</li>
            <li>Great healthy sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and makes my skin look really beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>so I really love this product!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a pretty impressive combination!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li>Best natural sunscreen and moisturizer out there.</li>
            <li>Most sunscreens on the market irritate my eyes - they water</li>
            <li>Thismoisturizer comes in a glass bottle, which I love because it avoids all the issues associated with plastic</li>
            <li>It seems okay for that.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear make up often, so I like to keep my skin looking glowy and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Their prices are reasonable and my skin looks great without any chemicals or parabens.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent because fragrances give me a headache.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely the best sunscreen I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>My wife has used many products that are conducive of allergies causing rashes, itching, and swelling.  </li>
            <li>but it is nothing more then a sun screen.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t consistently be sure which version of the sunscreen I&#x27;ll be getting when I order.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But have I found anything out there that is better?</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and it works great!!!!!</li>
            <li>If you keep it standing on its top (as in the picture) and squeeze down the sides as it empties, the pump continues to work perfectly until almost all is gone.</li>
            <li>Thicker and more concentrated than original formula.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soothing and applies easily.</li>
            <li>It does go on nicely and spreads clear with a nice finish</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since many times companies never seem to post the full ingredients of the products they sell on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy about it!</li>
            <li>The face becomes a little drier after wearing this, it does not moisturize the face, so it is best to put some moisturizer or oil</li>
            <li>Not only was it a great sunscreen, but it was also a fantastic moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer itself goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>So smoothly.</li>
            <li>Yes, I like that it is gluten free, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>Not oily and good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they had their reasons for reformulating, but it is a shame, as the old product was so nice</li>
            <li>/&gt;Below is my review from the original bottle from the Original 2oz.</li>
            <li>Higher Zinc Oxide level helps for better protection UVB &amp; UVA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Below I have copied and pasted the ingredients list as shown on the 100% pure site for those of you who would like to know what is in your product before you buy it :)</li>
            <li>and I was thrilled to have found an spf 30 natural moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I love 100% pure products and this one is great too, except that it&#x27;s hard to spread on your face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for 2 days, and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love that it is all natural.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely worth buying again.</li>
            <li>It is completely non-irritating, goes on smoothly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth but not greasy.</li>
            <li>Eventually gets absorbed by the skin, but not immediately.</li>
            <li>I used to LOVE the old formulation.</li>
            <li>say, if you&#x27;re gonna buy this, have another cream handy to keep your face properly moisturized.</li>
            <li>I will continue using it for it&#x27;s all natural properties and SPF protection, but if I find something better, I won&#x27;t hesitate to switch.</li>
            <li>Effective natural sunscreen but very drying, even if you mix it with moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Originally a selling point of this product (and others in the 100% pure line) was the glass container and the pump that helped keep the material airtight.</li>
            <li>So you have to learn to barely touch it because it will spew more out</li>
            <li>but if you put more than 2 squirts of this on your face be sure to apply a thin layer of oil or good moisturizer on your skin first to ensure it will not turn to white smudging in some areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>at this point, the sunscreen is no longer &amp;#34;ph balanced,&amp;#34; which is good, since our skin prefers to be a little acidic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update November 2012:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying out the new version and in comparison to the original....</li>
            <li>It is a nice sunscreen for those days you will not be in the direct sun too much and do not have time to rub in and deal with one of those other more whitening sunscreens that you have to apply a tint over.</li>
            <li>So when I finally was able to get my hands on a bottle I was exstatic.</li>
            <li>*Be aware that you should not pay higher than $26.00 for this.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>I have tried many daily moisturizers and this one takes the cake!  </li>
            <li>The moisturizer is very hydrating for my oily skin!</li>
            <li>I get this sunscreen from, since not all vendors seem to have the most recent</li>
            <li>The most recent change I&#x27;ve noticed is the container-</li>
            <li>Do I wish I could go back in time and stock up on the better version,</li>
            <li>I checked the 100% Pure website, and sure enough, it had this to say: &amp;#34;**New</li>
            <li>are charging higher than on the 100% pure website (How Deceitful)</li>
            <li>I bought stuff from 100% pure&#x27;s website as well, but it ships faster via amazon and you avoid taxes.</li>
            <li>I guess 100% pure is hoping we&#x27;ll forget about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the previous formula was much lighter and absorbed into your skin better.</li>
            <li>I also find that if I let it warm up a little in my hand or on my face before spreading it spreads easier.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Argon oil sunscreen really dies the job...</li>
            <li>I also really dislike 100%</li>
            <li>so if it has Argan oil in it, it can&#x27;t be much.</li>
            <li>The new formulation is still better than most moisturizer/sunscreen combos (especially with mineral sunscreens and high concentrations of active ingredients)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely distrustful of moisturizers with spf, since what you gain in convenience you often compromise in effectiveness, but judging from the ingredients I&#x27;m confident this product is providing protection from the sun&#x27;s radiation and experience tells me its moisturizing my skin</li>
            <li>They need to go back to the original bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Pure&#x27;s new tube packaging.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think to check, as I had purchased it in the past and liked it.  </li>
            <li>It does leave a slight white cast (because of the zinc), but I add a little bit of bronzer on top and am good to go.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Since it had a high SPF, I kept using it for protection.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved that it came in a glass bottle pump but a dark tinted glass would be better to block UV light like amber or dark blue (like other natural product lines do for their products) to protect the product ingredients from light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the original glass pumping bottle and it avoided the issue of possible plastic chemical leakage, not any more :(</li>
            <li>Also, if your face is not exfoliated prior to wearing this, it will show under this sunscreen so be sure you do not have dry patches on your face as it will emphasize them.</li>
            <li>The new formulation does seem a little thicker than the original formulation which is still okay, but the zinc they are using may be different from the original because I am now starting to get slight irritation in my eyes that I did not get with the original formulation prior to September 2012.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pump is dysfunctional on this new tube bottle, it works sometimes and then stops pumping out product after a while.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and drive a convertible</li>
            <li>also this new packaging is plastic instead of</li>
            <li>Now I am going to have to try to order a new tube and hope that it&#x27;s freshness isn&#x27;t compromised.</li>
            <li>The label on the bottle does not smear off easily over time like other Natural brand labels do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suppose it is typical of companies that see people enjoy their product and instead of leaving it alone</li>
            <li>The only really positive thing I have to say is that it is not greasy</li>
            <li>You have to work it into your skin to smooth out all the white stuff, but it doesn&#x27;t take very long.  </li>
            <li>Really nice and THICK moisturizer, just make sure to not use to much other wise it can leave a white residue being that it is so thick, with this product a little goes</li>
            <li>This one at least feels more elegant and blends in nicely especially if you put a little oil/good moisturizer on your face first to help prevent any white patching or peeling just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pure&#x27;s Red Wine Reservatrol cream</li>
            <li>Does not irritate Acne prone or sensitive</li>
            <li>far it seems that it may be a keeper for those days</li>
            <li>This product is truly natural, with no synthetic ingredients or harmful preservatives.  </li>
            <li>I will save it for when I will be in the sun for a considerable amount of time.</li>
            <li>Thus far she has had no reaction to using this product and she loves it.</li>
            <li>I would still recommend this, but the old formulation was basically my holy grail face sunscreen.</li>
            <li>All natural products + argan oil and SPF...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick but doesn&#x27;t make your face feel greasy, so it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>glass(I think this is the trend with all of their products shifting to plastic tubes) which I would be fine with if they weren&#x27;t charging the same for less product.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is thick and white when first applied, but it quickly absorbs and leaves my skin really soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Ask</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;I am still unsure how this sunscreen performs in direct prolonged sunlight as I have so far been using it for incidental day to day activities which do not require me out in the sun for too long or when I am near a window while indoors.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write customer reviews, but if mine stops at least one person from buying this product then I&#x27;ve done a good job.</li>
            <li>This product, along with all the other 100% pure products, helps me do just that.  </li>
            <li>It really protects the skin, unlike a lot of other moisturizers that claim to have sun screen in them.  </li>
            <li>Will leave a white cast on your skin due to the high % of Zinc Oxide, the natural sunblock that shields your skin against UVA and UVB rays.</li>
            <li>It is not what I expected in that it&#x27;s really thick, and I was looking for something more lightweight...</li>
            <li>Worse, my most recent order of this product, because it runs out pretty quickly, came to me with the cap loose, and the seal on the tube itself broken and leaking moisturizer.</li>
            <li>For $26 it is so hard to rub it into and spread around your skin, I have a darker complexion and it left my skin WHITE for about an hour, and once it finally absorbed..</li>

            <li> /&gt;Below is my review from the original bottle from the Original 2oz.</li>
            <li> Higher Zinc Oxide level helps for better protection UVB &amp; UVA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I also really dislike 100%</li>
            <li> so if it has Argan oil in it, it can&#x27;t be much.</li>
            <li> The new formulation is still better than most moisturizer/sunscreen combos (especially with mineral sunscreens and high concentrations of active ingredients)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely distrustful of moisturizers with spf, since what you gain in convenience you often compromise in effectiveness, but judging from the ingredients I&#x27;m confident this product is providing protection from the sun&#x27;s radiation and experience tells me its moisturizing my skin</li>

            <li> Pure&#x27;s new tube packaging.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think to check, as I had purchased it in the past and liked it.  </li>
            <li> It does leave a slight white cast (because of the zinc), but I add a little bit of bronzer on top and am good to go.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Since it had a high SPF, I kept using it for protection.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved that it came in a glass bottle pump but a dark tinted glass would be better to block UV light like amber or dark blue (like other natural product lines do for their products) to protect the product ingredients from light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked the original glass pumping bottle and it avoided the issue of possible plastic chemical leakage, not any more :(</li>
            <li> Also, if your face is not exfoliated prior to wearing this, it will show under this sunscreen so be sure you do not have dry patches on your face as it will emphasize them.</li>
            <li> The new formulation does seem a little thicker than the original formulation which is still okay, but the zinc they are using may be different from the original because I am now starting to get slight irritation in my eyes that I did not get with the original formulation prior to September 2012.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pump is dysfunctional on this new tube bottle, it works sometimes and then stops pumping out product after a while.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and drive a convertible</li>
            <li> also this new packaging is plastic instead of</li>
            <li> Now I am going to have to try to order a new tube and hope that it&#x27;s freshness isn&#x27;t compromised.</li>
            <li> The label on the bottle does not smear off easily over time like other Natural brand labels do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suppose it is typical of companies that see people enjoy their product and instead of leaving it alone</li>
            <li> The only really positive thing I have to say is that it is not greasy</li>
            <li> You have to work it into your skin to smooth out all the white stuff, but it doesn&#x27;t take very long.  </li>
            <li> Really nice and THICK moisturizer, just make sure to not use to much other wise it can leave a white residue being that it is so thick, with this product a little goes</li>
            <li> This one at least feels more elegant and blends in nicely especially if you put a little oil/good moisturizer on your face first to help prevent any white patching or peeling just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This product is truly natural, with no synthetic ingredients or harmful preservatives.  </li>

            <li> I would still recommend this, but the old formulation was basically my holy grail face sunscreen.</li>
            <li> All natural products + argan oil and SPF...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick but doesn&#x27;t make your face feel greasy, so it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> glass(I think this is the trend with all of their products shifting to plastic tubes) which I would be fine with if they weren&#x27;t charging the same for less product.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is thick and white when first applied, but it quickly absorbs and leaves my skin really soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Ask</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;I am still unsure how this sunscreen performs in direct prolonged sunlight as I have so far been using it for incidental day to day activities which do not require me out in the sun for too long or when I am near a window while indoors.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write customer reviews, but if mine stops at least one person from buying this product then I&#x27;ve done a good job.</li>
            <li> This product, along with all the other 100% pure products, helps me do just that.  </li>
            <li> It really protects the skin, unlike a lot of other moisturizers that claim to have sun screen in them.  </li>
            <li> Will leave a white cast on your skin due to the high % of Zinc Oxide, the natural sunblock that shields your skin against UVA and UVB rays.</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected in that it&#x27;s really thick, and I was looking for something more lightweight...</li>
            <li> Worse, my most recent order of this product, because it runs out pretty quickly, came to me with the cap loose, and the seal on the tube itself broken and leaking moisturizer.</li>
            <li> For $26 it is so hard to rub it into and spread around your skin, I have a darker complexion and it left my skin WHITE for about an hour, and once it finally absorbed..</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, we recommend you use a facial oil first and then a small amount of the argan oil spf 30 moisturizer on top.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen had been out of stock for a long while and finally came back in stock just after the summer..</li>
            <li> It is not as bad as other more whitening sunscreens but be aware that this can happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you put too much of this on your face it does start to develop white random patches/smudges on areas of your face or start to ball up if you try to fix it, so you have to be cautious of how much you put on your face especially if you put this on your face alone without another</li>
            <li> Your face looks a little white after applying it but after a few minutes it gets absorbed.</li>
            <li> you need a natural sunscreen without the white mess and oiliness</li>
            <li> If you leave it lying flat, the pump doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I started developing dry patches around my nose and the inner corners of my eye area.</li>
            <li> After using it a few times or so the pump stopped working completely</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is really just zinc oxide (very thick &amp; white)</li>
            <li> Also, I have dry skin, and it does do the job of moisturizing my face.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin either.</li>
            <li> Like another review said, your face should probably be moisturized before putting it on, but seriously, not worth $26 if you have to go buy another moisturizer just so this one will work properly...</li>
            <li> I did agree with others about the consistency: sort of pasty and you have to pat it on so it doesn&#x27;t become a white mess on your face.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a lot harder to put on.</li>
            <li> , It is unfortunate that 100% pure decided to give less and charge the same price while putting this into an inferior plastic tube.</li>
            <li> and also I can reuse it for other purposes when it runs out.</li>
            <li> you might get from other</li>

            <li> It seemed thicker than I remembered, with less &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34;, a whiter cast, and it made my face itch slightly.  </li>
            <li> it was soo thick and took so long to absorb into my skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use sunscreen everyday.  Most sunscreens on the market irritate my eyes - they water if I get the sunscreen too close.  I can put this sunscreen on my eyelids with no problem.  I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;nasty&amp;#34; ingredients.  It is very thick but I always put a little oil on my face after washing it, so that takes care of that problem.  I also find that if I let it warm up a little in my hand or on my face before spreading it spreads easier.</li>
            <li> I was waiting in anticipation because I heard such rave reviews. They even use it at the spa I go to. It was out of stock everywhere I checked. So when I finally was able to get my hands on a bottle I was exstatic. I rubbed some on my face and was shocked. This could not be the same product that people were being put on a wait list for. It is way too thick and leaves a yucky white cast on your face. It also stinks! I tried to like. But I ended up throwing it in the trash. I&#x27;ll stick with a lower spf.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 2 days, and so far I love it. Thismoisturizer comes in a glass bottle, which I love because it avoids all the issues associated with plastic and also I can reuse it for other purposes when it runs out. The moisturizer itself goes on smoothly. So smoothly. It&#x27;s not streaky, its not pasty, and it moisturizes as well. I&#x27;m extremely distrustful of moisturizers with spf, since what you gain in convenience you often compromise in effectiveness, but judging from the ingredients I&#x27;m confident this product is providing protection from the sun&#x27;s radiation and experience tells me its moisturizing my skin well. Get this! I bought stuff from 100% pure&#x27;s website as well, but it ships faster via amazon and you avoid taxes.</li>
            <li> ***Be aware that you should not pay higher than $26.00 for this.&lt;br /&gt;Some Amazon sellers are overcharging and taking advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update September 2012: This sunscreen had been out of stock for a long while and finally came back in stock just after the summer..can you say bad timing? Unfortunately, according to the picture and description on their website this sunscreen is now being put into a plastic tube container AND they decreased the amount making it 1.6 oz instead of 2 oz. and they are charging the SAME Price and some sellers here on Amazon are charging higher than on the 100% pure website (How Deceitful) I liked the original glass pumping bottle and it avoided the issue of possible plastic chemical leakage, not any more :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, It is unfortunate that 100% pure decided to give less and charge the same price while putting this into an inferior plastic tube. I suppose it is typical of companies that see people enjoy their product and instead of leaving it alone they take advantage, decrease the amount,  and do not give any explanation of the change thinking people will not notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update November 2012:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying out the new version and in comparison to the original....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The pump is dysfunctional on this new tube bottle, it works sometimes and then stops pumping out product after a while. You end up having to open it up which defeats the purpose of keeping it from getting contamination and air inside. They need to go back to the original bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The new formulation does seem a little thicker than the original formulation which is still okay, but the zinc they are using may be different from the original because I am now starting to get slight irritation in my eyes that I did not get with the original formulation prior to September 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The face becomes a little drier after wearing this, it does not moisturize the face, so it is best to put some moisturizer or oil beforeputting this on your face. Also, if your face is not exfoliated prior to wearing this, it will show under this sunscreen so be sure you do not have dry patches on your face as it will emphasize them. It is not as bad as other more whitening sunscreens but be aware that this can happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is my review from the original bottle from the Original 2oz. Glass version prior to the September 2012 container, formulation, and size change:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It does go on nicely and spreads clear with a nice finish but if you put more than 2 squirts of this on your face be sure to apply a thin layer of oil or good moisturizer on your skin first to ensure it will not turn to white smudging in some areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It uses 24.8% Zinc. Higher Zinc Oxide level helps for better protection UVB &amp; UVA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Does not cause watery eyes or go into the eyes as the day goes, stays in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Does not irritate Acne prone or sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The label on the bottle does not smear off easily over time like other Natural brand labels do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. I loved that it came in a glass bottle pump but a dark tinted glass would be better to block UV light like amber or dark blue (like other natural product lines do for their products) to protect the product ingredients from light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. If you put too much of this on your face it does start to develop white random patches/smudges on areas of your face or start to ball up if you try to fix it, so you have to be cautious of how much you put on your face especially if you put this on your face alone without another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It might be using Nano Zinc Oxide. Some people may not like this. It does not state what type of Zinc they are using on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;I am still unsure how this sunscreen performs in direct prolonged sunlight as I have so far been using it for incidental day to day activities which do not require me out in the sun for too long or when I am near a window while indoors. It seems okay for that. It is a nice sunscreen for those days you will not be in the direct sun too much and do not have time to rub in and deal with one of those other more whitening sunscreens that you have to apply a tint over. This one at least feels more elegant and blends in nicely especially if you put a little oil/good moisturizer on your face first to help prevent any white patching or peeling just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it seems that it may be a keeper for those days you need a natural sunscreen without the white mess and oiliness you might get from other types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since many times companies never seem to post the full ingredients of the products they sell on Amazon. Below I have copied and pasted the ingredients list as shown on the 100% pure site for those of you who would like to know what is in your product before you buy it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Active Ingredients: 24.8 % Zinc Oxide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients: Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice1, Argania Spinosa Kernel (Argan) Oil, Rosa Canina Seed (Rosehip Oil) Extract, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Extracts of: Euphorbia Cerifera Cera (Candelilla Wax), Organic Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf2, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf, Origanum Vulgar (Oregano), Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme), Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit Seed) Seed, Hydrastis Canadensis (Goldenseal), Lonicera Caprifolium (Japanese Honeysuckle) and Cinnamomum Zeylanicum Bark (Cinnamon)</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer and sunscreen for combination acne-prone skin and I love that it is all natural.  Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, moisturizes well, and doesn&#x27;t have that awful chemical smell that many (chemical-based) sunscreens have.  It does leave a slight white cast (because of the zinc), but I add a little bit of bronzer on top and am good to go.</li>
            <li> Love 100%, excellent product, very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I have tried many daily moisturizers and this one takes the cake!  It&#x27;s so light and makes my skin look really beautiful.  I don&#x27;t wear make up often, so I like to keep my skin looking glowy and healthy.  This product, along with all the other 100% pure products, helps me do just that.  Their prices are reasonable and my skin looks great without any chemicals or parabens.</li>
            <li> Imagine the thickest sunscreen you&#x27;ve ever used. This is it.&lt;br /&gt;I use one squirt and then spray it once with a Tea Tree Water Toner (from Lush) to thin it out. Otherwise, you&#x27;re pulling on your skin just to apply it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about 2 months and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the pump, unlike other reviewers. I also haven&#x27;t seen this product cause my skin to break out, but I do use it in conjunction with a dermatology prescription. We&#x27;ll see how it fares in another two months...</li>
            <li> It is perfect for the face not too oily at all and provides great hydration in the winter months I will purchase this item many more times you only need one squirt to moisturize your face</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is fine- the tube is terrible.  Too bad it&#x27;s not glass. The plastic split on mine so now I could only squeeze it out the side.</li>
            <li> fast shipping. awesome product! I can&#x27;t be more pleased! The moisturizer is very hydrating for my oily skin! I&#x27;m going to use it everyday now!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Not oily and good for sensitive skin. It smells neutral. Your face looks a little white after applying it but after a few minutes it gets absorbed.</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected in that it&#x27;s really thick, and I was looking for something more lightweight... But maybe that&#x27;s my fault for expecting something different. It&#x27;s thick but doesn&#x27;t make your face feel greasy, so it&#x27;s ok. The one downside is the packaging: THE PUMP DOESNT WORK AFTER A WHILE. You have to twist it off every time- a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> My skin started drying out immediately after use. The pump stopped working after a couple uses. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I used this moisturizer. it was soo thick and took so long to absorb into my skin. Yes, I like that it is gluten free, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Yes, it is thick and white when first applied, but it quickly absorbs and leaves my skin really soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Ask any good facialist and they will tell you that you want to see that in a facial sun screen product.  It really protects the skin, unlike a lot of other moisturizers that claim to have sun screen in them.  I would have given it five stars if they packaging were glass instead of plastic.</li>
            <li> This product is truly natural, with no synthetic ingredients or harmful preservatives.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent because fragrances give me a headache.  Also, I have dry skin, and it does do the job of moisturizing my face.  You have to work it into your skin to smooth out all the white stuff, but it doesn&#x27;t take very long.  This is definitely worth buying again.</li>
            <li> Great healthy sunscreen.  Tip:  Put regular moisturizer underneath to make it easier to spread the thicker sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best sunscreen I have ever tried. It is completely non-irritating, goes on smoothly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth but not greasy. I highly recommend it. If you keep it standing on its top (as in the picture) and squeeze down the sides as it empties, the pump continues to work perfectly until almost all is gone. If you leave it lying flat, the pump doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Argon oil sunscreen really dies the job... I live in Florida and drive a convertible so I really love this product!</li>
            <li> Best natural sunscreen and moisturizer out there. Love this product. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin either.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and difficult to absorb just like a sunscreen. I will save it for when I will be in the sun for a considerable amount of time.</li>
            <li> My wife has used many products that are conducive of allergies causing rashes, itching, and swelling.  We were never sure if it was the sun exposure or the sun block chemicals.  Thus far she has had no reaction to using this product and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love 100% pure products and this one is great too, except that it&#x27;s hard to spread on your face. It requires a little time and patience. Eventually gets absorbed by the skin, but not immediately. Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy about it!</li>
            <li> They call this a hydration facial moisturizer but it is nothing more then a sun screen.  It is a thick white cream that is a little hard to spread.  It does not moisturize and severely irritated my skin.  The pump on the tube is dysfunctional.  So you have to learn to barely touch it because it will spew more out then you want. When you take your finger off the pump it keeps going on it&#x27;s own. After using it a few times or so the pump stopped working completely so I had to unscrew it and squeeze the product out. The only really positive thing I have to say is that it is not greasy but I had to stop using it and send it back.</li>
            <li> I used to LOVE the old formulation. Not only was it a great sunscreen, but it was also a fantastic moisturizer. The new formulation is still better than most moisturizer/sunscreen combos (especially with mineral sunscreens and high concentrations of active ingredients) but it&#x27;s a lot harder to put on. I would still recommend this, but the old formulation was basically my holy grail face sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I ordered this not realizing that it has been reformulated.  It seemed thicker than I remembered, with less &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34;, a whiter cast, and it made my face itch slightly.  I checked the 100% Pure website, and sure enough, it had this to say: &amp;#34;**New Formula. Thicker and more concentrated than original formula. Will leave a white cast on your skin due to the high % of Zinc Oxide, the natural sunblock that shields your skin against UVA and UVB rays. If you have dry skin, we recommend you use a facial oil first and then a small amount of the argan oil spf 30 moisturizer on top.&amp;#34;  Belatedly, I saw that some people on Amazon have also mentioned the reformulation. I didn&#x27;t think to check, as I had purchased it in the past and liked it.  I also really dislike 100% Pure&#x27;s new tube packaging.  I&#x27;m sure they had their reasons for reformulating, but it is a shame, as the old product was so nice and I was thrilled to have found an spf 30 natural moisturizer.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews myself before I purchased the product. I did agree with others about the consistency: sort of pasty and you have to pat it on so it doesn&#x27;t become a white mess on your face. That&#x27;s usually how organic moisturizers with an SPF are, though. (I&#x27;ve also tried Burt&#x27;s Bees) The smell isn&#x27;t quite pleasant but I dealt with it. Since it had a high SPF, I kept using it for protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hydration was what gave me a problem... it didn&#x27;t hydrate, to put it simply. I started developing dry patches around my nose and the inner corners of my eye area. I soon after purchased 100% Pure&#x27;s Red Wine Reservatrol cream and that definitely helped my face get back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say, if you&#x27;re gonna buy this, have another cream handy to keep your face properly moisturized. I will continue using it for it&#x27;s all natural properties and SPF protection, but if I find something better, I won&#x27;t hesitate to switch.</li>
            <li> This is awesome for a sunscreen and moisturizer. I have super sensitive skin and it works great!!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write customer reviews, but if mine stops at least one person from buying this product then I&#x27;ve done a good job. I read all the reviews before buying this product and thought I would go ahead and try it anyway because it was also rated one of the best on another website... BIG MISTAKE. For $26 it is so hard to rub it into and spread around your skin, I have a darker complexion and it left my skin WHITE for about an hour, and once it finally absorbed.. it left white residue on my face. Like another review said, your face should probably be moisturized before putting it on, but seriously, not worth $26 if you have to go buy another moisturizer just so this one will work properly... I just stopped using it all together after a few days.</li>
            <li> Effective natural sunscreen but very drying, even if you mix it with moisturizer. Your skin will also look very white</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and I. Both of us are happy with the results. All natural products + argan oil and SPF...that&#x27;s a pretty impressive combination!</li>
            <li> the previous formula was much lighter and absorbed into your skin better. it is ridiculous how thick this new stuff is and it turns me white as a sheet. also this new packaging is plastic instead of glass(I think this is the trend with all of their products shifting to plastic tubes) which I would be fine with if they weren&#x27;t charging the same for less product.</li>
            <li> This product is really just zinc oxide (very thick &amp; white) so if it has Argan oil in it, it can&#x27;t be much. Didn&#x27;t moisturizer my skin at all unless I added some of my own Emu oil to it!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this sunscreen for a few years now. I am rather disappointed at the changes that have occurred, and have grown concerned about *where* I get this sunscreen from, since not all vendors seem to have the most recent stock- so I can&#x27;t consistently be sure which version of the sunscreen I&#x27;ll be getting when I order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to the fact that this product has gone through changes- at this point, the sunscreen is no longer &amp;#34;ph balanced,&amp;#34; which is good, since our skin prefers to be a little acidic.However, it is NOT 24.8% zinc, like the description says. It IS 20% only. And, as another reviewer pointed out, it is 1.6 ounces, not 2.0, despite the price remaining the same. The most recent change I&#x27;ve noticed is the container- it is no longer the plastic tube with the pump- it&#x27;s now simply a plastic tube with an opening you squeeze the sunscreen through. Now, it does make it easier to get all of the material out- but it also makes it easier to contaminate the sunscreen. Originally a selling point of this product (and others in the 100% pure line) was the glass container and the pump that helped keep the material airtight. I guess 100% pure is hoping we&#x27;ll forget about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite these discouraging things, I still use this product because it is the least uncomfortable sunscreen I can find. Is it expensive- yes. The tiny tube alone means I have to repurchase often. Do I wish I could go back in time and stock up on the better version, before 100% Pure inexplicably sabotaged the product? Yes. But have I found anything out there that is better? No, not yet. If I do, I&#x27;ll update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/2014- Sadly, have not found anything better. Worse, my most recent order of this product, because it runs out pretty quickly, came to me with the cap loose, and the seal on the tube itself broken and leaking moisturizer. it smells sour. I bought it last month in preparation for travel, knowing the tube I was on would run out before I leave. Now I am going to have to try to order a new tube and hope that it&#x27;s freshness isn&#x27;t compromised. This is the third item of 100% products that I&#x27;ve ordered through Amazon that have gone bad before I received it.</li>
            <li> Really nice and THICK moisturizer, just make sure to not use to much other wise it can leave a white residue being that it is so thick, with this product a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels great on the skin too.</li>
            <li> I like this product - I mix it with another 100%pure moisturizer to get great coverage. It&#x27;s soothing and applies easily.</li>
