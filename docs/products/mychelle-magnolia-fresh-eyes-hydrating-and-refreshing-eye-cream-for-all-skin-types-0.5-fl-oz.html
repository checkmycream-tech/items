            <li>However, I think if you are looking for a product that reduces lines or puffiness this may not be the best option.</li>
            <li>and I think in that respect this is a great product.</li>
            <li>, the coloring is so good</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>However, this stuff, the Magnolia Eye gel, is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s honestly been about 20 years since I&#x27;ve had a product work</li>
            <li>but when I do work some of Mychelle&#x27;s products in my budget, I can honestly say that I notice a visible (and texture) difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have this product 2 stars because I had actually liked the product</li>
            <li>I had contacted the company and they won&#x27;t refund me or work some kind of exchange either.  </li>
            <li>I tried this in a sample before I purchased, so I knew that I liked it.  </li>
            <li>However, I was not overly impressed with this particular item.  </li>
            <li>It has helped me to find new things I like and figure out what works best for me.</li>
            <li>I love how this goes on so silky and smooth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many eye creams, even the MyChelle Fabulous Eyes, which feels nice when you apply it.  </li>
            <li>It is also organic, and with as many allergies as I have I am not allergic to this gel.</li>
            <li>Our skin is our largest organ and can absorb both nutrients and toxins via the skin so it would make sense that we do our best to find products that will HELP our skin both now and in the future without compromising our health in the longrun.  </li>
            <li>that kicked up a bunch of who knows what that has many people in my area sneezing and sniffling...</li>
            <li>goodness!! :-)      </li>
            <li>When they do, I&#x27;ll be one of the first to sign up because with the 15% discount in addition to Amazon&#x27;s competitive pricing, it will be offered at the best price that I am aware of.  </li>
            <li>We love the ingrediance and the affect-</li>
            <li>I love MyChelle products</li>
            <li>I plan on continuing use for 2-3 months to wait for more results.</li>
            <li>It does a much better job calming puffiness</li>
            <li>And I love the fact that has no chemicals.  </li>
            <li>but it IS worth keeping on hand!!)    </li>
            <li>It is too strong and caused a chemical peel on my eyelids</li>
            <li>If you have puffiness under your eyes, I strongly suggest you look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I used to be a HUGE fan of a gel formula by Ultima II that they no longer make...</li>
            <li>I use with the Fabulous Eye Cream.</li>
            <li>They are definitely more evident when I&#x27;m not sleeping or eating well as my allergies start to act up</li>
            <li>but once I got married and started a family, &#x27;good skin care&#x27; is something that simply is not worked into the family budget each month</li>
            <li>You can also put your make-up on immediately after putting on yhe MyChelle Fresh Eyes.</li>
            <li>so here I am shopping around and tried a sample of Mychelle&#x27;s Magnolia Fresh Eyes in the store.  </li>
            <li>MyChelle&#x27;s Magnolia&#x27;s Fresh Eyes is one product that I am</li>
            <li>I apply the gel until is absorbed, followed by MyChelle Eye Cream.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that you don&#x27;t need a lot of product for coverage (be careful when squeezing...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m 31 years old and have had puffy eyes for most of my life.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product from whole foods and had 2 samples and was convinced that it was working so without checking here</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer for the delicate under eye area</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t be supporting their products again.</li>
            <li>they offer you a 15% discount if you get set up to have it delivered on a regular schedule (which is a GREAT deal)...as of today 2/1/10, so far Amazon has NOT YET included this specific product in their \\&quot;Subcribe &amp; Save\\&quot; program</li>
            <li>but sure enough when I got in the car, I looked in the mirror and to my astonishment, my eyes looked &#x27;normal&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>We have had strong winds here recently (Texas)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that it did much to improve the appearance of the skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li>(It does seem like it costs as much</li>
            <li>I bought this after seeing a review of this on a blog at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t really noticed it do too much yet.  </li>
            <li>I tend to get too much oftentimes)</li>
            <li>I even sampled it at Whole Foods before I bought it.</li>
            <li>So the dark circles in addition to puffiness around the eyes (again allergies or the lymph system being congested) just exasperates the issues and make my big, brown beautiful eyes instead squinchy, puffy with a huge dark shadow under it.      </li>
            <li>One other thing I would like to mention is that I love that all MyChelle products can be bought in trial/travel packs.  </li>
            <li>A HUGE added bonus is that the Mychelle line is &#x27;clean&#x27; and is free of common toxic ingredients so common in most skin care products.      </li>
            <li>I do use a lot of MyChelle products, and like them a lot, but the Magnolia Eyes definitely is review worthy.  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m older and a smidge wiser</li>
            <li>As I get older it seems like the puffiness worsens.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>For most of the other MyChelle products, Amazon offers a Subscribe &amp; Save offer...</li>
            <li>I turned right around and ran back in the store to buy a bottle of thispure</li>
            <li>It feels good when you put it on, sort of calming and awakening at the same time, and I notice a true difference when my eyes are puffy, however it&#x27;s made only minimal difference with dark circles.</li>
            <li>Makes my lower lids feel so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I am 75 Years old</li>
            <li>I like natural, non-toxic MyChelle products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if its something that will be more noticed later (as my skin tends to take some time adjusting to products)</li>
            <li>it would INSTANTLY shrink the puffiness down right before my very eyes.  </li>
            <li>I do like MyChelle Products but the Fresh Eyes is a HUGE disappointment.</li>
            <li>first I shelled out $38 bucks and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for about a month a half religiously</li>
            <li>but the pump broke within the first few pumps.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure if I would purchase again, given the price I was hoping for a little more.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations of this product due to</li>
            <li>I have a dry dehydrated wrinkle eyes and early 40yrs.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am on my second bottle! I love how this goes on so silky and smooth! Makes my lower lids feel so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying stuff on Amazon for years, but have never reviewed a product.  I just had to for this one.  I do use a lot of MyChelle products, and like them a lot, but the Magnolia Eyes definitely is review worthy.  I&#x27;ve had dark circles for years under my eyes, and my lids have always been veiny, red, and have looked damaged with out eye make-up on.  I&#x27;ve used many eye creams, even the MyChelle Fabulous Eyes, which feels nice when you apply it.  However, this stuff, the Magnolia Eye gel, is amazing.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, and already my eyes look so different.  The redness has decreased dramatically, and the circles under my eyes are actually gone!  I feel like my eyes just got younger, the coloring is so good I actually went a day without eye make-up.  I only wish I had found this stuff earlier. One other thing I would like to mention is that I love that all MyChelle products can be bought in trial/travel packs.  It has helped me to find new things I like and figure out what works best for me.</li>
            <li> I used this product for almost a month with absolutely no results. It did nothing for the bags or dark circles. It was an expensive purchase for a useless product.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and feels like it is firming your eyes immediately. You can also put your make-up on immediately after putting on yhe MyChelle Fresh Eyes. It is also organic, and with as many allergies as I have I am not allergic to this gel. I LOVE it! I totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and find it works for me.  I am 75 Years old and I do not have any crows feet.  Yeah!!</li>
            <li> I honestly do not see that much improvement under my eyes. This is a great moisturizer for the delicate under eye area and I think in that respect this is a great product.

I used to be a HUGE fan of a gel formula by Ultima II that they no longer make...it would INSTANTLY shrink the puffiness down right before my very eyes.  Now that I&#x27;m older and a smidge wiser, I realize that it&#x27;s not only imperative that we know what we put IN our bodies but also what we put ON our bodies as well.  Our skin is our largest organ and can absorb both nutrients and toxins via the skin so it would make sense that we do our best to find products that will HELP our skin both now and in the future without compromising our health in the longrun.  I think I have tried just about every eye gel / serum / cream to help reduce any residual dark circles or puffiness that exist (despite eating and sleeping well).  It&#x27;s honestly been about 20 years since I&#x27;ve had a product work THIS well in reducing the eye puffiness on my eyes.  We have had strong winds here recently (Texas) that kicked up a bunch of who knows what that has many people in my area sneezing and sniffling...when this happens, even though by clearing up my health and diet, it&#x27;s improved dramatically, I still suffer from allergic reaction when the dry winds kick in...so here I am shopping around and tried a sample of Mychelle&#x27;s Magnolia Fresh Eyes in the store.  I THOUGHT I felt the puffiness go down within minutes but thought it was in my head but sure enough when I got in the car, I looked in the mirror and to my astonishment, my eyes looked &#x27;normal&#x27;.  So what&#x27;s a girl to do?!  I turned right around and ran back in the store to buy a bottle of thispure goodness!! :-)      I used to be obsessed with beauty skin care products but once I got married and started a family, &#x27;good skin care&#x27; is something that simply is not worked into the family budget each month but when I do work some of Mychelle&#x27;s products in my budget, I can honestly say that I notice a visible (and texture) difference in my skin.  MyChelle&#x27;s Magnolia&#x27;s Fresh Eyes is one product that I am NEVER without now!!  I don&#x27;t need it on a daily basis so I do alternate it with some other products but on those days where I could use a little help in the eye area, this stuff is liquid gold!! (It does seem like it costs as much but it IS worth keeping on hand!!)    A HUGE added bonus is that the Mychelle line is &#x27;clean&#x27; and is free of common toxic ingredients so common in most skin care products.      For most of the other MyChelle products, Amazon offers a Subscribe &amp; Save offer...they offer you a 15% discount if you get set up to have it delivered on a regular schedule (which is a GREAT deal)...as of today 2/1/10, so far Amazon has NOT YET included this specific product in their \\&quot;Subcribe &amp; Save\\&quot; program but I HOPE that they will soon!!! When they do, I&#x27;ll be one of the first to sign up because with the 15% discount in addition to Amazon&#x27;s competitive pricing, it will be offered at the best price that I am aware of.  So Amazon, PLEASE add this to your Subscribe &amp; Save program SOON!!!!     To those wondering still if you should try this product or not, if you suffer from puffy eyes, this product is a winner! It&#x27;s one of the few products out there that you can truly see an immediate difference instead of wondering if it&#x27;s working or not while you are on your 3rd bottle...</li>
            <li> It is too strong and caused a chemical peel on my eyelids</li>
            <li> I have this product 2 stars because I had actually liked the product but the pump broke within the first few pumps.  I had contacted the company and they won&#x27;t refund me or work some kind of exchange either.  Basically they don&#x27;t care.  I don&#x27;t be supporting their products again.</li>
            <li> I have a dry dehydrated wrinkle eyes and early 40yrs. I apply the gel until is absorbed, followed by MyChelle Eye Cream. I gave only 4 stars because I have been using this product for only three weeks. For now,  it helps to my morning baggy eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing a review of this on a blog at Whole Foods. It had mixed reviews but for me I can say it works on the puffy eyes. You only need a small drop if the serum and I use it morning &amp; night. I&#x27;m 54 and it worked.</li>
            <li> We love the ingrediance and the affect- We use twice a day and definitely see the benefits withing a couple days</li>
            <li> I love MyChelle products so I thought I would go out on a limb and add something else to my routine.  This product claims to help with puffy eyes/dark circles but I haven&#x27;t really noticed it do too much yet.  I&#x27;m not sure if its something that will be more noticed later (as my skin tends to take some time adjusting to products) so we&#x27;ll have to wait and see....  The good thing is that you don&#x27;t need a lot of product for coverage (be careful when squeezing... I tend to get too much oftentimes)</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product from whole foods and had 2 samples and was convinced that it was working so without checking here first I shelled out $38 bucks and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for about a month a half religiously, I saw no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 31 years old and have had puffy eyes for most of my life. As I get older it seems like the puffiness worsens.&lt;br /&gt;This product did squat for me. If you have puffiness under your eyes, I strongly suggest you look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping that this product at least helped with preventing crows feet because I still don&#x27;t have any (knock on wood!!).</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a few weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen drastic results.  I plan on continuing use for 2-3 months to wait for more results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye gel for a few years.  I put it under my eyes before bed time.  I then apply my eye cream.  I have noticed less puffness under my eyes.  I had stopped using it for awhile and the puffiness was coming back.  NEVER AGAIN...,, I will always use MyChelle Magnolia eyes.  P.S.  keep in fridge.... Anna m.</li>
            <li> I do like MyChelle Products but the Fresh Eyes is a HUGE disappointment. I saw NO difference in my eyes. It did not live up to&lt;br /&gt;projected results and expectations. Eyes were puffy with usage. It is too pricey for the lack of results. I even sampled it at Whole Foods before I bought it. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations of this product due to it&#x27;s price.  It does a much better job calming puffiness then it does banishing dark circles. It feels good when you put it on, sort of calming and awakening at the same time, and I notice a true difference when my eyes are puffy, however it&#x27;s made only minimal difference with dark circles.</li>
            <li> I finally found an eye product that I can see results.  I tried this in a sample before I purchased, so I knew that I liked it.  And I love the fact that has no chemicals.  I use with the Fabulous Eye Cream.</li>
