    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this brand for years, it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I just realized that this brush is has been in use for around 3 years (after losing one of the pair when traveling) and is still in great shape.</li>
            <li>It feels great in your hand,</li>
            <li>The length is great.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled to find a replacement!  </li>
            <li>Amazingly, they did not brake.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t slip from my hand, the grip is nice.</li>
            <li>this is a very good product and performs very well.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a medium - soft brush, this is probably perfect for your needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, March 2016 -</li>
            <li>I love this shower brush.</li>
            <li>This is a great medium bristle back brush.</li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable.  </li>
            <li>a great back brush.  </li>
            <li>My original went on deployment with me on the ship and it stood the test of time.  </li>
            <li>my husband strongly insisted that i get an exact replacement.  </li>
            <li>I have to think that there may be more than one type of brush being sold here, as this brush lathers very well, does not break easily, and is certainly long-lasting.</li>
            <li>It was nice that it came in a 2 pack, because I was able to give my husband the other one.</li>
            <li>Worth the chance to see if you like it.</li>
            <li>I bought the pack of two because I had read that several of this price range were cheap and broke easily.</li>
            <li>Handle broke off the first time my husband use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad there was a 2nd one in the package.</li>
            <li>Fairly firm which i like and seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li>Another bonus is that it is easier to clean than natural bristle brushes.</li>
            <li>I would certainly avoid purchasing any products from them again.</li>
            <li>After about a week of &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; use, the head of the first one split in two during normal use.  </li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t use too much pressure.</li>
            <li>I dropped it many, many times and it only has a small chip in the tip that doesn&#x27;t impair usage.  </li>
            <li>When I first received them, I though maybe the bristles might be too soft, but found out that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li>It is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>They were just the right strength for my use, which is back, legs etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is, however, a bit too soft for my tastes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this brush for nearly five years</li>
            <li>I prefer the feel of natural bristles, but the wood handled brushes I&#x27;ve bought fall apart.</li>
            <li>The brush is fairly soft.  </li>
            <li>I cracked the old handle.  </li>
            <li>the brush is stiff but still comfortable.  </li>
            <li>He is very picky about back brushes being too light or hard bristled.</li>
            <li>we had an old one that broke after several years.  </li>
            <li>The handle broke near the brush head after only a month of use.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great medium bristle back brush. It was nice that it came in a 2 pack, because I was able to give my husband the other one. He is very picky about back brushes being too light or hard bristled. He likes this one as well. Another bonus is that it is easier to clean than natural bristle brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes have held up well.  But they are to stiff and rough for my liking.  I will try a softer brush next time.</li>
            <li> I was a little leery at first because this product was a little more expensive than some others.  It is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> Plenty or reach to hit the middle of my back.  Bristles are stiff enough to get the job done and not so stiff as to be uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable.  The length is long enough to reach every inch of my back.  While I can feel the bristles exfoliating, they are not overwhelmingly scratchy.  I like the look and color as well.</li>
            <li> This brush is well made, and durable. No complaints about the build quality. It is, however, a bit too soft for my tastes. I prefer a medium stiffness brush, and this falls just below that. If you are looking for a medium - soft brush, this is probably perfect for your needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, March 2016 - I just realized that this brush is has been in use for around 3 years (after losing one of the pair when traveling) and is still in great shape. I was about to order a replacement (3 years is too long to use a brush, me thinks) and saw a lot of negative reviews. I have to think that there may be more than one type of brush being sold here, as this brush lathers very well, does not break easily, and is certainly long-lasting.</li>
            <li> This is a piece of junk! Handle broke off the first time my husband use it. I would never buy this again.</li>
            <li> We bought two.  After about a week of &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; use, the head of the first one split in two during normal use.  Two weeks later the head of the second one split off as I was laying it on a ledge in the shower.  Other reviewers note the same sort of issue yet the company continues to sell what is clearly a very poorly made product.  Why?  I would certainly avoid purchasing any products from them again.</li>
            <li> Do not be mislead by the picture.  Brushes I received DO NOT have a gripper handled.  I was ordering from Amazon to get brush WITH gripper handle. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Fairly firm which i like and seems to do a good job. Worth the chance to see if you like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned one of these I bought from BB&amp;B. It doesn&#x27;t slip from my hand, the grip is nice. I&#x27;ve dropped it without breaking it quite a few times; just a little chip. About to buy another now.</li>
            <li> I have this and was going to replace after it broke in two.  From the reviews, I&#x27;ll look for something else.</li>
            <li> a great back brush.  we had an old one that broke after several years.  my husband strongly insisted that i get an exact replacement.  the brush is stiff but still comfortable.  he loves the length of the handle.  this is a very good product and performs very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for nearly five years and I&#x27;m thrilled to find a replacement!  It feels great in your hand, the bristles are firm but soft and it gets the job done.  I used it every day and it has lasted well through the years.  My original went on deployment with me on the ship and it stood the test of time.  I dropped it many, many times and it only has a small chip in the tip that doesn&#x27;t impair usage.  Just recently however, the handle broke while I was using it.  It broke in the middle of the handle at the rubber grip.  After five years of use I can&#x27;t complain at all.  I was so bummed at first and hated the thought of having to get used to another style of brush.  I&#x27;m getting my replacement immediately!</li>
            <li> It hangs in my shower, but I don&#x27;t use it. It doesn&#x27;t lather so it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing the job for which I bought it.</li>
            <li> I love this shower brush. I&#x27;ve bought this brand for years, it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve used. One tip to share, I break the brush handle in half to use it because the handle is so long as is.</li>
            <li> The product title is \\&quot;Feng Shui Back Brush with Ergonomic Grip Handle - Wood/Frosted Green\\&quot;. It is not made of wood and does not look like wood. I like the long handle and the grip. I prefer the feel of natural bristles, but the wood handled brushes I&#x27;ve bought fall apart. Update: The handle broke near the brush head after only a month of use. I never dropped it otherwise abused it. I&#x27;m glad there was a 2nd one in the package. We&#x27;ll see if two last as long as one wood one.</li>
            <li> This brush is very sturdy as opposed to someone&#x27;s negative comment. My 3 y.o played star wars with her granpa using these brushes. Amazingly, they did not brake. The bristles are not too hard; just the right way.</li>
            <li> Repeat purchase.  The length is great.  The brush is fairly soft.  some place along the line I cracked the old handle.  So don&#x27;t use too much pressure.</li>
            <li> When I first received them, I though maybe the bristles might be too soft, but found out that wasn&#x27;t the case. They were just the right strength for my use, which is back, legs etc.&lt;br /&gt; I bought the pack of two because I had read that several of this price range were cheap and broke easily. Again, not the case. I have dropped the one I&#x27;m using several times and it&#x27;s held together just fine.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Not as pictured -- no silicon grip on the stem.</li>
