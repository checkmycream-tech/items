            <li>IT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would love to finish it and buy another one</li>
            <li>I will try anything until I find something I love...</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how much better my skin looks and felt.  </li>
            <li>So i will take ti more.</li>
            <li>this size can be bought for $135 at many places.  </li>
            <li>It cleans and takes off make up well but is so overrated as it has not made my skin better or clearer.</li>
            <li>Just remember that it spreads more as it warms up.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s something magical about the muslin and,</li>
            <li>( most of us can&#x27;t afford her facials, so we can just take our products and lye down in her salon,do our own faces, and compare ours to her clients!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>at first, I thought it was kind of a gimmick.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a clarisonic, which is really just a brush that cleans better than most things.  </li>
            <li>I use this cleanser at night every day and it does remove all my makeup, my skin feel so clean , smooth and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>and I am sure it&#x27;s not just good genes but using this cleanser every single morning and night.  </li>
            <li>My skin looked and felt better after the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>This cloth feels better than the clarisonic, dries fast and costs about 50 cents a cloth.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>Although the price is pretty high, but there is no other better make up remover than it!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much at all.  </li>
            <li>EXACTLY</li>
            <li>this is my first time buy the cleanser.i use it for couple days.and</li>
            <li>I admit that I am a skin care junkie, simply because I was blessed by the gorgeous parents from the middle East and Greece.....</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this cleanser and after using for a week couldn&#x27;t buy more fast enough.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend, she said.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I even went so far as to give away my 2 new bottles of my other&lt;br</li>
            <li>this web site purports to sell it a a huge discount...that is not true....</li>
            <li>After using them I realized they have just the right amount of texture without being too rough.  </li>
            <li>I just recently bought a jar for my 30-year old niece</li>
            <li>I  first saw this presented on air in QVC few months ago and recommended by one of my friend.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and the muslin cloth really helps to clear the pores and exfoliate your skin.</li>

            <li> yesterday I went to sephora ,I saw the same product .it is a big different with the one i use.i think it is fake</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s just a small dimple in the middle.  </li>
            <li> then all your other products work tenfold!!!!  </li>

            <li> Love this cleanser. Method exfoliates daily, ingredients keep skin moisturizer while cleansing. Stock item in my skincare regime.</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T WRITE MANY REVIEWS...I AM A PRODUCT JUNKIE AND HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING! I GET REGULAR FACIALS AND DO CHEMICAL PEELS. THIS CLEANSER HAS LEFT MY PORES LOOKING EXACTLY LIKE I JUST HAD A FACIAL - I ACTUALLY CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE IT! MY FACE IS CLEANER THAN I HAVE EXPERIENCED WITH ANY PRODUCT ON THE MARKET.&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE LARGE PORES AND AM ALWAYS IN SEARCH OF THE BEST CLEANSER - THIS IS IT!</li>
            <li> one of Korean actress used it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s way cheaper than Korea.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would love to finish it and buy another one</li>
            <li> why？tell me why？expire？</li>
            <li> As of this writing I have only used this facial cleaner three times, but I will never use anything else ever again.  I&#x27;m somewhat of a beauty product junkie...I will try anything until I find something I love...then I stick with it.  This I&#x27;m sticking with.  My skin looked and felt better after the first time I used it.  I have very sensitive skin so I have to be really careful with what I use.  I was amazed at how much better my skin looks and felt.  Definitely worth it.  And you need such a small amount; a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I admit that I am a skin care junkie, simply because I was blessed by the gorgeous parents from the middle East and Greece.....BUT even flawless skin needs care to stay that way....Eve Lom&#x27;s skin cleanser is known the world over!!!  And I now know why!!!  I was hooked on another cleanser, and decided to try this out.!!  Boy, I was stunned at what all this cleanser did beyond cleaning...This one is a keeper!!  I even went so far as to give away my 2 new bottles of my other&lt;br /&gt;cleanser---that, in itself, makes a big statement....I have finally found a &amp;#34;for the rest of my life&amp;#34; cleanser....It takes every bit of 4 minutes to cleanse....then all your other products work tenfold!!!!  I look forward to dong my face!!!  When you can see visible results after one use, you too will be hooked.....And we can all get together and give each other compliments, form a cult following, and one day we&#x27;ll go to London to see Eve.( most of us can&#x27;t afford her facials, so we can just take our products and lye down in her salon,do our own faces, and compare ours to her clients!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good~I like it.I will be back soon.So i will take ti more.It&#x27;s very very good.It&#x27;s very very nice.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, the best cleanser ever.  I have been using this for 15 years.  While I may change other products, this is one that I will never change.  I just recently bought a jar for my 30-year old niece and she is now hooked.  It is for all skin types.  You cannot go wrong with this.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser ever made for any skin type.  I have been using this for over 20 years and am about to turn 60 with skin that looks 40....and I am sure it&#x27;s not just good genes but using this cleanser every single morning and night.  Highly recommend.  Just one thing....this web site purports to sell it a a huge discount...that is not true....this size can be bought for $135 at many places.  This is not a discount at all.</li>
            <li> I  first saw this presented on air in QVC few months ago and recommended by one of my friend. I am a repeat customer of Eve Lom Cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product! I use this cleanser at night every day and it does remove all my makeup, my skin feel so clean , smooth and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you amazon for keeping this is in your line and for the good price!</li>
            <li> Wonderful cleanser, no wonder it is award-winning. A little goes a long way, and the muslin cloth really helps to clear the pores and exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it so much and use everyday. Highly recommend, she said.</li>
            <li> It cleans and takes off make up well but is so overrated as it has not made my skin better or clearer.</li>
            <li> The is a great product!  You need to follow the directions and do the facial exercise and you will see your skin improve!</li>
            <li> Love Eve LOM a lot! Although the price is pretty high, but there is no other better make up remover than it!</li>
            <li> Best Product, love how smooth and clean my skin feels after use.</li>
            <li> It does a really good of taking off all of your make-up.  It does leave your face feeling good afterwards.  It does not take off the mascara at all so you still have to use a separate remover for that.</li>
            <li> I stongly recommend this cleanser.</li>
            <li> BEST CLEANSER ON THE PLANET..... WILL NEVER CHANGE. CUSTOMER FOR LIFE !!!</li>
            <li> eve lom good cleanser</li>
            <li> this is my first time buy the cleanser.i use it for couple days.and yesterday I went to sephora ,I saw the same product .it is a big different with the one i use.i think it is fake or it is expired!i want to return. But I already throw away the box! What can I do!</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your skin feel soooo good.  You don&#x27;t need to use very much at all.  Just remember that it spreads more as it warms up.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 3 weeks and there&#x27;s just a small dimple in the middle.  One thing I didn&#x27;t know, it comes with muslin cloths.  I bought some not knowing this.  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s something magical about the muslin and, at first, I thought it was kind of a gimmick.  After using them I realized they have just the right amount of texture without being too rough.  I&#x27;ve had a clarisonic, which is really just a brush that cleans better than most things.  This cloth feels better than the clarisonic, dries fast and costs about 50 cents a cloth. I received a sample of this cleanser and after using for a week couldn&#x27;t buy more fast enough.</li>
            <li> Does take off your makeup but has a strange, mud-like consistency and smell.  Guess I prefer the traditional.  Not for me.</li>
