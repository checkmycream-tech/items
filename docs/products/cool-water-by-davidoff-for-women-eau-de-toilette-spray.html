            <li>First off, I LOVE THE SMELL OF COOL WATER PERFUME!!!  </li>
            <li>I love my Davidoff Cool Water and so does my husband!</li>
            <li>Love love love cool water.</li>
            <li>I have been using cool waters for many years and will be for many more to come.</li>
            <li>EDT spray is a very fine mist, so easy to apply as a light &amp;#34;spritz&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Nice light, clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>This has kind of a &#x27;laundry fresh&#x27;</li>
            <li>Biggest bottle of cool water I&#x27;ve ever seen!</li>
            <li>this has a clean spring smell that I love</li>
            <li>The smell is not as strong as that of the department store bottles and within an hour you can&#x27;t even smell a hint of the perfume anymore.</li>
            <li>Cool refreshing like a summer breeze.</li>
            <li>I love Cool Water by Davidoff.  </li>
            <li>I love it, it&#x27;s cool</li>
            <li>My wife loves Cool Water (and has for years), so I am glad to order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love Cool Water.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light and refreshing scent, clean soapy smell.</li>
            <li>the cool water smell very fresh, I love it.</li>
            <li>I received Cool Water as a gift and liked it so much, I bought myself more of it.  </li>
            <li>The fragance lasts all day,  strong enough, and &#x60;great Price.</li>
            <li>I was so thrilled to find it at such a good price and receive it so quickly.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price on this huge container of perfume.</li>
            <li>When I saw the price and the size available on Amazon</li>
            <li>Fragrance is clean, not too strong.  </li>
            <li>and I really enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li>This perfume has a light welcoming fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is such a great deal I had to buy them the 6.7 ounce</li>
            <li>but the bottle is filled with something that smells like alcohol.  </li>
            <li>I got an excelent product for the best price, every female that I know loves this perfume and it is as they say the real thing and not a nockoff</li>
            <li>I was so pleased to be able to purchase such a big bottle of Cool Water for the price - very happy with my order.</li>
            <li>Clean and light, one spray will do.</li>
            <li>Light and breezy, not too sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>Thank you amazon, bought this perfume for my friend and it is original, she loves it.</li>
            <li>this is sure to make your date hot if he&#x27;s not allergic.</li>
            <li>Very fresh and cool.</li>
            <li>I love cool water and my wife loves it too, I am happy with this product i use it everyday now</li>
            <li>Is a birthday, anniversary, or special day coming up for your wife or girlfriend?</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light, fresh &amp; clean smell.</li>
            <li>I am a cool water fan and got this for my wife and we both like the way it smells.</li>
            <li>Light, fresh, and lasts.</li>
            <li>I have worn Cool Water for years.</li>
            <li>Yes, this is real Davidoff CoolWater; the genuine stuff!</li>
            <li>BUT my daughter loved it just the same.</li>
            <li>I am very upset and would love a refund.</li>
            <li>Loved it, bottle was bigger than I thought.</li>
            <li>But the bottle was not quite full</li>
            <li>have ordered Cool Water before and have never had this problem</li>
            <li>I have worn Cool Water for years</li>
            <li>so cool</li>
            <li>Cool Water By Davidoff For Women Edt Spray 6.7 Oz.</li>
            <li>Wrap up a bottle of Davidoff&#x27;s Cool Water for women.</li>
            <li>Then I went on amazon for something else but priced cool water just for kicks.</li>
            <li>I purchased Cool Water Cologne for Women as a Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li>I have been wearing Cool Water since 1998 and</li>
            <li>Cool Water is pretty much my summer fragrance - it&#x27;s a nice fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>It smells so fresh and clean, but also &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It was a super deal...</li>
            <li>The wife likes this brand so She was very happy to get it for Christmas, I just recently bought her a refill as she was running low.  </li>
            <li>Came quick and undamaged.</li>
            <li>I got my perfume fairly quickly (second order got a larger bottle) and I just love the scent, and my boyfriend just adores it!!!</li>
            <li>my wife liket it very much!</li>
            <li>very grateful and pleased with you, thank you very much for your help</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this previous years, and have always been happy with it.</li>
            <li>This smells more like alcohol and old spice.</li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift and they were over joyed with the gift and was surprised that it didn&#x27;t cost a lot more than it did.</li>
            <li>Wish there was option to get purse-size bottle with this, great size for everyday use, better pricing than available in discount or regular stores</li>
            <li>This does not smell like authentic Cool Water fragrance that I have worn for the last 5 years.</li>
            <li>There is absolutely nothing I can do with this 6.7 ounce bottle of non- Cool Water.</li>
            <li>the dry down smelled great on me, now I am not so sure.</li>
            <li>Beautiful fragrance and last long...</li>
            <li>I have since thrown this in the trash and had to spend extra money buying the authentic bottle from retail stores that actually smells like the real Cool Water.</li>
            <li>For me to present it to her on Christmas as one of the biggest bottles that she has ever received of this particular perfume made it that much more special to her.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The look of the bottle is so pretty</li>
            <li>&amp; Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I received my shipment exactly 24 hours after ordering it, without paying the overnight shipping costs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The 6.7oz one was exactly to my expectation.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that I got such a big bottle, way more than I would have gotten</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal!  </li>
            <li>I was getting low on my favorite cologne and was comparing prices around as I shopped.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>this is the first time I have been duped.  </li>
            <li>Good but the perfume inside the bottle appears to be missing a 1/5 portion.</li>
            <li>Clean &amp; classy!</li>
            <li>Glad I could find it in such a large bottle.</li>
            <li>This was brand new and you will not beat the price anywhere with free standard shipping, and even going with the free shipping option It arrived FAST!</li>
            <li>not the sweet smell that regular cool water has.</li>
            <li>I love this scent - light, sensual,  and can be worn year round.</li>
            <li>This is the largest bottle of Cool Water I have ever seen, so I was pleasantly surprised when I received the package.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells good but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long on you</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy it again</li>
            <li>and I have a sensitivity to certain smells</li>
            <li>My wife love the smooth yet long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>I always liked Cool Water and the bottle is actually larger than what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try this fragrance because I heard so much about it.</li>
            <li>The real thing.</li>
            <li>buy and was at our home very quickley.</li>
            <li>&amp; I found her very condescending.</li>
            <li>Will probably get this one again if its still available next time around.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The price is fantastic but the smell didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Very disapointed, was a Christmas gift to boot.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen reviews saying that the bottle was partially used or that it didn&#x27;t smell like true Cool Water.</li>
            <li>my local Macy&#x27;s price was more than double, my wife love it, she said it&#x27;s a new packing comparing with the old one, which apparently had a darker blue color, and it&#x27;s really light!</li>
            <li>100% Original&#x27;ve already bought a couple of times and are totally reliable I recommend</li>
            <li>It was such a great deal, I got so much for so little!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a GIANT bottle of davidoff cool water perfume  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s genuine, not a fake imitation.</li>
            <li>This is a great smelling perfume and the only thing I never really liked about it was the price.  </li>
            <li>My wife was looking for a new perfume we found this cool water which is a really big size 6.7 Oz.</li>
            <li>Arrived promptly as promised&amp;#62; Highly recommend</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of hard to hold onto</li>
            <li>The bottle we received was in fine condition as expected since we ordered it new.</li>
            <li>I would wear the year round as it makes you feel refreshed and if you have the blues this is a sure fire pick me up.</li>
            <li>The  box was not sealed in celophane as most perfumes are packaged and there is about one inch of product missing from the bottle.  </li>
            <li>simple, fresh, and understated; not overpowering or abrasive.</li>
            <li>She is enjoying the fragrance, as she uses it just about everyday.</li>
            <li>It is not returanble and therefore not recommended for people who have not used this fragrance before, but a must buy for all those who love this product and have tried it previously!</li>
            <li>My wife easily goes through two of the smaller bottles a year, so it was nice to find this larger size and for the less than what I would normally pay for the smaller bottle at a department store.</li>
            <li>I would like to return this for a refund as I feel this product was used and then sold as new.  </li>
            <li>When I first opened  the bottle was obvious that was already used, the box of the perfume does not  even package with the plastic bundle, clasic of any perfume.</li>
            <li>I got a lot of complements when I have it on bec of the fresh and mild scent , and the price is much cheaper than those with a very strong unpleasant brand name!</li>
            <li>I have been wearing cool water for 10 years and this is definitely NOT the same!</li>
            <li>It is kind of hard to hold and spray at the same time with one hand though.  </li>
            <li>and that is something for someone as old as myself.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t imagine a young girl wearing it.</li>
            <li>The cost of this 6.7 oz bottle was reasonable compared to smaller bottles.  </li>
            <li>My wife has used it for a few years; we both enjoy the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Getting harder to find but worth the effort.</li>
            <li>This is a watered down version of Cool Water.</li>
            <li>I can barely smell it.  </li>
            <li>I have worn Cool Water Perfume for the past 15 years and have always bought it from department stores.</li>
            <li>Cool Water for Women is the only EDT Spray that I can use because my husband hates the smell of perfume, it drives him absolutley crazy, but he loves the smell of Cool Water, go figure.....</li>
            <li>It has a strong, unappealing smell....</li>
            <li>The prize was a really good deal received it in a couple of days could not say anything bad even if I tried.</li>

            <li> First off, I LOVE THE SMELL OF COOL WATER PERFUME!!!  </li>
            <li> I love my Davidoff Cool Water and so does my husband!</li>
            <li> Love love love cool water.</li>
            <li> I have been using cool waters for many years and will be for many more to come.</li>
            <li> EDT spray is a very fine mist, so easy to apply as a light &amp;#34;spritz&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Nice light, clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> This has kind of a &#x27;laundry fresh&#x27;</li>
            <li> Biggest bottle of cool water I&#x27;ve ever seen!</li>
            <li> this has a clean spring smell that I love</li>
            <li> The smell is not as strong as that of the department store bottles and within an hour you can&#x27;t even smell a hint of the perfume anymore.</li>
            <li> Cool refreshing like a summer breeze.</li>
            <li> I love Cool Water by Davidoff.  </li>
            <li> I love it, it&#x27;s cool</li>
            <li> My wife loves Cool Water (and has for years), so I am glad to order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love Cool Water.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light and refreshing scent, clean soapy smell.</li>
            <li> the cool water smell very fresh, I love it.</li>
            <li> I received Cool Water as a gift and liked it so much, I bought myself more of it.  </li>
            <li> The fragance lasts all day,  strong enough, and &#x60;great Price.</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled to find it at such a good price and receive it so quickly.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price on this huge container of perfume.</li>
            <li> When I saw the price and the size available on Amazon</li>
            <li> Fragrance is clean, not too strong.  </li>
            <li> and I really enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a light welcoming fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is such a great deal I had to buy them the 6.7 ounce</li>
            <li> but the bottle is filled with something that smells like alcohol.  </li>
            <li> I got an excelent product for the best price, every female that I know loves this perfume and it is as they say the real thing and not a nockoff</li>
            <li> I was so pleased to be able to purchase such a big bottle of Cool Water for the price - very happy with my order.</li>
            <li> Clean and light, one spray will do.</li>
            <li> Light and breezy, not too sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> Thank you amazon, bought this perfume for my friend and it is original, she loves it.</li>
            <li> this is sure to make your date hot if he&#x27;s not allergic.</li>
            <li> Very fresh and cool.</li>
            <li> I love cool water and my wife loves it too, I am happy with this product i use it everyday now</li>
            <li> Is a birthday, anniversary, or special day coming up for your wife or girlfriend?</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light, fresh &amp; clean smell.</li>
            <li> I am a cool water fan and got this for my wife and we both like the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Light, fresh, and lasts.</li>
            <li> I have worn Cool Water for years.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is real Davidoff CoolWater; the genuine stuff!</li>
            <li> BUT my daughter loved it just the same.</li>
            <li> I am very upset and would love a refund.</li>
            <li> Loved it, bottle was bigger than I thought.</li>
            <li> But the bottle was not quite full</li>
            <li> have ordered Cool Water before and have never had this problem</li>
            <li> I have worn Cool Water for years</li>
            <li> so cool</li>
            <li> Cool Water By Davidoff For Women Edt Spray 6.7 Oz.</li>
            <li> Wrap up a bottle of Davidoff&#x27;s Cool Water for women.</li>
            <li> Then I went on amazon for something else but priced cool water just for kicks.</li>
            <li> I purchased Cool Water Cologne for Women as a Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li> I have been wearing Cool Water since 1998 and</li>
            <li> Cool Water is pretty much my summer fragrance - it&#x27;s a nice fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> It smells so fresh and clean, but also &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It was a super deal...</li>
            <li> The wife likes this brand so She was very happy to get it for Christmas, I just recently bought her a refill as she was running low.  </li>
            <li> Came quick and undamaged.</li>
            <li> I got my perfume fairly quickly (second order got a larger bottle) and I just love the scent, and my boyfriend just adores it!!!</li>
            <li> my wife liket it very much!</li>
            <li> very grateful and pleased with you, thank you very much for your help</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this previous years, and have always been happy with it.</li>
            <li> This smells more like alcohol and old spice.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift and they were over joyed with the gift and was surprised that it didn&#x27;t cost a lot more than it did.</li>
            <li> Wish there was option to get purse-size bottle with this, great size for everyday use, better pricing than available in discount or regular stores</li>
            <li> This does not smell like authentic Cool Water fragrance that I have worn for the last 5 years.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely nothing I can do with this 6.7 ounce bottle of non- Cool Water.</li>
            <li> the dry down smelled great on me, now I am not so sure.</li>
            <li> Beautiful fragrance and last long...</li>
            <li> I have since thrown this in the trash and had to spend extra money buying the authentic bottle from retail stores that actually smells like the real Cool Water.</li>
            <li> For me to present it to her on Christmas as one of the biggest bottles that she has ever received of this particular perfume made it that much more special to her.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The look of the bottle is so pretty</li>
            <li> &amp; Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I received my shipment exactly 24 hours after ordering it, without paying the overnight shipping costs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The 6.7oz one was exactly to my expectation.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that I got such a big bottle, way more than I would have gotten</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal!  </li>
            <li> I was getting low on my favorite cologne and was comparing prices around as I shopped.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> this is the first time I have been duped.  </li>
            <li> Good but the perfume inside the bottle appears to be missing a 1/5 portion.</li>
            <li> Clean &amp; classy!</li>
            <li> Glad I could find it in such a large bottle.</li>
            <li> This was brand new and you will not beat the price anywhere with free standard shipping, and even going with the free shipping option It arrived FAST!</li>
            <li> not the sweet smell that regular cool water has.</li>
            <li> I love this scent - light, sensual,  and can be worn year round.</li>
            <li> This is the largest bottle of Cool Water I have ever seen, so I was pleasantly surprised when I received the package.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells good but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long on you</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy it again</li>
            <li> and I have a sensitivity to certain smells</li>
            <li> My wife love the smooth yet long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> I always liked Cool Water and the bottle is actually larger than what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try this fragrance because I heard so much about it.</li>
            <li> The real thing.</li>
            <li> buy and was at our home very quickley.</li>
            <li> &amp; I found her very condescending.</li>
            <li> Will probably get this one again if its still available next time around.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> The price is fantastic but the smell didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Very disapointed, was a Christmas gift to boot.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen reviews saying that the bottle was partially used or that it didn&#x27;t smell like true Cool Water.</li>
            <li> my local Macy&#x27;s price was more than double, my wife love it, she said it&#x27;s a new packing comparing with the old one, which apparently had a darker blue color, and it&#x27;s really light!</li>
            <li> 100% Original&#x27;ve already bought a couple of times and are totally reliable I recommend</li>
            <li> It was such a great deal, I got so much for so little!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a GIANT bottle of davidoff cool water perfume  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s genuine, not a fake imitation.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling perfume and the only thing I never really liked about it was the price.  </li>
            <li> My wife was looking for a new perfume we found this cool water which is a really big size 6.7 Oz.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly as promised&amp;#62; Highly recommend</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of hard to hold onto</li>
            <li> The bottle we received was in fine condition as expected since we ordered it new.</li>
            <li> I would wear the year round as it makes you feel refreshed and if you have the blues this is a sure fire pick me up.</li>
            <li> The  box was not sealed in celophane as most perfumes are packaged and there is about one inch of product missing from the bottle.  </li>
            <li> simple, fresh, and understated; not overpowering or abrasive.</li>
            <li> She is enjoying the fragrance, as she uses it just about everyday.</li>
            <li> It is not returanble and therefore not recommended for people who have not used this fragrance before, but a must buy for all those who love this product and have tried it previously!</li>
            <li> My wife easily goes through two of the smaller bottles a year, so it was nice to find this larger size and for the less than what I would normally pay for the smaller bottle at a department store.</li>
            <li> I would like to return this for a refund as I feel this product was used and then sold as new.  </li>
            <li> When I first opened  the bottle was obvious that was already used, the box of the perfume does not  even package with the plastic bundle, clasic of any perfume.</li>
            <li> I got a lot of complements when I have it on bec of the fresh and mild scent , and the price is much cheaper than those with a very strong unpleasant brand name!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing cool water for 10 years and this is definitely NOT the same!</li>
            <li> It is kind of hard to hold and spray at the same time with one hand though.  </li>
            <li> and that is something for someone as old as myself.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine a young girl wearing it.</li>
            <li> The cost of this 6.7 oz bottle was reasonable compared to smaller bottles.  </li>
            <li> My wife has used it for a few years; we both enjoy the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Getting harder to find but worth the effort.</li>
            <li> This is a watered down version of Cool Water.</li>
            <li> I can barely smell it.  </li>
            <li> I have worn Cool Water Perfume for the past 15 years and have always bought it from department stores.</li>
            <li> Cool Water for Women is the only EDT Spray that I can use because my husband hates the smell of perfume, it drives him absolutley crazy, but he loves the smell of Cool Water, go figure.....</li>
            <li> It has a strong, unappealing smell....</li>
            <li> The prize was a really good deal received it in a couple of days could not say anything bad even if I tried.</li>
            <li> this is the GIANT bottle that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I got this large bottle for what they charge for the small bottle in the stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted this perfume for a long time now and finally bit the bullet.</li>
            <li> The only perfume that I use because the smell stay for a long time</li>
            <li> This bottle has lasted my wife probably 2 years now, she doesn&#x27;t wear it every single day but often enough.</li>
            <li> The only flaw is the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long, it wears off in less than 3 hours.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was not aware that I would not be able to return this product due to it being flammable.</li>
            <li> Today I received the bottle which is a used one.&lt;br /&gt;The product was unsealed with no plastic film which usually be there.&lt;br /&gt;Buyers be careful, I ordered it because I assumed its a new one as nothing</li>
            <li> Product as expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent almost double for  a bottle this size in the past...</li>
            <li> Not exactly my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> I am going through it at a faster pace than other perfumes I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Due to the rush of the holidays, I just opened this package that contained this perfume in it.  </li>
            <li> However, when I received it &amp; called about the misinformation, the customer service rep. was very rude &amp; unfriendly, which surprised me.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my body chemistry changed from a few years ago (last time I wore this scent was 2 years ago</li>
            <li> It must be watered down.</li>
            <li> and i use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I had a sample in a small vial.  </li>
            <li> I usually get the 3 oz bottle from Walmart and pay over $30  </li>
            <li> I have used it for two weeks and just this past week the smell changed.  </li>
            <li> but I switched to something different at Christmas time and then after I purchased this the scent is now very irritating to me.  </li>
            <li> No, it&#x27;s not old, our stale.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was a little wary about buying this after reading some of the reviews.  </li>
            <li> , it was rather weak to me and just seemed like something a man would wear.</li>
            <li> It is a vulgar forgery, no box is lined with cellophane characteristic perfume, no security seal and smells like chemicals, but not to a perfume.</li>
            <li> So sad this is being discontinued.</li>
            <li> I find some of this silly.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> The reviews saying it is fake are wrong.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for years, I would know if it was fake.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing</li>
            <li> It was very disappointing because I won&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very disappointed!!!</li>

            <li> Good but the perfume inside the bottle appears to be missing a 1/5 portion.</li>
            <li> Works great, product as described, thank you !</li>
            <li> I like this perfume for it&#x27;s light, fresh &amp; clean smell. suitable for daytime use.&lt;br /&gt;The EDT spray is a very fine mist, so easy to apply as a light &amp;#34;spritz&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It is a vulgar forgery, no box is lined with cellophane characteristic perfume, no security seal and smells like chemicals, but not to a perfume.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price on this huge container of perfume. Great value.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this perfume and the size of the bottle was great</li>
            <li> I did not receive this product, instead I received 2 of the same Beyonc&amp;eacute; heat perfume that I did not order</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this and I like the fragrance. Has a nice clean smell.  Getting harder to find but worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments on this perfume!  One lady said I smelled delicious :)</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the product, very good and a real value for the money. I&#x27;ve been able to ship it to Sri lanka using one of my friend, and it was the best ever gift I&#x27;ve been able to give to my wife. In Sri lanka the price is almost thrice the value given at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Product as expected.  Good price.</li>
            <li> I use to wear this all the time and I have a sensitivity to certain smells but I switched to something different at Christmas time and then after I purchased this the scent is now very irritating to me.  I love it but it doesn&#x27;t like me back now.</li>
            <li> I find some of this silly. The scent smells as it should; bottle didn&#x27;t break. What else can I say</li>
            <li> The look of the bottle is so pretty but, the smell is so refreshing. I would wear the year round as it makes you feel refreshed and if you have the blues this is a sure fire pick me up. The best price was here and I do shop around before I make a purchase.</li>
            <li> Cool Water is pretty much my summer fragrance - it&#x27;s a nice fresh scent.  I was so pleased to be able to purchase such a big bottle of Cool Water for the price - very happy with my order.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent to wear. Light and breezy, not too sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> Great price for a large bottle. The real thing.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter and since she has used it before, she was thrilled.  She just loves it.</li>
            <li> The wife likes this brand so She was very happy to get it for Christmas, I just recently bought her a refill as she was running low.  Can you say bonus points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good buy and was at our home very quickley.</li>
            <li> Beautiful fragrance and last long...the price is very worth it!! I checked the price at duty free shops in airports and found best price in amazon.</li>
            <li> I love Cool Water by Davidoff.  I was so thrilled to find it at such a good price and receive it so quickly.  I get compliments when I wear it and that is something for someone as old as myself.  I love ordering from Amazon, I can always find what I want and at a good price.</li>
            <li> I have worn Cool Water for years. It&#x27;s always been one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> The perfume smells great, and you get a good size bottle for the price. The only flaw is the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long, it wears off in less than 3 hours.</li>
            <li> Love love this aroma!!</li>
            <li> Although I did receive complaments when wearing this, I did not like the smell, it was rather weak to me and just seemed like something a man would wear.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and the price was great!  Would do business with them again!  I&#x27;m looking for a handbag sized bottle too.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is real Davidoff CoolWater; the genuine stuff! No, it&#x27;s not old, our stale. The BEST Price around!! Happy! Happy! &amp; Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> For me this is the perfect summer time scent. It smells so fresh and clean, but also &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34;. I couldn&#x27;t imagine a young girl wearing it. Maybe for 25 year olds and up.</li>
            <li> Have always used this and love the  price I got on it</li>
            <li> Cool Water for Women is the only EDT Spray that I can use because my husband hates the smell of perfume, it drives him absolutley crazy, but he loves the smell of Cool Water, go figure.....</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was a little wary about buying this after reading some of the reviews.  But I decided to take a chance and order and I am definitely glad I did!  Don&#x27;t listen to the fony reviews stating &amp;#34;this is fake&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;half used&amp;#34; or that it &amp;#34;smelled like alcohol&amp;#34;. This was brand new and you will not beat the price anywhere with free standard shipping, and even going with the free shipping option It arrived FAST! Thank you Amazon for satisfied and hassle free purchase!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe the size when I saw it posted figured it would be mostly glass and lid.  But it is every bit of 6.7 ounces.  Wife was elated especially the way she sprays it on.  Came quick and undamaged.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing cool water for 10 years and this is definitely NOT the same! It has a strong, unappealing smell....not the sweet smell that regular cool water has. Very disappointing</li>
            <li> I love it, it&#x27;s cool and i use it everyday.I love it ilove it i love it i love it.</li>
            <li> I received my shipment exactly 24 hours after ordering it, without paying the overnight shipping costs.&lt;br /&gt;I loved the price, since this is one of my favorites and most used perfume, made all the more sense to buy it in this size for this price! It is not returanble and therefore not recommended for people who have not used this fragrance before, but a must buy for all those who love this product and have tried it previously!</li>
            <li> My wife easily goes through two of the smaller bottles a year, so it was nice to find this larger size and for the less than what I would normally pay for the smaller bottle at a department store. Packaged nicely in original box, very nice.</li>
            <li> It was a great bargain but it looked like it might have been used. The liquid line was a bit lower than what I thought it should be for an unused bottle. BUT my daughter loved it just the same.</li>
            <li> This does not smell like authentic Cool Water fragrance that I have worn for the last 5 years. Unfortunately, I was not aware that I would not be able to return this product due to it being flammable. I am very upset and would love a refund. This smells more like alcohol and old spice. Horrible. There is absolutely nothing I can do with this 6.7 ounce bottle of non- Cool Water. The size and the price was too good to be true. Beware!</li>
            <li> The 6.7oz one was exactly to my expectation. The mini sized one which I was misinformed about over the telephone by a customer service rep. who was extremely nice was not. However, when I received it &amp; called about the misinformation, the customer service rep. was very rude &amp; unfriendly, which surprised me. We then had some contact by email &amp; I found her very condescending. I did return it and was credited the money in ample time.</li>
            <li> I have worn Cool Water Perfume for the past 15 years and have always bought it from department stores. When I saw the price and the size available on Amazon I decided to order and give it a try. The smell is not as strong as that of the department store bottles and within an hour you can&#x27;t even smell a hint of the perfume anymore. Was not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> It is just great!!! I am enjoying this and the compliments that I am given when I am around anyone!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling perfume and the only thing I never really liked about it was the price.  The cost of this 6.7 oz bottle was reasonable compared to smaller bottles.  Will probably get this one again if its still available next time around.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Everything was as planned. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love it!  Fragrance is clean, not too strong.  I also love the fact that I got such a big bottle, way more than I would have gotten had I purchased it elsewhere for the same price.</li>
            <li> Awesome fragrance. My wife love the smooth yet long lasting scent. 100% recommended. Will keep on buying it for further gifts.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter in law. She likes this and wanted it so we bought it for her as a gift.</li>
            <li> Been wearing this for years.  I love the smell of freshness &amp; it&#x27;s great for day time use as we&#x27;ll as evenings</li>
            <li> My fault for ordering perfume online that I have never smelled before that. Not exactly my cup of tea. It&#x27;s a light and refreshing scent, clean soapy smell.</li>
            <li> great perfume&lt;br /&gt;item came quickly&lt;br /&gt;no issues at all&lt;br /&gt;will order again&lt;br /&gt;love the size of the bottle&lt;br /&gt;would recommend to my friends</li>
            <li> This perfume smells good but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long on you</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. This is a great price for the 6.7 oz bottle that lasts forever!</li>
            <li> i love this stuff on my wife</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  I got this large bottle for what they charge for the small bottle in the stores.</li>
            <li> First off, I LOVE THE SMELL OF COOL WATER PERFUME!!!  So I ordered this, thinking it would end up being a knock off version or something... And it wasn&#x27;t!!!  It&#x27;s the real deal!  It&#x27;s a GIANT bottle of davidoff cool water perfume  I usually get the 3 oz bottle from Walmart and pay over $30  This is almost 3 times the size and the same price  I will definitely be ordering again  This is a great product for an amazing price</li>

            <li> The bottle of perfume smelled wonderfully....But the bottle was not quite full&lt;br /&gt;It seemed like the bottle must have leaked&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered Cool Water before and have never had this problem&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what happened this time</li>
            <li> What a wonderful  perfume!! I got a lot of complements when I have it on bec of the fresh and mild scent , and the price is much cheaper than those with a very strong unpleasant brand name!</li>
            <li> I received Cool Water as a gift and liked it so much, I bought myself more of it.  I am going through it at a faster pace than other perfumes I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> product came in timely and a great price for the size of the bottle! it was packaged well also! thanks</li>
            <li> Due to the rush of the holidays, I just opened this package that contained this perfume in it.  The  box was not sealed in celophane as most perfumes are packaged and there is about one inch of product missing from the bottle.  I would like to return this for a refund as I feel this product was used and then sold as new.  Very disapointed, was a Christmas gift to boot.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle for a great price. I have worn Cool Water for years and I LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> When I first opened  the bottle was obvious that was already used, the box of the perfume does not  even package with the plastic bundle, clasic of any perfume.</li>
            <li> very grateful and pleased with you, thank you very much for your help</li>
            <li> Today I received the bottle which is a used one.&lt;br /&gt;The product was unsealed with no plastic film which usually be there.&lt;br /&gt;Buyers be careful, I ordered it because I assumed its a new one as nothing is&lt;br /&gt;mentioned in this page whether its a tester or opened pack.&lt;br /&gt;Now it seems it is non returnable and I cant gift it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;This may be my last purchase of any perfume from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My sister in law was so happy when she opened this gift on Christmas. This is her favorite perfume and now that she has the huuuuuge bottle she won&#x27;t run out anytime soon!</li>
            <li> My wife loves Cool Water (and has for years), so I am glad to order it from Amazon. She is glad to get this for a holiday or birthday gift.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent at a wonderful price! I love my Davidoff Cool Water and so does my husband! Great product guys!</li>
            <li> Great quality, 100% recommended! I love it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite perfume and the price is really good for the size.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the smell.</li>
            <li> Just as is name...so cool</li>
            <li> This product smells like it has been diluted with alcohol and water.  I have purchased this product many times before and I have never had this problem.  It was very disappointing because I won&#x27;t use it.  The smell does not last like it has before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> They seemed to like this spray and they buy it often . This was a Christmas gift and they were over joyed with the gift and was surprised that it didn&#x27;t cost a lot more than it did. Shipping was on time also. Good job</li>
            <li> Not sure if my body chemistry changed from a few years ago (last time I wore this scent was 2 years ago then I ran out) or the formula changed. Not as fragrant and enticing as I remembered. I used to get compliments on this scent - the dry down smelled great on me, now I am not so sure. Will stop using for the meantime and probably try again in the future. It just smells so different from what I remember. Scent is gone on 4 hours. Very light scent.</li>
            <li> Everything according as promised! Excellent product , good shipping. I have been using this frangance for years, it is my favorite. The fragance lasts all day,  strong enough, and &#x60;great Price.</li>
            <li> Wish there was option to get purse-size bottle with this, great size for everyday use, better pricing than available in discount or regular stores</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fragance. Cool Water By Davidoff For Women Edt Spray 6.7 Oz. My wife is very happy for this.</li>
            <li> Was suuprised at how big the bottle was for the price I paid. Love love love cool water. I get lots of complements</li>
            <li> Is a birthday, anniversary, or special day coming up for your wife or girlfriend? Wrap up a bottle of Davidoff&#x27;s Cool Water for women. This perfume has a light welcoming fragrance. Everyone that comes in contact with me after I put it on ALWAYS mentions the nice smell that I have on! I promise it is one of the best perfumes out there for women!!!</li>
            <li> this is sure to make your date hot if he&#x27;s not allergic.</li>
            <li> I was getting low on my favorite cologne and was comparing prices around as I shopped. Then I went on amazon for something else but priced cool water just for kicks. What a deal I got alot more for my money I am so happy.</li>
            <li> This is a watered down version of Cool Water. The scent is not the same and even applying the perfume you can tell a difference from this product then the one purchased in stores. I have since thrown this in the trash and had to spend extra money buying the authentic bottle from retail stores that actually smells like the real Cool Water.</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love it.</li>
            <li> My daughters favorite and she loved it</li>
            <li> This bottle has lasted my wife probably 2 years now, she doesn&#x27;t wear it every single day but often enough. The bottle we received was in fine condition as expected since we ordered it new. I&#x27;ve seen reviews saying that the bottle was partially used or that it didn&#x27;t smell like true Cool Water. But, the bottle we received was great so we are both very happy for that.</li>
            <li> I love Cool Water.  This arrived on time and is everything like the ones I purchased in stores.  This, though, is a much better buy and I will order again.</li>
            <li> I always liked Cool Water and the bottle is actually larger than what I expected.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> 100% satisfied with size and price of perfume. I am completely satisfied with my purchase relationship price, quality and quantity is great, besides fast delivery</li>
            <li> Love this perfume...it smells great and stays on all day..I have been using cool waters for many years and will be for many more to come.</li>
            <li> Good aroma, lasts all day</li>
            <li> I purchased Cool Water Cologne for Women as a Christmas gift.  When looking for it at one store, couldn&#x27;t find it &amp; was told it was being discontinued.  Found it online at a good price &amp; size.</li>
            <li> My girl likes so I guess 5 stars.</li>
            <li> i love this scent. simple, fresh, and understated; not overpowering or abrasive. this is the GIANT bottle that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> best inexpensive perfume ever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this ever since I started wearing perfume.  It is my favorite scent and it is not overbearing even when you wear a lot. I love that it comes in a 6.7oz bottle, so I don&#x27;t have to buy as often.  It is kind of hard to hold and spray at the same time with one hand though.  Will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Biggest bottle of cool water I&#x27;ve ever seen! And a great price. And it&#x27;s genuine, not a fake imitation. I would definitely buy again!!</li>
            <li> I love this scent - light, sensual,  and can be worn year round. Price for the size of the bottle is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for years, and I love it. I was pleased to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It was such a great deal, I got so much for so little!! I will continue to buy this item from Amazon!! Thanks</li>
            <li> great product! purchased the product for a friend for christmas. she loved it. great service. i would recommend the product and service</li>
            <li> Amazing! I&#x27;ve wanted this perfume for a long time now and finally bit the bullet. The price is a steal, and as always, Amazon has lightning-fast shipping, even on the free shipping option! The fragrance itself is heavenly. Clean and light, one spray will do. I get compliments all the time when wearing this.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! JUST WHAT I WANTED!</li>
            <li> Favorite perfume of my sis - bought it for her.</li>
            <li> The only perfume that I use because the smell stay for a long time</li>
            <li> i love the scent of the perfume and love it when my wife wears it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  The reviews saying it is fake are wrong.  I have used this for years, I would know if it was fake.  I will buy it here from now on.</li>
            <li> the scent is clean and wonderful!  Great value if you like this product.</li>
            <li> I got my perfume fairly quickly (second order got a larger bottle) and I just love the scent, and my boyfriend just adores it!!!</li>
            <li> This is such a great deal I had to buy them the 6.7 ounce it&#x27;s kind of hard to hold onto it&#x27;s almost like a gallon size but love love love it.</li>
            <li> This has kind of a &#x27;laundry fresh&#x27; kinda smell to it.  I feel like I just got out of the shower.  Great stuff!!</li>
            <li> My favorite summertime spray.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly as promised&amp;#62; Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume. I wore it as a teenager and when I saw it was for sale here on Amazon I about died. So of course my hubby stocked my stalking with it. ;)</li>
            <li> This was an amazing deal...I&#x27;ve spent almost double for  a bottle this size in the past... My girlfriend loved it!</li>
            <li> Great price for this size- bought as a gift for my sister and she loves it.</li>
            <li> My wife was looking for a new perfume we found this cool water which is a really big size 6.7 Oz. The prize was a really good deal received it in a couple of days could not say anything bad even if I tried.</li>
            <li> This is probably my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume of all time. For me to present it to her on Christmas as one of the biggest bottles that she has ever received of this particular perfume made it that much more special to her. She is enjoying the fragrance, as she uses it just about everyday.</li>
            <li> When I first got this perfume and tried it....smelled perfect and was great.  I have been wearing Cool Water since 1998 and this is the first time I have been duped.  I think there must have been some REAL Cool Water in the sprayer but the bottle is filled with something that smells like alcohol.  I have used it for two weeks and just this past week the smell changed.  Amazon says no returns.  Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did.  Should have went to the department store.</li>
