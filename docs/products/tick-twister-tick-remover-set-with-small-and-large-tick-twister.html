            <li>Great product!!</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t use them for pets ears, these are great for cleaning handguns after a trip to the range.</li>
            <li>These appear to be a good quality and versatile being that there are two sizes provided.  </li>
            <li>These are great for many types of cleaning.</li>
            <li>and I loved being able to remove the tick so easily!!</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Amazing invention.</li>
            <li>This holds the tick in place while you are able to twist it off of your dog.</li>
            <li>We have had a problem with ticks this year and these have made removal very quick, easy and painless.</li>
            <li>These little things are wonderful!!</li>
            <li>cheap insurance</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering a set for everyone I know and love that lives in the north east right now.</li>
            <li>Luckily haven&#x27;t needed to use it yet</li>
            <li>can get caught on sharp edge and pull apart a bit, but overall very happy with them.</li>
            <li>Better than the Tick Key that we have used for years.</li>
            <li>This does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>Recommend if you live in the woods and are surrounded by ticks!!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m ready</li>
            <li>Ticks are a huge presence here and the last tick I tried to remove with tweezers (even with my steady nurses hand) broke off leaving the head embedded in my moms arm.</li>
            <li>I have a 4 year old boy and an almost one year old boy who love to play outside.</li>
            <li>sturdy sticks, large cotton swab, work much faster than the standard q-tips for getting in the action and cleaning things out.</li>
            <li>I secured it around the tick in one swoop (surprisingly easy as this tick was SMALL) and with less than 5 twirls it had detached fully and cleanly with no trauma to the tick...</li>
            <li>We live in a rural setting with ticks galore.  </li>
            <li>knowing I have a tool at my disposal that will carefully remove the whole tick carefully and completely.  </li>

            <li> the small tick twister was small enough to secure on and toast this one out.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I had always just used tweezers before, and the tick would end up slipping out.</li>
            <li> Since this tick twister was just delivered today I popped open the package and selected the small size twister.</li>

            <li> Tweezers can be a little dicey when it comes to pulling a tick off.  </li>
            <li> Had to use it the other day!!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had a few &amp;#34;cling-ons&amp;#34; find their way in.  </li>

            <li> Better than the Tick Key that we have used for years.</li>
            <li> Great product. Worked on even the tiniest tick embedded in my husbands ankle! Recommend if you live in the woods and are surrounded by ticks!!</li>
            <li> I have yet to need to use these, but I like knowing they are in the house.  We live in a rural setting with ticks galore.  While we used sprays when we go out into the yard which cuts down on the likelihood of bringing a tick in the house.  We&#x27;ve had a few &amp;#34;cling-ons&amp;#34; find their way in.  We haven&#x27;t had one attach to family or indoor pets yet, but I like the peace of mind knowing I have a tool at my disposal that will carefully remove the whole tick carefully and completely.  Tweezers can be a little dicey when it comes to pulling a tick off.  These appear to be a good quality and versatile being that there are two sizes provided.  No complaints about this product as of yet.</li>
            <li> Had to use it the other day!! I have 5 yorkies so it was bound to happen and I loved being able to remove the tick so easily!!</li>
            <li> Looks like it will do the job.Hope I don&#x27;t Ever have to use it,Ha...</li>
            <li> These little things are wonderful!! We have had a problem with ticks this year and these have made removal very quick, easy and painless. Simply place the tick it the front opening and swipe it out.</li>
            <li> Luckily haven&#x27;t needed to use it yet but I&#x27;m ready</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used then yet...cheap insurance I guess.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. I had always just used tweezers before, and the tick would end up slipping out. This holds the tick in place while you are able to twist it off of your dog. Works like a charm!</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t use them for pets ears, these are great for cleaning handguns after a trip to the range. sturdy sticks, large cotton swab, work much faster than the standard q-tips for getting in the action and cleaning things out. can get caught on sharp edge and pull apart a bit, but overall very happy with them. I add a bag to every amazon order I place.  EDIT: this listing used to be for oversize cotton swabs. No idea why it changed to tick remover set, so my review no longer applies.</li>
            <li> Hoping I never need to use it, but had to have it....</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use these yet but I feel prepared if we need them.</li>
            <li> Takes the tick out without detaching its head from its body. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I NEVER write reviews but just had to in this case. I&#x27;m an RN and currently living in Connectcut about 15 min from Lyme, home of the dreaded Lyme disease. I have a 4 year old boy and an almost one year old boy who love to play outside. Ticks are a huge presence here and the last tick I tried to remove with tweezers (even with my steady nurses hand) broke off leaving the head embedded in my moms arm. Tonight to my horror I discovered a tiny nymph deer tick attached to my 4 year olds arm. Since this tick twister was just delivered today I popped open the package and selected the small size twister. I secured it around the tick in one swoop (surprisingly easy as this tick was SMALL) and with less than 5 twirls it had detached fully and cleanly with no trauma to the tick... Or to my child. I&#x27;m ordering a set for everyone I know and love that lives in the north east right now. Amazing product. I want a set in my car, in my baby bag, in my upstairs and in my downstairs. I will never choose tweezers for ticks again. Amazing invention. Would give 6 stars if I could!  *photo on bottom shows how tiny the tick was that was attached to my son- the small tick twister was small enough to secure on and toast this one out.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> a just incase tool for grooming</li>
            <li> As soon as I saw this product listed on my Facebook page, I ordered it. For the price, it can&#x27;t be beat. It&#x27;ll be in my backpack for my next trek to the forest.</li>
            <li> These are great for many types of cleaning.</li>
