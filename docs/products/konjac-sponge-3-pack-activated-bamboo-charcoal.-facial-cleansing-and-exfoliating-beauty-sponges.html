            <li>A set of instructions is included and they are very easy to use and store.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>They keep my face feeling nice and smooth.</li>

            <li>Oh and I got these little ones in exchange of an honest review from the wonderful seller &amp;#34;Beth&amp;#34; ~</li>
            <li>The packaging is even cute and it comes with easy to follow directions as you will see in the slide show.  </li>
            <li>the cleanser washes out of the sponge and the sponge is left looking clean and as it dries, it looks and feels great!  </li>
            <li>and so far they have been great.</li>
            <li>These are great for sensitive skin and removing make up.  </li>
            <li>Great sponges so far.</li>
            <li>the exfoliation is gentle, smooth and pleasant-</li>
            <li>-easy</li>
            <li>Wow, I&#x27;ve been looking for a sturdy yet gentle sponge and because of excellent reviews, I decided to order through Amazon.</li>
            <li>First of all let me say, this was the first time ever getting an email from a Company before I even got the product, Great Jobs on that.</li>
            <li>, my skin felt so pure!!!</li>
            <li>and it seems as good as new.</li>
            <li>Plus my body&#x27;s skin is doing fine with body wash and wash cloth.</li>
            <li>Give these little ones a chance to do some miracles on your skin ~ :D</li>
            <li>smoothly-  </li>
            <li>I rinses out easy &amp; clean after use.</li>
            <li>Nice Gentle to the skin</li>
            <li>and I have a light case of rosacea on my nose and along the sides of it</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my face feel super clean.</li>

            <li>I love how gentle this is on my skin!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use soap and my face feels clean after using them ..</li>
            <li>My skin is a delightful combination of oily/acne, normal to dry</li>
            <li>Really like the way these feel on my face leaves skin feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li>These are way overpriced sponges, have nothing special.</li>
            <li>It would be handy if one side was softer and one side had a little more abrasive of a texture for more exfoliation.</li>
            <li>They arrived in nice packaging, with clear instructions.</li>
            <li>After seeing reviews saying they were sold at sephora, I figured that meant they were a good quality product and would actually make a difference.</li>
            <li>These sponges are so cool</li>
            <li>These are super absorbent and make you feel clean.</li>
            <li>Loved the sponges, the quality is the same as the ones they sell at Sephora, but the price is so much more reasonable.</li>
            <li>I just love the feeling of the sponge on my face, it exfoliates my skin so gently</li>
            <li>Really love this sponge... highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling smooth and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Nice and soft, but still exfoliating.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean &amp; looks clean &amp; bright after I dry my face.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and most of the treatments available</li>
            <li>I am a loyal user of this company&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is the very first time I have ordered these or ever used a sponge on my face...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it enough to report any significant changes, but so far it worked great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s organic and natural, which is very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;â€¢</li>
            <li>These sponges really get all the makeup off my face, leaving it very soft and clean!!</li>
            <li>quite useful-</li>
            <li>I bought these hoping to encourage my 10 and 13 year old granddaughters to be more faithful in face washing.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the buy</li>
            <li>These are pretty cool ..</li>
            <li>Simple and nice</li>
            <li>Useful:</li>
            <li>so worth it.</li>
            <li>Product arrived right on time.</li>
            <li>would totally recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good and natural exfoliator.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, and I was pleasantly surprised with the gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li>This brand is by far superior vs the last brand that I purchased.</li>
            <li>It does feel very nice when using the sponge, but again, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s all it&#x27;s cracked up to be.</li>
            <li>these are non abrasive and very gentle.</li>
            <li>It is a very unusual product, and I&#x27;ve never used anything like it.</li>
            <li>These sponges are *very* gentle.</li>
            <li>I gave them to my friend (who said she likes them very much)</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s not harsh at all, I can see why they say itâ€™s fine to use it with babies.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using Konjac sponges</li>
            <li>I wash off all my makeup first with oil</li>
            <li>Love these konjac facial sponges.</li>
            <li>You can use these sponges to wash your face and body, but I mostly use it as a facial sponge.</li>
            <li>My skin was super soft after first use!</li>
            <li>easy and gentle to use and leaves skin soft and cleansed</li>
            <li>I find they are gentle enough to use twice a day, yet do a very good job of slightly exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>So soft, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it can clean at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I don&#x27;t think this actually has real activated charcoal, I still love them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think the sponge is doing EXACTLY what it says it will.</li>
            <li>Its exactly what I&#x27;m looking for; sturdy in hand yet gentle to my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working good, I don&#x27;t suggest using everyday!</li>
            <li>They are super soft and really remove impurities from your skin.  </li>
            <li>sure not to damage the surface with your nails and always press the water out of the sponge between your palms before hanging it to dry!</li>
            <li>what a nice package they come in, with little cards to explain the sponges &amp; how they should be used.</li>
            <li>It has a smooth texture, but with a firm circular motion I can feel it lightly exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I have one also and really really like it.</li>
            <li>Quality &amp; fast service.</li>
            <li>With gentle exfoliation, it cleans my face well</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s see, I&#x27;ve always been using drug store cleansers my whole life</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling much cleaner and exfoliated.</li>
            <li>This works as an incredibly gentle exfoliator.</li>
            <li>itâ€™s a very porous sponge.</li>
            <li>It dissipated after about 5 uses and now I donâ€™t smell much at all.</li>
            <li>The sponge alone works very well</li>
            <li>They looked smaller than I expected but after the one use expanded to a good size.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you wet it thoroughly before using!</li>
            <li>The little sponges are just perfect for what I wanted to remove my dry skin from face daily.  </li>
            <li>The price is amazing and they last so long.  </li>
            <li>I am in my mid 30s and am starting to get fine lines along the laugh line area.  </li>
            <li>Not only are they unique &amp; compact, but easy to use &amp; care for, no strange odors, no rough texture and are not abrasive.</li>
            <li>I absolutely live these sponges!</li>
            <li>I noticed a diffrence in my skin for the better in less than a week.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these sponges to all skin types.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my honest opinion of the sponges.smaller and hard after about 2 days of not using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am surprised at how much my skin has already cleared up.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so if I just happen to scrub with too much force, my face can get irritated.  </li>
            <li>Too soon to tell if it makes a big difference on my skin, but so far my face feels soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Well, first of all, I just love rubbing these little sponges on my face, it is just so soft enough for you to just rub and rub.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Not really anything special.</li>
            <li>so I am always looking to try whatever I can to help clear it up!</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for, the product was exactly the same as pictured.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t use these for long enough to notice a huge result but I have faith in these that they will do miracles on my skin.</li>
            <li>it wet after a quick rinse with cleanser.</li>
            <li>make my skin dry and don&#x27;t really help that much.</li>
            <li>The sponges, once wet, are super soft to the point where they almost feel slimy.</li>
            <li>) help to lift the hair and clean the pores for less irritation and razor bumps.  </li>
            <li>They leave my skin feeling so soft after.</li>
            <li>They leave my skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>So far, that has not happened with these sponges.</li>
            <li>After using it, I can feel my face being so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used charcoal products before, including homemade charcoal/colloidal silver in all natural glyrecin.</li>
            <li>This sponge, however, surprised me beyond my expectations.  </li>
            <li>and itâ€™s been really incorporated into my facial routine on some days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The charcoal sponges leave my skin feeling soft and don&#x27;t cause any type of irritation.  </li>
            <li>to admit I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect when I saw these, but I read up on the reviews and didnâ€™t see anything negative, so</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the smell, but then that&#x27;s me-I&#x27;m hyper- sensitive to odors.</li>
            <li>I do use a mild face gel cleanser with this, rinse well and squeeze between palms and hang to dry for long life of sponge.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bizarre but it still doesn&#x27;t feel good, I mean who wouldn&#x27;t want clear skin.</li>
            <li>this is so soft when it gets wet and very soothing...</li>
            <li>I do use these on my face only because my face&#x27;s skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>The sponge feels great on my skin, but the company&#x27;s persistent tactics leave me with a bad taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li>This is part of the reason I donâ€™t want to use it to get makeup off, I can imagine it getting icky pretty fast if I do that.</li>
            <li>The real question with all konjac sponges is how long they last before falling to pieces.</li>
            <li>I wet the sponge, rub it gently over the soap....</li>
            <li>My skin type is a combination of oily and normal so for me personally I don&#x27;t use these sponges daily.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate that it can hang next to my sink to dry.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate that it can hang next to my sink to dry.</li>
            <li>It is not dry or itchy either!</li>
            <li>It dries up to its original state of being smaller and hard after about 2 days of not using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>am using them already, like the soft feel of them, hard as a rock when they first arrive...but</li>
            <li>I go in soft circles all over my face and let it dry overnight outside the shower.</li>

            <li> Really like the way these feel on my face leaves skin feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li> These are way overpriced sponges, have nothing special.</li>
            <li> It would be handy if one side was softer and one side had a little more abrasive of a texture for more exfoliation.</li>
            <li> They arrived in nice packaging, with clear instructions.</li>
            <li> After seeing reviews saying they were sold at sephora, I figured that meant they were a good quality product and would actually make a difference.</li>
            <li> These sponges are so cool</li>
            <li> These are super absorbent and make you feel clean.</li>
            <li> Loved the sponges, the quality is the same as the ones they sell at Sephora, but the price is so much more reasonable.</li>

            <li> I am a loyal user of this company&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is the very first time I have ordered these or ever used a sponge on my face...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it enough to report any significant changes, but so far it worked great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s organic and natural, which is very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;â€¢</li>
            <li> These sponges really get all the makeup off my face, leaving it very soft and clean!!</li>
            <li> quite useful-</li>
            <li> I bought these hoping to encourage my 10 and 13 year old granddaughters to be more faithful in face washing.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the buy</li>
            <li> These are pretty cool ..</li>
            <li> Simple and nice</li>
            <li> Useful:</li>
            <li> so worth it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> would totally recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good and natural exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, and I was pleasantly surprised with the gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li> This brand is by far superior vs the last brand that I purchased.</li>
            <li> It does feel very nice when using the sponge, but again, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s all it&#x27;s cracked up to be.</li>
            <li> these are non abrasive and very gentle.</li>
            <li> It is a very unusual product, and I&#x27;ve never used anything like it.</li>
            <li> These sponges are *very* gentle.</li>
            <li> I gave them to my friend (who said she likes them very much)</li>
            <li> Itâ€™s not harsh at all, I can see why they say itâ€™s fine to use it with babies.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Konjac sponges</li>
            <li> I wash off all my makeup first with oil</li>
            <li> Love these konjac facial sponges.</li>
            <li> You can use these sponges to wash your face and body, but I mostly use it as a facial sponge.</li>
            <li> My skin was super soft after first use!</li>
            <li> easy and gentle to use and leaves skin soft and cleansed</li>
            <li> I find they are gentle enough to use twice a day, yet do a very good job of slightly exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> So soft, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it can clean at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I don&#x27;t think this actually has real activated charcoal, I still love them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think the sponge is doing EXACTLY what it says it will.</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I&#x27;m looking for; sturdy in hand yet gentle to my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working good, I don&#x27;t suggest using everyday!</li>
            <li> They are super soft and really remove impurities from your skin.  </li>
            <li> sure not to damage the surface with your nails and always press the water out of the sponge between your palms before hanging it to dry!</li>
            <li> what a nice package they come in, with little cards to explain the sponges &amp; how they should be used.</li>
            <li> It has a smooth texture, but with a firm circular motion I can feel it lightly exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I have one also and really really like it.</li>
            <li> Quality &amp; fast service.</li>
            <li> With gentle exfoliation, it cleans my face well</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see, I&#x27;ve always been using drug store cleansers my whole life</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling much cleaner and exfoliated.</li>
            <li> This works as an incredibly gentle exfoliator.</li>
            <li> itâ€™s a very porous sponge.</li>
            <li> It dissipated after about 5 uses and now I donâ€™t smell much at all.</li>
            <li> The sponge alone works very well</li>
            <li> They looked smaller than I expected but after the one use expanded to a good size.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you wet it thoroughly before using!</li>
            <li> The little sponges are just perfect for what I wanted to remove my dry skin from face daily.  </li>
            <li> The price is amazing and they last so long.  </li>
            <li> I am in my mid 30s and am starting to get fine lines along the laugh line area.  </li>
            <li> Not only are they unique &amp; compact, but easy to use &amp; care for, no strange odors, no rough texture and are not abrasive.</li>
            <li> I absolutely live these sponges!</li>
            <li> I noticed a diffrence in my skin for the better in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these sponges to all skin types.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my honest opinion of the sponges.smaller and hard after about 2 days of not using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am surprised at how much my skin has already cleared up.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so if I just happen to scrub with too much force, my face can get irritated.  </li>
            <li> Too soon to tell if it makes a big difference on my skin, but so far my face feels soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Well, first of all, I just love rubbing these little sponges on my face, it is just so soft enough for you to just rub and rub.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> Not really anything special.</li>
            <li> so I am always looking to try whatever I can to help clear it up!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, the product was exactly the same as pictured.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use these for long enough to notice a huge result but I have faith in these that they will do miracles on my skin.</li>
            <li> it wet after a quick rinse with cleanser.</li>
            <li> make my skin dry and don&#x27;t really help that much.</li>
            <li> The sponges, once wet, are super soft to the point where they almost feel slimy.</li>
            <li> ) help to lift the hair and clean the pores for less irritation and razor bumps.  </li>
            <li> They leave my skin feeling so soft after.</li>
            <li> They leave my skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> So far, that has not happened with these sponges.</li>
            <li> After using it, I can feel my face being so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used charcoal products before, including homemade charcoal/colloidal silver in all natural glyrecin.</li>
            <li> This sponge, however, surprised me beyond my expectations.  </li>
            <li> and itâ€™s been really incorporated into my facial routine on some days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charcoal sponges leave my skin feeling soft and don&#x27;t cause any type of irritation.  </li>
            <li> to admit I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect when I saw these, but I read up on the reviews and didnâ€™t see anything negative, so</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell, but then that&#x27;s me-I&#x27;m hyper- sensitive to odors.</li>
            <li> I do use a mild face gel cleanser with this, rinse well and squeeze between palms and hang to dry for long life of sponge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bizarre but it still doesn&#x27;t feel good, I mean who wouldn&#x27;t want clear skin.</li>
            <li> this is so soft when it gets wet and very soothing...</li>
            <li> I do use these on my face only because my face&#x27;s skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> The sponge feels great on my skin, but the company&#x27;s persistent tactics leave me with a bad taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> This is part of the reason I donâ€™t want to use it to get makeup off, I can imagine it getting icky pretty fast if I do that.</li>
            <li> The real question with all konjac sponges is how long they last before falling to pieces.</li>
            <li> I wet the sponge, rub it gently over the soap....</li>
            <li> My skin type is a combination of oily and normal so for me personally I don&#x27;t use these sponges daily.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate that it can hang next to my sink to dry.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate that it can hang next to my sink to dry.</li>
            <li> It is not dry or itchy either!</li>
            <li> It dries up to its original state of being smaller and hard after about 2 days of not using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> am using them already, like the soft feel of them, hard as a rock when they first arrive...but</li>
            <li> I go in soft circles all over my face and let it dry overnight outside the shower.</li>
            <li> and I really feel my skin gets cleaner than using an ordinary facial sponge.</li>
            <li> Long lasting: I have been using the same one for a month</li>
            <li> Definitely helped me with fading away blemishes from previous acne, and helped keep skin clear.</li>
            <li> And with three sponges, seems like these will last me a really long time!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not replacing my cleanser, but it&#x27;s really helping on the other few days a week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not replacing my cleanser, but it&#x27;s really helping on the other few days a week</li>
            <li> But my face&#x27;s skin is so sensitive that whatever I use, I&#x27;d get these little acne.</li>
            <li> The sponges are very dense and seem less susceptible to tearing, which was an issue with the previous brand of sponge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sponge for about 2 weeks, so far i like it, but still not sure how long this one will last</li>
            <li> Who knows how long they will hold up?</li>
            <li> They were extremely well packaged and each was individually wrapped.</li>
            <li> I also have rather dry skin</li>
            <li> I use a konjac sponge every single night when I wash my face.</li>
            <li> I use a small dollop (not quite the size of a pea) of face wash on the sponge at night and much as others stated, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> These will appear small and tough when you first receive them, but as soon as they get soaked they are soft and hold lots of shower gel.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and delicate skin due to acne medication and</li>
            <li> I have used them once daily, and do not find they are sufficient to remove all dead skin.</li>
            <li> When itâ€™s wet</li>
            <li> I have only had the sponges for about 2 weeks, not sure how long they will last, but I&#x27;m hoping a few months each.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether the &amp;#34;activated charcoal&amp;#34; works, but I started using a few charcoal products around the same time, and my oily acne-prone skin has definitely improved.</li>
            <li> Sponges I&#x27;ve used in the past do not hold up and can be either too soft or too harsh.  </li>
            <li> but if I don&#x27;t wash my face in some form or other, I&#x27;m still oily and my pores remain clogged.</li>
            <li> My skin felt extremely velvety and plumped out after using it.</li>
            <li> , the area always being slightly to very pink.</li>
            <li> I am using it with the black charcoal soap.</li>
            <li> The sponges seem to help keep the pink toned down or at least don&#x27;t aggravate it and seem to work well over my other varying skin types across my face.  </li>
            <li> : When itâ€™s dry itâ€™s a hard little ball like disc.</li>
            <li> and I thought I&#x27;d give these little ones a shot.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it with cleansers because I want to know how these little sponges do without a cleanser</li>
            <li> The other days I get lazy and sometimes donâ€™t wash my face if Iâ€™m staying home all day.</li>
            <li> I have used for a few weeks, so perhaps it takes longer to see results.</li>
            <li> Maybe not, Iâ€™m not sure.</li>
            <li> It has a very faint musky, natural, organic smell.</li>
            <li> I do use a very small amount of cleanser if I have makeup on</li>
            <li> Not something that is bothersome, but not pleasant either</li>
            <li> Can but this all 3 for .99 cents, very very disappointed, the worst part is that there is no way to return as you realize what they really are once you wet them.</li>
            <li> Fairly expensive for something so disposable.</li>
            <li> I canâ€™t think of anything bad to say about this!</li>
            <li> I canâ€™t think of anything bad to say about this!</li>

            <li> delightful sponges!  quite useful- and the hanging loop makes drying and storage a simple matter- the exfoliation is gentle, smooth and pleasant- my facial cleanser dissolves into the sponge and together the combination works smoothly-  the cleanser washes out of the sponge and the sponge is left looking clean and as it dries, it looks and feels great!  - very clean!  -unobtrusive yet effective!  -easy to maintain and a pleasure to use!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SPONGE! I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else. I do use a mild face gel cleanser with this, rinse well and squeeze between palms and hang to dry for long life of sponge.</li>
            <li> I just received these yesterday and have already used it twice. They are a bit smoother in texture than the Ecotools brand that I had before.  I am in my mid 30s and am starting to get fine lines along the laugh line area.  I also have rather dry skin so I try not to use cleansers with too many chemicals. I love how gentle this is on my skin! With this product I only use a cleanser with it once a week and use the sponge alone daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure not to damage the surface with your nails and always press the water out of the sponge between your palms before hanging it to dry!</li>
            <li> I love them!&lt;br /&gt;My sponges arrived on time and they are beautifully packaged. A set of instructions is included and they are very easy to use and store.&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good and natural exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly pleases with these sponges.  I use them to exfoliate both before and after i shave.  I shave with a safety razor and the sponge(and face wash) help to lift the hair and clean the pores for less irritation and razor bumps.  Five stars!</li>
            <li> These sponges are great for gentle cleaning.  Make sure you wet it thoroughly before using!</li>
            <li> Loved the product. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I bought these hoping to encourage my 10 and 13 year old granddaughters to be more faithful in face washing. It worked! They love them and the way they feel on their faces. I actually had to tell them to quit scrubbing. I have one also and really really like it.</li>
            <li> Love these sponges. I have very sensitive and delicate skin due to acne medication and these are non abrasive and very gentle. This company also followed up with me on my order (unsolicited) and provided FAQ&#x27;s on the care and use of my sponges. When I had a question, they responded on a Sunday within minutes! Excellent customer service! I will be reordering! Thank you!</li>
            <li> These sponges are wonderful! They leave my skin feeling so soft after. Totally worth the buy and you get 3 which lasts for a while! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Konjac sponges and I&#x27;m a fan! I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, and I was pleasantly surprised with the gentle exfoliation. They arrived in nice packaging, with clear instructions. I&#x27;d purchase these from this seller again!</li>
            <li> The products have been working well.  They look just like the picture on the internet.  They leave my skin feeling soft.  I don&#x27;t see an improvement just yet, but I am sure that I will.</li>
            <li> These sponges are great. I use mine every day &amp; it holds up perfectly, dries great overnight, when I wet it well it handles my facial cleanser with no problem, gets the cleanser &amp; keeps it foamy. I rinses out easy &amp; clean after use. My face feels clean &amp; looks clean &amp; bright after I dry my face. Just a well made product &amp; what a nice package they come in, with little cards to explain the sponges &amp; how they should be used. Quality &amp; fast service. Would buy again &amp; recommend.</li>
            <li> These are pretty cool .. I don&#x27;t use soap and my face feels clean after using them .. Simple and nice</li>
            <li> These sponges really get all the makeup off my face, leaving it very soft and clean!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think the sponge is doing EXACTLY what it says it will. There are no instructions to actually wash your face before or after use of the sponge but if I don&#x27;t wash my face in some form or other, I&#x27;m still oily and my pores remain clogged. It does feel very nice when using the sponge, but again, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s all it&#x27;s cracked up to be.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for about a week now and I love them! I have adult acne and most of the treatments available make my skin dry and don&#x27;t really help that much. I am surprised at how much my skin has already cleared up. It is not dry or itchy either! I do use a very small amount of cleanser if I have makeup on but nothing if I don&#x27;t. I would highly recommend. Just need one on a back scrubber now!</li>
            <li> I love the Konjac sponges. They keep my face feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;ve been looking for a sturdy yet gentle sponge and because of excellent reviews, I decided to order through Amazon. Sponges I&#x27;ve used in the past do not hold up and can be either too soft or too harsh.  I received your beautifully wrapped package in a timely manner. Its exactly what I&#x27;m looking for; sturdy in hand yet gentle to my skin. With gentle exfoliation, it cleans my face well and I&#x27;m recommending this product to others. Thank you.</li>
            <li> These sponges are great!  I have sensitive skin, so if I just happen to scrub with too much force, my face can get irritated.  So far, that has not happened with these sponges.</li>
            <li> Oh my these sponges are brilliant. I don&#x27;t even know where to start. Let&#x27;s see, I&#x27;ve always been using drug store cleansers my whole life and I thought I&#x27;d give these little ones a shot. They have been doing great on my skin. Though I only use it on my face, you can also use them on your body. You can use them without any cleansers and soaps but that wouldn&#x27;t be refreshing when washing your body, would it? I do use these on my face only because my face&#x27;s skin is very sensitive and I like to separate what I use on my face and body. Plus my body&#x27;s skin is doing fine with body wash and wash cloth. But my face&#x27;s skin is so sensitive that whatever I use, I&#x27;d get these little acne. It&#x27;s not bizarre but it still doesn&#x27;t feel good, I mean who wouldn&#x27;t want clear skin. Look at me going on and on about stuff and forgetting about these brilliant sponges. Well, first of all, I just love rubbing these little sponges on my face, it is just so soft enough for you to just rub and rub. It has never give me any acne. It cleans my face well. I don&#x27;t use it with cleansers because I want to know how these little sponges do without a cleanser and they are doing wonderful. After using it, I can feel my face being so soft. Also I started noticing my acne being gone a bit. I haven&#x27;t use these for long enough to notice a huge result but I have faith in these that they will do miracles on my skin. Although, it does have a little charcoal scent which makes me feel like I&#x27;m cooking my face (lol), they are wonderful sponges. I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone. Give these little ones a chance to do some miracles on your skin ~ :D Oh and I got these little ones in exchange of an honest review from the wonderful seller &amp;#34;Beth&amp;#34; ~</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sponge for about 2 weeks, so far i like it, but still not sure how long this one will last, i&#x27;ll give updates once i found it.</li>
            <li> The little sponges are just perfect for what I wanted to remove my dry skin from face daily.  I use a good face scrub with the sponge.</li>
            <li> These are as good as the item description says they are.  Love them and will continue to buy them.</li>
            <li> After seeing reviews saying they were sold at sephora, I figured that meant they were a good quality product and would actually make a difference. The sponges, once wet, are super soft to the point where they almost feel slimy. I used these sponges for about 3 weeks and didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I love using this sponge, my skin feels clean and fresh after using it.</li>
            <li> Definitely helped me with fading away blemishes from previous acne, and helped keep skin clear. Have been using it with Murad acne clearing face wash for a month now.</li>
            <li> I see. No benefit. So soft, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it can clean at all.</li>
            <li> Received the product as scheduled and tried it as soon as I got it, of course. I&#x27;ve used charcoal products before, including homemade charcoal/colloidal silver in all natural glyrecin. This sponge, however, surprised me beyond my expectations.  Every time I use it, it leaves my face feeling younger. I haven&#x27;t used it enough to report any significant changes, but so far it worked great</li>
            <li> These sponges are so cool (: my skin feels incredible after I shower with my new sponge! I&#x27;ve even noticed a difference in razor bumps! Love love love!</li>
            <li> These are super absorbent and make you feel clean. I will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> Used the sponge several times and it feels like nothing on my skin, there is virtually no exfoliating going on and I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these sponges now for about two weeks and so far they have been great. This brand is by far superior vs the last brand that I purchased. The sponges are very dense and seem less susceptible to tearing, which was an issue with the previous brand of sponge.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference after using a couple of times. Cleared up blackheads.</li>
            <li> First of all let me say, this was the first time ever getting an email from a Company before I even got the product, Great Jobs on that. Now the sponges arrived on time .I am using them already, like the soft feel of them, hard as a rock when they first arrive...but so wonderful feeling once you follow the directions. It does have a string for hanging up, I couldn&#x27;t tell from the picture.I am using it with the black charcoal soap. I feel these will last as they should, I wet the sponge, rub it gently over the soap....so far so good. It&#x27;s working good, I don&#x27;t suggest using everyday! I didn&#x27;t have the falling apart issues. So far, so good</li>
            <li> I still use face wash with mine or a charcoal bar but works great. Leaves skin feeling much cleaner and exfoliated.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:7cd8626dafd0ae614be6c54d0167ace7]] I wanted to do a slide show to capture the quality of these sponges.  They are super soft and really remove impurities from your skin.  The price is amazing and they last so long.  The packaging is even cute and it comes with easy to follow directions as you will see in the slide show.  These are great for sensitive skin and removing make up.  I am a loyal user of this company&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this free or at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased feedback but I can 100% tell you this is a great product</li>
            <li> I use a konjac sponge every single night when I wash my face. I don&#x27;t think you need to pay a ton to get a good konjac sponge. This brand is awesome! They were extremely well packaged and each was individually wrapped. SO nice!&lt;br /&gt; This works as an incredibly gentle exfoliator. I wash off all my makeup first with oil (I don&#x27;t use foaming cleansers) and then use the konjac for about a minute. I go in soft circles all over my face and let it dry overnight outside the shower. Since starting with these sponges about 8 months ago, my skin is infinitely softer and healthier! It helps with acne and dryness too! These are a beauty STAPLE for me.&lt;br /&gt;Although I don&#x27;t think this actually has real activated charcoal, I still love them. And these ones from the Beauty Shelf are wonderful</li>
            <li> These are way overpriced sponges, have nothing special. Can but this all 3 for .99 cents, very very disappointed, the worst part is that there is no way to return as you realize what they really are once you wet them. I wish i could get my money backðŸ˜–ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜–</li>
            <li> Excellent for acne prone skin. Wish I had knowledge of this when I was in my teens.</li>
            <li> Wonderful item! Works great to keep my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Very nice packaging, customer service seems excellent in following up, but I truthfully cannot claim these are helping my skin improve. I have used them once daily, and do not find they are sufficient to remove all dead skin. I have also not noticed any improvement in clearing up acne. I do like the feel of them on my skin though, and they are gentle/ do not cause redness on the skin. I have used for a few weeks, so perhaps it takes longer to see results. If I see a change in my skin, I will update accordingly.</li>
            <li> These will appear small and tough when you first receive them, but as soon as they get soaked they are soft and hold lots of shower gel.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely live these sponges! I have acne prone skin even though I&#x27;m a 30 something,  since using these my face has never looked so good and felt so clean and smooth! I love how convenient the sponge is and that I can use it with or without cleanser. I wish I had tried these sponges sooner!</li>
            <li> Loved the sponges, the quality is the same as the ones they sell at Sephora, but the price is so much more reasonable. I just love the feeling of the sponge on my face, it exfoliates my skin so gently and it works perfectly for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Not really anything special. Fairly expensive for something so disposable.</li>
            <li> Just got my charcoal sponges a couple of weeks ago and have been using them almost every morning. Too soon to tell if it makes a big difference on my skin, but so far my face feels soft and clean. And it saves the expense of the exfoliating wash I use.</li>
            <li> Really like the way these feel on my face leaves skin feeling very smooth. The only down side is I felt I had to use a lot of soap to remove all the makeup as they seem to absorb a lot of the soap</li>
            <li> I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect with this sponge, but I have been really happy with it. I have never used anything like this before and itâ€™s been really incorporated into my facial routine on some days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ Useful: I still prefer cleanser on days I wear makeup, which is about 3-4 days a week. The other days I get lazy and sometimes donâ€™t wash my face if Iâ€™m staying home all day. This has been a lifesaver on those days. Instead of just not washing my face, I scrub it in the morning and at night with this. Since the weather has been in the 90â€™s in Seattle, I find myself using this 2-4 times a day sometimes when I get sweaty or just want to freshen up my face or remove some sunscreen. I also use these after working out to just remove the oil and sweat. It feels so refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ Texture: When itâ€™s dry itâ€™s a hard little ball like disc. When itâ€™s wet itâ€™s a very porous sponge. It has a smooth texture, but with a firm circular motion I can feel it lightly exfoliating. Itâ€™s not harsh at all, I can see why they say itâ€™s fine to use it with babies. It would be handy if one side was softer and one side had a little more abrasive of a texture for more exfoliation. Iâ€™m guessing because of the nature of the material thatâ€™s not possible.&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ Smell: It has a very faint musky, natural, organic smell. Not something that is bothersome, but not pleasant either, I would say itâ€™s a neutral odor. It dissipated after about 5 uses and now I donâ€™t smell much at all. It&#x27;s organic and natural, which is very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ Long lasting: I have been using the same one for a month and it seems as good as new. This is part of the reason I donâ€™t want to use it to get makeup off, I can imagine it getting icky pretty fast if I do that. Maybe not, Iâ€™m not sure. I am just used to using cleanser with makeup, so thatâ€™s what I do. Using it how I am, I am anticipating 3-6 months of use per sponge. It dries up to its original state of being smaller and hard after about 2 days of not using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints about this. It&#x27;s not replacing my cleanser, but it&#x27;s really helping on the other few days a week I don&#x27;t want to do my 10 minute skincare routine. It was packaged nicely and could be given as a gift. The string is really handy. I really appreciate that it can hang next to my sink to dry. I canâ€™t think of anything bad to say about this! I was sent it to test and review. This is my honest opinion of the sponges.smaller and hard after about 2 days of not using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints about this.

            <li> konjac sponge is great. It is a very unusual product, and I&#x27;ve never used anything like it. My skin felt extremely velvety and plumped out after using it. I felt like I had had a 3 hour facial, my skin felt so pure!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! My skin was super soft after first use!</li>
            <li> Really love this sponge... highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I read about these sponges on my internet travels and decided to give them a try...love them! Delivery was on time, sponges where packaged in a beautiful box for storage. 3 is a perfect number should last about 6 months...so worth it. I noticed a diffrence in my skin for the better in less than a week. Thank you!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:6b4607f827ebfec56c8fdfeb9e472069]] Love these konjac facial sponges. This is a great box set of 3 charcoal sponges. You can use these sponges to wash your face and body, but I mostly use it as a facial sponge. I like that you can use these sponges without any face wash although I prefer using the sponges in combination with a facial soap. These charcoal sponges are great for treating acne, fighting acne and dealing with excess oil. My skin type is a combination of oily and normal so for me personally I don&#x27;t use these sponges daily. I like to use these sponges maybe 1-2 a week as an acne/excess oil preventative. The charcoal sponges leave my skin feeling soft and don&#x27;t cause any type of irritation.  I highly recommend these sponges to all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchang for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I love these konjac sponages!!! I have a problem with acne so I am always looking to try whatever I can to help clear it up! These charcoal sponges are great for treating acne and dealing with oily skin (which I have as well). I use these sponges about 3 times a week and just run it over my face and the areas that are affected by acne. It leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Have to admit I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect when I saw these, but I read up on the reviews and didnâ€™t see anything negative, so I thought Iâ€™d give them a shot. I am very glad that I did! My skin just feels amazing once I am done using them!</li>
            <li> easy and gentle to use and leaves skin soft and cleansed</li>
            <li> These sponges are *very* gentle. I bought these to prevent feeling my face while washing, which prevents my picking. Please know that it is recommended to replace each sponge after a month of use. I use mine daily. Excellent.</li>
            <li> They looked smaller than I expected but after the one use expanded to a good size.  I&#x27;m enjoying it and us it wet after a quick rinse with cleanser.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with these sponges. Not only are they unique &amp; compact, but easy to use &amp; care for, no strange odors, no rough texture and are not abrasive. My teenage grandchildren will probably receive some for Christmas. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product</li>
            <li> Loved this product. I bought the 3 pak and gave one to my daughter.  She&#x27;s 26. I&#x27;m 59  we both loved it.  I bought 2 more 3 paks. One for me and one for her</li>
            <li> Nice Gentle to the skin</li>
            <li> I love this product... this is the very first time I have ordered these or ever used a sponge on my face... this is so soft when it gets wet and very soothing... I love how it makes my face feel super clean. I will be ordering this again for my mom and sister to use as well... I feel like this helps get the dead skin off my face especially after a long hot sweaty day..</li>
            <li> They do a great job!!  So convenient.  Thinking of getting them for my spa.</li>
            <li> Konjac Sponges are great!  They feel great on my skin and I really feel my skin gets cleaner than using an ordinary facial sponge.</li>
            <li> These sponges are great!  I love that I don&#x27;t need to use soap.  Leaves my face feeling smooth and fresh.  Very unique product!</li>
            <li> Great sponges so far. Who knows how long they will hold up? The real question with all konjac sponges is how long they last before falling to pieces. I was going to give it time before reviewing, but the company will berate you with repeated emails until you leave a review. As a result, I&#x27;m leaving this review now, and perhaps I&#x27;ll update later. The sponge feels great on my skin, but the company&#x27;s persistent tactics leave me with a bad taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Product arrived right on time. I received an email letting me know the product was on its way and a contact name/number/email if I had any questions. Great customer service. Just what I was looking for, the product was exactly the same as pictured. I&#x27;ve used several times and am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought these sponges based on the reviews I read and am very glad I did.  I find they are gentle enough to use twice a day, yet do a very good job of slightly exfoliating.  My skin is a delightful combination of oily/acne, normal to dry and I have a light case of rosacea on my nose and along the sides of it, the area always being slightly to very pink. The sponges seem to help keep the pink toned down or at least don&#x27;t aggravate it and seem to work well over my other varying skin types across my face.  I use a small dollop (not quite the size of a pea) of face wash on the sponge at night and much as others stated, a little goes a long way.  Foams well, scrubs nicely, leaves my face feeling clean.  Do need to rinse well several times to get all the cleanser out and it takes multiple squeezes to wring out the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning depending on my mood, I may either wash my face only with the sponge or with some cleaner on the sponge.  The sponge alone works very well and I find it helps freshen up my skin in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I have only had the sponges for about 2 weeks, not sure how long they will last, but I&#x27;m hoping a few months each.</li>
            <li> Love these! Nice and soft, but still exfoliating. I love that they have a string for easy drying!! I&#x27;m not grossed out by the thought of a damp sponge sitting in bacteria. I&#x27;m not sure whether the &amp;#34;activated charcoal&amp;#34; works, but I started using a few charcoal products around the same time, and my oily acne-prone skin has definitely improved. And with three sponges, seems like these will last me a really long time!! I&#x27;ve used my sponge 3-4 times now and it is still in like-new condition. Great buy!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell, but then that&#x27;s me-I&#x27;m hyper- sensitive to odors. I gave them to my friend (who said she likes them very much)</li>
