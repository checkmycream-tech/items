            <li>It is very gentle and has a great sent.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s actually a great price on amazon compare to whole foods).</li>
            <li>I think she will love it.</li>
            <li>hope there will be more favorable project</li>
            <li>I have dandruff and it made it a bit better</li>
            <li>This is Safe and love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of Burt&#x27;s Bees better but for her hair alone</li>
            <li>I like it, but my husband suggested it smelled like a famous &amp;#34;pine-scented&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe and clean!</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and my girls love this product!  </li>
            <li>A bit drying and not as great for very sensitive baby skin.</li>
            <li>I love itÔºÅIt is not expansive but useful!</li>
            <li>I tried this on a recommendation that this was good for sensitive skin too and after the first wash, her hair was so much better!  </li>
            <li>We tried something else and with the exception of smelling like savory herbs - like what you toss in with a ground beef dinner, it was fine.</li>
            <li>And it hasn&#x27;t irritated her skin which is important.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a most have in our bath time ;)</li>
            <li>Worth the money!  </li>
            <li>When my baby comes out of the tub, she does not have that baby clean smell that you just want to snuggle into.</li>
            <li>It smells great, keeps my sons skin &amp; hair soft, and doesn&#x27;t foam too much.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out baby&#x27;s skin and smells great.</li>
            <li>My hair just smells clean, not piney.</li>
            <li>We found one, My True Nature brand, that we could order online</li>
            <li>After first time use, you can feel the hair is smooth and silk</li>
            <li>My son is very sensitive and I love this product.</li>
            <li>I was searching for a baby shampoo/wash with no chemicals and that rated low on the EWG website and this one is my favorite shampoo that we&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>he size is just right, the express service is in place, dress up and feel very handsome, next time will come to buy</li>
            <li>I love these natural products.  </li>
            <li>plus I love that it is so natural</li>
            <li>Combo useful, design or cap .Me</li>
            <li>When I switched to this, her skin cleared right up.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and better for my baby&#x27;s skin than some of the other products out there!</li>
            <li>Very gentle and smooth, really delicate for a baby, I would recommend it to anybody looking for a good product</li>
            <li>Thank you very much .Next</li>
            <li>I frantically tried everything and eventually settled on Burt&#x27;s Bees which worked fine with my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This is purely a personal preference and someone else may love the smell.</li>
            <li>I was willing to try.</li>
            <li>But then I wanted to try something available in stores near us.  </li>
            <li>This is my second purchase after the first one which made me completely satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the scent or clean rinsing formula that leaves baby&#x27;s skin SOOOO soft!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to the tried and true My True Nature brand.</li>
            <li>The scent does not linger long, and what does is super light on my and baby&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li>So, this does get my hair clean, but it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; type clean feeling (like washed with dish soap) although doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp at all.</li>
            <li>It is a bit more pricey than your average shampoo and body wash, but it is well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a consequence of her hair being fine and laying on her back and squirming all the time.  </li>
            <li>My daughter would get bumps after her bath when we would use another baby brand of shampoo that is also supposed to be gentle.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t, and I really like the smell.</li>
            <li>We really wanted to like the product and used about 80% of the bottle hoping that she needed to acclimate</li>
            <li>I have to twist cap off and too much</li>
            <li>I try to run as chemical-free a home as I reasonably can.</li>
            <li>This is one of the only shampoo / soaps out there that is gluten free.</li>
            <li>I think this smells great and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has sensitive skin and this is very gentle.</li>
            <li>They are gentle, non irritating and smell good.  </li>
            <li>I was particularly fond of.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I moved on to try California Baby Calendula shampoo/body wash and the very first time my son used it he was itching and red.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s responsible, safe, and gentle enough to use everyday.</li>
            <li>I thought that this one may not contain it because MOST HELPFUL CRITICAL REVIEW of other 2 products mention about it, while this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s not quite right, but he&#x27;s not far off!  </li>
            <li>but I found this to be too drying as well as having an odd herbal scent (reminiscent of Aveda products) which is ok</li>
            <li>This works well for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and started using it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I decided to try something for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Before that, I used it on my 2 year old and she screamed when it was rinsed passed her eyes.  </li>
            <li>My son loves this shampoo and it doesn&#x27;t bother him when it gets near his eyes.  </li>
            <li>It is not very harsh and so far my son&#x27;s skin has responded favorably to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about the claim of helping smooth out tangles but as the father of a curly haired 3 year old</li>
            <li>The baby feel good after use, has certain help to eczema, the price is a little expensive,</li>
            <li>The all natural French Lavender scent is out of this world!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been suspicious that my son has been very mildly sensitive to the regular shampoo/body wash combo we had been using for years.  </li>
            <li>We recently had family visit, including a 6 month old, and I purchased this for their stay</li>
            <li>I have eczema-prone skin, and this does not dry me out anywhere near as other soaps I&#x27;ve tried, e.g. castile which is just waaaaay too drying.  </li>

            <li> I would like to mention I&#x27;ve noticed some dry spots on my baby&#x27;s back since using it.</li>
            <li> The baby had sensitive-ish skin- not super sensitive, but still had rashes.</li>
            <li> No bad/nasty unnecessary chemical, worth the extra cash for the peace of mind (</li>
            <li> I like it in theory, but it leaves my toddler&#x27;s skin extremely dry even though I apply lotion after each bath and bathe only every other day when possible.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in an effort to calm my poor baby&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasted us a long time.</li>
            <li> Same as the other product from this company.</li>
            <li> I use this for my toddler son with dry skin patches.  </li>
            <li> and I had hoped that this would ease her dry skin</li>

            <li> My little one got eczema and then I learned that it is bet to avoid essential oils in baby washes and lotions. I stopped using it. Did not care for the smell for the few weeks when I did use it.</li>
            <li> This works well for sensitive skin. My daughter would get bumps after her bath when we would use another baby brand of shampoo that is also supposed to be gentle. When I switched to this, her skin cleared right up. I also have sensitive skin and started using it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I did not rate it 5 stars because I am not a big fan of the scent. This is purely a personal preference and someone else may love the smell. The scent also does not linger at all. When my baby comes out of the tub, she does not have that baby clean smell that you just want to snuggle into. However, I know that fragrance usually does have to be cut out for sensitive formulas and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in an effort to calm my poor baby&#x27;s eczema. We&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, and it seems to do well. For us, It doesn&#x27;t necessarily moisturize or anything, but it does help with the redness. I follow it up with CeraVe after his bath and his skin stays nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the scent, it&#x27;s something that I will probably try if my eczema flares up this winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I&#x27;m very happy that it&#x27;s made in the USA, and all natural.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and smooth, really delicate for a baby, I would recommend it to anybody looking for a good product</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to avoid the parabens and pthalates.  I like it in theory, but it leaves my toddler&#x27;s skin extremely dry even though I apply lotion after each bath and bathe only every other day when possible. I also think the smell is similar to a household cleaner, but you could always go with the unscented version if drying isn&#x27;t an issue for your child.</li>
            <li> I use this for my toddler son with dry skin patches.  Haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement, but it hasn&#x27;t gotten worse (so I don&#x27;t think it has anything to do with the shampoos I am using).  I was worried it would smell a little girly but it isn&#x27;t, and I really like the smell.</li>
            <li> I use this occasionally for my baby&#x27;s bath. He has eczema, so I use it diluted with water. It is not very harsh and so far my son&#x27;s skin has responded favorably to it.</li>
            <li> Love all California Baby products!  They are gentle, non irritating and smell good.  Great products!  You can&#x27;t go wrong when buying them.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and my girls love this product!  It does a great job!</li>
            <li> Great product, quick shipping!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe and clean! No bad/nasty unnecessary chemical, worth the extra cash for the peace of mind (but it&#x27;s actually a great price on amazon compare to whole foods). It&#x27;s a most have in our bath time ;)</li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> buy twice. it&#x27;s good for my baby. i use lt also for hand wash. baby loves it. so i will buy it next time.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo&amp; body wash! My daughter has sensitive skin and this is very gentle. I was searching for a baby shampoo/wash with no chemicals and that rated low on the EWG website and this one is my favorite shampoo that we&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I use this product for my baby and LOVE IT!  It is a bit more pricey than your average shampoo and body wash, but it is well worth every penny. The all natural French Lavender scent is out of this world! Friends and family are always asking me what type of shampoo I use on her because of the wonderful aroma! Plus it&#x27;s responsible, safe, and gentle enough to use everyday.</li>
            <li> I love these natural products.  Cleared up my newborn daughter&#x27;s cradle cap after only a few uses and I love the way it smells!</li>
            <li> I preparied for my baby, who wil be born in Aug, and havn&#x27;t use it. I think she will love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the claim of helping smooth out tangles but as the father of a curly haired 3 year old I was willing to try. I think this smells great and a little bit goes a long way.  All in all I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The baby feel good after use, has certain help to eczema, the price is a little expensive, hope there will be more favorable project</li>
            <li> Our favorite baby body wash!!  Can&#x27;t beat the scent or clean rinsing formula that leaves baby&#x27;s skin SOOOO soft!</li>
            <li> I love itÔºÅIt is not expansive but useful! hope my baby will like it,too. hope my baby will like it,too.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my 2 daughters for shampoo purpose after swim class. After first time use, you can feel the hair is smooth and silk and it will not irritate your hand. Both my daughters and I are loving the smell. The reason to rate for 4 star is because a little bit pricy on the product with 8.5 fl oz. Will purchase a big one next time to save some $$$.</li>
            <li> I have dandruff and it made it a bit better plus I love that it is so natural</li>
            <li> my son doesn&#x27;t like it, I don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li> Send to friends. Feel good</li>
            <li> Same as the other product from this company.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell and the thickness of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suspicious that my son has been very mildly sensitive to the regular shampoo/body wash combo we had been using for years.  I decided to try something for sensitive skin.  We found one, My True Nature brand, that we could order online and it was was wonderful.  But then I wanted to try something available in stores near us.  We tried something else and with the exception of smelling like savory herbs - like what you toss in with a ground beef dinner, it was fine. I couldn&#x27;t handle the smell, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I moved on to try California Baby Calendula shampoo/body wash and the very first time my son used it he was itching and red.  Before that, I used it on my 2 year old and she screamed when it was rinsed passed her eyes.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all and ended up returning the product - along with the Calendula conditioner I ordered and didn&#x27;t want to risk trying. Too bad I have to give it one star.  I&#x27;m going back to the tried and true My True Nature brand.</li>
            <li> My son loves this shampoo and it doesn&#x27;t bother him when it gets near his eyes.  The bottle lasted us a long time.</li>
            <li> My son is very sensitive and I love this product. It is very gentle and has a great sent.</li>
            <li> I heard it&#x27;s good from friends, so I wanna try it this time, haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but it looks good.</li>
            <li> I usually use this when I go to baths. It is really good. My family trys to use this. After that everybody uses it.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase after the first one which made me completely satisfied with this product.  Smells good, works fine on baby&#x27;s skin thus no reason to change it.</li>
            <li> This is Safe and love the smell. Best one so far that I&#x27;ve tried. Worth the money!  Safe and smells great!</li>
            <li> Combo useful, design or cap .Me and the baby .The baby is very happy.Thank you very much .Next time will buy .</li>
            <li> Loved this product, used it to make eye makeup remover and it works perfectly I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I would like to mention I&#x27;ve noticed some dry spots on my baby&#x27;s back since using it. I just apply a bit of Aquaphor.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It smells great, keeps my sons skin &amp; hair soft, and doesn&#x27;t foam too much. I have nothing negative to say about it.</li>
            <li> My baby had pretty bad eczema early on and Aveeno made it worse.  I frantically tried everything and eventually settled on Burt&#x27;s Bees which worked fine with my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.  However, she has a lot of hair and whenever she laid down (which was 80% of her life at this point) the hair at the back of her head would get so ratty and tangled.  I thought it was a consequence of her hair being fine and laying on her back and squirming all the time.  I tried this on a recommendation that this was good for sensitive skin too and after the first wash, her hair was so much better!  It was silky and never got tangled or matted.  I still had some Burt&#x27;s Bees left so I tried it again to test it and her hair went back to getting knotted again.  And it hasn&#x27;t irritated her skin which is important.  I like the smell of Burt&#x27;s Bees better but for her hair alone I prefer this.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful and is nice and gentle on baby&#x27;s skin. I love that I can have just one product for washing her hair and body too!</li>
            <li> he size is just right, the express service is in place, dress up and feel very handsome, next time will come to buy</li>
            <li> I trust it is very nice, and recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, for our baby this did not work very well.  She has eczema and I had hoped that this would ease her dry skin but I found this to be too drying as well as having an odd herbal scent (reminiscent of Aveda products) which is ok but it was not something I was particularly fond of.  We really wanted to like the product and used about 80% of the bottle hoping that she needed to acclimate but her eczema did not improve.  We even tried to just use just it as a shampoo but her scalp became too dry as well.  Only when we switched over to Cerave products did her redness disappear and skin improve.  YMMV.</li>
            <li> spout didn&#x27;t work so I have to twist cap off and too much comes out</li>
            <li> A bit drying and not as great for very sensitive baby skin.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! Doesn&#x27;t dry out baby&#x27;s skin and smells great.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that doesn&#x27;t make my son&#x27;s face breakout.</li>
            <li> it is really a good product and the shampoo is more than others. when my son washes it ,the skin looks so good</li>
            <li> Works great for advertised use: babies. We recently had family visit, including a 6 month old, and I purchased this for their stay bc I try to run as chemical-free a home as I reasonably can. The baby had sensitive-ish skin- not super sensitive, but still had rashes. After using this for a week, no rashes!  They didn&#x27;t use the entire bottle, and not one to waste- I took it into my own shower for use as a body wash and ulta-gentle shampoo.  I have eczema-prone skin, and this does not dry me out anywhere near as other soaps I&#x27;ve tried, e.g. castile which is just waaaaay too drying.  I have always been prone to occasional break outs and no more after also using to wash my face. Lathered great. Why didn&#x27;t I rate 5 stars?  For hair, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;ok.&amp;#34; On the baby&#x27;s &amp; on mine- same experience: I don&#x27;t use a lot of styling product. So, this does get my hair clean, but it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; type clean feeling (like washed with dish soap) although doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp at all. I definitely suggest a conditioner-type product either during the shower or a spray afterwards to re-add softness. The smell: I like it, but my husband suggested it smelled like a famous &amp;#34;pine-scented&amp;#34; cleaner.  He&#x27;s not quite right, but he&#x27;s not far off!  Either way, it&#x27;s not enough to deter me.  The scent does not linger long, and what does is super light on my and baby&#x27;s skin.  My hair just smells clean, not piney.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and better for my baby&#x27;s skin than some of the other products out there!</li>
            <li> This is one of the only shampoo / soaps out there that is gluten free. My son is severely allergic to gluten and cannot tolerate it. It is expensive, but is all natural.</li>
            <li> shipped in a good condition.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my friend. She said it was good.</li>
            <li> This one also has sodium benzoate. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s harmful, though. Just FYI in order to be on par with other California Baby Shampoo &amp; Bodywash products. I thought that this one may not contain it because MOST HELPFUL CRITICAL REVIEW of other 2 products mention about it, while this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> good quality.Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Excellent!! I loveee!!</li>
