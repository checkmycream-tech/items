            <li>Available on Prime as well.</li>

            <li>i would buy more ty you very much</li>
            <li>Thank you for the super quick delivery!</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t see any difference with the original</li>
            <li>this manufacturer is familiar to you.</li>
            <li>Given my own experience I now enclose the trimmer head in a soft cloth with an elastic band.</li>
            <li>Excellent price for the same blade you would pay almost double in a supply store for barbers.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, very sharp.  </li>
            <li>Fit my Andis Styliner perfectly and is just sharp enough.</li>
            <li>Better than getting a new one clipper.</li>
            <li>My share almost feels brand new again. :)</li>
            <li>But there are Andis clipper owners who aren&#x27;t too aware of Andis and might not be too familiar with name brands like me</li>
            <li>Glad to have purchased the replacement blade b/c the old ones were damaged.</li>
            <li>Nice for low cuts.</li>
            <li>I use this particular blade to make razor sharp lines around my goatee, I&#x27;ve been using this model and system for over 10 years now, works great.</li>
            <li>pretty cool until i zero gapped too much</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the fact that these blades made my old trimmer look brand new!</li>
            <li>Great blade, comes preadjusted to factory standards, wasnt hard to adjust to my standards.</li>
            <li>Overall I was satisfied with the blade replacement..</li>
            <li>Fast Deliver!  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li>This machine will last for many many years, only requiring blade changes every now and then.</li>
            <li>Make sure the blade is properly attached and well oiled before use.  </li>
            <li>ok thanks now just to get my clientelle back and cut some hairs</li>
            <li>Thanks again, for the fast service!</li>
            <li>The owner should definitely consider having more than one perspective image of what fully comes with the blade so people are more aware of what they&#x27;re purchasing, just like other andis blade sellers do.</li>
            <li>My replacement is very sharp and cut my skin (I cut my own hair)...</li>
            <li>work&#x27;s very well its the one i have been looking for 2 years</li>
            <li>I thought these were regular blades that would fit on my T-Outliner.</li>
            <li>Swore they were stainless steal blades.</li>
            <li>Product Dint fit and it had an extra piece on it that made it incompatible.</li>
            <li>if you well haha</li>
            <li>I have been using the Syliner since high school!</li>
            <li>Back to factory original setup.</li>
            <li>Also, until I realized that I could just purchase the trimmer head, I replaced my last trimmer after damaging the head paying the full price of the trimmer - well, what can I say.</li>
            <li>My new blade works like a charm!</li>
            <li>new trimmer.the blade gives very neat trim around the hairline.</li>
            <li>Test it out on the back of your hand before you start trimming to make sure it is working properly and will not cut you.</li>
            <li>Very good for cutting hair.</li>
            <li>Seems like thus blade is duller than normal</li>
            <li>Made my Styliner II like new again.</li>
            <li>Thought I needed a new trimmer, saw this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I had to purchase a new T blade after accidentally dropping my old clipper onto a tile</li>
            <li>I received an old andis masters clipper from a retired Barber.</li>
            <li>I have been doing hair for 30 years and this blade is by far the smoothest trimmer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>I shave with my andis and needed new blades, due to the fact I dropped my trimmers in the sink, chipping my old blades!</li>
            <li>maybe I am familiar with my dull blade that I replaced.</li>
            <li>I received fast but it is working as my old one is so not very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I just use it to set a line, then I take it down with a razor to get the edges really crispy.</li>
            <li>Just a very small chip can in any of the teeth can make the difference between a quick effective trimming and cutting or abrading the skin.</li>

            <li> Be careful in the beginning because it WILL cut you if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed it didnt come with the two screw outter screws but great product.</li>
            <li> AND YOU WILL KEEP THEM IN USE FOR A LONG TIME...</li>
            <li> lasting longer than expected.</li>
            <li> What u needed but took extremely long to recieve.</li>
            <li> popped it into my old andis trimmer and and with a few tweeking got it to work.  </li>
            <li> but this is just for black trimer only dos nat work for all trimmers</li>
            <li> It turned my broken trimmer back to being new.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how dull my old blade was until I used this one.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected.  </li>
            <li> Work as expected.</li>
            <li> Works like expected.</li>
            <li> Its sharper than i expected</li>
            <li> If you are familiar with the convenience of using electric clippers for trimming, shaping and cutting hair</li>
            <li> It cuts quickly, cleanly and without cutting the hair below the skin.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I started cutting my son&#x27;s hair that I decided to get a new blade because my old one started to nick him when I lined his hair up.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t cause they get too sharp.</li>
            <li> Right out the package and cutting.</li>
            <li> This blade is very sharp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades arrived promptly, were pre oiled and after attachment proved to be very sharp.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t replaced my blade in years for some odd reason.</li>
            <li> Arrived all scratched up as if it had been previously used.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected!!!</li>
            <li> Sharp Adjustable!!</li>
            <li> oh yes, purchase the Andis trimmer oil and oil up the head after every few uses.</li>
            <li> If any of the teeth are chipped then the likelihood of the trimmer cutting or abrading the skin is high.</li>
            <li> Lazy I guess.</li>
            <li> Replacement for dull blades.</li>
            <li> blades were really thin..</li>
            <li> so I ended up ordering the wrong pair of blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed because the blades are rusting.</li>
            <li> I just threw the product away :(</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been a backyard barber for years now and this product has been a staple in my repertoire.  Thoroughly satisfied with the product and the speedy service of the seller.  Good stuff woop woop.</li>
            <li> I have had my sty liner for over 20 years,I dropped it on the floor and the blade cracked on the side.These blades last forever,provided you don&#x27;t drop it on the floor.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected.  Had to &amp;#34;zero gap&amp;#34; the blade to get a cleaner cut. but after that all was good.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the super quick delivery! I shave with my andis and needed new blades, due to the fact I dropped my trimmers in the sink, chipping my old blades! My wife and I thank you, now that I&#x27;m not walking around with a ruff face any longer.                                                             Thanks again, for the fast service!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend that cuts hair in his spare time and he swears by these brand of blades for his clippers.</li>
            <li> this trimmer blade, after putting it on my trimmer, works like a brand new trimmer.the blade gives very neat trim around the hairline. i would recomment this blade to all that use andis styliner ll trimmer.</li>
            <li> Wow! My replacement is very sharp and cut my skin (I cut my own hair)... maybe I am familiar with my dull blade that I replaced. Regardless, great buy. --- Andis, PLEASE DO NOT OFF SHORE THE MAKING OF YOUR PRODUCTS ! ? ! Thank you.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the fact that these blades made my old trimmer look brand new! The cut is so precise, I will order another set soon!</li>
            <li> Glad to have purchased the replacement blade b/c the old ones were damaged. Made my Styliner II like new again. Just make sure you adjust them correctly and you have some hair clipper oil.</li>
            <li> THESE BLADES WORK AS DESCRIBED ; EASY TO INSTALL ; AS ALWAYS KEEP THEM WELL OILED AND YOU WILL KEEP THEM IN USE FOR A LONG TIME...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS,&lt;br /&gt;MO</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t replaced my blade in years for some odd reason. Lazy I guess. It wasn&#x27;t until I started cutting my son&#x27;s hair that I decided to get a new blade because my old one started to nick him when I lined his hair up. I gonna replace it once a year from now on.</li>
            <li> Replacement for dull blades. Work as expected.</li>
            <li> Just the replacement part i needed. Excellent quality, original item in original packaging. Just what i was looking for when i dropped my trimmer.</li>
            <li> It is serving me excellent. I have used it several times since I bout it and it gives a great cut each time.</li>
            <li> excellent my trimming blade, thanks..!!</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this blade is that it&#x27;s only for Andis Styliner II. But there are Andis clipper owners who aren&#x27;t too aware of Andis and might not be too familiar with name brands like me so I ended up ordering the wrong pair of blades. I thought these were regular blades that would fit on my T-Outliner. The owner should definitely consider having more than one perspective image of what fully comes with the blade so people are more aware of what they&#x27;re purchasing, just like other andis blade sellers do.</li>
            <li> Arrived all scratched up as if it had been previously used. Would not recommend. Not a satisfactory product at all.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, it was received just as promised and has done the job that I needed to do.</li>
            <li> The andis trimmer blade 2 worked put great for me. It turned my broken trimmer back to being new. Thankyou</li>
            <li> I have found that protecting the head is good practice. This is a fine, fine trimmer and I use it once a week for head and body grooming. If any of the teeth are chipped then the likelihood of the trimmer cutting or abrading the skin is high. Just a very small chip can in any of the teeth can make the difference between a quick effective trimming and cutting or abrading the skin. Given my own experience I now enclose the trimmer head in a soft cloth with an elastic band. Now I use the trimmer in a gym, I guess if I only used it at home I may not have to take such precautions. Also, until I realized that I could just purchase the trimmer head, I replaced my last trimmer after damaging the head paying the full price of the trimmer - well, what can I say. I won&#x27;t do that again. Enjoy this trimmer, it will serve you well, and, oh yes, purchase the Andis trimmer oil and oil up the head after every few uses. Rob</li>
            <li> it is still working for about two weeks i will wait and see how long it will last.  i don&#x27;t see any difference with the original</li>
            <li> Just what I expected!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed because the blades are rusting. Swore they were stainless steal blades.</li>
            <li> Right out the package and cutting. These blades cut excellent and no need for adjustment. Thank you for a good product</li>
            <li> I was about to throw my trimmer away because the last blade gouged. This one is so smooth. It cuts quickly, cleanly and without cutting the hair below the skin.</li>
            <li> Fast Deliver!  Quality Product as Described in the posting!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Fast shipment good quality</li>
            <li> Great blade and good quality.</li>
            <li> Outstanding just what I need it, work great.</li>
            <li> Work great for replacement</li>
            <li> Perfect replacements for my styleliner 2. Back to factory original setup. You can Adjust the blades for 0 gap but I haven&#x27;t cause they get too sharp. I just use it to set a line, then I take it down with a razor to get the edges really crispy. These blades still get closer than my 0 gapped whals.</li>
            <li> Very good for cutting hair. The blade fit perfect. Very good price. Better than getting a new one clipper. Nice for low cuts.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li> Works like expected. Can&#x27;t have any problems with it. This blade is very sharp. I adjusted mine to get a closer shave and they are perfect</li>
            <li> Fits my styliner ll perfect. Didn&#x27;t realize how dull my old blade was until I used this one.</li>
            <li> Seems like thus blade is duller than normal</li>
            <li> good blade. lasting longer than expected.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, and works great. My share almost feels brand new again. :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE BLADE! I received an old andis masters clipper from a retired Barber. The blade was in&lt;br /&gt;Bad shape but with this blade their as good as new.</li>
            <li> blades were really thin.. wich means nicer sharper line ups. just like the old blades  which is a really good thing.</li>
            <li> Order received. What u needed but took extremely long to recieve.</li>
            <li> pretty cool until i zero gapped too much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve using these blades for years.  They work hone for me.</li>
            <li> Product Dint fit and it had an extra piece on it that made it incompatible. I just threw the product away :(</li>
            <li> When i received the trimmer this product looked as if it was used their was hair on it will return.</li>
            <li> Its sharper than i expected it made my work feel so good its like using a razor to finish liining</li>
            <li> Excellent price for the same blade you would pay almost double in a supply store for barbers. I have been doing hair for 30 years and this blade is by far the smoothest trimmer I have ever owned. Details precisely and does line ups like a dream. No pulling. I would buy this blade 100 times over. Thank you for making my job easier.</li>
            <li> i realy like this this is good nice better if you well haha ok thanks now just to get my clientelle back and cut some hairs</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THESE TWO BLADES FOR MY GRANDSON WHO IS IN COLLEGE&lt;br /&gt;HE LOVES THEM. THANK YOU FOR CARRYING THEM AND THE PRICE IS&lt;br /&gt;THE ICING ON THE CAKE WHOOOOHOOOO!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these blades after I dropped my clippers. They fit and cut just as good as the old ones did. A perfect match for the Andis Styleliner II clippers.</li>
            <li> If you are familiar with the convenience of using electric clippers for trimming, shaping and cutting hair this manufacturer is familiar to you. Andis makes some of the best professional and consumer models of clipper blades and clippers on the market. I own the Styliner clipper as well which uses the non \\&quot;T\\&quot; shaped blade. I had to purchase a new T blade after accidentally dropping my old clipper onto a tile floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades arrived promptly, were pre oiled and after attachment proved to be very sharp. I use this particular blade to make razor sharp lines around my goatee, I&#x27;ve been using this model and system for over 10 years now, works great.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than Andis Styliner.</li>
            <li> Great replacement clipper head. Available on Prime as well.</li>
            <li> cuts very clean after you zero gap it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect!!! Sharp Adjustable!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Syliner since high school! This machine will last for many many years, only requiring blade changes every now and then. This blade gets the job done, is competitively priced compared to beauty supply shops. Be careful in the beginning because it WILL cut you if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> im muster barber i like this idem. but this is just for black trimer only dos nat work for all trimmers</li>
            <li> My new blade works like a charm! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Good buy for the price. Fit my Andis Styliner perfectly and is just sharp enough. I will buy more of these when needed.</li>
            <li> popped it into my old andis trimmer and and with a few tweeking got it to work.  the blade is exceptionally sharpe.  now I look and feel great!!!</li>
            <li> Thought I needed a new trimmer, saw this on Amazon.  I ordered, new blade set, arrived promptly, was an original equipment replacement part, works perfectly..</li>
            <li> Awesome! Wish I would have purchased the blade sooner!</li>
            <li> I received fast but it is working as my old one is so not very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this product for my styliner I.  I had to do a bit of modifying to get it to fit my trimmer, but it worked.  This is a great product, very sharp.  Make sure the blade is properly attached and well oiled before use.  Test it out on the back of your hand before you start trimming to make sure it is working properly and will not cut you.</li>
            <li> Great blade, comes preadjusted to factory standards, wasnt hard to adjust to my standards. A little disappointed it didnt come with the two screw outter screws but great product.</li>
            <li> I prefer the oem replacement blade over the Promate blade I thought I &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34; to.</li>
            <li> I GAVE THIS ITEM TO MY SON WHO IS A BARBER AND HE SAYS IT WORKS GREAT!</li>
            <li> Great way to buy clipper blades. Saved me a trip to the beauty supply store and the blades were either cheaper or around the same price.</li>
