            <li> Some products irritate my sensitive skin, so when I get a makeup bag of products I take the time to sample them individually for a couple days over the course of a few weeks.</li>
            <li> ESTEE LAUDER HAS BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME</li>
            <li> You must must use brushes, and small ones at that, to get the shadow and lipsticks out, the skin care items would probably last 1 week, 2 weeks with a push, I can deal with the mini mascara because they don&#x27;t last long anyways....</li>
            <li> Not pleased</li>
            <li> If you are looking to sample Estee Lauder&#x27;s products, and I do mean sample</li>
            <li> The bag is poorly made and flimzy.  </li>
            <li> It appears that Estee Lauder is really cutting expenses.  </li>

            <li> All my excitement was enhanced when I actually got to open my package, open the make up bag, and marvel at the quality goodies! Nothing less than fantastic. I haven&#x27;t tried all the products, for me, I&#x27;m patient. Some products irritate my sensitive skin, so when I get a makeup bag of products I take the time to sample them individually for a couple days over the course of a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend&#x27;s birthday. and She absolutely loved it!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this set for people who are looking for the perfect gift for their girlfriends or BBF</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT MOTHERS DAY GIFT. NOT ONLY IS IT A GREAT BUY BUT IT HAS EVERYTHING FOR A WOMEN ON THE GO. THIS DESERVES 5 STARS AND MORE. ESTEE LAUDER HAS BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME AND WHY BECAUSE IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with the original offer from macys in the spring &amp; had used almost all of the eye shadow &amp; lipstick. I really liked these products esp &amp; was very pleased to get another set of  them!! great products!!</li>
            <li> My mom loved it. Arrived Just in time.</li>
            <li> It appears that Estee Lauder is really cutting expenses.  Samples are cheaply packaged and skimpy.  I&#x27;ve never bought without going to the store and won&#x27;t do it again.</li>
            <li> its fit very well I use this item for clubbing or party whit my friends .the material its nice and beautiful ,other customers  buy this idem for  holidays or birthday gifts, the quality its very good for  my expectation .this  is good  and I am please to do business with you and thank you.</li>
            <li> had al allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Okay people, the products in the kit are definitely high quality Estee Lauder stuff, however the eyeshadow palette, lipstick palette and skin treatments are sooooo tiny that you can&#x27;t even dip a finger into them!!! You must must use brushes, and small ones at that, to get the shadow and lipsticks out, the skin care items would probably last 1 week, 2 weeks with a push, I can deal with the mini mascara because they don&#x27;t last long anyways....but boy oh boy!!! I bought this as a gift and didn&#x27;t expect that I would looking like a cheapo!!!</li>
            <li> I was shopping around for a friend&#x27;s birthday gift. She generally likes Estee Lauder things, so when I found this gift set online it seemed perfect. It had a lot of products for an excellent price so it was a no brainer. She loved it, which was what I wanted, so I&#x27;m very happy with this purchsse.</li>
            <li> Their listing does not disclose this to be a sample set. There is barely any product whatsoever. Tubes and jars are miniature. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> This was given to me as a gift from my husband for Christmas.  The eye shadow, and tray/compact  lip color are very small, but nice varieties.  There are no mirrors on the eye shadow or lipstick tray/compacts.  The mascara is really nice, but trial size also.  The lipstick is very nice.  I have never used Estee Lauder&#x27;s products so I am new to it.  I found out I am allergic to the face cream, which isn&#x27;t the company&#x27;s fault.  If you are looking to sample Estee Lauder&#x27;s products, and I do mean sample, this is the one for you.  The only non sample size  item is the lipstick.  The make up bag is small but cute.  It was a nice surprise to get.</li>
            <li> I love it!  would order again!  thank you  everything came in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;I love amazon!  I was amazed at how many products are available in this line.&lt;br /&gt;thank you again</li>
            <li> Excellent product, a great gift, the eyeshadow set is the best. Was a great buy for the price. Recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Estée Lauder products are the best and the special gift packs are so fun.  I&#x27;m always excited for the next product!!!</li>
            <li> The bag is poorly made and flimzy.  The cases for the eyeshadow and lip set appear to have had a mirror ripped out of the top.</li>
            <li> maybe I wanted more but not as I like, sorry this was too much for what it was.  Not pleased</li>
            <li> This was a free gift with purchase that is being resold.  You get one of these for free when you purchase $ 27.50 in Estée Lauder products during free gift time.  They are not meant for resale and are NOT Estée Lauder gift sets.</li>
