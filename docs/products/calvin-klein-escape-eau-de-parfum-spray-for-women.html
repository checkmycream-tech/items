            <li>I am always fan of CK&#x27;s Perfume and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have used this perfume for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>and I have spent thousands and thousands of dollars through the years by ordering from Amazon, which speaks for itself to say that we have been very happy with our purchases.  </li>
            <li>Its a good perfume for a reasonable price .</li>
            <li>It also shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>I have worn this fragrance and another by Givenchy for 25 years now and hope it will always be available.</li>
            <li>My new GF said she loved this stuff and was running out, and I thought it was super special</li>
            <li>I said &#x27;IF&#x27; you get the original fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Lasts pretty well throughout the day - more floral than I was expecting but not \\&quot;flowery\\&quot; by any means - really nice scent that receives many compliments each time I wear it - would definitely purchase again</li>
            <li>IF you get the &#x27;right&#x27; or original fragrance</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>

            <li>The previous bottle of Escape by Calvin Klein for Women I also ordered from Amazon in August 2013 and the fragrance is the same scent I fell in love with many years ago when I first smelt it.  </li>
            <li>It smells divine and the fragrance is longlasting and a bit unusual.</li>
            <li>guess it was too much for 4 months into that relationship</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my friend and she really loves it.</li>

            <li> This was a great buy at a good affordable price. It smells divine and the fragrance is longlasting and a bit unusual. It can be hard to find, so I am always grateful for finding it on amazon. I have worn this fragrance and another by Givenchy for 25 years now and hope it will always be available. Escape is fresh. It smells of LIFE!!! Love it!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted! Oldie but goodie!</li>
            <li> My new GF said she loved this stuff and was running out, and I thought it was super special I remembered.&lt;br /&gt;I guess it was too much for 4 months into that relationship... should have just brought her cake.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my friend and she really loves it. I really like the price. Its a good perfume for a reasonable price .</li>
            <li> Good morning all these objects came Congratulations perfect and they were very nice thank you send your best deals to remain a loyal customer dede Caracas Venezuela</li>
            <li> I ve always been having this perfume.  It&#x27;s one of my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel great wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing. Signature style.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Comparative decent pricing. I&#x27;ve worn this purfume for 22 years and it&#x27;s still my favorite.</li>
            <li> excellent they were not perfect I made ​​my comment above sorry but I&#x27;m happy with the product</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes. Smells amazing</li>
            <li> If I could leave two and a half stars I would to make my review experience &#x27;even&#x27;.  I say that because &amp;#34;as a whole&amp;#34; I love Escape by Calvin Klein for Women.  IF you get the &#x27;right&#x27; or original fragrance it is beautiful and I have received a **countless number** of compliments from strangers to family members and friends, who ask me what perfume I am wearing because it &amp;#34;smells so good&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you read that correctly.  I said &#x27;IF&#x27; you get the original fragrance.  The previous bottle of Escape by Calvin Klein for Women I also ordered from Amazon in August 2013 and the fragrance is the same scent I fell in love with many years ago when I first smelt it.  When I sprayed THAT bottle of Escape by Calvin Klein for Women on me is when the compliments were constant.  I reordered Escape again in May 2014, also from Amazon, and upon opening the new bottle of Escape by Calvin Klein for Women I instantly noticed that the aroma was not right.  My mind immediately went to the online reviews that I had read that were left by Amazon customers who were unhappy with their bottle of Escape by Calvin Klein for Women, stating specifically that it smelt more like alcohol and less like the fruity floral scent they expected.  Unfortunately this is precisely&lt;br /&gt;the bottle that was delivered to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say what exactly is happening, as to why two different bottles of the exact same perfume that I ordered from Amazon did not share the same scent, especially since they were both sold by Amazon.  I love Amazon and my husband and I have spent thousands and thousands of dollars through the years by ordering from Amazon, which speaks for itself to say that we have been very happy with our purchases.

This particular bottle is &#x27;off&#x27; big time.  I even waited awhile before writing this review as to give&lt;br /&gt;the perfume some time to &#x27;come alive&#x27; so to speak.  I thought (and hoped) to myself  &amp;#34;Maybe it&#x27;s just my imagination&amp;#34;, but I&lt;br /&gt;knew it wasn&#x27;t.  I asked the same family members who always gave me compliments from my perfume (when I was wearing Escape by Calvin Klein for Women from the bottle I ordered in August 2013) what they thought and they agreed that it wasn&#x27;t the same perfume I used to wear.  So needless to say, it is confirmed - by us anyhow- that the shipment I received is not  the &#x27;real&#x27; Escape by Calvin Klein for Women.  Maybe it was just a bad batch....I don&#x27;t know.  All I know is that it was not right and that it did not exude the &#x27;original&#x27; scent by Calvin Klein and is a big let down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I am going to be ordering this ONE more time from Amazon and I hope that I am happy with it when it arrives.

            <li> The scent was more alcohol than parfum. I love Escape Parfum and wish I had received a better bottle. I could tell the difference in the brand. I can&#x27;t get out to mail it back.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved the smell!</li>
            <li> The picture displayed and the actual size that was delivered, were two different things.  I love, love, love  Calvin Klein&#x27;s Escape  so I didn&#x27;t mind the size discrepancy but it was very deceptive.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It also shipped very quickly. I absolutely loved it! Def suggest using this company and this product to anyone</li>
            <li> Lasts pretty well throughout the day - more floral than I was expecting but not \\&quot;flowery\\&quot; by any means - really nice scent that receives many compliments each time I wear it - would definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> Smelled like the real deal. Will definitely re-order!</li>

            <li> what can i say its calvin klein.  I have used this perfume for years and love it.  received very fast</li>
            <li> I love it! Thank you.</li>
            <li> very good excellent product thank you for your attention</li>
