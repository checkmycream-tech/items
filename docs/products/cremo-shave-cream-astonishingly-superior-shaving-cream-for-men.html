            <li>, in my waiting for me DE razor, I used this Cremo with a disposable and got the very best shave</li>
            <li>Husband says this is the best ever.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;You took the time to write a review about a shaving cream?&amp;#34; Yeah I did, because this stuff is AWESOME!</li>
            <li>Very good indeed, but Proraso Sandalwood is the best in my opinion.</li>
            <li>(Smell is very pleasant.)  </li>
            <li>They both are very good cremes.</li>
            <li>Very good shave cream.</li>

            <li>I am already impressed by how great this shaving cream is, if you can even call it that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Follow the instructions on the bottle to get the BEST experience - if you just slap it on and shave you&#x27;ll get good shave but not the best experience.</li>
            <li>Cremo did eventually reply to me,  and very kindly sent me at no charge both some replacement Cremo and their skin conditioner product (which is excellent).</li>
            <li>Cremo smells great and softens whiskers for a very pleasant shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>Great Shaving Cream, Very good Lubrication .</li>
            <li>In my 68 years, I have always prided myself in good grooming and especially a great shave.</li>
            <li>I like good shaving creams and soaps and this is one of the best.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful stuff indeed.....</li>
            <li>good value for the money and a great shave!</li>

            <li>A great shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>Not as great as Chuck Woolery would have you believe in his TV/Radio pitches.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;ll probably be great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly great shave</li>
            <li>but I heard some really great things about Cremo cream.</li>
            <li>and it works great in both locations.  </li>
            <li>Great shave cream.</li>
            <li>It shaves well, and the smell is great.</li>
            <li>but I am happy to have my search stop here.</li>
            <li>I was using a shave gel everyone swore by and got great reviews on amazon</li>
            <li>Really great product.</li>

            <li>It smells great and worked as described.</li>
            <li>I think this product is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for about 5 month now and have noting but great things to say.</li>
            <li>and you will get a great shave.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any online fancy shaving creams but this one is great</li>
            <li>So I bought this based on all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>When I saw that it got great reviews</li>
            <li>I get a great shave every time with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>This, along with a nice blade, has produced the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Kiehl&#x27;s &amp;#34;Close Shavers&amp;#34; Shaving Cream for about 15 years and was quite happy.</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a great shave until I tried Cremo Cream.</li>
            <li>and I can run a rusty blade over my face with a great shave everytime.</li>
            <li>Great going guys.</li>
            <li>He is happy and shaving is not causing him pain anymore.</li>
            <li>It was a great &amp;#34;find&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy to have found this great product.</li>
            <li>Since I started using it about a month ago--along with my great blades, I have had no nicks, cuts, or scraps.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>I just started using it with a safety razor and it works great.  </li>
            <li>3 great things about this stuff...</li>
            <li>This worked great with my Mach 3 blades.</li>
            <li>this is awesome stuff all on its own</li>
            <li>Great product,</li>
            <li>it works great.  </li>
            <li>The smell is great but doesn&#x27;t linger so</li>
            <li>This is a great product for a great price</li>
            <li>shave soaps and brushes, so I was happy to try another.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never tried cream from a tube before but this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>and he seems happy.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love!!</li>
            <li>It is certainly much better than a can of Edge or Barbasol!!  </li>
            <li>It also has a very nice smell which I have come to appreciate.</li>
            <li>It also has a very nice smell which I have come to appreciate.</li>
            <li>This has very nice after-smell and feeling.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll get a very nice shave.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and it smells pleasant.</li>
            <li>This is a very good and cost effective product that deserves a place in your shaving kit.</li>
            <li>Amazing product!  </li>
            <li>Amazing stuff here!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>Great product, good smell.</li>
            <li>I get a remarkably closer shave with this cream than with a grocery store cream or gel.</li>
            <li>I dropped a star just because there isnt anything remarkable about the product.</li>
            <li>Unlike others, I found the smell pleasant.</li>
            <li>The smell is a very pleasant fruity, a very unique scent.  </li>
            <li>Best is still Dr. Carver&#x27;s Easy Shave Butter from Dollar Shave Club.</li>
            <li>This is easily the best shaving cr&amp;egrave;me I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Stuff was awesome and my razor glided so easily</li>
            <li>The best I was able to achieve was a kind of film, like lotion.</li>
            <li>It also smells really good, almost citrus smelling.</li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>it had good reviews</li>
            <li>I loved.</li>
            <li>Why pay for good cologne, and then use scented:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Clogs up between your blades and does not leave your skin in as good a condition as it claims.</li>
            <li>Even with a cheap razor, this is still the best shave cream I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>Adding water at the end for touch ups is all you need for a good shave with a blade.  </li>
            <li>Now, I get good shaves this way,</li>
            <li>If you overuse, the shave is not as good.</li>
            <li>A truly superior product.</li>
            <li>I got a really good lather.  </li>
            <li>Felt good on the skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think Creamo Cream is a good buy.  </li>
            <li>Good for making uber lather.</li>
            <li>It smells really good, but not like perfume.</li>
            <li>I needed to use a fair amount of it</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cremo Astonishingly Superior Shave Cream 6 oz&lt;</li>
            <li>He said that he loved the smell and that it gave a good lather.</li>
            <li>I gave it a fair tryout, used it for a week, followed directions and ended up tossing it in the trash.</li>
            <li>But compared to shaving cream, Cremo is absolutely superior.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m adding another star because I feel like being fair to the product.</li>
            <li>It really is a good product, I just wish it was easier to find.</li>
            <li>ASTONISHINGLY SUPERIOR SHAVE CREAM&lt;</li>
            <li>I know it is good</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>This a superior shave cream.</li>
            <li>and youre good to go.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a superior shave to what I&#x27;m used to yet, however the level of irritation has all but disappeared.</li>
            <li>Good quality</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t protect from razor burn like a good lather from shave soap.</li>
            <li>I bought the product after reading all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t find the Cremo a good shaving solution</li>
            <li>So here it is, I have my badger brush, Cremeo, and my good razor in the shower.  </li>
            <li>you have a tendency to get acne or breakouts when your pores get clogged, I have some good news for you:</li>
            <li>, I have some good news for you:</li>
            <li>It is simply good.</li>
            <li>Astonishingly superior?</li>
            <li>Good stuff, it works.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It puts a milky soapy film that smells good ...on your face</li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how good this works.</li>
            <li>I am using this to shave my legs and it is a good shave cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good shaving creme.</li>
            <li>Good investment in your skin.</li>
            <li>and I will say this is truly a superior shave cream.</li>
            <li>Even my wife loved it.</li>
            <li>Cremo is so good</li>
            <li>It felt sooo good to shave and afterwards to feel my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it smells good, works as advertised</li>
            <li>and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li>Cremo Cream is one of the best shaving creams made, smells great, and makes the razor glide right over your skin without irritation.</li>

            <li>This shaving cream is not bad, but not the best either.</li>
            <li>All of them had excellent reviews and probably all would have been worthy of purchase, however I did not have a badger hair brush</li>
            <li>Super awesome shaving cream for when I shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aside from making shaving easier and more enjoyable, I am mostly impressed by the smoothness of my skin hours after shaving!</li>
            <li>the very first, I was impressed.</li>
            <li>If you are shaving just your face, either will work fine and, in all fairness, Proraso does smell incredible.</li>
            <li>The verdict for me is that the is a very satisfying shave cream</li>
            <li>The verdict for me is that the is a very satisfying shave cream</li>
            <li>I was told by a friend that this was what he was using, and he was very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a full-head shaver who has tried a great many products, and Cremo is hands-down the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have been very pleased with the performance of Cremo.</li>
            <li>gave this a try and very glad that I did.</li>
            <li>Very enjoyable aroma, too.  </li>
            <li>Because you&#x27;re massaging it into your skin, it really is best to shave right after a shower, when your face is softest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>still on the lookout for even better slickness or longerlasting slickness with shave soaps - but this is the best so far and best performer for comfort, slickness, and an effective shave.  </li>
            <li>I tried it and it was better than foaming can creams, but I still experienced shaving irritation after using it and I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the smell, it has hints of oranges in it and stuck with me all day.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions and you will be able to enjoy the best qualities of the product.</li>
            <li>With this I am getting a better shave and saving 75% in the process!</li>

            <li>â™¦ Works best if brush is primed with hot water then shaken down.&lt;br /</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The best part is I&#x27;m still using my first bottle(? container thingy)</li>
            <li>Love The Stuff!</li>
            <li>Cremo is a much better product!</li>
            <li>It does work best if, as directed, you get your face and neck as hot as you can stand, but who has the time for that?</li>
            <li>No nicks, no discomfort and beautifully close and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I did!</li>
            <li>The first shaving cream I ever tried, and still the best!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Get this as your basic/goto while you search for your perfect soap/creme or as your travel/quickie crÃ¨me (figuring you may not be able to travel or want to with your full brush+mug/bowl kit..</li>
            <li>Cremo is amazing.</li>
            <li>Also amazing is the amount that I need to use.  </li>
            <li>Results were amazing.</li>
            <li>The stuff is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great to transfer to one of those 3-ounce travel squeeze tubes also available from Wal-Mart, to put in your travel bag.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>for the evaluation of Cremo....  it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>This shaving cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>still enjoy that aspect of shaving... but when on the run this stuff does a great job.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, I get almost zero irritation despite this combination giving me the closest shaves I have ever had in my life.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing...</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It lasts forever and really gives you the best shave for men and women.</li>
            <li>I bought a tube of this after hearing an enthusiastic radio advertisement for it.  </li>
            <li>Ive had better, almost prefer a good slippery foam.</li>
            <li>So I use warm sink water.</li>
            <li>Tomorrow I am going to try about a pea (the vegatable) size, and warm sink water.</li>
            <li>It makes a nice conditioner too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>but WONDERFUL, especially on sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Smells nice like an Orange peel.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a nice side benefit</li>
            <li>My husband who is not a &amp;#34;foo-foo&amp;#34; kind of guy LOVES this shaving cream.</li>
            <li>It works very well, doesn&#x27;t require a lot, and smells great!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t relish the idea of mixing my own lather with a brush</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always have time to lather up with a brush, so Cremo provides me with a nice shave when I&#x27;m pressed for time.</li>
            <li>I got a nice shave from it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Creamo Cream has a nice citrus scent that isn&#x27;t over-powering.  </li>
            <li>I do not think this is some kind of miracle product, but I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve even whipped up my own for a safety razor I shave with.</li>
            <li>no matter what kind of cream or soap I used, my face wouldn&#x27;t allow a shave but every 5-6 days.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works great!  </li>
            <li>There probably are others that as good or even better.</li>
            <li>The absolute BEST shaving cream i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Has a nice citrus fragrance, razor just slides on the face, no nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used Cremo about six times since receiving it and it does give a good shave though not any better than Barbasol.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely one of the best shaving creams I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own product.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and functions well for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li>Then whip up a nice lather by working your beard the brush, very quickly a nice lather will gather on your face.  </li>
            <li>Cremo does give you a really nice and close shave.</li>
            <li>Best shaving cream at very affordable price</li>
            <li>each have their own purpose.</li>
            <li>This is ABSOLUTELY the best shave cream that I have ever used in my 70 years on this planet.  </li>
            <li>This one is spectacular.</li>
            <li>this is a really nice choice</li>
            <li>Nothing has given me as nice a shave as Cremo.</li>
            <li>It is a nice cream.</li>
            <li>and I must say this Cremo is astounding.</li>
            <li>The absolute best shaving cream there is.</li>
            <li>sure what is it about it that makes it so good, but it works.</li>
            <li>After being pretty sure I liked feather blades the best of them all, I decided to give Cremo another try before throwing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its great for shaving my lady bits,  no razor burn and smells really clean too</li>
            <li>Quickly adapted and really impressed by how close and smooth a shave is by using this product.</li>
            <li>A cool water rinse at the conclusion of the shave caps off a great shaving experience.....</li>
            <li>Good product, but it is the second best shaving cream I have used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells good, easy to carry/travel and use....great value.  </li>
            <li>Cremo leaves your skin very smooth while Proraso leaves it kind of tacky.</li>
            <li>It makes for a smooth and comfortable shave and the smell is wonderful with a very mild citrus influence.  </li>
            <li>- Price, High Quality product, Smells great, feels good during and after shave&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>The one I&#x27;ve found works best for me is Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sticking to Taylor of Old Bond Street as it works perfect and they have variety.</li>
            <li>This is the best shave cream I used thus far</li>
            <li>It seems to be in the range with the good quality vegan (tallow/animal free) products out there.</li>
            <li>It also does not stick around post-shave though so you will be able to fully use your own lotion/aftershave/cologne to go out smelling the way</li>
            <li>So far, Cremo has been the best I have found for this purpose.  </li>
            <li>I liked it better than king of shaves.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found to be the most effective way to use it</li>
            <li>I use a double-bladed safety razor so having a good shaving cream is important to me.  </li>
            <li>This is far and away the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>This product is especially great for those with sensitive skin and acne (in my opinion) as I have both.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The most important thing about successful use of this product is to read the directions.</li>
            <li>On the head it does good - pretty good.</li>
            <li>The shave is noticeably more pleasant than I&#x27;m used to with cheap foams.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good for getting a close shave and for that reason I highly reccommend it over anything else you can get at a store.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m half-way through the tube, I am glad to have found it here because it is by far the best shaving product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I still enjoy using mug soap and a good brush, but this is outstanding for the smoothest shave.</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves my face smooth and cut free.</li>
            <li>Very nice to purchase an order that is made for my skin type at such a great price.</li>
            <li>I was able to work up a good lather with my brush,enough for 3 passes,no pulling from the Astra blades, smells good and the shave is absolutely unbelivable.</li>
            <li>this stuff is pretty great for me.  </li>
            <li>All the good things you have read about this product is true, and I will add one thing in addition to the close shave, ease of use, lack of cuts, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried the full tube of Cremo Cream I ordered to give it a fair trial and ended up regretting it.  </li>
            <li>My face was very smooth.</li>
            <li>Very light or non scented and a very smooth cream shave that is non drying.</li>
            <li>but it does still leave a light and pleasant smell that can be easily overpowered by your favorite cologne or aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>A smooth shave, a pleasant feeling afterward, a light scent</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cremo Shave Cream has a light, pleasant scent, and goes on so, so smooth.</li>
            <li>I always believed that the type of razor mattered most, and thus I always gravitated toward</li>
            <li>the latest and greatest Gillette had to offer, finally settling on their Fusion 5 blade razor.</li>
            <li>Hope you guys have better results.  </li>
            <li>I would gotten a better shave with Barbasol or Edge gel.</li>
            <li>Stop the presses; This is better than advertised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an interesting product, probably more appropriate for a barbershop than for home use.</li>
            <li>I have never had such a great shaving results!</li>
            <li>Tried many shaving creams.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>but I feel the need to invest more in my scalp.</li>
            <li>Expect more like what you&#x27;d  experience with a skin conditioning cream or hand</li>
            <li>This stuff is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Great price, fast delivery</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love the scent as well.</li>
            <li>Like the bottle says -- it works astonishingly well.  </li>
            <li>and it gives a nice smooth feel once you are finished.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the smoothest my legs have ever felt and the smell is sort of a light orange, its really nice.</li>
            <li>I like that it isn&#x27;t foamy like most of the canned shaving creams.  </li>
            <li>Okay, I tried it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is okay for my face, but I&#x27;d be hesitant to use it on my head.</li>
            <li>And I also love the scent.</li>
            <li>So I can see how the shower moisture/heat would help it work better in that environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(and organic, if possible) products the best.    </li>
            <li>So I can see how the shower moisture/heat would help it work better in that environment.    </li>
            <li>Carver&#x27;s Shave Butter\\&quot; more.    </li>
            <li>The results were astonishing.</li>
            <li>I went to Amazon to read reviews and saw that many people drew comparisons with Proraso</li>
            <li>/&gt;So which is better?</li>
            <li>For most people it shouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I love this shaving &amp;#34;cream!&amp;#34; Follow the directions and you will get the closest shave ever.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t invest in anything more than a sample pack of blades and a Feather Safety Razor.</li>
            <li>was more irritated on the creamo side.</li>
            <li>Works better .</li>
            <li>Better than any canned product</li>
            <li>My blade glides even better then the luxury  cream.  </li>
            <li>Got this on sale at Walmart and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Have tried many premium blends and brands costing 3-4 times as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently switched from Gillette blades to the Dollar Shave Club&#x27;s program with their &amp;#34;Executive&amp;#34; blades, and am very happy with the quality of shave that I&#x27;m getting.  </li>
            <li>and was satisfied with the shaving results and price paid to buy this,</li>
            <li>This is quite simply the BEST shave cream I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>A superior product worth three times the price.</li>
            <li>This product gives you the best shave possible with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>I use it with the Panasonic ES8243A Men&#x27;s 4-Blade Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver and have never had a better closer shave.</li>
            <li>, I get better results from a $2.00 can of Edge gel.  </li>
            <li>My husband and sons absolutely love Cremo.  </li>
            <li>More than once.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not getting any better.</li>
            <li>but this could have a more pleasing scent for others (this brand has a citrus/sweet smell</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different ways to shave my bear-like beard, and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need an aftershave or moisturizer (tried more than 15 of those too).</li>
            <li>All this despite spending lots of time and money on supposedly better tools and products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite brushless cream.</li>
            <li>For whatever reason, the Kale Naturals had no reviews but it is a wonderfully smelling, all natural ingredients, smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li>The fusion stuff was okay for me.</li>
            <li>I loved the cooling sensation but it wasn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>somebody said they felt it was more aggressive than the EJ).  </li>
            <li>Until i find somethign better</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m going to make sure i have some of this around (or will always have some of this around anyway for those days</li>
            <li>Also because it doesn&#x27;t lather a lot, you have to use more than is indicated, and I would say I got about 30days from a tube max, nothing close to the 90 it claims.</li>
            <li>but now that I get the cream activated in my hands, then rub into my beard, it works fantastic!</li>
            <li>that much more</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many types of shave foams/creams/gels/oils over the years to control the irritation and still get a close shave.</li>
            <li>You do have to make sure to keep the product moist during the shave to maximize</li>
            <li>Better than aerosol shave products.</li>
            <li>I like soap and brush better.</li>
            <li>simply the best shaving cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I think most five star reviews are from people abandoning the rattle can shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Without a doubt Cremo is better than that Gillette garbage.</li>
            <li>Currently my favorite is D.R. Harris shaving soap, I love the Marlborough scent, it can be purchased in a wood container.</li>
            <li>Works better than all those foamy things</li>
            <li>Cremo has it; so did Murad and Prorasso but, again, Murad is exponentially greater in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works better than you will believe.</li>
            <li>BTW - if you want to try something better, go to West Coast Shaving, click on creams and soaps and almost every product will be better than this one.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>You will love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The more water you water the creamer</li>
            <li>Best shaving cream on market especially for body shaving.</li>
            <li>And while it&#x27;s perfectly safe to leave on your face after shaving (it will condition your skin, according to the company)</li>
            <li>Some reviewers mention products that work better for them</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s different, luxurious and provides you with the best shave out there</li>
            <li>words on the front of the tube says it better than any reviewer could...</li>
            <li>and this is so much better.</li>
            <li>so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>more effectively)&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I found this stuff, works better than any can shave cream or gel.</li>
            <li>Just adding more soap did not seep to work</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Try and just Love it....</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s an ok product.</li>
            <li>I use this shaving cream on my legs, no cuts or razor burn, I love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>Cremo, in contrast, has more of a soapy, even lotion-like texture.</li>
            <li>Works a lot better than any of the many Gillette products I have used over the years.  </li>
            <li>It was here that I found this stuff in one of the boxes and am always on the look out for a better product.</li>
            <li>Phenomenal product.</li>
            <li>Spend your money on a better product.</li>
            <li>You have to wonder what&#x27;s going on when hundreds of people love a product a handful</li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>I had to wash both after applying Cremo in order to be able to hold on to the razor.  </li>
            <li>I might have been better off just shaving with water.</li>
            <li>Better than most</li>
            <li>Just make sure to follow directions.</li>
            <li>Too many ingredients including many I cannot even pronounce.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>When you really work this cream into your skin, you are not just prepping for a close shave, but you are also massaging the moisturizers into your skin, and this WILL greatly reduce irritation.</li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>What I love about this is that it really forces you to massage your beard before shaving setting up a great shave.  </li>
            <li>It was the smoothest, most close and pain free shave ever!</li>
            <li>I ordered the men&#x27;s original, and I love the scent!</li>
            <li>I love that it is in an all plastic bottle, so no rust in the shower.</li>
            <li>maybe it works better for some people</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve read the directions closely and for me it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>still more product to go (shave 3 times a week)</li>
            <li>Not as Astonishing as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It was just ok.</li>
            <li>Decided to give it a try and love it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been impressed by this shave cream for the following  reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>Cremo is a noticably better lubricant for shaving.</li>
            <li>I have been using Remington&#x27;s Shave Gel and the King of Shave&#x27;s equivalent for many years now.</li>
            <li>The best shave I&#x27;ve possibly ever had.</li>
            <li>This product is okay.  </li>
            <li>(OKAY even that is not breaking the bank).</li>
            <li>I will admit - results were better using more than an &amp;#34;almond&amp;#34; size.</li>
            <li>costing 9 times more than economy grade)</li>
            <li>As I take very short showers now a days, this is the best shave crÃ¨me on the market.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sold in many places which is convenient and everywhere</li>
            <li>I do wish it was more moisturizing</li>
            <li>I also get MUCH more mileage out of one container than they advertise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t my favorite cream.</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it, this stuff is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>Outstanding quickness in shipping and product packing.</li>
            <li>and I think I just found my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>This product works, but there are many better options.</li>
            <li>My Face is so much better.</li>
            <li>Give Cremo a try for a more comfortable, closer shave!</li>
            <li>and I should get many months out of this tube.</li>
            <li>altjhough not drying I need something a bit more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It is slippery, and not clunky at all, allowing for the best shave possible.</li>
            <li>Teflon for shaving - pretty amazing!</li>
            <li>Been shaving 35 yrs never had a better experience shaving while using Creamo.</li>
            <li>Read the top review - that&#x27;s basically what I&#x27;d like to say.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to deal with an aerosol</li>
            <li>I think it results on more cream on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried many; all have shortcomings.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but EOS works better .</li>
            <li>The more water you add during the shave the better.  </li>
            <li>The citrus/bergamot smell is awesome, the lather (when used as directed) is terrific, and the shave is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried MANY shave</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest, face shaving isn&#x27;t very fun.</li>
            <li>Once the quantity is right, the shave is amazingly good.</li>
            <li>Very nice product; lives up to its claims of &amp;#34;use very little&amp;#34; and lots of glide.</li>
            <li>The C.O Bigelow had a rich (but not foamy) lather that covered nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good results with Headblade Headslick Mentholated Shave Cream (the best one I had previously tried), Proraso (not as smooth as headblade; smells a bit too strong), AHAVA shaving gel (nice smell,pricey, smooth but gunks up the blade).  </li>
            <li>The most surprising thing for me was that shaving with a gillette blade was a very smooth affair, it really glides through the bristle.</li>
            <li>good product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Hotter water to the face prior to application makes shaving easier and makes this product work best (and it is worth noting that water that is hotter works better than water that is just warm).</li>
            <li>It seems to leave no residue, is easy to squeeze just the right amount and has a more than fair price.  </li>
            <li>Dispensing is also very clean as the cream comes out in a toothpaste consistency.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is great - not thick at all but not watery either.</li>
            <li>The price is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I also cut my chin pretty good, and I haven&#x27;t cut myself shaving in years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s that I get from Target for over a year and its pretty good but too pricey.</li>
            <li>Sure the guys who buy Barbasol and are now getting the free tube with the rebate love it, because they&#x27;ve tried nothing else, and it is better than aerosol shave cream.  </li>
            <li>On the first use of Cremo, I loved everything about the stuff: the smell, the close shave, the compactness of the tube</li>
            <li>was certainly cheap, smelled ok, but did not give me a close or very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>but since I shave while showering, this is fine because this gave me a very smooth close shave without irritated skin or cut skin.  </li>
            <li>shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This started a new search that has ended happily with the Cremo Shave Cream.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, perfect for sensitive skin, washes off actually cleanly.</li>
            <li>I still say it is the best shave gel and the only thing I would use if Cremo weren&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li>Smooth and provides for the best possible shave.</li>
            <li>Closest, most comfortable, and most effortless</li>
            <li>This stuff is great...lasts a long-time, and gives a nice, smooth rash free shave.  </li>
            <li>Good product, good price, VERY FAST and reasonable shipping.</li>
            <li>this is my husband&#x27;s new favorite!!</li>
            <li>I guess sometimes high tech just doesn&#x27;t cut it when it comes to things that have been successfully done another way for 100+ years.</li>
            <li>The answer is Cremo for one very good and very specific reason.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, if you like this stuff, your local WallWorld carries it for $5.97 which is a very good deal considering</li>
            <li>In the search for the perfect shave I have spent north of $25 for 6 oz.</li>
            <li>I have recently started using a DE Safety razor and been very pleased with the superior shave.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who has sensitive skin or someone who is looking for a close and great shave.  </li>
            <li>This is the best shave cream I ever used in over 60 years of wet shaving.</li>
            <li>I use Cremo with Dorco Pace 6+1 razors, but I get good performance without chafing even when I use a cheap Gillette Good News or drug store generic disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to get this shave cream at Wal-Mart in this area, so I decided too shave with it this morning, the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li>The aerosol creams are just a stopgap if nothing better is available.  </li>
            <li>Even so, Cremo gives me the closest most comfortable shave ever...period.</li>
            <li>My husband has sensitive skin and this shave cream works great for him.</li>
            <li>Cremo is a good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Rinsing off the cream was very easy and fast, and my skin felt very smooth to the touch and refreshing.</li>
            <li>No irritation at all after shaving, even in those places that are easy to irritate&lt;br /&gt;7 - Works great for those with acne issues, doesn&#x27;t burn when you use in on irritated sensitive</li>
            <li>Out of other cream i find this being the best as i like the smell, the consistence of the cream and the feeling once you are shaved.</li>
            <li>The directions may work for you like the other reviewers, but in my experience, it works best with a brush.  </li>
            <li>This cream smells much better and has a more user-friendly consistently, but I don&#x27;t think it is better than King of Shaves in terms of skin protection.  </li>
            <li>If you have ever enjoyed drinking these teas, then you are familiar with the smell of Cremo Cream.</li>
            <li>Outstanding shave and worth every penny!</li>
            <li>The full title of this product is spot on!</li>
            <li>This rinses easily, so</li>
            <li>but it tends to wear off  easy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an easy switch, and I&#x27;ve grown to prefer it</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t shave your head you can easily adapt it to your needs.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not all that easy to find and costs a fortune.</li>
            <li>It glides on so easy</li>
            <li>Easily the nicest shaving cream that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both love this product and started a subscribe and save subscription we liked the quality and price so much.</li>
            <li>The Cremo scent is of the citrus variety and washes away easily.</li>
            <li>EASILY</li>
            <li>â™¦ Easily applied with a brush.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slippery and cleans up easily.  </li>
            <li>It does just what it&#x27;s supposed to: deliver a smooth, safe, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, I reach for the cremo when I want an easy brushless shave.</li>
            <li>I have skin that easily becomes irritated from shaving and this Cremo dramatically reduces irritation.</li>
            <li>Of course, good razor etiquette is still important, but this stuff makes it that much easier to shave.</li>
            <li>The razor glides very quickly.</li>
            <li>Awesome product - you only use about an almond&#x27;s worth of product, and it doesn&#x27;t bubble a lot.</li>
            <li>have a strong scent</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is nice and when paired with my personna razor blades, my DE razor performed very, very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I now know that creams and razors matter and only wish that I had considered these great products years earlier.very smooth to the touch and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I added warm water and shaved those areas I missed the first time again.</li>
            <li>My first reaction was shock, honest to goodness.</li>
            <li>I used a new cartridge for my razor to insure the best performance from this new setup</li>
            <li>After 27 years of trying literally everything in the book, hands down this is the best.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best shaving cream that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>They say that it makes shaving so easy and pleasant and leaves their skin soft.  </li>
            <li>great product, using water as hot as you can take it before application really makes the product shine.</li>
            <li>I apply my dime sized amount with a brush and find that it lathers just fine for me.  </li>
            <li>There is no comparison between it and the soapy fresh smell of Cremo which is also pretty damn good</li>
            <li>this has a slight citrusy scent and it wont be the best one out there.  </li>
            <li>The Cremo would work fine as an every-day shave cream  for me.</li>
            <li>but doesn&#x27;t shave as close or smoothly as a fine lather.</li>
            <li>If you are a cartridge shaver, I suppose this is fine, although you could also use whatever soap or body wash and get away with it just fine.  </li>
            <li>I heard about this fine product on the Dr. Savage radio program.</li>
            <li>For the best shave possible that works for me is hot water, Creamo Cream and</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work well with a brush (neither badger fine nor synthetic), but it&#x27;s okay for a quick shave every now and then.</li>
            <li>Cremo does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>use a brush to apply shaving soap and find CREMO to work just fine:  </li>
            <li>I have tested many other shave creams, most more expensive, and think this one of the best, perhaps the best.</li>
            <li>This product works best after the foam is washed away a little, but with Dr. Carver&#x27;s, the cream starts out that way.</li>
            <li>(Very happy with the Perfecto Pure Badger Shaving Brush that currently costs about $12.)  </li>
            <li>after a good shave, my skin felt as smooth and as soft as ever before.</li>
            <li>The Cremo Cream lathered nicely on my skin, almost invisible but not so much that I couldn&#x27;t tell it was on.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It is really comfortable with no burn or nicks.  </li>
            <li>My goodness it is 4 hrs since I shaved and my face is silky smooth.</li>
            <li>This one is as smooth as it gets.</li>
            <li>I used Aveeno Positively Smooth Shave Gel exclusively for years.</li>
            <li>The package claims that it creates a light lather.</li>
            <li>Does not gum up the drains and makes for easy clean up when shave is finished.  </li>
            <li>I do Like the light scent</li>
            <li>Oh so smooth.</li>
            <li>Smooth and no razor burn.</li>
            <li>I could not also believe that it was actually the closest shave I ever experienced (</li>
            <li>Enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>I have to optimize all the variables in my shave to get a comfortable BBS shave.</li>
            <li>although not quite up to the level I get with the majority of tallow based soap/cream products available.</li>
            <li>It will reduce or illuminate nicks and cuts and the razor glides smoothly on the skin.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic .</li>
            <li>Makes shaving a lot easier and it keeps the shaved area smooth.</li>
            <li>Comes in handy if I&#x27;m in a real hurry.</li>
            <li>To say Cremo Cream gives you a smooth shave is an understatement.</li>
            <li>Every morning was filled with in-grown hairs, nicks and lots of irritation.</li>
            <li>Not the best for heavy beards.</li>
            <li>(so it&#x27;s locally available) and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Close comfortable shaves are now the norm.</li>
            <li>The difference primarily comes in the creams themselves.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;It&#x27;s so smooth and hydrating.</li>
            <li>This is also available at CVS pharmacy in you run</li>
            <li>Thank goodness it was free.  </li>
            <li>Smooth shave with one stroke.</li>
            <li>It smells great, plus I can shave both my legs with only a quarter-sized amount and a glass of water to rinse.</li>
            <li>The light level of lather allows my razor to cover a lot of area before I have to rinse it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than shaving cream or soap, soothes my face for a nice smooth shave, leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it was more manly or fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>smooth results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if that wasn&#x27;t available or if they changed the formula, I would switch to this product.</li>
            <li>Smooth as a baby&#x27;s backside without razor burn or irritation.</li>
            <li>followed the IMPORTANT directions, no lather.</li>
            <li>I shave my entire head and cremo is great for it.</li>
            <li>I had used Cremeo a few times when the idea came to me, and I blended the very best of both worlds.  </li>
            <li>A close comfortable shave, and convenience.  </li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t grow much facial hair, and to some it may appear as none at all, this stuff still works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great addition to your daily routine!</li>
            <li>Smoooooooth shave, smells great, and I only have to go over my skin one time.</li>
            <li>It is astonishingly smooth.</li>
            <li>The cheap 99 cent conditioner works just as well as Cremo does for my beard.  </li>
            <li>It gives you a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>the cheap Wal-Mart purchased creams.</li>
            <li>I was immediately hooked on the smooth shave I got.  </li>
            <li>Use it daily, great shave product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s readily available.</li>
            <li>Considering how cheap this stuff is, you&#x27;ll be amazed how well it works.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Both are great and work equally well with my Gillette Fusion razor.</li>
            <li>The cream has a light, citrusy scent.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaving cream because it was cheap.</li>
            <li>and I get a fantastic shave.  </li>
            <li>Smooth as can be-blade or electric razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was BLOWN away at how smooth my face was during and after shaving.</li>
            <li>But it makes the razor glide smoothly</li>
            <li>Shaving too is not as smooth as I&#x27;d like, I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li>I was surprised on how good this was.</li>
            <li>The results so far have been good.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and bought this based on the &amp;#34;Astonishingly&amp;#34; high claims and very good reviews.</li>
            <li>so far so good works</li>
            <li>I liked the eucalyptus scent, though it was not as nice if you happened to get it in your mouth, and it left a tingly sensation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: If you want to pay five dollars more, Harry&#x27;s Foaming Shave Gel is better than both and is pressurized making it much easier to work with.  </li>
            <li>Because you rub the cream directly on the beard, it provides for a superior glide.</li>
            <li>yes i followed directions, this is probably good for a man with soft baby hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I don&#x27;t shave daily, I can say that my first tube has lasted me probably around five months now, and is still going strong, which is incredible.</li>
            <li>The squeeze tube that Cremo comes in is very easy to keep clean and it does not ooze out after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are interested, I used this cream with a Gillette Fusion 5 blade</li>
            <li>The squeeze tube that Cremo comes in is very easy to keep clean and it does not ooze out after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are interested, I used this cream with a Gillette Fusion 5 blade</li>
            <li>/&gt;I ended up trying The Art of Shaving Shave Cream (good lubricated shave, smells good, but comes in a ridiculously small tube 2.5 oz for a hefty price of $16) and settled on Kale Naturals Smooth Shave Cream.</li>
            <li>It does not seem like an adequate layer of soap if you are used to a shaving lather, but this cream is such an excellent lubricant that it works far better than lather.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s kind of fun to put on.</li>
            <li>This one had high reviews, so I figured &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34; I am thrilled I gave it a chance as it is literally everything they advertise.</li>
            <li>I apply Cremo twice per shave,  the first time so that I can shave with the grain, then I apply it once more and shave against the grain.</li>
            <li>Reduced cuts and bumps significantly.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t believe I am actually excited about a shaving cream.</li>
            <li>The cream doesn&#x27;t foam up and instead stays in its original form.</li>
            <li>definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li>Pretty sure this will be my cream.  </li>
            <li>The Cremo too had a nice lather and a pleasant, more subtle scent.</li>
            <li>Then I splash on more hot water and work up a bit of lather.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a unique scent that takes some getting used to, but even at that it&#x27;s not overpowering or offensive in my view, and</li>
            <li>I did this because in part my original review was based on the fact that I repeatedly tried to contact Cremo and was never replied to.  </li>
            <li>I thought I needed to use more, but it was actually more than enough - extremely smooth shave and no irritation after 3 weeks or so of use!</li>
            <li>totally worth the price!</li>
            <li>Product works exactly as promised (probably even better)</li>
            <li>Creamo is unique.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling great all day long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Crucially, the smell is the right mix of pleasant and masculine.</li>
            <li>Takes a little getting used to, but has a nice orange smell and does a good job.</li>
            <li>has a clean scent</li>
            <li>I  shave q 3 days because this stuff allows that goodovva clean shave.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes shaving so easy and fun.</li>
            <li>I gave this a 5 star rating earlier, but I wanted to test it with a cheap disposable razor, instead of my good razor.</li>
            <li>Super comfortable shaves.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a quick Baby Butt Smooth shave without all the hassle of soaking a brush and building a mug soap</li>
            <li>I found the citrusy scent to be pleasant enough</li>
            <li>so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it takes surprisingly little to achieve very good results since the shaving cream is so concentrated.</li>
            <li>Scent I would describe as a slightly sweet grapefruit or &amp;#34;grapefruit n cream&amp;#34; which was pleasant enough.</li>
            <li>Based on their profiles and promotional information, they seem to think they&#x27;re special to have started a business.  </li>
            <li>For my face it did nothing special.</li>
            <li>It lubricates my skin exceptionally well and permits my razor to glide smoothly allowing an extra close shave.</li>
            <li>It is certainly better than the high dollar soaps that require a brush and is much better than the higher end</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin or just want a very pleasant shaving experience look no further.</li>
            <li>This cream works great and lasts a lot longer than expected.</li>
            <li>I use a standard Gillette razor and wanted a shave cream that smelled as good, gave as close, smooth shave, and was reasonably economical.</li>
            <li>husband is pretty basic when it comes to grooming products but he has had no qualms about switching to this great product.</li>
            <li>I apply if with a brush, on my wet face and its great.</li>
            <li>I have tried a great many shave cream / soap / gels over the past 40+</li>
            <li>One more thing I really appreciate about this is the tube it comes in.</li>
            <li>One more thing I really appreciate about this is the tube it comes in.</li>
            <li>I do think I have found the creme that I am going to combine with KMF Cool Mint just for a change-up.</li>
            <li>My razor blades last longer too because this stuff softens my gruff beard that good.</li>
            <li>Besides, Cremo had a rebate to cover the full purchase price so why not try it.</li>
            <li>In the beginning I just used this product because it had a full refund rebate.</li>
            <li>But, in fact, this is an insanely good product that actually delivers.</li>
            <li>have to admit that I felt all three provided a nice smooth shave, I can&#x27;t say that I noticed anything different about the end result of my shave in terms of closeness or smooth skin.</li>
            <li>This product is so good that I will NEVER go back to shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Good old cheapo Williams is a far better product.  </li>
            <li>He no longer has razor burn or razor bumps, and is definitely enjoying the straight razor experience.</li>
            <li>Try it now and you really will love it.</li>
            <li>His face looks so good that the fellas at work have even asked what he is doing differently</li>
            <li>I really thought it would end up in the trash with most of the ones making these claims.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s the only good thing I can say.</li>
            <li>It was watery and runny, and yet full of bubbles.  </li>
            <li>Give me the tried and true shave cream for $1.99 that works.</li>
            <li>It really does lubricate and protect (from razor burn) skin much better than even premium canned gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before using a brush I enjoyed shaving in the shower to expedite my morning routine, and since moving to a real shave I missed the convenience.  </li>
            <li>believe that anyone who is not getting a superior result with Creamo must not be following the directions correctly.  </li>
            <li>I rated it &#x27;OK&#x27; though because really, have you ever run out of shaving cream and used some conditioner instead?  </li>
            <li>absolute garbage a bar of soap would do better.</li>
            <li>a good while as I use about the same amount of product as you&#x27;d put on a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Not bad at all; but, not &amp;#34;Astonishingly&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>â™¦ No bad nor lingering smell.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Since the tube said that &amp;#34;most can comfortably shave against the grain&amp;#34;, I tried it that way right out of the gate.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as Edge or the Gels - pretty economical and smells good - does not protect very well and not very slippery.</li>
            <li>Comes in a plastic container with no metal parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Best yet - Gentleman&#x27;s Hangar Genuine Old School Natural Shaving Cream for Sensitive Skin sold here.</li>
            <li>this product does not irritate my sensitive skin, that says a whole lot about how good this Cremo really is, and I feel that indicates for most people this product will prevent irritation.</li>
            <li>this product does not irritate my sensitive skin, that says a whole lot about how good this Cremo really is, and I feel that indicates for most people this product will prevent irritation.</li>
            <li>also shaved my boyfriend&#x27;s face for him the other day, of course using Cremo, and although his facial hair was slightly longer than is best for shaving, it went great and his skin was very smooth</li>
            <li>Seriously, this stuff is the best.  </li>
            <li>To me this is a top soap for travel, I&#x27;m more of a traditional way shave guy and prefer to use a brush and lather up soap.</li>
            <li>The grit disappears quickly too.</li>
            <li>Because the cream and grit disappear quickly, you&#x27;ll need to switch your mindset from knowing where to shave by where there&#x27;s still foam to knowing where to shave by where there&#x27;s still stubble.</li>
            <li>The result is a burn and knick free shave that allows you to reactivate selected areas by simply rubbing again with a bit of warm water.  </li>
            <li>They claim to just being super slippery -- but it seemed like it must have softened my whiskers.  </li>
            <li>But when reactivated with water, it is super slippery</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, like most people, when it says it is the best shave cream you will ever buy, and at $6-$7 a bottle, you would hope so.</li>
            <li>I quickly began dreading shaving often while using that stuff as I would often cut myself despite using a 5 blade razor.  </li>
            <li>I was able to overlap the same spot more than once without complaining as I did before.  </li>
            <li>It allows me to get an even closer shave, not to mention it&#x27;s cheaper and more available in brick and mortar stores near me.</li>
            <li>had the smoothest/best shave yet with this crÃ¨me while in the shower - and tha&#x27;ts with super torn up/sensitive/healing skin happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i need to quickly shave but still want to be safe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let me recap that really quick in the paragraph below...</li>
            <li>Vendor was quick on the shipping..</li>
            <li>I was coming from Shave Secret, which gives a really good shave, and is superior to this product (except in scent, Cremo blows it away.)</li>
            <li>When my old favorite Gel Gillette was no longer made, I had to start a search for shave cream / gel that would be comfortable for shaving my head in the shower.  </li>
            <li>After a quick check of reviews on amazon</li>
            <li>I would be on my third can of Nivea Shave Gel by now, so even though Cremo costs more per unit, its cheaper to use than my favorite drugstore brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been upgrading my shave kit with a better razor and better cream and aftershave, and this has become an essential part of my shaving routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much better than traditional style shaving cream and better than shaving soap; works well in the shower too.  </li>
            <li>I shave against the grain and always get a super shave.</li>
            <li>Will Not Get super foam ...&lt;</li>
            <li>Luckily for me, when I ran out of that stuff, the store I was at did not stock it, so I turned to the men&#x27;s shaving aisle and found Cremo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I can get a quick quality shave with a DE safety razor without any skin irritation.</li>
            <li>Gave me a very close, smooth, comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no foam to speak of, and that takes some getting used to, but the results are extraordinary.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many shave creams and soaps ranging from high end stuff like Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat and Tabac to Godrej, Palmolive and Proraso.</li>
            <li>Not sure if this is just the nature of a cream vs a soap, but in my experience, this wasn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li>He says it feels amazing on sensitive skin and really promotes a smooth (and painfree) shave.</li>
            <li>Let me start by admitting that I have not tried very many different shaving creams in my lifetime.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for other brands,not nearly as effective as this.</li>
            <li>First the results are fantastic if you are coming from a \\&quot;can\\&quot; of shave creme.</li>
            <li>I fill the sink with very hot water</li>
            <li>It really is better than the normal canned shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I tried this the first time because I had a coupon for a free tube.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I cut myself more using this stuff than any other product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like Earl Grey tea to me, it just smells like a bright, citrusy smell.</li>
            <li>hundreds of glowing reviews here show that this is a very consistent product.</li>
            <li>hundreds of glowing reviews here show that this is a very consistent product.</li>
            <li>In case nobody has noticed, the first tube is free with a mail-in rebate (up to $8.00, not including sales tax), but well-worth the price.  </li>
            <li>but it lasts perhaps 1/5th as long and isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>Really good sharing cream; lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>So far I am pleased with this as it seems like good stuff, especially if you follow the directions for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>â™¦ Easy to use, comes in a large tube.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Scents and foam and lather are great, but in the end it comes down to how a shaving crÃ¨me/soap COMES OFF your face, not how it goes</li>
            <li>Such a nice lather and clean rinse</li>
            <li>I do recommend adding a good amount of water, because once the cream is added to your head it does dry quickly.</li>
            <li>The price point on Cremo was much more attractive than the soaps and only a few dollars more than the gels I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>forget the trendy overhyped scents that are overwhelmingly strong that mask rather than smell genuinely clean, if you want something that does a good job and is not that expensive</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised--great skin protection when shaving, use only an &amp;#34;almond&amp;#34; size portion, lather it in, and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li>Soaping up your face and shaving is better then the old foams!</li>
            <li>I use both straight razors and double edged (&amp;#34;safety&amp;#34;) razors and this cream works great with both.</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;cream\\&quot; instead of a foam soap makes so much more sense for sensitive skin!   </li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing product - a whole new shave.</li>
            <li>going back to every man jack products as they were super effective and cheaper than this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love whipping up a nice thick lather with a hot brush, and then working the lather into my beard before executing a perfectly smooth comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>You have to use so little that it seems it lasts forever too which makes it a great value.</li>
            <li>Works great with little water which is what everyone here in California needs.</li>
            <li>Cremos notable trait is it does seem to lather up easily and to a fairly large amount in comparison to many other brands.</li>
            <li>This product works very well to facilitate a close, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a bizarre product, because you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>The cream gave a real close smooth shave.</li>
            <li>used it with DE shavers and Straight Edge, and with both i didnt get nicked and i got a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t get much else better to lubricate shaving and leaving your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>If you just slap it on without water you are missing a great shave.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, been using it for a few years now.  </li>
            <li>This shave cream is a nice alternative to the regular canned shave creams.  </li>
            <li>rarely bleed when using this</li>
            <li>I rarely use a lotion afterwards</li>
            <li>know the Shave Butter has a slightly (natural) citrusy smell, but I think it works/feels better for me.</li>
            <li>I know the Shave Butter has a slightly (natural) citrusy smell, but I think it works/feels better for me.</li>
            <li>Once you find what amount works for you, it&#x27;s worth using when you&#x27;re in a rush.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the difference when you use this product vs the regular aerosol kind.</li>
            <li>I aslo noticed that they offered a full rebate on your first bottle.  </li>
            <li>I rarely write a review but thought this product warranted one.</li>
            <li>Oh well, it was worth a try, but again, I will not buy.</li>
            <li>Not only did I not cut myself, but I was actually able to enjoy shaving without any irritation or pain.</li>
            <li>So far, it has done better than all the soaps</li>
            <li>Topping it off, I can get a good, close shave with zero blade drag and zero irritation.</li>
            <li>While I like my Shave Secret oil, I am quite impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for years now and nothing beats good ol&#x27; Proraso or Speick shaving cream in a metal tube.</li>
            <li>but we&#x27;ll worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>While shaving my head, it requires application of a considerable amount more than your face.</li>
            <li>, MOST COMFORTABLE LONGEST LASTING SHAVE&lt;br /&gt;LEAVES</li>
            <li>the month that he&#x27;s been using the cream, not only is he nick and burn free, his shaves are closer and his complexion more even.</li>
            <li>I have tried a number of shaving creams and lotions and this one is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>This is well worth a try.</li>
            <li>I swipe the brush under warm water and reapply for a second pass.</li>
            <li>Between my double-blade razor and this stuff, I&#x27;ll probably spend 10% of what I did just three years ago, and am getting a far better shave to</li>
            <li>so I went back to the basics, a nice quality</li>
            <li>To start, let the warm shower moisten your brush for a minute, just enough to get it saturated with water.  </li>
            <li>Came to Amazon to read the reviews, laugh at the 2 star rating and move on with my life...</li>
            <li>you will be golden.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I have a personal preference for Neutrogena Shave Cream for men</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>â€¦ itâ€™s definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>â€¦ itâ€™s definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s like a tradeoff between closeness (this stuff wins) and risk factor.</li>
            <li>I am a 23 year old woman, and I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t nicked myself once since using this, and the tiny dot I use for each armpit has effectively eliminated razor burn in that area as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It smells refreshing yet still masculine.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price and the tube is easier to transport than those shave cream dispenser bottles.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh citrus scent which I like but some may not.  </li>
            <li>well worth the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is useful as a quick, good shaving cream when theres not time to sit and do the whole process for a true lather up wet shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with Cremo now for a couple months and it is, hands down, the best I&#x27;ve ever used, better even than Trader Joe&#x27;s Cream Shave, which had previously topped my list.</li>
            <li>Thick and rich, by far the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I had a week&#x27;s worth of beard and this allowed the razor to slide right through it.</li>
            <li>It works exactly 0% better than most any other product you might use.</li>
            <li>Cremo is a white shave cream that has a slight pleasant scent that I can quite identify but it smells nice and isnâ€™t overpowering and fades after a bit.  </li>
            <li>Coming in a large 8oz tube that lasts a long time, a \\&quot;luxury\\&quot; shave cream for $24 is actually a good deal.</li>
            <li>Look to other products for a superior shave.</li>
            <li>; so I know I did it right.</li>
            <li>They are right-</li>
            <li>Right now, I am using the Cremo Cream.</li>
            <li>WEll they were right and</li>
            <li>A good shaving cream that remains slick and provides a relatively smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>It has a subtle, very nice light citrus/orange fragrance.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no fluffy residue to clog up the razor and it rinses clean!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than Proraso and even my previous favorite, Harry&#x27;s shave cream and comes in at an attractive price point, although more expensive than some cheaper brands, but well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that the cream is very dense, but that does not in fact lead to a closer shave.</li>
            <li>While skin is unique in a sense that not all products may work equally-well for different people, these reviews show that Cremo gives outstanding results on many different skin types and sensitivities.</li>
            <li>While skin is unique in a sense that not all products may work equally-well for different people, these reviews show that Cremo gives outstanding results on many different skin types and sensitivities.</li>
            <li>I tried some on top of &amp;#34;shave secret&amp;#34; oil and it was even a little better still, but still not going to buy again.</li>
            <li>Once applied to your face you can add a little more water and rub to create yet more lather.  </li>
            <li>That means use it right out of a hot shower, or else</li>
            <li>I now know that creams and razors matter and only wish that I had considered these great products years earlier.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to find something that would provide him with a good product to use on his teenage sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but I feel the Cremo advantage is that the cream more easily washes off the razor slots (I use Gillette Sensitive cartridges and use the vibration feature), leaving the razor clean and ready for the next shaving pass.  </li>
            <li>Having used Kiehl&#x27;s shaving products for years I have to say that this gives a shave that is every bit as good for a heck of a lot less money.</li>
            <li>It has a unusual consistency, but it gives a really close shave and leaves your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>It dries out super fast.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised the difference it made in getting a close comfortable shave and the way my skin felt afterwards.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t require much in order for me to make a 3 pass shave and that it keeps your skin nice and slick when more water is applied.</li>
            <li>I mean it this is seriously better than Art of Shaving the women shave cream is also amazing for ladies legs</li>
            <li>The first time I tried shaving with this new cream, with my Gillette Proglide Power razor, I was amazed at the smooth, nick-free, close shave I got.</li>
            <li>On my first attempt, I used an ASTRA super stainless blade.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Looks like 1940&#x27;s packaging, but it&#x27;s a very modern preparation.  </li>
            <li>I fill the sink with hot water prior to a shower, put the whole tube in to let it heat up, and have a nice hot shave after the shower, dipping the razor in the water between strokes.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>This is, by far, one the greatest shaving creams I have found - I use it daily and it doesn&#x27;t leave any scents or dry skin.  </li>
            <li>then aftershave works just fine to cover that up as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smell is a little chemically, but it works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>Cremo is a decent cream that is much better than the glob of foam or gel from an aerosol can, but it does not stand up to soaps like Proraso, Woolfat or Taylor of Old Bond.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions to a tee, choosing the hot water with a cloth option since I do not like to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>WHAT TO EXPECT ON FIRST USE&lt;br</li>
            <li>WHAT TO EXPECT ON FIRST USE&lt;br /&gt;See</li>
            <li>This actually took me the most to get used to.</li>
            <li>Keep skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>One advantage is you can see where you are shaving much better than with traditional shaving creams.</li>
            <li>I shave before showering, and even soap &amp; hot water in the shower doesn&#x27;t get it out.  </li>
            <li>(Is that what the \\&quot;hot water\\&quot; was for in the directions)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only not as refreshing smelling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As many of the reviewers have said, it does not lather like a traditional shaving soap or cream.  </li>
            <li>It creates a slick surface and provides excellent protection, especially against DE blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t find it any different than most shaving creams.</li>
            <li>Soak the area you are going to shave in hot water before you start, it does make the shave even closer</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s actually not any more expensive!nd when you compare 1-1</li>
            <li>I am willing to admit it - I purchased this &amp;#34;superior shave cream&amp;#34; because I wanted a shave cream that didn&#x27;t come in a can that would leave marks on the shower tub.</li>
            <li>Much better than your regular shaving creams or gels!!</li>
            <li>therefore pretty expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve stocked up from Amazon at a much better price than my local store.</li>
            <li>, Proraso was more menthol and grown-up male smelling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And if that wasn&#x27;t enough, when I was done, my face was softer and smoother than I have felt it in many years.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>In my 2 mos as a newbie, i&#x27;m discovering that slickness is really what&#x27;s most important in wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a a first for me.</li>
            <li>and I shave after I get out of the hot shower (even before I used this stuff).</li>
            <li>So use a decent amount of water with the super lather.</li>
            <li>However Cremo overall is just OK</li>
            <li>While similarly priced to Prorasso, I like the lighter scent of Cremo better.</li>
            <li>Just bought a tube of this because my local pharmacy quit carrying my favorite puck.  </li>
            <li>Really is astonishing (!)</li>
            <li>I love Cremo Creme and I will never go back to anything else!!</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed upon my first shave is the aroma.</li>
            <li>YOUR SKIN ASTONISHINGLY SOFT AND SMOOTH</li>
            <li>gets a closer shave on the first pass or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Run hot water and get your hands wet.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Also, it leaves your face incredibly smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>, the first day I used it, I thought I made a mistake buying this.  </li>
            <li>and I obviously used more than the recommended size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t like it almost instantly- first</li>
            <li>Just some hot water and a dollop of this</li>
            <li>It stays on the face well and allows you to go back over areas unlike many others.  </li>
            <li>I shave about 4-5 days a week, and my first tube of Cremo lasted me 6 months.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly, and it doesn&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li>First for those who complain this product &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t lather&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I was confident that this would be an acceptable shave cream from reading the label, but my experiences with this were nothing short of awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Proraso and was reasonably happy with it but didn&#x27;t really like the extra time needed to prepare it or do multiple passes.  </li>
            <li>I use the 3 pass method most often, and trust me, the brush will hold enough lather for all three passes.  </li>
            <li>Try this once, and I am convinced you will be a fan of this product, and of the Mud Method.  ;-)</li>
            <li>When I first traveled with this it was because of</li>
            <li>I get much better results using regular bars of hand soap than Cremo.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t hear clean-shaven angels singing from on-high when I first put it on my face.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get a great shave (well, at least from this cream) and I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I tried using a hit towel first then hot water.</li>
            <li>, I have a short beard that extends just below the jaw line, so most of my shaving is on the neck.</li>
            <li>simply wet the brush, apply the dab of CREAMO CREAM to the brush and use your face as the mixing platform (dabbing your brush lightly in warm water every so often to generate more lather) â€¦ or you could use a mixing bowl (which I consider more of traditional tool than a necessity) â€¦ or use the palm of your hand as the mixing bowl (I used this method until I discovered the simple convenience of using my face to generate the lather).  </li>
            <li>Lightly dipping the edge of my brush into a sink of warm water allows me to add water in small increments to generate the lather I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t been satisfied with some of the mainstream big name shaving creams and gels.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is just that KMF is the most diluted of the three and does not create the same level of slickness as the others.</li>
            <li>I did not care for the fragrance when I first started using Cremo, but I have to say that after a week or two I actually quite enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li>It works like a charm, leaves his skin really soft and bump free.</li>
            <li>If you expect barber shop type hot lather,this cream is not for you.</li>
            <li>applied first) then followed by Creamo</li>
            <li>I just received Cremo Shave Cream today, and tonight was my first time using it.</li>
            <li>The directions instruct you to mix it with hot water at first, because the cream is so concentrated, so you don&#x27;t have to use but an almond sized amount of this miracle cream.</li>
            <li>I felt as though my skin was cleaner, and upon touching the area I just shaved noticed it felt instantly smoother than the rest of my skin.</li>
            <li>But the bottom line is that it leaves my face feeling more abused/abraded than with traditional soaps.  </li>
            <li>I have found nothing better, or longer lasting.</li>
            <li>Use the hot towel on your face and then apply the cream.</li>
            <li>- No big mess to clean up after, wipes off easily but make sure to clean your razor well as you go</li>
            <li>It is not like the other creams, which are mostly air - goes on more like a lotion - but with water, forms a nice slick surface for the razor to glide on.</li>
            <li>I still really like the smell of it, and I&#x27;ll probably keep using it for my head for right now.</li>
            <li>I find I have to use twice as much as the almond size indicated, but this stuff is cheap and not messy!</li>
            <li>My face is very sensitive and dry, and since using the Cremo, I have enjoyed the way it leaves my face feeling smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions and was impressed that such a small amount can do so much.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this allowed for a much closer (better) shave.</li>
            <li>Vastly overrated really the product of a marketing campaign and nothing more.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this is far better than anything in a can...</li>
            <li>However shortly after this, it dries up too much and requires application of more product.  </li>
            <li>I use the amount the company advises and I&#x27;m pretty darned certain</li>
            <li>Shaving dry can be a hassle in the warm months with high humidity.</li>
            <li>also like the tube because I am not afraid of it bursting all over the inside of my suitcase when I put it on an airplane or take it to a high altitude.</li>
            <li>on a pretty regular basis, but no product is as convenient or easy to shave with as Cremo.</li>
            <li>While not necessary, I find the wet brush method a more enjoyable part of shave prep.  </li>
            <li>Performance is pretty much in line with the retail price.  </li>
            <li>With the AAFES shave cream, I could use pretty much any razor</li>
            <li>Use a hot towel before shaving, it really helps.</li>
            <li>You can get it pretty much at any retail outlet (Walmart-Target-CVS-Amazon for example).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I prefer to put the Cremo in a stainless bowl and whip with my hot brush.</li>
            <li>The blades slide smoothly across my visage, even when I take a second and third pass without adding more</li>
            <li>But follicle, per follicle nothing has given me a closer shave except a hot towel and straight razor</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like it at first</li>
            <li>It shaves phenomenally close and smooth, and it only takes a tiny bit to do the job.</li>
            <li>The trick was to maximize the slickness with a uniform addition of water, using a small brush (my fingers did not do a good and uniform job of mixing water into the face bound cream).  </li>
            <li>Although it is slick, that doesn&#x27;t make a good shave medium.  </li>
            <li>Having said that, I think &amp;#34;Cremo&amp;#34; is a good product, but no better than &amp;#34;Proraso&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I mean like soaking wet, it&#x27;s best to shave right out of the shower after allowing your face to soak for about 30 seconds in hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Scrub scrub scrub, which of course feels good, but it&#x27;s opening your pores, the hot(ish, here) helps get your face ready, and then once that tiny little dab is all over, the shave is smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>This product is nicely scented, really softens the skin and makes it slick enough for a razor to comfortably glide over facial contours with amazing ease.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the idea of shaving in the shower as our water bill is high enough without spending more time in the shower shaving.</li>
            <li>Far better than any gilette or other commonly available brands of after shave</li>
            <li>I settled on Cremo Cream a few years ago and it&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>Most leave my face irritated and dry feeling, which makes after-shave balm a necessity.  </li>
            <li>I tried using a brush and shaving soap, but quickly returned to Cremo Cream--closer shave and no nicks, so far.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback to using this product was that it does create buildup on your razor that doesnâ€™t rinse away so easily</li>
            <li>Because of the light refreshing citrus scent of this cream I usually use it in the summer months.</li>
            <li>This product should work real well for most shavers as long as the hydrating issue is well done</li>
            <li>and 6 oz size will last a good long time.</li>
            <li>I doubt it will last as long as they claim but it does give a good shave with my Phillips electric.  </li>
            <li>my husband swears by the shave cream for his face and has had a large container of The Art of Shaving shaving cream and uses this instead.</li>
            <li>certainly a saucy cream</li>
            <li>an added bonus, I was pleased to learn that a visit to the Creamo web site will provide new customers with a rebate equal to you</li>
            <li>I usually use shave gels because most shave creams don&#x27;t give me enough lubrication for a smooth and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>No matter what amount I use (deviating more and less than the recommended &amp;#34;almond size&amp;#34;) the cream never seems to form a consistent layer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Be aware that, yes, this stuff is slippery, but then, that&#x27;s the point of their product, to lubricate the shave itself in a better way than other products do.</li>
            <li>By the way,it washes off just fine, and it doesn&#x27;t build up a layer of white flaky crud on your razor</li>
            <li>My beard is light and doesn&#x27;t stand up well, so I typically shave a second time against the grain to get a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>Particularly if you use HOT water to soak a towel and wrap your face in it</li>
            <li>Not only is the shaving experience with Cremo far superior, but compared to the medicinal, slightly chemical smell of the Neutrogena, this one smells all natural, and absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that this product is available with Prime, because the store I got my first tube at did not have it when I checked the other day, and I definitely plan to repurchase.</li>
            <li>No frills, reasonably-priced, and a small amount goes a long way---yet it performs admirably in the key categories: lubrication without excessive foaming, refreshing manly smell, suitable for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fancy shaving boutiques and designer stores are great for finding a pretty, unique, luxurious gift.</li>
            <li>Far superior to the typical gels and foams, better than other premium cremes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The shave is smooth, but left my skin feeling very irritated and</li>
            <li>I really think a cheap, creamy conditioner on your face would give you the same results.  </li>
            <li>Really works well for me and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>This &#x3D; way TOO Much.</li>
            <li>A can of Positively Smooth costs about the same as a tube of Cremo Cream</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve realized that the upside of this is that you are getting a much closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, 1 bottle lasts a very longtime.  </li>
            <li>at a very affordable price.  </li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>Price not so much.  </li>
            <li>and this really goes along way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took about 10 shaves to fully understand how it lathers and that you really don&#x27;t need that much  - you can get away with an almond size dollop.  </li>
            <li>Pop a moistened, rolled-up wash cloth in there 5 minutes before I jump in the shower, and it is ready for me when I get out.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I would get a very close shave and zero cuts.  </li>
            <li>(Ok I used it for my legs but an almond size dab was more than enough for one leg and actually probably enough for two.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can tell you got the entire area because it has this smooth silky lightwieght film on it.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>It makes my legs feel as smooth as if I had just had them waxed, same with my underarm area.</li>
            <li>I get a very close shave when I use this</li>
            <li>The 2 cm amount can cover my whole head and chin area.  </li>
            <li>Also, I had very irritated skin on the creamo side.</li>
            <li>Cremo, while not eliminating the bumps and rashes has really diminished the area the shaving rash covers and the number of bumps I get.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>BUT after awhile of use I must admit, this product works very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Barbasol and Edge for years, but this stuff really takes the cake.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Really slickens up your face.  </li>
            <li>Available in 3 oz and smaller for travel purposes.</li>
            <li>The second pass resulted in no lather, but there was sufficient lubrication on my face so that my face was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about my shave creams, and I would prefer Barbarosa to this.</li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;m not as estatic as the 5 star reviews, this product really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if I&#x27;m in a rush I&#x27;ll use straight Cremo.  </li>
            <li>(and it doesn&#x27;t lather which is how I like it) and it just didn&#x27;t lubricate my skin very well at all.</li>
            <li>that doesn&#x27;t matter nearly as much as shave performance.  </li>
            <li>It took me several shaves to figure this stuff out but now that I have, it provides a silky smooth, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, I feel I often use too much.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much and it just keeps gliding on.</li>
            <li>I threw my bottle of cremo straight in the trash where it belongs</li>
            <li>The Every Man Jack had a texture that felt more like a skin lotion and not much of a lather.</li>
            <li>I have been using the King of Shaves brand gel which works very well for just about any blade I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It does give you a very close shave, that feels very &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; (their word, not mine).  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t do what it needs to do, too much and your eyes can become overwhelmed),</li>
            <li>find there to be some sort of iridescent sheen associated with the very slickest of creams and</li>
            <li>I like to prime with hot water and Parker soap, then either use Cremo Cream or Premier Dead Sea Luxury Facial Cleanser, both work pretty good and soften my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t alleviate the pull, it doesn&#x27;t allow a real close shave as well as others.  </li>
            <li>The difference between this and what I used  before is very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you shaved your face fast, you might not encounter this.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re using a double-edged razor or straight razor, you&#x27;re going to cut yourself.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S REALLY</li>
            <li>This prevents the razor from clogging, while allowing the blade very close contact with the skin.</li>
            <li>Make sure your face is wet.  </li>
            <li>This did not turn out well given that electric razors do not handle that much volume of shaving cream well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended !</li>
            <li>Apply with a Clarisonic for a really close shave.</li>
            <li>Its really fruity and not my thing.</li>
            <li>This might be a contributing reason why it left my face smooth etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really debating on whether to get this again.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But the real problem I have with this is the stickiness....</li>
            <li>you rub it into your face, or between your hands, it&#x27;s not going to lather up much at all.</li>
            <li>Having used Barbasol and cheap shave gels all my life, I was used to applying massive amounts of Santa-Claus-beard foam that looks and feels on my skin a bit like spray sealant.</li>
            <li>It has a gentle citrus scent, tending toward grapefruit.</li>
            <li>This stuff works very well and moisturizes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>; - it really isn&#x27;t supposed to be used with a mug and brush.</li>
            <li>However it really won&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li>Oh, and costs a couple times as much.</li>
            <li>For such a small amount of lather, I had the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced, with no nicks, and all on the first application.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really is &amp;#34;Astonishingly Superior&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Now you are ready to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I much prefer my Gillette Foamy.  </li>
            <li>Took a bit of getting used to but it is the real deal &amp; lives upp to the commercials</li>
            <li>I really cant tell a difference between this and</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone considering buying this stuff!</li>
            <li>much easier.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go.  </li>
            <li>It makes even duller razors perform very well.  </li>
            <li>A pea sized amount really is all you need for your whole face.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t speak much about it.</li>
            <li>I find that It makes a very airy lather.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>However, I still have seldom gotten as close a shave with my safety razor or straight edge as I did with my disposable and cremo.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as I&#x27;d hope and isn&#x27;t as lubricative as I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really feel the need to go into exhaustive details about a grooming product.  </li>
            <li>It is much milder than the shave foam I was using (and is now in the trash).</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need more than a dime sized amount of the cream and your face needs to be WET.</li>
            <li>really works as advertised</li>
            <li>and I am very please with it.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Using my hands, I had as much Creamo on my palms as I did on my face.  </li>
            <li>This one is THE shaving cream for straight edge shave fans.</li>
            <li>Made the switch to the this from regular sensitive shaving cream and boy am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I have only used a Gillette shave gel for sensitive skin and had considered upgrading to something better.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical when I first ordered Cremo Cream since it seemed too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>the socks off of your basic canned goop or gel, and far better for your skin.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I can now shave more frequently (if need be) than I did prior to using Cremo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After years of trying to find a good shave cream that helps remove razor burn and not leave a rash, I bought this one for my son, who has a thick beard.</li>
            <li>agree with other Reviewers who have noted that you need to prepare this cream correctly in order to get the maximum benefits, and it is very important to understand that this is a very concentrated product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not certain the purpose of this - maybe the grit contains some of the magic.</li>
            <li>Very close shave on the first run (against the grain with a safety razor) and came out very smooth with little or no burn.</li>
            <li>first with the grain, then quickly re-lathered and gave a second shave against the grain.  </li>
            <li>This shaving cream is surprisingly good and a single tube lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light and refreshing and it is very slick</li>
            <li>This particular product is very close to the Neutrogena product, except that it is MUCH thicker (like toothpase)</li>
            <li>I cannot stress to make sure you follow the directions on the back of the bottle (Rub Hot Water onto Face for 30 seconds, only an Almond Size portion rubbed in</li>
            <li>I gave it a 1 star review and now am revising it out of fairness due to the latest results.</li>
            <li>The first time using this the only way to describe what happened is I had to check to make sure my razor was actually working.</li>
            <li>The scent is rather unique and the only tangible aroma I can tie it to would be a hint of orange.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t see a difference between this and most other gel shaving creams.</li>
            <li>It was basically a glorified lotion branded for use in the shower, but even so, it was better than any other foaming products.</li>
            <li>Because of this I tend to use a generous amount, more than with other brands.</li>
            <li>If you are a shower shaver you may have better luck with this stuff as it needs to be very wet.  </li>
            <li>â™¦ Warms nicely if placed in a small stainless bowl and placed on a candle warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You get such a clean shave and my skin has never been irritated using this.</li>
            <li>It may be more expensive up front, but in the long run you&#x27;ll save more money because less is more with this shaving cream :)</li>
            <li>Exceptional product and one that I recommend at least once or twice a week to my customers</li>
            <li>This shaving cream, in conjunction with a fresh brand new gillette fusion proglide power blade with the power button on, shaving with it in the hot shower with a proper LED light shaving mirror and a proper pre shave oil beforehand, will give you like it does for me, the closest and smoothest shave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m nearly paranoid about not being able to find it when I need more, so I&#x27;ll be purchasing a few extra tubes promptly.</li>
            <li>small dab of CREAMO with a sink or cup full of warm water is really all that is needed to provide a well-lubricated lather to accommodate multiple razor passes.  </li>
            <li>First impression was:  strange scent, but super</li>
            <li>The label says pretty clearly to massage this onto your skin and it will form a &amp;#34;light lather&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Although I do have fairly sensitive skin, more so when I was in my teens and twenties, I just never really put much thought into the type of cream I used.</li>
            <li>If normal stuff makes a 1/4&amp;#34; layer, this is going to be 1/8&amp;#34; - just a film on your face really, but its adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(My wifey has a cool washcloth steamer which I also use regularly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried everything from the old hot lather machines (remember them?)</li>
            <li>I lather it in my palms, and a good wet lather always gives me enough cream for complete beard and neck coverage.</li>
            <li>Its not bad, just... different.</li>
            <li>Not a bad choice overall.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about you but cleaning up after a teenage boy isn&#x27;t easy to begin with and this definitely makes it much easier for us!</li>
            <li>You really only need a little bit for a good shave.</li>
            <li>As the package says, less is more.</li>
            <li>Better now that I am using less.</li>
            <li>In fact less is more.</li>
            <li>Suffice to say I found that my shaving experience was in the kindest way I can describe, less than satisfying.</li>
            <li>I am glad because it is about half the cost.</li>
            <li>I would compare this to Jack Black shave cream but better.</li>
            <li>but, it is (less is actually more with this</li>
            <li>Smells like an orange creamsicle and has to be reapplied more or less after each pass</li>
            <li>Bumps were drastically less and skin was noticeably better.</li>
            <li>I concur with most othe posters on the 2 stars and less....</li>
            <li>began researching different shave creams/gels when I decided to purchase bulk toiletries on Amazon and a simple search for shave creams returned more options than I had time to consider.</li>
            <li>Whether I am using a brush or rubbing it straight on a wet face, it works well and keep my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>I personally like it super</li>
            <li>It makes the shaving surface super slippery, but it makes no claim to softening the actual hair before the shaving process.</li>
            <li>I mainly use this cream when I don&#x27;t have the time or want to put forth the effort to soak my brush and whip up lather in a bowl.  </li>
            <li>later found Cremo Shaving Cream at my local Walgreens in desperation for somethig better.</li>
            <li>Even have enough on to make a second pass without putting any more on.</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;d buy Cremo is if I ran out of traditional soap and it was either Cremo or spray can soap, there are tons of better shaving soap brands.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly to shave my scalp and this product works wonders.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually about to order the facial cleanser/moisturizer specifically because the shaving cream is so outstanding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through all sorts of different shave cream brands, most recently using Aveeno.</li>
            <li>It does not later up like regular shave cream unless you use more than suggested.</li>
            <li>Buy the 6 ounce tube,it&#x27;s cheaper by the ounce and will last 3 months and more with daily use if needed.</li>
            <li>A tube lasts so long because you use just a small amount which does a great job.</li>
            <li>Before shaving was an irritating nightmare, but Cremo changed that and made it pleasant again.</li>
            <li>I prefer a nice thick lather and application via a badger hair brush and mainly shave with a safety razor or a straight razor</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, it has pleasant feel, provides a close shave and the scent is not overpowering or negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Leaves a very close shave, no nicks, and no irritation, and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If I seem to be running low on it, I just add a little bit more to my head and add a little water as well, and it&#x27;s good to go again.  </li>
            <li>After mixing it together with the hot water in my hands for about 30 seconds, I applied it on my face, and let me tell you, the consistency and feel of this cream is like no other!</li>
            <li>Lately, I&#x27;ve experimented with adding two drops of shaving oil (Somersets) to my dab of Cremo and that works even better!  </li>
            <li>I love it because there is still a nice slick surface when going back and touching up tough areas.  </li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t have high water pressure, this could be the shave cream for you.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Cremo.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just going to say I highly recommend this product to all women and</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I have also compared it to some of the high end shaving creams that I also tried.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>You will not get a high volume lather.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>The performance of the Cremo creme beats anything that I have tried (including the high end Clinique products).  </li>
            <li>There is plenty of cream in the tube and after a month of use everyday, I still have more than enough to last me a couple of months or more.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Cremo Cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, you will probably feel a little more &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; against the stubble than you&#x27;re used to.</li>
            <li>Just better when you can soak a little first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I also bought the women&#x27;s version which just smells a little more &amp;#34;girlie&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When used with my brush to make a lather it is a little better.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice smell, but no matter how hard I tried, I could not get it to lather.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good product because a little goes a long way; I bought one from the drug store what feels like 5 months ago</li>
            <li>This with a blade and razor that I have used successfully many times (naturally when trying something new, I want every other factor to be a known quantity).  </li>
            <li>The lather of this really reminds my husband of the old fashion soap and brush application.  </li>
            <li>You put a dab about the size of an almond on your fingers and then smooth it over your wet face.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this so much he purchased some for each of our (adult) children.  </li>
            <li>I normally use a [[ASIN:B00T7WNHK2 shaving gel]] and a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I shave my head as normal</li>
            <li>You will never use normal shaving cream again...</li>
            <li>I normally get 25 shaves out of a blade - this one is at 35 and probably about time to be</li>
            <li>All 3 of the creams are good values, and I recommend getting small quantities to test for your personal preferences.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price, and from what I&#x27;ve seen it will last a while, and like all creams it takes some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>several knicks, even with a fresh blade.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it provides a better shave (because I can&#x27;t really tell the difference), but I like the story.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Suggestion: buy it before you run out of your normal shaving cream/gel.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not cutting my face up on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>A heavy advertising of this product and promise the first will be free...</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price since I can achieve the same results with a can of Barbasol</li>
            <li>So far the worst shave with this cream is better than the best shave I ever had with the Gillette or Neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li>I normally use a brush and safety razor.</li>
            <li>A lot of people write a review saying it doesn&#x27;t lather well, well it doesn&#x27;t lather like normal foamy shaving cream, but the point isn&#x27;t the lather of it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry, this is normal.  </li>
            <li>I use it to shave my legs and armpits, and have used it in my bikini area before, but that&#x27;s an area I normally wax</li>
            <li>I use an almond-size squirt from the tube (and the tube will last you almost forever using this small of an amount), make sure face is warm and wet.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, it&#x27;s worth it for the extra kisses from the wife.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not great or even really good.</li>
            <li>Good lather/shave soap e.g. proraso&amp;#62; shave secret &amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li>My very finicky husband has used many shave products over the years, from very high-end creams all the way down to generic drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t rinse off the skin very easily, and it left me smelling like a can of furniture polish due to the lemony scent.</li>
            <li>version but this does the same job and smells just as nice for less.</li>
            <li>It is not as thick as the instructions indicate and you have to use more than an almond size especially if you have significant beard</li>
            <li>I have been wet shaving with a DE for the past few years and have enjoyed it except when I traveled because most hotel etc do not have soft water and most soaps and creams gum up on the razor and do not perform as well as with soft water.  </li>
            <li>They work well in the shower with electric razors as well, but Cremo is not only priced right</li>
            <li>The key is getting the water/cream ratio right</li>
            <li>Cremo smells great, but it doesn&#x27;t soften the beard at all, is very thin, and dries to a flaky consistency within a minute or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>REALLY work it in good and develop a nice lather that is neither runny nor so thick that it is difficult to rinse off of the razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave quite as close of a shave as other products, but it leaves your skin stupidly smooth.  </li>
            <li>Very creamy, spreads very evenly on your face and you don&#x27;t need to use much so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Just squeeze a very small amount in your hand then add water and it whips into a nice lather.  </li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t even a new blade).  </li>
            <li>This is my new go-to shaving cr&amp;egrave;me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve subscribed for a new tube every 4 months because this stuff lasts.</li>
            <li>Even with new blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your skin is sticky and even with a clean face the razor will drag.</li>
            <li>as advertised and it  works equally well with a regular razor or a  wet electric shaver to produce a clean and comfortable shave&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;First you should know that I have an extra-large head (XL hats don&#x27;t fit me), I have a very coarse beard, and the hair on my head is somewhat coarse too.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, cheap and expensive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut back on the amount I use, and I haven&#x27;t really noticed as much of a &amp;#34;drying-out&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I wanted something better than the cheap shaving cans you get in the store, and randomly heard about this product.</li>
            <li>by the way, I have found that the same amount will also cover my head along with my face, so you really don&#x27;t need much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blade will slide across your face smoothly and effortlessly leaving behind a shave so smooth even your kids will notice.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s pretty darn slick and comfortable when I&#x27;m not nicking myself.</li>
            <li>, I would just prefer something a little &amp;#34;manlier&amp;#34; - but it isn&#x27;t a deal breaker as the smell is pretty mild anyway.</li>
            <li>My skin tells me how I have done very clearly each and every shave.  </li>
            <li>I would be very surprised if they didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and I believed it was going to beat every man jack shaving cream according to the description on the tube.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The cost for a single tube seems high until you realize how many shaves a single tube will provide (with a pea-sized dollop for each shave)</li>
            <li>The cost for a single tube seems high until you realize how many shaves a single tube will provide (with a pea-sized dollop for each shave)</li>
            <li>B003EMVVMM Gillette Fusion Razor]], and only experience nicks or cuts when using a new blade for the first time.  </li>
            <li>the first two shaves and a Edwin Jagger DE89 Lbl for the last shave.</li>
            <li>the first two shaves and a Edwin Jagger DE89 Lbl for the last shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll also feel a sort of gritty texture at first.</li>
            <li>Just wow!</li>
            <li>I followed the EXACTLY what the directions said on the back.  </li>
            <li>And after a razor stroke it didn&#x27;t always feel like it left enough lubrication to go over the same area more than once or twice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bonus no fake gross stuff</li>
            <li>different higher end shave creams - Murad, Anthony, Prorasso - and I</li>
            <li>Every shave with the old stuff is disappointing and gets more and more so, until you just throw it out and use the Cremo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay, these guys claim this is the &#x27;impossibly slick&#x27; blah blah.</li>
            <li>This feels much richer than general lathers.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>my beard was still pretty low.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m only finishing my first 6 oz.</li>
            <li>This was my first foray into traditional shave cream</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m used to using higher quality creams like Proraso and C.O. Bigelow, and this is definitely inferior, in my opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t lather worth jack monkey squat, either by hand or with brush and bowl.  </li>
            <li>Thus far I have used it three separate times and found it to give me an acceptable shaving experience though nothing to brag about and based on my experience up to this moment I do not plan to purchase it again once the tube has been used up!</li>
            <li>I bought my first tube at Meijer and have recently seen it  at  Walmart, both for under $7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this when I first switched to a double edged razor and that was probably a mistake to switch two things at once.  </li>
            <li>ONLY after hot moist towels have been applied.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s no better then many of the brands I buy at the store.</li>
            <li>Apparently Creamo gives me a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li>close shaves were a bit surprising because Creamo doesn&#x27;t give you a real thick lather.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, it really does work well even though the generic labeling (which is fine) reminds me of the white cans in the 70&#x27;s that simply said &amp;#34;Beer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I re-wet my hands a little and pat fresh hot water on my head only&lt;</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the difference between phenomenal success in utter failure:</li>
            <li>As advertised,a little dab goes a long way and needs plenty of warm water added as you are using it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, especially the neck area, and get better results from a bar of Dove soap and a semi sharp Hydro5.</li>
            <li>On a hot summer day when I don&#x27;t want to spend too much time in a steamy bathroom wet shaving, I use Cremo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading all the hype - I had high expectations for this shaving cream - followed directions to the letter - disappointing shave even with Gillette Silver Blues - going to give to my bud with the lighter beard - maybe it will work better for him-eh!!</li>
            <li>I tried this because of the strongly positive reviews and the moderate price point.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not this huge mess like aerosol shaving creams.</li>
            <li>If you need to shave your head, this stuff will make a HUGE mess and get all in your eyes and mouth..</li>
            <li>I bought a tube of Cremo a few months back and waited awhile to review it because your first impression is not always accurate.</li>
            <li>but I have previously used Gillette Fusion gel and most recently Axe chilled shaving gel.  </li>
            <li>Overall a decent product for a decent price.</li>
            <li>Pretty much the complete opposite of what the label on the back had claimed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not foam up like conventional shave creams and you have to get your facial skin very warm and wet in order to make it work properly.</li>
            <li>And if you go to a certain big box retailer based in Arkansas, you can get it for $3.98.</li>
            <li>Although, if your the type who only uses one cream all the time, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to keep anyone from using this cream anytime of year.</li>
            <li>It doesnt lather the same as other shave products, but it is slick and leaves you with a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s GREAT), however, it is also VERY runny and thin (which means it makes a mess</li>
            <li>(I clean and preserve my blades with alcohol to cut down on rust/oxidation.  </li>
            <li>Next I started using bar soap, which was a little better</li>
            <li>then you can even get another pass by just working in a little more water with what&#x27;s left on your face.</li>
            <li>If after the initial shave, you find some skin areas that need more attention, just add a little water to the area and the slickness is renewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The texture of this cream is like no other I have ever seen, and I&#x27;ve got a cabinet full of widely known brands of shaving cream.</li>
            <li>It is easily rinsed from a razor or an  electric shaver unlike some other shave creams, specifically American Crew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super slick, super easy to use, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have used quite a few products which do, so this is a huge plus to</li>
            <li>I have used quite a few products which do, so this is a huge plus to</li>
            <li>Cremo was slippery and clear.</li>
            <li>I quote from the label instructions in the review and clearly state that the product is not meant to be used with a brush</li>
            <li>Based on reviews it is clear that this stuff is working well for some people, in fact lots of people.</li>
            <li>I use it with my straight razors only as I can see through the cream on my face without nicking vital anatomy during the process.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While shaving with Cremo is comfortable, it&#x27;s much harder to apply than gel, and an \\&quot;almond-sized\\&quot; amount is completely insufficient (although it might work with only one day&#x27;s growth).  </li>
            <li>I rinse my razor in the sink frequently</li>
            <li>Far fewer skin bumps after shaving</li>
            <li>Of the 3 creams, the Cremo has the least lubricity and least after shave conditioning with the Bigelow premium far and above the best lubricity and conditioning.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There were a few times that I needed to \\&quot;reactivate\\&quot; the slickness by placing water on my face with my free hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Every time I use it, about halfway through my shave I resign myself to the fact that I&#x27;ll need to reach for my brush and Taylor of Old Bond Street and re-shave.  </li>
            <li>Upon finishing though, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at the results.  </li>
            <li>So far, it has worked out well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell where I&#x27;ve shaved and later realize that I missed spots.</li>
            <li>However, each item cost nearly twenty bucks and</li>
            <li>They also send me periodic offers by email.  </li>
            <li>and I am 62 years old.  </li>
            <li>I am using an old school 1965 Gillette DE adjustable razor.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face soft</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin, prone to get razor burn on my neck.</li>
            <li>Go every-other-shave between the two until you use up your old one.</li>
            <li>I have far fewer cuts, get a closer shave, and have no irritation.</li>
            <li>It really does last for 3 months and both me and my husband use it.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>But eventually it dries up completely and I have to reapply the product to finish shaving.</li>
            <li>After using this several times to shave both my head and face, I&#x27;ve come to the opinion that it just dries up too fast.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER: You absolutely must do the following to get this product to work.</li>
            <li>so, have enough experience now to write a reasonable review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the facial hair it didn&#x27;t really cover like I&#x27;d expect it to.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin as it has no harsh ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay, this is for all those 1 star reviews that complained about the lack of lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Wow, shaving this way is a treat, but there is one drawback.  </li>
            <li>Shake out the excess water with a flick of the wrist and add about and almond size dollop of Cremeo directly on your brush.  </li>
            <li>Simultaneously, it does not irritate my sensitive skin and it helps to prevent the skin on my face from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I then apply a Proraso aftershave lotion for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>tube has lasted a year so far and</li>
            <li>Fast forward, on recent travel I was using the Kiehl&#x27;s Shaving Cream that was already packed in my dopp kit.</li>
            <li>I have a semi sensitive face but was optimistic.  </li>
            <li>Daily shaving really beats up my face</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;m 43 years old</li>
            <li>(It does also have a secondary scent that I don&#x27;t love.  </li>
            <li>At least most of you will never use another shave cream again.</li>
            <li>As far as I an concerned.  </li>
            <li>I thought she was just imagining a difference, so tested to see if she really could tell when I used Cremo or regular foam out of a can.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft afterwards and the cream doesnâ€™t stick in the razor.  </li>
            <li>After only a few shaves, I am already really glad I made the change.</li>
            <li>Thick facial hair is no match, and gives a clean quick shave.  </li>
            <li>Very slick, it allows for a very comfortable glide.</li>
            <li>And the razor cleans very quickly because the stuff is so slick.</li>
            <li>I quickly narrowed my search down to some shave soaps and this product based on reviews alone.</li>
            <li>One thing I did find Cremo is useful for however is to add to other shaving soaps.  </li>
            <li>The original (rather harsh) review is below:  </li>
            <li>Love the smell of this, and it is very slick.</li>
            <li>It does not lather as much as some of the other shave creams I have used, but it still provided a small amount of lather and a very smooth shaving experience.</li>
            <li>I soon throw away my disposables, I am also going to throw away my Barbersol shave cream that does nothing more than make a mess and works just a little better than plain soap and water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but after the first shave on my face it did not leave enough lubricant to go back over my face and get it closer.</li>
            <li>and I can only buy it at one particular drug store in town.  </li>
            <li>and I can only buy it at one particular drug store in town.  </li>
            <li>When you wet your skin and apply the cream in the appropriate proportion, you may see a little white cream on your skin at first, but it will be very little and will likely disappear very quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used dozens of high end shave care products and this stuff is squarely in the middle.  </li>
            <li>My electric razor was giving out, and I didn&#x27;t want another because the newer ones look like high maintenance, low quality.</li>
            <li>I have tried both with new blades and old and with various water temperatures.</li>
            <li>Not sure one tube will last him the full 90 days it claims to, but he&#x27;ll certainly be buying another when this one runs out.</li>
            <li>He does get a closer shave with less burn, but he says he can&#x27;t really tell and doesn&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>Cremo Shave Cream is better than typical grade, but not much.</li>
            <li>Not sure how it works, but compared to the cheap gel I was using g, it is night and day difference.</li>
            <li>As long as they keep making this and selling it at a reasonable price, I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li>This cream provides for a slick and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>â™¦ Does not take much, one tube lasts a long time.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The makers state rather clearly that their problem with traditional shave cream is that too much of the product does nothing for you at all, due to too much</li>
            <li>but what it does is leaves a slick surface for your razor blade to glide over for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Both grow back enough to shave once per day, but to be economical I actually shave every 1.5 days</li>
            <li>The electric razor glides across my face and after I have finished the first shave I wet my hand and rub it over my face again.</li>
            <li>Wet face with hot water.</li>
            <li>the next time, I shaved like normal...</li>
            <li>I have also tried it shaving my face, and I do find Shave Secret a superior shave, but for the two reasons stated above, I am likely to continue using this to shave my head.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m good with the smell (seems citric - like oranges) , and it did allow a close shave with no irritation, but the extra mess and hassle and time of keeping it watered and having that running down my elbow constantly was just B.S.  </li>
            <li>I use a new gillette fusion proglide power blade with each shave since my hair is so thick and cuts up the blade after each shave, and this cream really helps to make the blade just glide along my face and neck like butter on a scalding hot pan.  </li>
            <li>Whether or not you get a closer shave might depend on your shaving style, but this product stays slick longer than usual and allows several strokes to the same areas, so you are more likely to do a better job</li>
            <li>Now a new regular customer for this product.</li>
            <li>Combined with my new Edwin Jagger De87bl razor, I now actually look forward to shaving!</li>
            <li>Recently, I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li>I keep about 4 or so different shave creams/soaps on rotation and like to try new ones as i run out.</li>
            <li>Recently I decides to try something new</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for several months before reviewing to ensure I wasn&#x27;t just biased because its something new.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something a bit more &#x27;natural&#x27; than canned shave gels, this is a poor choice.</li>
            <li>I now can shave against the grain without major neck irritation.  </li>
            <li>to expensive electric shavers, but the Cremo cream was the first product that made this daily task more tolerable for me.  </li>
            <li>I have had this for 3 weeks now, and I have barely made a dent in the supply of one tube!</li>
            <li>The instructions say all you need is a small amount and that is true, a small almond sized amount was good enough to cover my face well but not as a thick lather that I would expect but more like a slick liquid on my face.  </li>
            <li>Well, since I started using this, even on super sensitive areas, I have little to no razor burn, and I only have to shave about once every 1.5-2 weeks.</li>
            <li>As someone who used to shave sometimes twice daily for work (military), this has help provide such a close and smooth shave that I only have to shave once a day.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and after switiching to Cremo, as well as Shea Moisture&#x27;s Tea Tree alcohol-free aftershave, I have had nothing but close shaves, and smooth, bump-free skin that&#x27;s not left red and dried out.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this has really worked especially during the winter when I have really dry skin.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers note, follow the instructions when applying--wet hands and wet face are important..</li>
            <li>Prepare your face with hot water, or a hot towel, and apply a very small amount.</li>
            <li>Following the instructions on the tube very carefully, and having put a fresh Wilkinson Sword blade in my Parker 99</li>
            <li>Takes a little experimenting, but worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A little pricey and worth it.</li>
            <li>is less than half the price and gives me a better shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While the shaves are better, finding a decent soap or cream is difficult at any price point.  </li>
            <li>foams up well, smooth shave and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin very slick and easy to shave.</li>
            <li>It is slick like it says because of its special &amp;#34;molecules&amp;#34; but for me, does not produce a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>Even much more expensive \\&quot;premium\\&quot; brands found in high end department</li>
            <li>so I will update my review with long term use and whether this really will last 90 days.  </li>
            <li>At any rate, if you have sensitive skin and shaving is sometimes a problem for you -- definitely get this stuff.</li>
            <li>Ever since they discontinued the generic AAFES brand foamy sensitive shave cream, I have struggled to find a replacement.  </li>
            <li>I have the unenviable combination of a very coarse beard and soft skin.</li>
            <li>gave me the same results (Proraso for sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>/&gt;This will be replacing my Schick Hydro Sensitive gel that I had been using daily.</li>
            <li>It was so sudsy and watery, you could barely use it.</li>
            <li>I think the next cream I&#x27;ll try is Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s Sandalwood.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe they&#x27;re only comparing themselves with the old school foams.</li>
            <li>I have a rough beard that grows every which direction, especially on my sensitive neck.</li>
            <li>Once I finally spoke to them I thought that they really were interested in being helpful, and that&#x27;s a rare thing these days (unfortunately).   </li>
            <li>I feel no drag at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d shave with Creamo for a while, then throw in a day with regular old stuff.  </li>
            <li>Nicks and irritation are rare, and are usually just because I used an old blade.  </li>
            <li>If you enjoy a thick, luscious lather, DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
            <li>Sorry guys, nice try.</li>
            <li>It is a little odd though using it over a lather able cream.</li>
            <li>I FIRST tried it, I probably expected slightly too much.  </li>
            <li>Mainly it seems like a vehicle for a couple of vain and egotistical men called Kyle Schroeder and Mike Boone to brag about how cool they were to start a company which makes mediocre high end shave creme, which they seem to have to give away to get distribution.  </li>
            <li>This has twice as many ingredients as your standard Gillette shave gel including a whole load of synthetic chemicals not found in normal shave gels which are artificial enough at</li>
            <li>, it is SUPER SLICK when kept moist, which is what they advertised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super slick as advertised.</li>
            <li>The bad news for me (and good news for those who like this product) is that it really can go a long way.  </li>
            <li>It lathers on clear but leaves your face very slick, better than any other shaving cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This stuff works very well, if not exactly as advertised by the maker.</li>
            <li>This is very slick and provides a close irritation free shave.  </li>
            <li>I found the key to this products success being the addition of a little water to each application of the cream.  </li>
            <li>The standard aerosol gels generate a lot of foam/lather for one razor pass, but always left my face dry and the cans simply never stop oozing foam after the first use.  </li>
            <li>Just use my hands to apply a thin lather, then use my brush with the traditional products on top of the super slick goodness that is Cremo Cream.</li>
            <li>Looking to make his shaving experience more enjoyable (and less painful), I purchased Cremo, and we&#x27;re both</li>
            <li>I have used foams from time to time but never really cared for them and only really used them if I had to purchase a travel size of if they were provided at a hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Absolutely would recommend trying it especially if you suffer every time you have to drag that razor over your neck like I do.</li>
            <li>My blade did not glide over my skin nearly as well as a lather soap, I nicked my chin and found enough stubble left that I lathered up with my brush and shaved again.</li>
            <li>But for daily shaving, keep your man&#x27;s shaving kit  stocked with the old standard Cremo!</li>
            <li>I recently switched to using an old fashioned safety razor and this just doesn&#x27;t give enough protection.</li>
            <li>I have not yet used it long enough to determine if this 6 oz tube lasts longer than a normal 7 oz can of shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I bought a few different items to try and this one wins hands</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was long time user of American Crew Shave cream when I could find it at less than the full retail price of about $16.</li>
            <li>I thought at first I just had a dull razor but switched to brand new (and got the cuts to prove it)</li>
            <li>A little frusterated at first.  </li>
            <li>This cremo cream left a load of razor bumps and redness under my neck like no other.</li>
            <li>While much more expensive than other products, the 6 ounces will give you many shaves as the amount required per-shave is so little, plus you are getting a product that will not only give you a closer shave, but it will also reduce irritation while simultaneously moisturizing your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While much more expensive than other products, the 6 ounces will give you many shaves as the amount required per-shave is so little, plus you are getting a product that will not only give you a closer shave, but it will also reduce irritation while simultaneously moisturizing your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I re-read the instructions and decided I&#x27;d misinterpreted them the first time and gotten a little over-ambitious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Found Cremo at my local drug store and had high hopes for it, but it did not live up to the hype on the label.  </li>
            <li>Some gave me great results while others disappointed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I still go every 3 days though as I shave my head at the same time and every other day would be to much for my schedule.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Monday shaving is normally a bit rough for me.  </li>
            <li>If you currently use some product like Edge shaving gel give this a try;  you will understand why it is worth an extra few dollars.</li>
            <li>I let the brush soak in hot water for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>Cremo is intended to be brushless, but I find that applying a small dot to a wet brush before each of 2-3 passes works fine.  </li>
            <li>It really cuts down on the skin irritation--especially with the DE razor.</li>
            <li>Does not work very well for me; the cream seems too liquid and tends to run down the shaver handle so making the grip slippery.</li>
            <li>This compensated for the absence of the straight razor due to the lubrication on your skin.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, this product is very economical because you need/use so much less than a typical gel or foam.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this based on the reviews, but it might as well be any other shave cream that doesn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re a senior with dry and thinning skin, finish it off with Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many gel/creams/oils for shaving my head over the past few years.</li>
            <li>After four days of use, I set it aside for several reasons: first, although it&#x27;s slick, it didn&#x27;t shave my beard any closer than other products in this price range; second, my skin felt tight and irritated after rinsing off; and third, I developed a patch of dermatitis on my chin--which quickly cleared up after I stopped using the product.</li>
            <li>(bleeding was a normal thing with other creams)&lt;br</li>
            <li>multiple times when using this, while it never happened in the year or two with my previous shave stuff (the real shaving co)</li>
            <li>time I found myself applying more of this to my face for a second pass, again maybe this was user error because of bad blades or not letting my face be in hot enough water or something.</li>
            <li>He really hates the gel in a can stuff that continually expands after the cap is replaced - creating a gooey mess for the next shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super slick, as advertised, and allows multiple passes with minor reapplication of some water and a tiny bit of cream.</li>
            <li>â€¦ too little water &#x3D; dry/uncomfortable shave â€¦ to much water &#x3D; messy/uncomfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>It only takes a little dab, about as much as you put toothpaste on your brush.</li>
            <li>However since it is so affordable I don&#x27;t really mind using a little extra.</li>
            <li>First impression is a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>no matter how hard I tried to keep them clean and dry.</li>

            <li> I think Creamo is the best shave cream product I have ever</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.</li>
            <li> I think Noxema shave cream is still the best I have used.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product in compilation with the Dollar Shave Club executive razors and it works great!</li>
            <li> All together a great product!</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Btw smells great too!</li>
            <li> , in my waiting for me DE razor, I used this Cremo with a disposable and got the very best shave</li>
            <li> Husband says this is the best ever.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;You took the time to write a review about a shaving cream?&amp;#34; Yeah I did, because this stuff is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> Very good indeed, but Proraso Sandalwood is the best in my opinion.</li>
            <li> (Smell is very pleasant.)  </li>
            <li> They both are very good cremes.</li>
            <li> Very good shave cream.</li>
            <li> and this one is very good.</li>
            <li> Very good.</li>
            <li> was the best shave I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> was the best shave I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> Incredible stuff.</li>
            <li> Positives -&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my face incredibly smooth&lt;br /&gt;Lets</li>
            <li> I am already impressed by how great this shaving cream is, if you can even call it that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Follow the instructions on the bottle to get the BEST experience - if you just slap it on and shave you&#x27;ll get good shave but not the best experience.</li>
            <li> Cremo did eventually reply to me,  and very kindly sent me at no charge both some replacement Cremo and their skin conditioner product (which is excellent).</li>
            <li> Cremo smells great and softens whiskers for a very pleasant shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> Great Shaving Cream, Very good Lubrication .</li>
            <li> In my 68 years, I have always prided myself in good grooming and especially a great shave.</li>
            <li> I like good shaving creams and soaps and this is one of the best.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful stuff indeed.....</li>
            <li> good value for the money and a great shave!</li>
            <li> Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Honestly, the best shave cream you&#x27;re going to get for the money.</li>
            <li> Great shave every time.</li>
            <li> Gives me a great shave.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  </li>
            <li> I get a great close shave</li>

            <li> Great shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Great to take when you travel.</li>
            <li> however I have been in a hurry and rushed it but still had great results.</li>
            <li> A great shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> Not as great as Chuck Woolery would have you believe in his TV/Radio pitches.</li>
            <li> Great ingredients that makes up this product too.</li>
            <li> Works great, will not use anything else now.</li>
            <li> However, it is great stuff.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  </li>
            <li> great either.</li>
            <li> and you will be amazed at the great shave you get.</li>
            <li> A great combination.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll probably be great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly great shave</li>
            <li> but I heard some really great things about Cremo cream.</li>
            <li> and it works great in both locations.  </li>
            <li> Great shave cream.</li>
            <li> It shaves well, and the smell is great.</li>
            <li> but I am happy to have my search stop here.</li>
            <li> I was using a shave gel everyone swore by and got great reviews on amazon</li>
            <li> Really great product.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shave cream.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> It smells great and worked as described.</li>
            <li> I think this product is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about 5 month now and have noting but great things to say.</li>
            <li> and you will get a great shave.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any online fancy shaving creams but this one is great</li>
            <li> So I bought this based on all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> When I saw that it got great reviews</li>
            <li> I get a great shave every time with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> This, along with a nice blade, has produced the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kiehl&#x27;s &amp;#34;Close Shavers&amp;#34; Shaving Cream for about 15 years and was quite happy.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a great shave until I tried Cremo Cream.</li>
            <li> and I can run a rusty blade over my face with a great shave everytime.</li>
            <li> Great going guys.</li>
            <li> He is happy and shaving is not causing him pain anymore.</li>
            <li> It was a great &amp;#34;find&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy to have found this great product.</li>
            <li> Since I started using it about a month ago--along with my great blades, I have had no nicks, cuts, or scraps.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I just started using it with a safety razor and it works great.  </li>
            <li> 3 great things about this stuff...</li>
            <li> This worked great with my Mach 3 blades.</li>
            <li> this is awesome stuff all on its own</li>
            <li> Great product,</li>
            <li> it works great.  </li>
            <li> The smell is great but doesn&#x27;t linger so</li>
            <li> This is a great product for a great price</li>
            <li> shave soaps and brushes, so I was happy to try another.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never tried cream from a tube before but this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li> and he seems happy.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love!!</li>
            <li> It is certainly much better than a can of Edge or Barbasol!!  </li>
            <li> It also has a very nice smell which I have come to appreciate.</li>
            <li> It also has a very nice smell which I have come to appreciate.</li>
            <li> This has very nice after-smell and feeling.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll get a very nice shave.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it smells pleasant.</li>
            <li> This is a very good and cost effective product that deserves a place in your shaving kit.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  </li>
            <li> Amazing stuff here!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Great product, good smell.</li>
            <li> I get a remarkably closer shave with this cream than with a grocery store cream or gel.</li>
            <li> I dropped a star just because there isnt anything remarkable about the product.</li>
            <li> Unlike others, I found the smell pleasant.</li>
            <li> The smell is a very pleasant fruity, a very unique scent.  </li>
            <li> Best is still Dr. Carver&#x27;s Easy Shave Butter from Dollar Shave Club.</li>
            <li> This is easily the best shaving cr&amp;egrave;me I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Stuff was awesome and my razor glided so easily</li>
            <li> The best I was able to achieve was a kind of film, like lotion.</li>
            <li> It also smells really good, almost citrus smelling.</li>
            <li> Smells good too.</li>
            <li> it had good reviews</li>
            <li> I loved.</li>
            <li> Why pay for good cologne, and then use scented:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Clogs up between your blades and does not leave your skin in as good a condition as it claims.</li>
            <li> Even with a cheap razor, this is still the best shave cream I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Adding water at the end for touch ups is all you need for a good shave with a blade.  </li>
            <li> Now, I get good shaves this way,</li>
            <li> If you overuse, the shave is not as good.</li>
            <li> A truly superior product.</li>
            <li> I got a really good lather.  </li>
            <li> Felt good on the skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think Creamo Cream is a good buy.  </li>
            <li> Good for making uber lather.</li>
            <li> It smells really good, but not like perfume.</li>
            <li> I needed to use a fair amount of it</li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cremo Astonishingly Superior Shave Cream 6 oz&lt;</li>
            <li> He said that he loved the smell and that it gave a good lather.</li>
            <li> I gave it a fair tryout, used it for a week, followed directions and ended up tossing it in the trash.</li>
            <li> But compared to shaving cream, Cremo is absolutely superior.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m adding another star because I feel like being fair to the product.</li>
            <li> It really is a good product, I just wish it was easier to find.</li>
            <li> ASTONISHINGLY SUPERIOR SHAVE CREAM&lt;</li>
            <li> I know it is good</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> This a superior shave cream.</li>
            <li> and youre good to go.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a superior shave to what I&#x27;m used to yet, however the level of irritation has all but disappeared.</li>
            <li> Good quality</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t protect from razor burn like a good lather from shave soap.</li>
            <li> I bought the product after reading all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t find the Cremo a good shaving solution</li>
            <li> So here it is, I have my badger brush, Cremeo, and my good razor in the shower.  </li>
            <li> you have a tendency to get acne or breakouts when your pores get clogged, I have some good news for you:</li>
            <li> , I have some good news for you:</li>
            <li> It is simply good.</li>
            <li> Astonishingly superior?</li>
            <li> Good stuff, it works.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It puts a milky soapy film that smells good ...on your face</li>
            <li> Good price</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how good this works.</li>
            <li> I am using this to shave my legs and it is a good shave cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good shaving creme.</li>
            <li> Good investment in your skin.</li>
            <li> and I will say this is truly a superior shave cream.</li>
            <li> Even my wife loved it.</li>
            <li> Cremo is so good</li>
            <li> It felt sooo good to shave and afterwards to feel my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it smells good, works as advertised</li>
            <li> and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> Cremo Cream is one of the best shaving creams made, smells great, and makes the razor glide right over your skin without irritation.</li>
            <li> Best viewed in FULL SCREEN</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is not bad, but not the best either.</li>
            <li> All of them had excellent reviews and probably all would have been worthy of purchase, however I did not have a badger hair brush</li>
            <li> Super awesome shaving cream for when I shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aside from making shaving easier and more enjoyable, I am mostly impressed by the smoothness of my skin hours after shaving!</li>
            <li> the very first, I was impressed.</li>
            <li> If you are shaving just your face, either will work fine and, in all fairness, Proraso does smell incredible.</li>
            <li> The verdict for me is that the is a very satisfying shave cream</li>
            <li> The verdict for me is that the is a very satisfying shave cream</li>
            <li> I was told by a friend that this was what he was using, and he was very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a full-head shaver who has tried a great many products, and Cremo is hands-down the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have been very pleased with the performance of Cremo.</li>
            <li> gave this a try and very glad that I did.</li>
            <li> Very enjoyable aroma, too.  </li>
            <li> Because you&#x27;re massaging it into your skin, it really is best to shave right after a shower, when your face is softest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> still on the lookout for even better slickness or longerlasting slickness with shave soaps - but this is the best so far and best performer for comfort, slickness, and an effective shave.  </li>
            <li> I tried it and it was better than foaming can creams, but I still experienced shaving irritation after using it and I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the smell, it has hints of oranges in it and stuck with me all day.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and you will be able to enjoy the best qualities of the product.</li>
            <li> With this I am getting a better shave and saving 75% in the process!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Husbands favorite shave cream!</li>
            <li> â™¦ Works best if brush is primed with hot water then shaken down.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> With Cremo and a safety razor, you will have a better shave and save money too!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> The best part is I&#x27;m still using my first bottle(? container thingy)</li>
            <li> Love The Stuff!</li>
            <li> Cremo is a much better product!</li>
            <li> It does work best if, as directed, you get your face and neck as hot as you can stand, but who has the time for that?</li>
            <li> No nicks, no discomfort and beautifully close and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I did!</li>
            <li> The first shaving cream I ever tried, and still the best!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Get this as your basic/goto while you search for your perfect soap/creme or as your travel/quickie crÃ¨me (figuring you may not be able to travel or want to with your full brush+mug/bowl kit..</li>
            <li> Cremo is amazing.</li>
            <li> Also amazing is the amount that I need to use.  </li>
            <li> Results were amazing.</li>
            <li> The stuff is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great to transfer to one of those 3-ounce travel squeeze tubes also available from Wal-Mart, to put in your travel bag.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> for the evaluation of Cremo....  it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is amazing.</li>
            <li> still enjoy that aspect of shaving... but when on the run this stuff does a great job.</li>
            <li> Amazingly, I get almost zero irritation despite this combination giving me the closest shaves I have ever had in my life.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing...</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It lasts forever and really gives you the best shave for men and women.</li>
            <li> I bought a tube of this after hearing an enthusiastic radio advertisement for it.  </li>
            <li> Ive had better, almost prefer a good slippery foam.</li>
            <li> So I use warm sink water.</li>
            <li> Tomorrow I am going to try about a pea (the vegatable) size, and warm sink water.</li>
            <li> It makes a nice conditioner too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> but WONDERFUL, especially on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Smells nice like an Orange peel.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a nice side benefit</li>
            <li> My husband who is not a &amp;#34;foo-foo&amp;#34; kind of guy LOVES this shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It works very well, doesn&#x27;t require a lot, and smells great!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t relish the idea of mixing my own lather with a brush</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always have time to lather up with a brush, so Cremo provides me with a nice shave when I&#x27;m pressed for time.</li>
            <li> I got a nice shave from it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Creamo Cream has a nice citrus scent that isn&#x27;t over-powering.  </li>
            <li> I do not think this is some kind of miracle product, but I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve even whipped up my own for a safety razor I shave with.</li>
            <li> no matter what kind of cream or soap I used, my face wouldn&#x27;t allow a shave but every 5-6 days.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works great!  </li>
            <li> There probably are others that as good or even better.</li>
            <li> The absolute BEST shaving cream i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Has a nice citrus fragrance, razor just slides on the face, no nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Cremo about six times since receiving it and it does give a good shave though not any better than Barbasol.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely one of the best shaving creams I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own product.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent and functions well for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> Then whip up a nice lather by working your beard the brush, very quickly a nice lather will gather on your face.  </li>
            <li> Cremo does give you a really nice and close shave.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream at very affordable price</li>
            <li> each have their own purpose.</li>
            <li> This is ABSOLUTELY the best shave cream that I have ever used in my 70 years on this planet.  </li>
            <li> This one is spectacular.</li>
            <li> this is a really nice choice</li>
            <li> Nothing has given me as nice a shave as Cremo.</li>
            <li> It is a nice cream.</li>
            <li> and I must say this Cremo is astounding.</li>
            <li> The absolute best shaving cream there is.</li>
            <li> sure what is it about it that makes it so good, but it works.</li>
            <li> After being pretty sure I liked feather blades the best of them all, I decided to give Cremo another try before throwing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its great for shaving my lady bits,  no razor burn and smells really clean too</li>
            <li> Quickly adapted and really impressed by how close and smooth a shave is by using this product.</li>
            <li> A cool water rinse at the conclusion of the shave caps off a great shaving experience.....</li>
            <li> Good product, but it is the second best shaving cream I have used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells good, easy to carry/travel and use....great value.  </li>
            <li> Cremo leaves your skin very smooth while Proraso leaves it kind of tacky.</li>
            <li> It makes for a smooth and comfortable shave and the smell is wonderful with a very mild citrus influence.  </li>
            <li> - Price, High Quality product, Smells great, feels good during and after shave&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> The one I&#x27;ve found works best for me is Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking to Taylor of Old Bond Street as it works perfect and they have variety.</li>
            <li> This is the best shave cream I used thus far</li>
            <li> It seems to be in the range with the good quality vegan (tallow/animal free) products out there.</li>
            <li> It also does not stick around post-shave though so you will be able to fully use your own lotion/aftershave/cologne to go out smelling the way</li>
            <li> So far, Cremo has been the best I have found for this purpose.  </li>
            <li> I liked it better than king of shaves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found to be the most effective way to use it</li>
            <li> I use a double-bladed safety razor so having a good shaving cream is important to me.  </li>
            <li> This is far and away the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> This product is especially great for those with sensitive skin and acne (in my opinion) as I have both.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The most important thing about successful use of this product is to read the directions.</li>
            <li> On the head it does good - pretty good.</li>
            <li> The shave is noticeably more pleasant than I&#x27;m used to with cheap foams.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good for getting a close shave and for that reason I highly reccommend it over anything else you can get at a store.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m half-way through the tube, I am glad to have found it here because it is by far the best shaving product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I still enjoy using mug soap and a good brush, but this is outstanding for the smoothest shave.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my face smooth and cut free.</li>
            <li> Very nice to purchase an order that is made for my skin type at such a great price.</li>
            <li> I was able to work up a good lather with my brush,enough for 3 passes,no pulling from the Astra blades, smells good and the shave is absolutely unbelivable.</li>
            <li> this stuff is pretty great for me.  </li>
            <li> All the good things you have read about this product is true, and I will add one thing in addition to the close shave, ease of use, lack of cuts, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried the full tube of Cremo Cream I ordered to give it a fair trial and ended up regretting it.  </li>
            <li> My face was very smooth.</li>
            <li> Very light or non scented and a very smooth cream shave that is non drying.</li>
            <li> but it does still leave a light and pleasant smell that can be easily overpowered by your favorite cologne or aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> A smooth shave, a pleasant feeling afterward, a light scent</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cremo Shave Cream has a light, pleasant scent, and goes on so, so smooth.</li>
            <li> I always believed that the type of razor mattered most, and thus I always gravitated toward</li>
            <li> the latest and greatest Gillette had to offer, finally settling on their Fusion 5 blade razor.</li>
            <li> Hope you guys have better results.  </li>
            <li> I would gotten a better shave with Barbasol or Edge gel.</li>
            <li> Stop the presses; This is better than advertised.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an interesting product, probably more appropriate for a barbershop than for home use.</li>
            <li> I have never had such a great shaving results!</li>
            <li> Tried many shaving creams.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> but I feel the need to invest more in my scalp.</li>
            <li> Expect more like what you&#x27;d  experience with a skin conditioning cream or hand</li>
            <li> This stuff is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love the scent as well.</li>
            <li> Like the bottle says -- it works astonishingly well.  </li>
            <li> and it gives a nice smooth feel once you are finished.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the smoothest my legs have ever felt and the smell is sort of a light orange, its really nice.</li>
            <li> I like that it isn&#x27;t foamy like most of the canned shaving creams.  </li>
            <li> Okay, I tried it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is okay for my face, but I&#x27;d be hesitant to use it on my head.</li>
            <li> And I also love the scent.</li>
            <li> So I can see how the shower moisture/heat would help it work better in that environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (and organic, if possible) products the best.    </li>
            <li> So I can see how the shower moisture/heat would help it work better in that environment.    </li>
            <li> Carver&#x27;s Shave Butter\\&quot; more.    </li>
            <li> The results were astonishing.</li>
            <li> I went to Amazon to read reviews and saw that many people drew comparisons with Proraso</li>
            <li> /&gt;So which is better?</li>
            <li> For most people it shouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love this shaving &amp;#34;cream!&amp;#34; Follow the directions and you will get the closest shave ever.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t invest in anything more than a sample pack of blades and a Feather Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> was more irritated on the creamo side.</li>
            <li> Works better .</li>
            <li> Better than any canned product</li>
            <li> My blade glides even better then the luxury  cream.  </li>
            <li> Got this on sale at Walmart and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> Have tried many premium blends and brands costing 3-4 times as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently switched from Gillette blades to the Dollar Shave Club&#x27;s program with their &amp;#34;Executive&amp;#34; blades, and am very happy with the quality of shave that I&#x27;m getting.  </li>
            <li> and was satisfied with the shaving results and price paid to buy this,</li>
            <li> This is quite simply the BEST shave cream I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> A superior product worth three times the price.</li>
            <li> This product gives you the best shave possible with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> I use it with the Panasonic ES8243A Men&#x27;s 4-Blade Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver and have never had a better closer shave.</li>
            <li> , I get better results from a $2.00 can of Edge gel.  </li>
            <li> My husband and sons absolutely love Cremo.  </li>
            <li> More than once.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not getting any better.</li>
            <li> but this could have a more pleasing scent for others (this brand has a citrus/sweet smell</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different ways to shave my bear-like beard, and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need an aftershave or moisturizer (tried more than 15 of those too).</li>
            <li> All this despite spending lots of time and money on supposedly better tools and products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite brushless cream.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, the Kale Naturals had no reviews but it is a wonderfully smelling, all natural ingredients, smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li> The fusion stuff was okay for me.</li>
            <li> I loved the cooling sensation but it wasn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> somebody said they felt it was more aggressive than the EJ).  </li>
            <li> Until i find somethign better</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m going to make sure i have some of this around (or will always have some of this around anyway for those days</li>
            <li> Also because it doesn&#x27;t lather a lot, you have to use more than is indicated, and I would say I got about 30days from a tube max, nothing close to the 90 it claims.</li>
            <li> but now that I get the cream activated in my hands, then rub into my beard, it works fantastic!</li>
            <li> that much more</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many types of shave foams/creams/gels/oils over the years to control the irritation and still get a close shave.</li>
            <li> You do have to make sure to keep the product moist during the shave to maximize</li>
            <li> Better than aerosol shave products.</li>
            <li> I like soap and brush better.</li>
            <li> simply the best shaving cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I think most five star reviews are from people abandoning the rattle can shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt Cremo is better than that Gillette garbage.</li>
            <li> Currently my favorite is D.R. Harris shaving soap, I love the Marlborough scent, it can be purchased in a wood container.</li>
            <li> Works better than all those foamy things</li>
            <li> Cremo has it; so did Murad and Prorasso but, again, Murad is exponentially greater in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works better than you will believe.</li>
            <li> BTW - if you want to try something better, go to West Coast Shaving, click on creams and soaps and almost every product will be better than this one.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> You will love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The more water you water the creamer</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream on market especially for body shaving.</li>
            <li> And while it&#x27;s perfectly safe to leave on your face after shaving (it will condition your skin, according to the company)</li>
            <li> Some reviewers mention products that work better for them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different, luxurious and provides you with the best shave out there</li>
            <li> words on the front of the tube says it better than any reviewer could...</li>
            <li> and this is so much better.</li>
            <li> so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> more effectively)&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I found this stuff, works better than any can shave cream or gel.</li>
            <li> Just adding more soap did not seep to work</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Try and just Love it....</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s an ok product.</li>
            <li> I use this shaving cream on my legs, no cuts or razor burn, I love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> Cremo, in contrast, has more of a soapy, even lotion-like texture.</li>
            <li> Works a lot better than any of the many Gillette products I have used over the years.  </li>
            <li> It was here that I found this stuff in one of the boxes and am always on the look out for a better product.</li>
            <li> Phenomenal product.</li>
            <li> Spend your money on a better product.</li>
            <li> You have to wonder what&#x27;s going on when hundreds of people love a product a handful</li>
            <li> and I still love it.</li>
            <li> I had to wash both after applying Cremo in order to be able to hold on to the razor.  </li>
            <li> I might have been better off just shaving with water.</li>
            <li> Better than most</li>
            <li> Just make sure to follow directions.</li>
            <li> Too many ingredients including many I cannot even pronounce.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> When you really work this cream into your skin, you are not just prepping for a close shave, but you are also massaging the moisturizers into your skin, and this WILL greatly reduce irritation.</li>
            <li> My favorite.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> What I love about this is that it really forces you to massage your beard before shaving setting up a great shave.  </li>
            <li> It was the smoothest, most close and pain free shave ever!</li>
            <li> I ordered the men&#x27;s original, and I love the scent!</li>
            <li> I love that it is in an all plastic bottle, so no rust in the shower.</li>
            <li> maybe it works better for some people</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve read the directions closely and for me it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> still more product to go (shave 3 times a week)</li>
            <li> Not as Astonishing as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It was just ok.</li>
            <li> Decided to give it a try and love it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been impressed by this shave cream for the following  reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> Cremo is a noticably better lubricant for shaving.</li>
            <li> I have been using Remington&#x27;s Shave Gel and the King of Shave&#x27;s equivalent for many years now.</li>
            <li> The best shave I&#x27;ve possibly ever had.</li>
            <li> This product is okay.  </li>
            <li> (OKAY even that is not breaking the bank).</li>
            <li> I will admit - results were better using more than an &amp;#34;almond&amp;#34; size.</li>
            <li> costing 9 times more than economy grade)</li>
            <li> As I take very short showers now a days, this is the best shave crÃ¨me on the market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sold in many places which is convenient and everywhere</li>
            <li> I do wish it was more moisturizing</li>
            <li> I also get MUCH more mileage out of one container than they advertise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my favorite cream.</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, this stuff is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> Outstanding quickness in shipping and product packing.</li>
            <li> and I think I just found my favorite.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> This product works, but there are many better options.</li>
            <li> My Face is so much better.</li>
            <li> Give Cremo a try for a more comfortable, closer shave!</li>
            <li> and I should get many months out of this tube.</li>
            <li> altjhough not drying I need something a bit more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It is slippery, and not clunky at all, allowing for the best shave possible.</li>
            <li> Teflon for shaving - pretty amazing!</li>
            <li> Been shaving 35 yrs never had a better experience shaving while using Creamo.</li>
            <li> Read the top review - that&#x27;s basically what I&#x27;d like to say.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to deal with an aerosol</li>
            <li> I think it results on more cream on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried many; all have shortcomings.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but EOS works better .</li>
            <li> The more water you add during the shave the better.  </li>
            <li> The citrus/bergamot smell is awesome, the lather (when used as directed) is terrific, and the shave is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY shave</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest, face shaving isn&#x27;t very fun.</li>
            <li> Once the quantity is right, the shave is amazingly good.</li>
            <li> Very nice product; lives up to its claims of &amp;#34;use very little&amp;#34; and lots of glide.</li>
            <li> The C.O Bigelow had a rich (but not foamy) lather that covered nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good results with Headblade Headslick Mentholated Shave Cream (the best one I had previously tried), Proraso (not as smooth as headblade; smells a bit too strong), AHAVA shaving gel (nice smell,pricey, smooth but gunks up the blade).  </li>
            <li> The most surprising thing for me was that shaving with a gillette blade was a very smooth affair, it really glides through the bristle.</li>
            <li> good product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Hotter water to the face prior to application makes shaving easier and makes this product work best (and it is worth noting that water that is hotter works better than water that is just warm).</li>
            <li> It seems to leave no residue, is easy to squeeze just the right amount and has a more than fair price.  </li>
            <li> Dispensing is also very clean as the cream comes out in a toothpaste consistency.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is great - not thick at all but not watery either.</li>
            <li> The price is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I also cut my chin pretty good, and I haven&#x27;t cut myself shaving in years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s that I get from Target for over a year and its pretty good but too pricey.</li>
            <li> Sure the guys who buy Barbasol and are now getting the free tube with the rebate love it, because they&#x27;ve tried nothing else, and it is better than aerosol shave cream.  </li>
            <li> On the first use of Cremo, I loved everything about the stuff: the smell, the close shave, the compactness of the tube</li>
            <li> was certainly cheap, smelled ok, but did not give me a close or very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> but since I shave while showering, this is fine because this gave me a very smooth close shave without irritated skin or cut skin.  </li>
            <li> shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This started a new search that has ended happily with the Cremo Shave Cream.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, perfect for sensitive skin, washes off actually cleanly.</li>
            <li> I still say it is the best shave gel and the only thing I would use if Cremo weren&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li> Smooth and provides for the best possible shave.</li>
            <li> Closest, most comfortable, and most effortless</li>
            <li> This stuff is great...lasts a long-time, and gives a nice, smooth rash free shave.  </li>
            <li> Good product, good price, VERY FAST and reasonable shipping.</li>
            <li> this is my husband&#x27;s new favorite!!</li>
            <li> I guess sometimes high tech just doesn&#x27;t cut it when it comes to things that have been successfully done another way for 100+ years.</li>
            <li> The answer is Cremo for one very good and very specific reason.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, if you like this stuff, your local WallWorld carries it for $5.97 which is a very good deal considering</li>
            <li> In the search for the perfect shave I have spent north of $25 for 6 oz.</li>
            <li> I have recently started using a DE Safety razor and been very pleased with the superior shave.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who has sensitive skin or someone who is looking for a close and great shave.  </li>
            <li> This is the best shave cream I ever used in over 60 years of wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I use Cremo with Dorco Pace 6+1 razors, but I get good performance without chafing even when I use a cheap Gillette Good News or drug store generic disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to get this shave cream at Wal-Mart in this area, so I decided too shave with it this morning, the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> The aerosol creams are just a stopgap if nothing better is available.  </li>
            <li> Even so, Cremo gives me the closest most comfortable shave ever...period.</li>
            <li> My husband has sensitive skin and this shave cream works great for him.</li>
            <li> Cremo is a good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Rinsing off the cream was very easy and fast, and my skin felt very smooth to the touch and refreshing.</li>
            <li> No irritation at all after shaving, even in those places that are easy to irritate&lt;br /&gt;7 - Works great for those with acne issues, doesn&#x27;t burn when you use in on irritated sensitive</li>
            <li> Out of other cream i find this being the best as i like the smell, the consistence of the cream and the feeling once you are shaved.</li>
            <li> The directions may work for you like the other reviewers, but in my experience, it works best with a brush.  </li>
            <li> This cream smells much better and has a more user-friendly consistently, but I don&#x27;t think it is better than King of Shaves in terms of skin protection.  </li>
            <li> If you have ever enjoyed drinking these teas, then you are familiar with the smell of Cremo Cream.</li>
            <li> Outstanding shave and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> The full title of this product is spot on!</li>
            <li> This rinses easily, so</li>
            <li> but it tends to wear off  easy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an easy switch, and I&#x27;ve grown to prefer it</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t shave your head you can easily adapt it to your needs.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not all that easy to find and costs a fortune.</li>
            <li> It glides on so easy</li>
            <li> Easily the nicest shaving cream that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love this product and started a subscribe and save subscription we liked the quality and price so much.</li>
            <li> The Cremo scent is of the citrus variety and washes away easily.</li>
            <li> EASILY</li>
            <li> â™¦ Easily applied with a brush.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slippery and cleans up easily.  </li>
            <li> It does just what it&#x27;s supposed to: deliver a smooth, safe, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, I reach for the cremo when I want an easy brushless shave.</li>
            <li> I have skin that easily becomes irritated from shaving and this Cremo dramatically reduces irritation.</li>
            <li> Of course, good razor etiquette is still important, but this stuff makes it that much easier to shave.</li>
            <li> The razor glides very quickly.</li>
            <li> Awesome product - you only use about an almond&#x27;s worth of product, and it doesn&#x27;t bubble a lot.</li>
            <li> have a strong scent</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is nice and when paired with my personna razor blades, my DE razor performed very, very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I now know that creams and razors matter and only wish that I had considered these great products years earlier.very smooth to the touch and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I added warm water and shaved those areas I missed the first time again.</li>
            <li> My first reaction was shock, honest to goodness.</li>
            <li> I used a new cartridge for my razor to insure the best performance from this new setup</li>
            <li> After 27 years of trying literally everything in the book, hands down this is the best.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best shaving cream that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> They say that it makes shaving so easy and pleasant and leaves their skin soft.  </li>
            <li> great product, using water as hot as you can take it before application really makes the product shine.</li>
            <li> I apply my dime sized amount with a brush and find that it lathers just fine for me.  </li>
            <li> There is no comparison between it and the soapy fresh smell of Cremo which is also pretty damn good</li>
            <li> this has a slight citrusy scent and it wont be the best one out there.  </li>
            <li> The Cremo would work fine as an every-day shave cream  for me.</li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t shave as close or smoothly as a fine lather.</li>
            <li> If you are a cartridge shaver, I suppose this is fine, although you could also use whatever soap or body wash and get away with it just fine.  </li>
            <li> I heard about this fine product on the Dr. Savage radio program.</li>
            <li> For the best shave possible that works for me is hot water, Creamo Cream and</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well with a brush (neither badger fine nor synthetic), but it&#x27;s okay for a quick shave every now and then.</li>
            <li> Cremo does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> use a brush to apply shaving soap and find CREMO to work just fine:  </li>
            <li> I have tested many other shave creams, most more expensive, and think this one of the best, perhaps the best.</li>
            <li> This product works best after the foam is washed away a little, but with Dr. Carver&#x27;s, the cream starts out that way.</li>
            <li> (Very happy with the Perfecto Pure Badger Shaving Brush that currently costs about $12.)  </li>
            <li> after a good shave, my skin felt as smooth and as soft as ever before.</li>
            <li> The Cremo Cream lathered nicely on my skin, almost invisible but not so much that I couldn&#x27;t tell it was on.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It is really comfortable with no burn or nicks.  </li>
            <li> My goodness it is 4 hrs since I shaved and my face is silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This one is as smooth as it gets.</li>
            <li> I used Aveeno Positively Smooth Shave Gel exclusively for years.</li>
            <li> The package claims that it creates a light lather.</li>
            <li> Does not gum up the drains and makes for easy clean up when shave is finished.  </li>
            <li> I do Like the light scent</li>
            <li> Oh so smooth.</li>
            <li> Smooth and no razor burn.</li>
            <li> I could not also believe that it was actually the closest shave I ever experienced (</li>
            <li> Enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> I have to optimize all the variables in my shave to get a comfortable BBS shave.</li>
            <li> although not quite up to the level I get with the majority of tallow based soap/cream products available.</li>
            <li> It will reduce or illuminate nicks and cuts and the razor glides smoothly on the skin.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic .</li>
            <li> Makes shaving a lot easier and it keeps the shaved area smooth.</li>
            <li> Comes in handy if I&#x27;m in a real hurry.</li>
            <li> To say Cremo Cream gives you a smooth shave is an understatement.</li>
            <li> Every morning was filled with in-grown hairs, nicks and lots of irritation.</li>
            <li> Not the best for heavy beards.</li>
            <li> (so it&#x27;s locally available) and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Close comfortable shaves are now the norm.</li>
            <li> The difference primarily comes in the creams themselves.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;It&#x27;s so smooth and hydrating.</li>
            <li> This is also available at CVS pharmacy in you run</li>
            <li> Thank goodness it was free.  </li>
            <li> Smooth shave with one stroke.</li>
            <li> It smells great, plus I can shave both my legs with only a quarter-sized amount and a glass of water to rinse.</li>
            <li> The light level of lather allows my razor to cover a lot of area before I have to rinse it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better than shaving cream or soap, soothes my face for a nice smooth shave, leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it was more manly or fresh smelling.</li>
            <li> smooth results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if that wasn&#x27;t available or if they changed the formula, I would switch to this product.</li>
            <li> Smooth as a baby&#x27;s backside without razor burn or irritation.</li>
            <li> followed the IMPORTANT directions, no lather.</li>
            <li> I shave my entire head and cremo is great for it.</li>
            <li> I had used Cremeo a few times when the idea came to me, and I blended the very best of both worlds.  </li>
            <li> A close comfortable shave, and convenience.  </li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t grow much facial hair, and to some it may appear as none at all, this stuff still works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great addition to your daily routine!</li>
            <li> Smoooooooth shave, smells great, and I only have to go over my skin one time.</li>
            <li> It is astonishingly smooth.</li>
            <li> The cheap 99 cent conditioner works just as well as Cremo does for my beard.  </li>
            <li> It gives you a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> the cheap Wal-Mart purchased creams.</li>
            <li> I was immediately hooked on the smooth shave I got.  </li>
            <li> Use it daily, great shave product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s readily available.</li>
            <li> Considering how cheap this stuff is, you&#x27;ll be amazed how well it works.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Both are great and work equally well with my Gillette Fusion razor.</li>
            <li> The cream has a light, citrusy scent.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaving cream because it was cheap.</li>
            <li> and I get a fantastic shave.  </li>
            <li> Smooth as can be-blade or electric razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was BLOWN away at how smooth my face was during and after shaving.</li>
            <li> But it makes the razor glide smoothly</li>
            <li> Shaving too is not as smooth as I&#x27;d like, I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I was surprised on how good this was.</li>
            <li> The results so far have been good.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and bought this based on the &amp;#34;Astonishingly&amp;#34; high claims and very good reviews.</li>
            <li> so far so good works</li>
            <li> I liked the eucalyptus scent, though it was not as nice if you happened to get it in your mouth, and it left a tingly sensation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: If you want to pay five dollars more, Harry&#x27;s Foaming Shave Gel is better than both and is pressurized making it much easier to work with.  </li>
            <li> Because you rub the cream directly on the beard, it provides for a superior glide.</li>
            <li> yes i followed directions, this is probably good for a man with soft baby hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I don&#x27;t shave daily, I can say that my first tube has lasted me probably around five months now, and is still going strong, which is incredible.</li>
            <li> The squeeze tube that Cremo comes in is very easy to keep clean and it does not ooze out after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are interested, I used this cream with a Gillette Fusion 5 blade</li>
            <li> The squeeze tube that Cremo comes in is very easy to keep clean and it does not ooze out after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are interested, I used this cream with a Gillette Fusion 5 blade</li>
            <li> /&gt;I ended up trying The Art of Shaving Shave Cream (good lubricated shave, smells good, but comes in a ridiculously small tube 2.5 oz for a hefty price of $16) and settled on Kale Naturals Smooth Shave Cream.</li>
            <li> It does not seem like an adequate layer of soap if you are used to a shaving lather, but this cream is such an excellent lubricant that it works far better than lather.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s kind of fun to put on.</li>
            <li> This one had high reviews, so I figured &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34; I am thrilled I gave it a chance as it is literally everything they advertise.</li>
            <li> I apply Cremo twice per shave,  the first time so that I can shave with the grain, then I apply it once more and shave against the grain.</li>
            <li> Reduced cuts and bumps significantly.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t believe I am actually excited about a shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The cream doesn&#x27;t foam up and instead stays in its original form.</li>
            <li> definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this will be my cream.  </li>
            <li> The Cremo too had a nice lather and a pleasant, more subtle scent.</li>
            <li> Then I splash on more hot water and work up a bit of lather.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a unique scent that takes some getting used to, but even at that it&#x27;s not overpowering or offensive in my view, and</li>
            <li> I did this because in part my original review was based on the fact that I repeatedly tried to contact Cremo and was never replied to.  </li>
            <li> I thought I needed to use more, but it was actually more than enough - extremely smooth shave and no irritation after 3 weeks or so of use!</li>
            <li> totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> Product works exactly as promised (probably even better)</li>
            <li> Creamo is unique.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling great all day long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Crucially, the smell is the right mix of pleasant and masculine.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to, but has a nice orange smell and does a good job.</li>
            <li> has a clean scent</li>
            <li> I  shave q 3 days because this stuff allows that goodovva clean shave.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes shaving so easy and fun.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 5 star rating earlier, but I wanted to test it with a cheap disposable razor, instead of my good razor.</li>
            <li> Super comfortable shaves.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a quick Baby Butt Smooth shave without all the hassle of soaking a brush and building a mug soap</li>
            <li> I found the citrusy scent to be pleasant enough</li>
            <li> so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it takes surprisingly little to achieve very good results since the shaving cream is so concentrated.</li>
            <li> Scent I would describe as a slightly sweet grapefruit or &amp;#34;grapefruit n cream&amp;#34; which was pleasant enough.</li>
            <li> Based on their profiles and promotional information, they seem to think they&#x27;re special to have started a business.  </li>
            <li> For my face it did nothing special.</li>
            <li> It lubricates my skin exceptionally well and permits my razor to glide smoothly allowing an extra close shave.</li>
            <li> It is certainly better than the high dollar soaps that require a brush and is much better than the higher end</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin or just want a very pleasant shaving experience look no further.</li>
            <li> This cream works great and lasts a lot longer than expected.</li>
            <li> I use a standard Gillette razor and wanted a shave cream that smelled as good, gave as close, smooth shave, and was reasonably economical.</li>
            <li> husband is pretty basic when it comes to grooming products but he has had no qualms about switching to this great product.</li>
            <li> I apply if with a brush, on my wet face and its great.</li>
            <li> I have tried a great many shave cream / soap / gels over the past 40+</li>
            <li> One more thing I really appreciate about this is the tube it comes in.</li>
            <li> One more thing I really appreciate about this is the tube it comes in.</li>
            <li> I do think I have found the creme that I am going to combine with KMF Cool Mint just for a change-up.</li>
            <li> My razor blades last longer too because this stuff softens my gruff beard that good.</li>
            <li> Besides, Cremo had a rebate to cover the full purchase price so why not try it.</li>
            <li> In the beginning I just used this product because it had a full refund rebate.</li>
            <li> But, in fact, this is an insanely good product that actually delivers.</li>
            <li> have to admit that I felt all three provided a nice smooth shave, I can&#x27;t say that I noticed anything different about the end result of my shave in terms of closeness or smooth skin.</li>
            <li> This product is so good that I will NEVER go back to shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Good old cheapo Williams is a far better product.  </li>
            <li> He no longer has razor burn or razor bumps, and is definitely enjoying the straight razor experience.</li>
            <li> Try it now and you really will love it.</li>
            <li> His face looks so good that the fellas at work have even asked what he is doing differently</li>
            <li> I really thought it would end up in the trash with most of the ones making these claims.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s the only good thing I can say.</li>
            <li> It was watery and runny, and yet full of bubbles.  </li>
            <li> Give me the tried and true shave cream for $1.99 that works.</li>
            <li> It really does lubricate and protect (from razor burn) skin much better than even premium canned gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before using a brush I enjoyed shaving in the shower to expedite my morning routine, and since moving to a real shave I missed the convenience.  </li>
            <li> believe that anyone who is not getting a superior result with Creamo must not be following the directions correctly.  </li>
            <li> I rated it &#x27;OK&#x27; though because really, have you ever run out of shaving cream and used some conditioner instead?  </li>
            <li> absolute garbage a bar of soap would do better.</li>
            <li> a good while as I use about the same amount of product as you&#x27;d put on a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all; but, not &amp;#34;Astonishingly&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> â™¦ No bad nor lingering smell.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Since the tube said that &amp;#34;most can comfortably shave against the grain&amp;#34;, I tried it that way right out of the gate.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as Edge or the Gels - pretty economical and smells good - does not protect very well and not very slippery.</li>
            <li> Comes in a plastic container with no metal parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Best yet - Gentleman&#x27;s Hangar Genuine Old School Natural Shaving Cream for Sensitive Skin sold here.</li>
            <li> this product does not irritate my sensitive skin, that says a whole lot about how good this Cremo really is, and I feel that indicates for most people this product will prevent irritation.</li>
            <li> this product does not irritate my sensitive skin, that says a whole lot about how good this Cremo really is, and I feel that indicates for most people this product will prevent irritation.</li>
            <li> also shaved my boyfriend&#x27;s face for him the other day, of course using Cremo, and although his facial hair was slightly longer than is best for shaving, it went great and his skin was very smooth</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff is the best.  </li>
            <li> To me this is a top soap for travel, I&#x27;m more of a traditional way shave guy and prefer to use a brush and lather up soap.</li>
            <li> The grit disappears quickly too.</li>
            <li> Because the cream and grit disappear quickly, you&#x27;ll need to switch your mindset from knowing where to shave by where there&#x27;s still foam to knowing where to shave by where there&#x27;s still stubble.</li>
            <li> The result is a burn and knick free shave that allows you to reactivate selected areas by simply rubbing again with a bit of warm water.  </li>
            <li> They claim to just being super slippery -- but it seemed like it must have softened my whiskers.  </li>
            <li> But when reactivated with water, it is super slippery</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, like most people, when it says it is the best shave cream you will ever buy, and at $6-$7 a bottle, you would hope so.</li>
            <li> I quickly began dreading shaving often while using that stuff as I would often cut myself despite using a 5 blade razor.  </li>
            <li> I was able to overlap the same spot more than once without complaining as I did before.  </li>
            <li> It allows me to get an even closer shave, not to mention it&#x27;s cheaper and more available in brick and mortar stores near me.</li>
            <li> had the smoothest/best shave yet with this crÃ¨me while in the shower - and tha&#x27;ts with super torn up/sensitive/healing skin happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i need to quickly shave but still want to be safe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me recap that really quick in the paragraph below...</li>
            <li> Vendor was quick on the shipping..</li>
            <li> I was coming from Shave Secret, which gives a really good shave, and is superior to this product (except in scent, Cremo blows it away.)</li>
            <li> When my old favorite Gel Gillette was no longer made, I had to start a search for shave cream / gel that would be comfortable for shaving my head in the shower.  </li>
            <li> After a quick check of reviews on amazon</li>
            <li> I would be on my third can of Nivea Shave Gel by now, so even though Cremo costs more per unit, its cheaper to use than my favorite drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been upgrading my shave kit with a better razor and better cream and aftershave, and this has become an essential part of my shaving routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much better than traditional style shaving cream and better than shaving soap; works well in the shower too.  </li>
            <li> I shave against the grain and always get a super shave.</li>
            <li> Will Not Get super foam ...&lt;</li>
            <li> Luckily for me, when I ran out of that stuff, the store I was at did not stock it, so I turned to the men&#x27;s shaving aisle and found Cremo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I can get a quick quality shave with a DE safety razor without any skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Gave me a very close, smooth, comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no foam to speak of, and that takes some getting used to, but the results are extraordinary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many shave creams and soaps ranging from high end stuff like Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat and Tabac to Godrej, Palmolive and Proraso.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is just the nature of a cream vs a soap, but in my experience, this wasn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li> He says it feels amazing on sensitive skin and really promotes a smooth (and painfree) shave.</li>
            <li> Let me start by admitting that I have not tried very many different shaving creams in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for other brands,not nearly as effective as this.</li>
            <li> First the results are fantastic if you are coming from a \\&quot;can\\&quot; of shave creme.</li>
            <li> I fill the sink with very hot water</li>
            <li> It really is better than the normal canned shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I tried this the first time because I had a coupon for a free tube.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I cut myself more using this stuff than any other product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like Earl Grey tea to me, it just smells like a bright, citrusy smell.</li>
            <li> hundreds of glowing reviews here show that this is a very consistent product.</li>
            <li> hundreds of glowing reviews here show that this is a very consistent product.</li>
            <li> In case nobody has noticed, the first tube is free with a mail-in rebate (up to $8.00, not including sales tax), but well-worth the price.  </li>
            <li> but it lasts perhaps 1/5th as long and isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li> Really good sharing cream; lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> So far I am pleased with this as it seems like good stuff, especially if you follow the directions for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> â™¦ Easy to use, comes in a large tube.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Scents and foam and lather are great, but in the end it comes down to how a shaving crÃ¨me/soap COMES OFF your face, not how it goes</li>
            <li> Such a nice lather and clean rinse</li>
            <li> I do recommend adding a good amount of water, because once the cream is added to your head it does dry quickly.</li>
            <li> The price point on Cremo was much more attractive than the soaps and only a few dollars more than the gels I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> forget the trendy overhyped scents that are overwhelmingly strong that mask rather than smell genuinely clean, if you want something that does a good job and is not that expensive</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised--great skin protection when shaving, use only an &amp;#34;almond&amp;#34; size portion, lather it in, and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li> Soaping up your face and shaving is better then the old foams!</li>
            <li> I use both straight razors and double edged (&amp;#34;safety&amp;#34;) razors and this cream works great with both.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;cream\\&quot; instead of a foam soap makes so much more sense for sensitive skin!   </li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product - a whole new shave.</li>
            <li> going back to every man jack products as they were super effective and cheaper than this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love whipping up a nice thick lather with a hot brush, and then working the lather into my beard before executing a perfectly smooth comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> You have to use so little that it seems it lasts forever too which makes it a great value.</li>
            <li> Works great with little water which is what everyone here in California needs.</li>
            <li> Cremos notable trait is it does seem to lather up easily and to a fairly large amount in comparison to many other brands.</li>
            <li> This product works very well to facilitate a close, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bizarre product, because you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> The cream gave a real close smooth shave.</li>
            <li> used it with DE shavers and Straight Edge, and with both i didnt get nicked and i got a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get much else better to lubricate shaving and leaving your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> If you just slap it on without water you are missing a great shave.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, been using it for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> This shave cream is a nice alternative to the regular canned shave creams.  </li>
            <li> rarely bleed when using this</li>
            <li> I rarely use a lotion afterwards</li>
            <li> know the Shave Butter has a slightly (natural) citrusy smell, but I think it works/feels better for me.</li>
            <li> I know the Shave Butter has a slightly (natural) citrusy smell, but I think it works/feels better for me.</li>
            <li> Once you find what amount works for you, it&#x27;s worth using when you&#x27;re in a rush.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the difference when you use this product vs the regular aerosol kind.</li>
            <li> I aslo noticed that they offered a full rebate on your first bottle.  </li>
            <li> I rarely write a review but thought this product warranted one.</li>
            <li> Oh well, it was worth a try, but again, I will not buy.</li>
            <li> Not only did I not cut myself, but I was actually able to enjoy shaving without any irritation or pain.</li>
            <li> So far, it has done better than all the soaps</li>
            <li> Topping it off, I can get a good, close shave with zero blade drag and zero irritation.</li>
            <li> While I like my Shave Secret oil, I am quite impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for years now and nothing beats good ol&#x27; Proraso or Speick shaving cream in a metal tube.</li>
            <li> but we&#x27;ll worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> While shaving my head, it requires application of a considerable amount more than your face.</li>
            <li> , MOST COMFORTABLE LONGEST LASTING SHAVE&lt;br /&gt;LEAVES</li>
            <li> the month that he&#x27;s been using the cream, not only is he nick and burn free, his shaves are closer and his complexion more even.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of shaving creams and lotions and this one is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> This is well worth a try.</li>
            <li> I swipe the brush under warm water and reapply for a second pass.</li>
            <li> Between my double-blade razor and this stuff, I&#x27;ll probably spend 10% of what I did just three years ago, and am getting a far better shave to</li>
            <li> so I went back to the basics, a nice quality</li>
            <li> To start, let the warm shower moisten your brush for a minute, just enough to get it saturated with water.  </li>
            <li> Came to Amazon to read the reviews, laugh at the 2 star rating and move on with my life...</li>
            <li> you will be golden.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have a personal preference for Neutrogena Shave Cream for men</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> â€¦ itâ€™s definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li> â€¦ itâ€™s definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s like a tradeoff between closeness (this stuff wins) and risk factor.</li>
            <li> I am a 23 year old woman, and I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t nicked myself once since using this, and the tiny dot I use for each armpit has effectively eliminated razor burn in that area as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It smells refreshing yet still masculine.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price and the tube is easier to transport than those shave cream dispenser bottles.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh citrus scent which I like but some may not.  </li>
            <li> well worth the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is useful as a quick, good shaving cream when theres not time to sit and do the whole process for a true lather up wet shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with Cremo now for a couple months and it is, hands down, the best I&#x27;ve ever used, better even than Trader Joe&#x27;s Cream Shave, which had previously topped my list.</li>
            <li> Thick and rich, by far the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I had a week&#x27;s worth of beard and this allowed the razor to slide right through it.</li>
            <li> It works exactly 0% better than most any other product you might use.</li>
            <li> Cremo is a white shave cream that has a slight pleasant scent that I can quite identify but it smells nice and isnâ€™t overpowering and fades after a bit.  </li>
            <li> Coming in a large 8oz tube that lasts a long time, a \\&quot;luxury\\&quot; shave cream for $24 is actually a good deal.</li>
            <li> Look to other products for a superior shave.</li>
            <li> ; so I know I did it right.</li>
            <li> They are right-</li>
            <li> Right now, I am using the Cremo Cream.</li>
            <li> WEll they were right and</li>
            <li> A good shaving cream that remains slick and provides a relatively smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> It has a subtle, very nice light citrus/orange fragrance.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no fluffy residue to clog up the razor and it rinses clean!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than Proraso and even my previous favorite, Harry&#x27;s shave cream and comes in at an attractive price point, although more expensive than some cheaper brands, but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that the cream is very dense, but that does not in fact lead to a closer shave.</li>
            <li> While skin is unique in a sense that not all products may work equally-well for different people, these reviews show that Cremo gives outstanding results on many different skin types and sensitivities.</li>
            <li> While skin is unique in a sense that not all products may work equally-well for different people, these reviews show that Cremo gives outstanding results on many different skin types and sensitivities.</li>
            <li> I tried some on top of &amp;#34;shave secret&amp;#34; oil and it was even a little better still, but still not going to buy again.</li>
            <li> Once applied to your face you can add a little more water and rub to create yet more lather.  </li>
            <li> That means use it right out of a hot shower, or else</li>
            <li> I now know that creams and razors matter and only wish that I had considered these great products years earlier.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to find something that would provide him with a good product to use on his teenage sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but I feel the Cremo advantage is that the cream more easily washes off the razor slots (I use Gillette Sensitive cartridges and use the vibration feature), leaving the razor clean and ready for the next shaving pass.  </li>
            <li> Having used Kiehl&#x27;s shaving products for years I have to say that this gives a shave that is every bit as good for a heck of a lot less money.</li>
            <li> It has a unusual consistency, but it gives a really close shave and leaves your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> It dries out super fast.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised the difference it made in getting a close comfortable shave and the way my skin felt afterwards.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t require much in order for me to make a 3 pass shave and that it keeps your skin nice and slick when more water is applied.</li>
            <li> I mean it this is seriously better than Art of Shaving the women shave cream is also amazing for ladies legs</li>
            <li> The first time I tried shaving with this new cream, with my Gillette Proglide Power razor, I was amazed at the smooth, nick-free, close shave I got.</li>
            <li> On my first attempt, I used an ASTRA super stainless blade.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Looks like 1940&#x27;s packaging, but it&#x27;s a very modern preparation.  </li>
            <li> I fill the sink with hot water prior to a shower, put the whole tube in to let it heat up, and have a nice hot shave after the shower, dipping the razor in the water between strokes.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, one the greatest shaving creams I have found - I use it daily and it doesn&#x27;t leave any scents or dry skin.  </li>
            <li> then aftershave works just fine to cover that up as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smell is a little chemically, but it works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> Cremo is a decent cream that is much better than the glob of foam or gel from an aerosol can, but it does not stand up to soaps like Proraso, Woolfat or Taylor of Old Bond.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to a tee, choosing the hot water with a cloth option since I do not like to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> WHAT TO EXPECT ON FIRST USE&lt;br</li>
            <li> WHAT TO EXPECT ON FIRST USE&lt;br /&gt;See</li>
            <li> This actually took me the most to get used to.</li>
            <li> Keep skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> One advantage is you can see where you are shaving much better than with traditional shaving creams.</li>
            <li> I shave before showering, and even soap &amp; hot water in the shower doesn&#x27;t get it out.  </li>
            <li> (Is that what the \\&quot;hot water\\&quot; was for in the directions)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only not as refreshing smelling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As many of the reviewers have said, it does not lather like a traditional shaving soap or cream.  </li>
            <li> It creates a slick surface and provides excellent protection, especially against DE blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find it any different than most shaving creams.</li>
            <li> Soak the area you are going to shave in hot water before you start, it does make the shave even closer</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually not any more expensive!nd when you compare 1-1</li>
            <li> I am willing to admit it - I purchased this &amp;#34;superior shave cream&amp;#34; because I wanted a shave cream that didn&#x27;t come in a can that would leave marks on the shower tub.</li>
            <li> Much better than your regular shaving creams or gels!!</li>
            <li> therefore pretty expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stocked up from Amazon at a much better price than my local store.</li>
            <li> , Proraso was more menthol and grown-up male smelling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And if that wasn&#x27;t enough, when I was done, my face was softer and smoother than I have felt it in many years.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> In my 2 mos as a newbie, i&#x27;m discovering that slickness is really what&#x27;s most important in wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a a first for me.</li>
            <li> and I shave after I get out of the hot shower (even before I used this stuff).</li>
            <li> So use a decent amount of water with the super lather.</li>
            <li> However Cremo overall is just OK</li>
            <li> While similarly priced to Prorasso, I like the lighter scent of Cremo better.</li>
            <li> Just bought a tube of this because my local pharmacy quit carrying my favorite puck.  </li>
            <li> Really is astonishing (!)</li>
            <li> I love Cremo Creme and I will never go back to anything else!!</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed upon my first shave is the aroma.</li>
            <li> YOUR SKIN ASTONISHINGLY SOFT AND SMOOTH</li>
            <li> gets a closer shave on the first pass or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Run hot water and get your hands wet.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Also, it leaves your face incredibly smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> , the first day I used it, I thought I made a mistake buying this.  </li>
            <li> and I obviously used more than the recommended size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like it almost instantly- first</li>
            <li> Just some hot water and a dollop of this</li>
            <li> It stays on the face well and allows you to go back over areas unlike many others.  </li>
            <li> I shave about 4-5 days a week, and my first tube of Cremo lasted me 6 months.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly, and it doesn&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li> First for those who complain this product &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t lather&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I was confident that this would be an acceptable shave cream from reading the label, but my experiences with this were nothing short of awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Proraso and was reasonably happy with it but didn&#x27;t really like the extra time needed to prepare it or do multiple passes.  </li>
            <li> I use the 3 pass method most often, and trust me, the brush will hold enough lather for all three passes.  </li>
            <li> Try this once, and I am convinced you will be a fan of this product, and of the Mud Method.  ;-)</li>
            <li> When I first traveled with this it was because of</li>
            <li> I get much better results using regular bars of hand soap than Cremo.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t hear clean-shaven angels singing from on-high when I first put it on my face.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get a great shave (well, at least from this cream) and I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I tried using a hit towel first then hot water.</li>
            <li> , I have a short beard that extends just below the jaw line, so most of my shaving is on the neck.</li>
            <li> simply wet the brush, apply the dab of CREAMO CREAM to the brush and use your face as the mixing platform (dabbing your brush lightly in warm water every so often to generate more lather) â€¦ or you could use a mixing bowl (which I consider more of traditional tool than a necessity) â€¦ or use the palm of your hand as the mixing bowl (I used this method until I discovered the simple convenience of using my face to generate the lather).  </li>
            <li> Lightly dipping the edge of my brush into a sink of warm water allows me to add water in small increments to generate the lather I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been satisfied with some of the mainstream big name shaving creams and gels.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is just that KMF is the most diluted of the three and does not create the same level of slickness as the others.</li>
            <li> I did not care for the fragrance when I first started using Cremo, but I have to say that after a week or two I actually quite enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li> It works like a charm, leaves his skin really soft and bump free.</li>
            <li> If you expect barber shop type hot lather,this cream is not for you.</li>
            <li> applied first) then followed by Creamo</li>
            <li> I just received Cremo Shave Cream today, and tonight was my first time using it.</li>
            <li> The directions instruct you to mix it with hot water at first, because the cream is so concentrated, so you don&#x27;t have to use but an almond sized amount of this miracle cream.</li>
            <li> I felt as though my skin was cleaner, and upon touching the area I just shaved noticed it felt instantly smoother than the rest of my skin.</li>
            <li> But the bottom line is that it leaves my face feeling more abused/abraded than with traditional soaps.  </li>
            <li> I have found nothing better, or longer lasting.</li>
            <li> Use the hot towel on your face and then apply the cream.</li>
            <li> - No big mess to clean up after, wipes off easily but make sure to clean your razor well as you go</li>
            <li> It is not like the other creams, which are mostly air - goes on more like a lotion - but with water, forms a nice slick surface for the razor to glide on.</li>
            <li> I still really like the smell of it, and I&#x27;ll probably keep using it for my head for right now.</li>
            <li> I find I have to use twice as much as the almond size indicated, but this stuff is cheap and not messy!</li>
            <li> My face is very sensitive and dry, and since using the Cremo, I have enjoyed the way it leaves my face feeling smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions and was impressed that such a small amount can do so much.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this allowed for a much closer (better) shave.</li>
            <li> Vastly overrated really the product of a marketing campaign and nothing more.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this is far better than anything in a can...</li>
            <li> However shortly after this, it dries up too much and requires application of more product.  </li>
            <li> I use the amount the company advises and I&#x27;m pretty darned certain</li>
            <li> Shaving dry can be a hassle in the warm months with high humidity.</li>
            <li> also like the tube because I am not afraid of it bursting all over the inside of my suitcase when I put it on an airplane or take it to a high altitude.</li>
            <li> on a pretty regular basis, but no product is as convenient or easy to shave with as Cremo.</li>
            <li> While not necessary, I find the wet brush method a more enjoyable part of shave prep.  </li>
            <li> Performance is pretty much in line with the retail price.  </li>
            <li> With the AAFES shave cream, I could use pretty much any razor</li>
            <li> Use a hot towel before shaving, it really helps.</li>
            <li> You can get it pretty much at any retail outlet (Walmart-Target-CVS-Amazon for example).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer to put the Cremo in a stainless bowl and whip with my hot brush.</li>
            <li> The blades slide smoothly across my visage, even when I take a second and third pass without adding more</li>
            <li> But follicle, per follicle nothing has given me a closer shave except a hot towel and straight razor</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like it at first</li>
            <li> It shaves phenomenally close and smooth, and it only takes a tiny bit to do the job.</li>
            <li> The trick was to maximize the slickness with a uniform addition of water, using a small brush (my fingers did not do a good and uniform job of mixing water into the face bound cream).  </li>
            <li> Although it is slick, that doesn&#x27;t make a good shave medium.  </li>
            <li> Having said that, I think &amp;#34;Cremo&amp;#34; is a good product, but no better than &amp;#34;Proraso&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I mean like soaking wet, it&#x27;s best to shave right out of the shower after allowing your face to soak for about 30 seconds in hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Scrub scrub scrub, which of course feels good, but it&#x27;s opening your pores, the hot(ish, here) helps get your face ready, and then once that tiny little dab is all over, the shave is smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> This product is nicely scented, really softens the skin and makes it slick enough for a razor to comfortably glide over facial contours with amazing ease.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the idea of shaving in the shower as our water bill is high enough without spending more time in the shower shaving.</li>
            <li> Far better than any gilette or other commonly available brands of after shave</li>
            <li> I settled on Cremo Cream a few years ago and it&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> Most leave my face irritated and dry feeling, which makes after-shave balm a necessity.  </li>
            <li> I tried using a brush and shaving soap, but quickly returned to Cremo Cream--closer shave and no nicks, so far.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback to using this product was that it does create buildup on your razor that doesnâ€™t rinse away so easily</li>
            <li> Because of the light refreshing citrus scent of this cream I usually use it in the summer months.</li>
            <li> This product should work real well for most shavers as long as the hydrating issue is well done</li>
            <li> and 6 oz size will last a good long time.</li>
            <li> I doubt it will last as long as they claim but it does give a good shave with my Phillips electric.  </li>
            <li> my husband swears by the shave cream for his face and has had a large container of The Art of Shaving shaving cream and uses this instead.</li>
            <li> certainly a saucy cream</li>
            <li> an added bonus, I was pleased to learn that a visit to the Creamo web site will provide new customers with a rebate equal to you</li>
            <li> I usually use shave gels because most shave creams don&#x27;t give me enough lubrication for a smooth and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> No matter what amount I use (deviating more and less than the recommended &amp;#34;almond size&amp;#34;) the cream never seems to form a consistent layer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Be aware that, yes, this stuff is slippery, but then, that&#x27;s the point of their product, to lubricate the shave itself in a better way than other products do.</li>
            <li> By the way,it washes off just fine, and it doesn&#x27;t build up a layer of white flaky crud on your razor</li>
            <li> My beard is light and doesn&#x27;t stand up well, so I typically shave a second time against the grain to get a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li> Particularly if you use HOT water to soak a towel and wrap your face in it</li>
            <li> Not only is the shaving experience with Cremo far superior, but compared to the medicinal, slightly chemical smell of the Neutrogena, this one smells all natural, and absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that this product is available with Prime, because the store I got my first tube at did not have it when I checked the other day, and I definitely plan to repurchase.</li>
            <li> No frills, reasonably-priced, and a small amount goes a long way---yet it performs admirably in the key categories: lubrication without excessive foaming, refreshing manly smell, suitable for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fancy shaving boutiques and designer stores are great for finding a pretty, unique, luxurious gift.</li>
            <li> Far superior to the typical gels and foams, better than other premium cremes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The shave is smooth, but left my skin feeling very irritated and</li>
            <li> I really think a cheap, creamy conditioner on your face would give you the same results.  </li>
            <li> Really works well for me and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This &#x3D; way TOO Much.</li>
            <li> A can of Positively Smooth costs about the same as a tube of Cremo Cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve realized that the upside of this is that you are getting a much closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, 1 bottle lasts a very longtime.  </li>
            <li> at a very affordable price.  </li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> Price not so much.  </li>
            <li> and this really goes along way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took about 10 shaves to fully understand how it lathers and that you really don&#x27;t need that much  - you can get away with an almond size dollop.  </li>
            <li> Pop a moistened, rolled-up wash cloth in there 5 minutes before I jump in the shower, and it is ready for me when I get out.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I would get a very close shave and zero cuts.  </li>
            <li> (Ok I used it for my legs but an almond size dab was more than enough for one leg and actually probably enough for two.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can tell you got the entire area because it has this smooth silky lightwieght film on it.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> It makes my legs feel as smooth as if I had just had them waxed, same with my underarm area.</li>
            <li> I get a very close shave when I use this</li>
            <li> The 2 cm amount can cover my whole head and chin area.  </li>
            <li> Also, I had very irritated skin on the creamo side.</li>
            <li> Cremo, while not eliminating the bumps and rashes has really diminished the area the shaving rash covers and the number of bumps I get.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> BUT after awhile of use I must admit, this product works very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Barbasol and Edge for years, but this stuff really takes the cake.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Really slickens up your face.  </li>
            <li> Available in 3 oz and smaller for travel purposes.</li>
            <li> The second pass resulted in no lather, but there was sufficient lubrication on my face so that my face was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my shave creams, and I would prefer Barbarosa to this.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;m not as estatic as the 5 star reviews, this product really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if I&#x27;m in a rush I&#x27;ll use straight Cremo.  </li>
            <li> (and it doesn&#x27;t lather which is how I like it) and it just didn&#x27;t lubricate my skin very well at all.</li>
            <li> that doesn&#x27;t matter nearly as much as shave performance.  </li>
            <li> It took me several shaves to figure this stuff out but now that I have, it provides a silky smooth, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, I feel I often use too much.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much and it just keeps gliding on.</li>
            <li> I threw my bottle of cremo straight in the trash where it belongs</li>
            <li> The Every Man Jack had a texture that felt more like a skin lotion and not much of a lather.</li>
            <li> I have been using the King of Shaves brand gel which works very well for just about any blade I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> It does give you a very close shave, that feels very &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; (their word, not mine).  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t do what it needs to do, too much and your eyes can become overwhelmed),</li>
            <li> find there to be some sort of iridescent sheen associated with the very slickest of creams and</li>
            <li> I like to prime with hot water and Parker soap, then either use Cremo Cream or Premier Dead Sea Luxury Facial Cleanser, both work pretty good and soften my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t alleviate the pull, it doesn&#x27;t allow a real close shave as well as others.  </li>
            <li> The difference between this and what I used  before is very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you shaved your face fast, you might not encounter this.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re using a double-edged razor or straight razor, you&#x27;re going to cut yourself.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S REALLY</li>
            <li> This prevents the razor from clogging, while allowing the blade very close contact with the skin.</li>
            <li> Make sure your face is wet.  </li>
            <li> This did not turn out well given that electric razors do not handle that much volume of shaving cream well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended !</li>
            <li> Apply with a Clarisonic for a really close shave.</li>
            <li> Its really fruity and not my thing.</li>
            <li> This might be a contributing reason why it left my face smooth etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really debating on whether to get this again.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But the real problem I have with this is the stickiness....</li>
            <li> you rub it into your face, or between your hands, it&#x27;s not going to lather up much at all.</li>
            <li> Having used Barbasol and cheap shave gels all my life, I was used to applying massive amounts of Santa-Claus-beard foam that looks and feels on my skin a bit like spray sealant.</li>
            <li> It has a gentle citrus scent, tending toward grapefruit.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well and moisturizes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; - it really isn&#x27;t supposed to be used with a mug and brush.</li>
            <li> However it really won&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> Oh, and costs a couple times as much.</li>
            <li> For such a small amount of lather, I had the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced, with no nicks, and all on the first application.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really is &amp;#34;Astonishingly Superior&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Now you are ready to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I much prefer my Gillette Foamy.  </li>
            <li> Took a bit of getting used to but it is the real deal &amp; lives upp to the commercials</li>
            <li> I really cant tell a difference between this and</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to anyone considering buying this stuff!</li>
            <li> much easier.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go.  </li>
            <li> It makes even duller razors perform very well.  </li>
            <li> A pea sized amount really is all you need for your whole face.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak much about it.</li>
            <li> I find that It makes a very airy lather.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> However, I still have seldom gotten as close a shave with my safety razor or straight edge as I did with my disposable and cremo.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as I&#x27;d hope and isn&#x27;t as lubricative as I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really feel the need to go into exhaustive details about a grooming product.  </li>
            <li> It is much milder than the shave foam I was using (and is now in the trash).</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need more than a dime sized amount of the cream and your face needs to be WET.</li>
            <li> really works as advertised</li>
            <li> and I am very please with it.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Using my hands, I had as much Creamo on my palms as I did on my face.  </li>
            <li> This one is THE shaving cream for straight edge shave fans.</li>
            <li> Made the switch to the this from regular sensitive shaving cream and boy am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I have only used a Gillette shave gel for sensitive skin and had considered upgrading to something better.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first ordered Cremo Cream since it seemed too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> the socks off of your basic canned goop or gel, and far better for your skin.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I can now shave more frequently (if need be) than I did prior to using Cremo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After years of trying to find a good shave cream that helps remove razor burn and not leave a rash, I bought this one for my son, who has a thick beard.</li>
            <li> agree with other Reviewers who have noted that you need to prepare this cream correctly in order to get the maximum benefits, and it is very important to understand that this is a very concentrated product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain the purpose of this - maybe the grit contains some of the magic.</li>
            <li> Very close shave on the first run (against the grain with a safety razor) and came out very smooth with little or no burn.</li>
            <li> first with the grain, then quickly re-lathered and gave a second shave against the grain.  </li>
            <li> This shaving cream is surprisingly good and a single tube lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> The scent is light and refreshing and it is very slick</li>
            <li> This particular product is very close to the Neutrogena product, except that it is MUCH thicker (like toothpase)</li>
            <li> I cannot stress to make sure you follow the directions on the back of the bottle (Rub Hot Water onto Face for 30 seconds, only an Almond Size portion rubbed in</li>
            <li> I gave it a 1 star review and now am revising it out of fairness due to the latest results.</li>
            <li> The first time using this the only way to describe what happened is I had to check to make sure my razor was actually working.</li>
            <li> The scent is rather unique and the only tangible aroma I can tie it to would be a hint of orange.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t see a difference between this and most other gel shaving creams.</li>
            <li> It was basically a glorified lotion branded for use in the shower, but even so, it was better than any other foaming products.</li>
            <li> Because of this I tend to use a generous amount, more than with other brands.</li>
            <li> If you are a shower shaver you may have better luck with this stuff as it needs to be very wet.  </li>
            <li> â™¦ Warms nicely if placed in a small stainless bowl and placed on a candle warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get such a clean shave and my skin has never been irritated using this.</li>
            <li> It may be more expensive up front, but in the long run you&#x27;ll save more money because less is more with this shaving cream :)</li>
            <li> Exceptional product and one that I recommend at least once or twice a week to my customers</li>
            <li> This shaving cream, in conjunction with a fresh brand new gillette fusion proglide power blade with the power button on, shaving with it in the hot shower with a proper LED light shaving mirror and a proper pre shave oil beforehand, will give you like it does for me, the closest and smoothest shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nearly paranoid about not being able to find it when I need more, so I&#x27;ll be purchasing a few extra tubes promptly.</li>
            <li> small dab of CREAMO with a sink or cup full of warm water is really all that is needed to provide a well-lubricated lather to accommodate multiple razor passes.  </li>
            <li> First impression was:  strange scent, but super</li>
            <li> The label says pretty clearly to massage this onto your skin and it will form a &amp;#34;light lather&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Although I do have fairly sensitive skin, more so when I was in my teens and twenties, I just never really put much thought into the type of cream I used.</li>
            <li> If normal stuff makes a 1/4&amp;#34; layer, this is going to be 1/8&amp;#34; - just a film on your face really, but its adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (My wifey has a cool washcloth steamer which I also use regularly.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried everything from the old hot lather machines (remember them?)</li>
            <li> I lather it in my palms, and a good wet lather always gives me enough cream for complete beard and neck coverage.</li>
            <li> Its not bad, just... different.</li>
            <li> Not a bad choice overall.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about you but cleaning up after a teenage boy isn&#x27;t easy to begin with and this definitely makes it much easier for us!</li>
            <li> You really only need a little bit for a good shave.</li>
            <li> As the package says, less is more.</li>
            <li> Better now that I am using less.</li>
            <li> In fact less is more.</li>
            <li> Suffice to say I found that my shaving experience was in the kindest way I can describe, less than satisfying.</li>
            <li> I am glad because it is about half the cost.</li>
            <li> I would compare this to Jack Black shave cream but better.</li>
            <li> but, it is (less is actually more with this</li>
            <li> Smells like an orange creamsicle and has to be reapplied more or less after each pass</li>
            <li> Bumps were drastically less and skin was noticeably better.</li>
            <li> I concur with most othe posters on the 2 stars and less....</li>
            <li> began researching different shave creams/gels when I decided to purchase bulk toiletries on Amazon and a simple search for shave creams returned more options than I had time to consider.</li>
            <li> Whether I am using a brush or rubbing it straight on a wet face, it works well and keep my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I personally like it super</li>
            <li> It makes the shaving surface super slippery, but it makes no claim to softening the actual hair before the shaving process.</li>
            <li> I mainly use this cream when I don&#x27;t have the time or want to put forth the effort to soak my brush and whip up lather in a bowl.  </li>
            <li> later found Cremo Shaving Cream at my local Walgreens in desperation for somethig better.</li>
            <li> Even have enough on to make a second pass without putting any more on.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;d buy Cremo is if I ran out of traditional soap and it was either Cremo or spray can soap, there are tons of better shaving soap brands.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly to shave my scalp and this product works wonders.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually about to order the facial cleanser/moisturizer specifically because the shaving cream is so outstanding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through all sorts of different shave cream brands, most recently using Aveeno.</li>
            <li> It does not later up like regular shave cream unless you use more than suggested.</li>
            <li> Buy the 6 ounce tube,it&#x27;s cheaper by the ounce and will last 3 months and more with daily use if needed.</li>
            <li> A tube lasts so long because you use just a small amount which does a great job.</li>
            <li> Before shaving was an irritating nightmare, but Cremo changed that and made it pleasant again.</li>
            <li> I prefer a nice thick lather and application via a badger hair brush and mainly shave with a safety razor or a straight razor</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, it has pleasant feel, provides a close shave and the scent is not overpowering or negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Leaves a very close shave, no nicks, and no irritation, and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If I seem to be running low on it, I just add a little bit more to my head and add a little water as well, and it&#x27;s good to go again.  </li>
            <li> After mixing it together with the hot water in my hands for about 30 seconds, I applied it on my face, and let me tell you, the consistency and feel of this cream is like no other!</li>
            <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve experimented with adding two drops of shaving oil (Somersets) to my dab of Cremo and that works even better!  </li>
            <li> I love it because there is still a nice slick surface when going back and touching up tough areas.  </li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t have high water pressure, this could be the shave cream for you.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Cremo.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to say I highly recommend this product to all women and</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I have also compared it to some of the high end shaving creams that I also tried.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> You will not get a high volume lather.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> The performance of the Cremo creme beats anything that I have tried (including the high end Clinique products).  </li>
            <li> There is plenty of cream in the tube and after a month of use everyday, I still have more than enough to last me a couple of months or more.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Cremo Cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, you will probably feel a little more &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; against the stubble than you&#x27;re used to.</li>
            <li> Just better when you can soak a little first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I also bought the women&#x27;s version which just smells a little more &amp;#34;girlie&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When used with my brush to make a lather it is a little better.</li>
            <li> It does have a nice smell, but no matter how hard I tried, I could not get it to lather.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good product because a little goes a long way; I bought one from the drug store what feels like 5 months ago</li>
            <li> This with a blade and razor that I have used successfully many times (naturally when trying something new, I want every other factor to be a known quantity).  </li>
            <li> The lather of this really reminds my husband of the old fashion soap and brush application.  </li>
            <li> You put a dab about the size of an almond on your fingers and then smooth it over your wet face.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this so much he purchased some for each of our (adult) children.  </li>
            <li> I normally use a [[ASIN:B00T7WNHK2 shaving gel]] and a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I shave my head as normal</li>
            <li> You will never use normal shaving cream again...</li>
            <li> I normally get 25 shaves out of a blade - this one is at 35 and probably about time to be</li>
            <li> All 3 of the creams are good values, and I recommend getting small quantities to test for your personal preferences.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price, and from what I&#x27;ve seen it will last a while, and like all creams it takes some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> several knicks, even with a fresh blade.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it provides a better shave (because I can&#x27;t really tell the difference), but I like the story.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suggestion: buy it before you run out of your normal shaving cream/gel.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not cutting my face up on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> A heavy advertising of this product and promise the first will be free...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price since I can achieve the same results with a can of Barbasol</li>
            <li> So far the worst shave with this cream is better than the best shave I ever had with the Gillette or Neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li> I normally use a brush and safety razor.</li>
            <li> A lot of people write a review saying it doesn&#x27;t lather well, well it doesn&#x27;t lather like normal foamy shaving cream, but the point isn&#x27;t the lather of it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry, this is normal.  </li>
            <li> I use it to shave my legs and armpits, and have used it in my bikini area before, but that&#x27;s an area I normally wax</li>
            <li> I use an almond-size squirt from the tube (and the tube will last you almost forever using this small of an amount), make sure face is warm and wet.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, it&#x27;s worth it for the extra kisses from the wife.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not great or even really good.</li>
            <li> Good lather/shave soap e.g. proraso&amp;#62; shave secret &amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> My very finicky husband has used many shave products over the years, from very high-end creams all the way down to generic drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t rinse off the skin very easily, and it left me smelling like a can of furniture polish due to the lemony scent.</li>
            <li> version but this does the same job and smells just as nice for less.</li>
            <li> It is not as thick as the instructions indicate and you have to use more than an almond size especially if you have significant beard</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving with a DE for the past few years and have enjoyed it except when I traveled because most hotel etc do not have soft water and most soaps and creams gum up on the razor and do not perform as well as with soft water.  </li>
            <li> They work well in the shower with electric razors as well, but Cremo is not only priced right</li>
            <li> The key is getting the water/cream ratio right</li>
            <li> Cremo smells great, but it doesn&#x27;t soften the beard at all, is very thin, and dries to a flaky consistency within a minute or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> REALLY work it in good and develop a nice lather that is neither runny nor so thick that it is difficult to rinse off of the razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave quite as close of a shave as other products, but it leaves your skin stupidly smooth.  </li>
            <li> Very creamy, spreads very evenly on your face and you don&#x27;t need to use much so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Just squeeze a very small amount in your hand then add water and it whips into a nice lather.  </li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t even a new blade).  </li>
            <li> This is my new go-to shaving cr&amp;egrave;me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve subscribed for a new tube every 4 months because this stuff lasts.</li>
            <li> Even with new blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your skin is sticky and even with a clean face the razor will drag.</li>
            <li> as advertised and it  works equally well with a regular razor or a  wet electric shaver to produce a clean and comfortable shave&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;First you should know that I have an extra-large head (XL hats don&#x27;t fit me), I have a very coarse beard, and the hair on my head is somewhat coarse too.</li>
            <li> I have tried many, cheap and expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut back on the amount I use, and I haven&#x27;t really noticed as much of a &amp;#34;drying-out&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I wanted something better than the cheap shaving cans you get in the store, and randomly heard about this product.</li>
            <li> by the way, I have found that the same amount will also cover my head along with my face, so you really don&#x27;t need much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blade will slide across your face smoothly and effortlessly leaving behind a shave so smooth even your kids will notice.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s pretty darn slick and comfortable when I&#x27;m not nicking myself.</li>
            <li> , I would just prefer something a little &amp;#34;manlier&amp;#34; - but it isn&#x27;t a deal breaker as the smell is pretty mild anyway.</li>
            <li> My skin tells me how I have done very clearly each and every shave.  </li>
            <li> I would be very surprised if they didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I believed it was going to beat every man jack shaving cream according to the description on the tube.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The cost for a single tube seems high until you realize how many shaves a single tube will provide (with a pea-sized dollop for each shave)</li>
            <li> The cost for a single tube seems high until you realize how many shaves a single tube will provide (with a pea-sized dollop for each shave)</li>
            <li> B003EMVVMM Gillette Fusion Razor]], and only experience nicks or cuts when using a new blade for the first time.  </li>
            <li> the first two shaves and a Edwin Jagger DE89 Lbl for the last shave.</li>
            <li> the first two shaves and a Edwin Jagger DE89 Lbl for the last shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll also feel a sort of gritty texture at first.</li>
            <li> Just wow!</li>
            <li> I followed the EXACTLY what the directions said on the back.  </li>
            <li> And after a razor stroke it didn&#x27;t always feel like it left enough lubrication to go over the same area more than once or twice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bonus no fake gross stuff</li>
            <li> different higher end shave creams - Murad, Anthony, Prorasso - and I</li>
            <li> Every shave with the old stuff is disappointing and gets more and more so, until you just throw it out and use the Cremo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay, these guys claim this is the &#x27;impossibly slick&#x27; blah blah.</li>
            <li> This feels much richer than general lathers.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> my beard was still pretty low.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m only finishing my first 6 oz.</li>
            <li> This was my first foray into traditional shave cream</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m used to using higher quality creams like Proraso and C.O. Bigelow, and this is definitely inferior, in my opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t lather worth jack monkey squat, either by hand or with brush and bowl.  </li>
            <li> Thus far I have used it three separate times and found it to give me an acceptable shaving experience though nothing to brag about and based on my experience up to this moment I do not plan to purchase it again once the tube has been used up!</li>
            <li> I bought my first tube at Meijer and have recently seen it  at  Walmart, both for under $7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this when I first switched to a double edged razor and that was probably a mistake to switch two things at once.  </li>
            <li> ONLY after hot moist towels have been applied.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s no better then many of the brands I buy at the store.</li>
            <li> Apparently Creamo gives me a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li> close shaves were a bit surprising because Creamo doesn&#x27;t give you a real thick lather.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, it really does work well even though the generic labeling (which is fine) reminds me of the white cans in the 70&#x27;s that simply said &amp;#34;Beer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I re-wet my hands a little and pat fresh hot water on my head only&lt;</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the difference between phenomenal success in utter failure:</li>
            <li> As advertised,a little dab goes a long way and needs plenty of warm water added as you are using it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, especially the neck area, and get better results from a bar of Dove soap and a semi sharp Hydro5.</li>
            <li> On a hot summer day when I don&#x27;t want to spend too much time in a steamy bathroom wet shaving, I use Cremo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading all the hype - I had high expectations for this shaving cream - followed directions to the letter - disappointing shave even with Gillette Silver Blues - going to give to my bud with the lighter beard - maybe it will work better for him-eh!!</li>
            <li> I tried this because of the strongly positive reviews and the moderate price point.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not this huge mess like aerosol shaving creams.</li>
            <li> If you need to shave your head, this stuff will make a HUGE mess and get all in your eyes and mouth..</li>
            <li> I bought a tube of Cremo a few months back and waited awhile to review it because your first impression is not always accurate.</li>
            <li> but I have previously used Gillette Fusion gel and most recently Axe chilled shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> Overall a decent product for a decent price.</li>
            <li> Pretty much the complete opposite of what the label on the back had claimed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not foam up like conventional shave creams and you have to get your facial skin very warm and wet in order to make it work properly.</li>
            <li> And if you go to a certain big box retailer based in Arkansas, you can get it for $3.98.</li>
            <li> Although, if your the type who only uses one cream all the time, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to keep anyone from using this cream anytime of year.</li>
            <li> It doesnt lather the same as other shave products, but it is slick and leaves you with a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s GREAT), however, it is also VERY runny and thin (which means it makes a mess</li>
            <li> (I clean and preserve my blades with alcohol to cut down on rust/oxidation.  </li>
            <li> Next I started using bar soap, which was a little better</li>
            <li> then you can even get another pass by just working in a little more water with what&#x27;s left on your face.</li>
            <li> If after the initial shave, you find some skin areas that need more attention, just add a little water to the area and the slickness is renewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The texture of this cream is like no other I have ever seen, and I&#x27;ve got a cabinet full of widely known brands of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It is easily rinsed from a razor or an  electric shaver unlike some other shave creams, specifically American Crew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super slick, super easy to use, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few products which do, so this is a huge plus to</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few products which do, so this is a huge plus to</li>
            <li> Cremo was slippery and clear.</li>
            <li> I quote from the label instructions in the review and clearly state that the product is not meant to be used with a brush</li>
            <li> Based on reviews it is clear that this stuff is working well for some people, in fact lots of people.</li>
            <li> I use it with my straight razors only as I can see through the cream on my face without nicking vital anatomy during the process.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While shaving with Cremo is comfortable, it&#x27;s much harder to apply than gel, and an \\&quot;almond-sized\\&quot; amount is completely insufficient (although it might work with only one day&#x27;s growth).  </li>
            <li> I rinse my razor in the sink frequently</li>
            <li> Far fewer skin bumps after shaving</li>
            <li> Of the 3 creams, the Cremo has the least lubricity and least after shave conditioning with the Bigelow premium far and above the best lubricity and conditioning.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There were a few times that I needed to \\&quot;reactivate\\&quot; the slickness by placing water on my face with my free hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every time I use it, about halfway through my shave I resign myself to the fact that I&#x27;ll need to reach for my brush and Taylor of Old Bond Street and re-shave.  </li>
            <li> Upon finishing though, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at the results.  </li>
            <li> So far, it has worked out well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell where I&#x27;ve shaved and later realize that I missed spots.</li>
            <li> However, each item cost nearly twenty bucks and</li>
            <li> They also send me periodic offers by email.  </li>
            <li> and I am 62 years old.  </li>
            <li> I am using an old school 1965 Gillette DE adjustable razor.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face soft</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin, prone to get razor burn on my neck.</li>
            <li> Go every-other-shave between the two until you use up your old one.</li>
            <li> I have far fewer cuts, get a closer shave, and have no irritation.</li>
            <li> It really does last for 3 months and both me and my husband use it.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> But eventually it dries up completely and I have to reapply the product to finish shaving.</li>
            <li> After using this several times to shave both my head and face, I&#x27;ve come to the opinion that it just dries up too fast.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER: You absolutely must do the following to get this product to work.</li>
            <li> so, have enough experience now to write a reasonable review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the facial hair it didn&#x27;t really cover like I&#x27;d expect it to.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin as it has no harsh ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay, this is for all those 1 star reviews that complained about the lack of lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Wow, shaving this way is a treat, but there is one drawback.  </li>
            <li> Shake out the excess water with a flick of the wrist and add about and almond size dollop of Cremeo directly on your brush.  </li>
            <li> Simultaneously, it does not irritate my sensitive skin and it helps to prevent the skin on my face from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I then apply a Proraso aftershave lotion for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> tube has lasted a year so far and</li>
            <li> Fast forward, on recent travel I was using the Kiehl&#x27;s Shaving Cream that was already packed in my dopp kit.</li>
            <li> I have a semi sensitive face but was optimistic.  </li>
            <li> Daily shaving really beats up my face</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m 43 years old</li>
            <li> (It does also have a secondary scent that I don&#x27;t love.  </li>
            <li> At least most of you will never use another shave cream again.</li>
            <li> As far as I an concerned.  </li>
            <li> I thought she was just imagining a difference, so tested to see if she really could tell when I used Cremo or regular foam out of a can.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft afterwards and the cream doesnâ€™t stick in the razor.  </li>
            <li> After only a few shaves, I am already really glad I made the change.</li>
            <li> Thick facial hair is no match, and gives a clean quick shave.  </li>
            <li> Very slick, it allows for a very comfortable glide.</li>
            <li> And the razor cleans very quickly because the stuff is so slick.</li>
            <li> I quickly narrowed my search down to some shave soaps and this product based on reviews alone.</li>
            <li> One thing I did find Cremo is useful for however is to add to other shaving soaps.  </li>
            <li> The original (rather harsh) review is below:  </li>
            <li> Love the smell of this, and it is very slick.</li>
            <li> It does not lather as much as some of the other shave creams I have used, but it still provided a small amount of lather and a very smooth shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I soon throw away my disposables, I am also going to throw away my Barbersol shave cream that does nothing more than make a mess and works just a little better than plain soap and water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but after the first shave on my face it did not leave enough lubricant to go back over my face and get it closer.</li>
            <li> and I can only buy it at one particular drug store in town.  </li>
            <li> and I can only buy it at one particular drug store in town.  </li>
            <li> When you wet your skin and apply the cream in the appropriate proportion, you may see a little white cream on your skin at first, but it will be very little and will likely disappear very quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dozens of high end shave care products and this stuff is squarely in the middle.  </li>
            <li> My electric razor was giving out, and I didn&#x27;t want another because the newer ones look like high maintenance, low quality.</li>
            <li> I have tried both with new blades and old and with various water temperatures.</li>
            <li> Not sure one tube will last him the full 90 days it claims to, but he&#x27;ll certainly be buying another when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> He does get a closer shave with less burn, but he says he can&#x27;t really tell and doesn&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> Cremo Shave Cream is better than typical grade, but not much.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it works, but compared to the cheap gel I was using g, it is night and day difference.</li>
            <li> As long as they keep making this and selling it at a reasonable price, I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> This cream provides for a slick and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> â™¦ Does not take much, one tube lasts a long time.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The makers state rather clearly that their problem with traditional shave cream is that too much of the product does nothing for you at all, due to too much</li>
            <li> but what it does is leaves a slick surface for your razor blade to glide over for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Both grow back enough to shave once per day, but to be economical I actually shave every 1.5 days</li>
            <li> The electric razor glides across my face and after I have finished the first shave I wet my hand and rub it over my face again.</li>
            <li> Wet face with hot water.</li>
            <li> the next time, I shaved like normal...</li>
            <li> I have also tried it shaving my face, and I do find Shave Secret a superior shave, but for the two reasons stated above, I am likely to continue using this to shave my head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m good with the smell (seems citric - like oranges) , and it did allow a close shave with no irritation, but the extra mess and hassle and time of keeping it watered and having that running down my elbow constantly was just B.S.  </li>
            <li> I use a new gillette fusion proglide power blade with each shave since my hair is so thick and cuts up the blade after each shave, and this cream really helps to make the blade just glide along my face and neck like butter on a scalding hot pan.  </li>
            <li> Whether or not you get a closer shave might depend on your shaving style, but this product stays slick longer than usual and allows several strokes to the same areas, so you are more likely to do a better job</li>
            <li> Now a new regular customer for this product.</li>
            <li> Combined with my new Edwin Jagger De87bl razor, I now actually look forward to shaving!</li>
            <li> Recently, I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li> I keep about 4 or so different shave creams/soaps on rotation and like to try new ones as i run out.</li>
            <li> Recently I decides to try something new</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several months before reviewing to ensure I wasn&#x27;t just biased because its something new.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something a bit more &#x27;natural&#x27; than canned shave gels, this is a poor choice.</li>
            <li> I now can shave against the grain without major neck irritation.  </li>
            <li> to expensive electric shavers, but the Cremo cream was the first product that made this daily task more tolerable for me.  </li>
            <li> I have had this for 3 weeks now, and I have barely made a dent in the supply of one tube!</li>
            <li> The instructions say all you need is a small amount and that is true, a small almond sized amount was good enough to cover my face well but not as a thick lather that I would expect but more like a slick liquid on my face.  </li>
            <li> Well, since I started using this, even on super sensitive areas, I have little to no razor burn, and I only have to shave about once every 1.5-2 weeks.</li>
            <li> As someone who used to shave sometimes twice daily for work (military), this has help provide such a close and smooth shave that I only have to shave once a day.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and after switiching to Cremo, as well as Shea Moisture&#x27;s Tea Tree alcohol-free aftershave, I have had nothing but close shaves, and smooth, bump-free skin that&#x27;s not left red and dried out.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this has really worked especially during the winter when I have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers note, follow the instructions when applying--wet hands and wet face are important..</li>
            <li> Prepare your face with hot water, or a hot towel, and apply a very small amount.</li>
            <li> Following the instructions on the tube very carefully, and having put a fresh Wilkinson Sword blade in my Parker 99</li>
            <li> Takes a little experimenting, but worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A little pricey and worth it.</li>
            <li> is less than half the price and gives me a better shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While the shaves are better, finding a decent soap or cream is difficult at any price point.  </li>
            <li> foams up well, smooth shave and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin very slick and easy to shave.</li>
            <li> It is slick like it says because of its special &amp;#34;molecules&amp;#34; but for me, does not produce a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> Even much more expensive \\&quot;premium\\&quot; brands found in high end department</li>
            <li> so I will update my review with long term use and whether this really will last 90 days.  </li>
            <li> At any rate, if you have sensitive skin and shaving is sometimes a problem for you -- definitely get this stuff.</li>
            <li> Ever since they discontinued the generic AAFES brand foamy sensitive shave cream, I have struggled to find a replacement.  </li>
            <li> I have the unenviable combination of a very coarse beard and soft skin.</li>
            <li> gave me the same results (Proraso for sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> /&gt;This will be replacing my Schick Hydro Sensitive gel that I had been using daily.</li>
            <li> It was so sudsy and watery, you could barely use it.</li>
            <li> I think the next cream I&#x27;ll try is Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s Sandalwood.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe they&#x27;re only comparing themselves with the old school foams.</li>
            <li> I have a rough beard that grows every which direction, especially on my sensitive neck.</li>
            <li> Once I finally spoke to them I thought that they really were interested in being helpful, and that&#x27;s a rare thing these days (unfortunately).   </li>
            <li> I feel no drag at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d shave with Creamo for a while, then throw in a day with regular old stuff.  </li>
            <li> Nicks and irritation are rare, and are usually just because I used an old blade.  </li>
            <li> If you enjoy a thick, luscious lather, DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
            <li> Sorry guys, nice try.</li>
            <li> It is a little odd though using it over a lather able cream.</li>
            <li> I FIRST tried it, I probably expected slightly too much.  </li>
            <li> Mainly it seems like a vehicle for a couple of vain and egotistical men called Kyle Schroeder and Mike Boone to brag about how cool they were to start a company which makes mediocre high end shave creme, which they seem to have to give away to get distribution.  </li>
            <li> This has twice as many ingredients as your standard Gillette shave gel including a whole load of synthetic chemicals not found in normal shave gels which are artificial enough at</li>
            <li> , it is SUPER SLICK when kept moist, which is what they advertised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super slick as advertised.</li>
            <li> The bad news for me (and good news for those who like this product) is that it really can go a long way.  </li>
            <li> It lathers on clear but leaves your face very slick, better than any other shaving cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well, if not exactly as advertised by the maker.</li>
            <li> This is very slick and provides a close irritation free shave.  </li>
            <li> I found the key to this products success being the addition of a little water to each application of the cream.  </li>
            <li> The standard aerosol gels generate a lot of foam/lather for one razor pass, but always left my face dry and the cans simply never stop oozing foam after the first use.  </li>
            <li> Just use my hands to apply a thin lather, then use my brush with the traditional products on top of the super slick goodness that is Cremo Cream.</li>
            <li> Looking to make his shaving experience more enjoyable (and less painful), I purchased Cremo, and we&#x27;re both</li>
            <li> I have used foams from time to time but never really cared for them and only really used them if I had to purchase a travel size of if they were provided at a hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Absolutely would recommend trying it especially if you suffer every time you have to drag that razor over your neck like I do.</li>
            <li> My blade did not glide over my skin nearly as well as a lather soap, I nicked my chin and found enough stubble left that I lathered up with my brush and shaved again.</li>
            <li> But for daily shaving, keep your man&#x27;s shaving kit  stocked with the old standard Cremo!</li>
            <li> I recently switched to using an old fashioned safety razor and this just doesn&#x27;t give enough protection.</li>
            <li> I have not yet used it long enough to determine if this 6 oz tube lasts longer than a normal 7 oz can of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I bought a few different items to try and this one wins hands</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was long time user of American Crew Shave cream when I could find it at less than the full retail price of about $16.</li>
            <li> I thought at first I just had a dull razor but switched to brand new (and got the cuts to prove it)</li>
            <li> A little frusterated at first.  </li>
            <li> This cremo cream left a load of razor bumps and redness under my neck like no other.</li>
            <li> While much more expensive than other products, the 6 ounces will give you many shaves as the amount required per-shave is so little, plus you are getting a product that will not only give you a closer shave, but it will also reduce irritation while simultaneously moisturizing your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While much more expensive than other products, the 6 ounces will give you many shaves as the amount required per-shave is so little, plus you are getting a product that will not only give you a closer shave, but it will also reduce irritation while simultaneously moisturizing your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I re-read the instructions and decided I&#x27;d misinterpreted them the first time and gotten a little over-ambitious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Found Cremo at my local drug store and had high hopes for it, but it did not live up to the hype on the label.  </li>
            <li> Some gave me great results while others disappointed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I still go every 3 days though as I shave my head at the same time and every other day would be to much for my schedule.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Monday shaving is normally a bit rough for me.  </li>
            <li> If you currently use some product like Edge shaving gel give this a try;  you will understand why it is worth an extra few dollars.</li>
            <li> I let the brush soak in hot water for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Cremo is intended to be brushless, but I find that applying a small dot to a wet brush before each of 2-3 passes works fine.  </li>
            <li> It really cuts down on the skin irritation--especially with the DE razor.</li>
            <li> Does not work very well for me; the cream seems too liquid and tends to run down the shaver handle so making the grip slippery.</li>
            <li> This compensated for the absence of the straight razor due to the lubrication on your skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, this product is very economical because you need/use so much less than a typical gel or foam.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this based on the reviews, but it might as well be any other shave cream that doesn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re a senior with dry and thinning skin, finish it off with Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many gel/creams/oils for shaving my head over the past few years.</li>
            <li> After four days of use, I set it aside for several reasons: first, although it&#x27;s slick, it didn&#x27;t shave my beard any closer than other products in this price range; second, my skin felt tight and irritated after rinsing off; and third, I developed a patch of dermatitis on my chin--which quickly cleared up after I stopped using the product.</li>
            <li> (bleeding was a normal thing with other creams)&lt;br</li>
            <li> multiple times when using this, while it never happened in the year or two with my previous shave stuff (the real shaving co)</li>
            <li> time I found myself applying more of this to my face for a second pass, again maybe this was user error because of bad blades or not letting my face be in hot enough water or something.</li>
            <li> He really hates the gel in a can stuff that continually expands after the cap is replaced - creating a gooey mess for the next shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super slick, as advertised, and allows multiple passes with minor reapplication of some water and a tiny bit of cream.</li>
            <li> â€¦ too little water &#x3D; dry/uncomfortable shave â€¦ to much water &#x3D; messy/uncomfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a little dab, about as much as you put toothpaste on your brush.</li>
            <li> However since it is so affordable I don&#x27;t really mind using a little extra.</li>
            <li> First impression is a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> no matter how hard I tried to keep them clean and dry.</li>
            <li> no matter how hard I tried to keep them clean and dry.</li>
            <li> The cream is extremely slick, cleans easily out of my razor, and will probably last me for several months given how little is required to shave.  </li>
            <li> A very subtle citrus that suits me just fine.</li>
            <li> Thus I tend to get at least a little razor burn and nicks pretty much every time I shave.  </li>
            <li> Very slippery, a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I like using shaming creams in pretty pink bottles, but the heavy fragrance just seemed to irritate my skin, so even though this is technically a men&#x27;s shaving cream</li>
            <li> Those that are expecting a conventional lather shaving cream seem to be surprised at the lack of same.</li>
            <li> First the instructions are wrong in regards to how much you should use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I find myself with a thicker beard the next morning, its easier to shave the next day because my face is far less irritated -</li>
            <li> and if you use it properly one tube can last you a long time.</li>
            <li> Then, a small size (I use about 2-3 peas worth) is what should be worked into the already wet skin on the face.</li>
            <li> Using the brush, I mix a small squirt of Creamo with a little warm water in a small bowl, then slap it on like the barbers of yore.</li>
            <li> When you do the lubricant seems to reappear making it easy to go back over those sections where you still feel uncut beard growth.</li>
            <li> If the cream gets a bit dry, just dip your fingertips in hot water, rub them over your face and the cream gets slick again</li>
            <li> This is a very concentrated product, and a small amount is all that is required.  </li>
            <li> I purchased my first tube late June 2014</li>
            <li> This cream is slick but will not lather and vanishes fast off your face.</li>
            <li> so have been around long enough to have tried it all.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t recall how long I&#x27;ve had this bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> My shave cans never last that long</li>
            <li> Actually ends up being cheaper than Gillette or store-brand shaving gel since a tube lasts so long.  </li>
            <li> I still have so much left even though I&#x27;ve had it so long.</li>
            <li> it is in a flat jar.</li>
            <li> My whiskers are pretty thick.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately had my first razor break (EJ de89) and used that opportunity to go ahead and try a Merkur Classic Safety (since it was alos the rage for beginners and</li>
            <li> mo2YDMK59FBK5VX]]I have a super tough beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain I still have enough in the tube for at least another month!&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain I still have enough in the tube for at least another month!&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will not be going back to what I used to use for a long time!</li>
            <li> $5.97 could last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d possibly slice a chunk of skin off my scalp from the dry swipe of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know the company itself offers a travel size, but this way you get half a tube to use at home, and a travel tube to take with you.</li>
            <li> Of course that&#x27;s not its primary purpose but at least it&#x27;s not going to waste.    </li>
            <li> Gave this to my 15 year old grandson with oddly eclectric retro taste.  </li>
            <li> I found it locally but the local Walmart is not very reliable on keeping things in stock</li>
            <li> Ive tried a few of the big name brands and a couple old school brands off of amazon.  </li>
            <li> One tube will last a long long time&lt;br /&gt;beating</li>
            <li> For those of you who comment that I failed to understand how to use Cremo, (because I tried to lather the Cremo just to see if it would lather), I would ask you to read more carefully.  </li>
            <li> The key is to have your face wet and to put the thinnest layer possible of this on.</li>
            <li> tube will last a long, long time so give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this quite a bit since my original review and update, and I believe I was a little too hard on it.</li>
            <li> use single blade disposables maybe this is designed for a different razor?  </li>
            <li> I like the idea and like not using the foam mess, but so far I am not a convert.</li>
            <li> I hav very sensitive pale skin and course hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually not any more expensive!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to get used to at first - you really don&#x27;t need a lot and a little water in your palm mixes with it to create a lather.  </li>
            <li> reminds me a little of the old style shaving cream that my grandfather use to shave with that you can no longer find.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Aerosol shaving foams are a rip off-(mostly propellant) as are cartridge razors-(over priced, and dull fast)</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband who, much to his chagrin, has had to return to shaving at least once a day for work.</li>
            <li> If you use too much it will, as some have complained, gum up your razor.</li>
            <li> The consistency is more like a coating of cold cream on your face.  </li>
            <li> Initially, I was squeezing the small amount on my fingertips and applying directly to my beard then rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> I usually only do one pass shaves, but in any case, I think the tube should last the average person quite a bit longer than the 2 months</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with razor burn, but this shaving cream fixed it for me.  </li>
            <li> , this is a very simple soap to use, wet the face squeeze out an almond size into your hands and apply to face in a circular motion.  </li>
            <li> HOW LONG DOES A TUBE OF CREMO CREAM LAST?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> HOW LONG DOES A TUBE OF CREMO CREAM LAST?&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> This time I decided to measure how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> at 5 out of 10 and so far, the C.O. Bigelow Premium (Green tube) is 10 out of 10.  </li>
            <li> I had been a life long off and on user of Kiehl&#x27;s</li>
            <li> was not what I expected, so after several uses I replaced it with a foam shave</li>
            <li> I wish I knew about this cream a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell of cloves, and I don&#x27;t want the extra oil on my face, so I wash my face after using it (beyond just wiping with a wet washcloth.)  </li>
            <li> This is for shaving your head, shaving your face shouldn&#x27;t take that long.  </li>
            <li> so, historically have to pass the razer over the same area a few times from different directions ...</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to heap it on, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> So long aerosol cans of shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> Gave me the smoothest, closest shave I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
            <li> I  had just  purchased  a Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver  after having used a Gillette Fusion razor  for a long time and decided to try some &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; shaving oils and creams.&lt;br</li>
            <li> never used a cream shave before, only the canned goop.&lt;br /&gt;You put an almond size dab in your hands,&lt;br /&gt;Rub into your wet face,&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I have seen this sold at my local drugstore, walmart, amazon, and even some of the fancier online shave shops that specialize in wet shaving accessories.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time...</li>
            <li> At first, wasn&#x27;t used to needing only a thin layer.</li>
            <li> At first I got several poor shaves with this.</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;The stuff goes on paper thin, it doesn&#x27;t lather worth</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need to use muchâ€”I think the packaging recommends a quarter-size dollop, and I think you could even get away with a little less.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also harder to wash off the razor (although I don&#x27;t have to wash it off as frequently since less of it accumulates than gel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While in my local CVS pharmacy, I saw the Cremo display which offered a refund of the entire selling price (less sales tax.)</li>
            <li> Smoothest shave imaginable...requires just the right amount of water to lather up without getting too thin...</li>
            <li> This small tube will last as long as 3 of the aerosol cans in my opinion, you only need to use an almond sized dab for your entire face.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt, it&#x27;s just different from the feel of shaving with other products.</li>
            <li> A cut was a daily thing with other creams.  </li>
            <li> The product is very slick and protects your face very well.</li>
            <li> Out of due respect for everyone, I do believe it works for some, but I was left wondering if some of the reviews were exaggerated&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started using this mixed in with other shaving creams and all that changed.</li>
            <li> Then I simply shave it off, rinsing off the razor with every other swipe.</li>
            <li> My neck is no smoother afterwards than any other gel or traditional foam in a can.</li>
            <li> This is after having tried various other creams, gels, foams, multi-cartridge razors, and an electric razor.</li>
            <li> and while I drift off to try other creams, I always seem to come back to this one.  </li>
            <li> I can only imagine sub-5Star reviews being due to having ignored this.</li>
            <li> To shave my legs, I use roughly an almond-size amount for each leg for the entire area from just above the knee on down, and that is plenty of product.</li>
            <li> A bottle also lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Because if it were to go dry, and I did not notice it...</li>
            <li> It immediately started to dry and disappear.</li>
            <li> With the Gel I have to shave every two days and my skin feel dry.</li>
            <li> It does dry up, however.</li>
            <li> I shave immediately after getting out of the shower and don&#x27;t dry my face beforehand.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I have to use a hair dryer to dry off my face while shaving</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the pre shave lotions that supposedly dry and lubricate your face, but they leave your face oily and you have to wash or shower afterwards.</li>
            <li> To finish off the shave, I dry my face with a towel (I do not rinse but rather pat dry with a towel as I prefer to keep the moisturizers from the Cremo on my skin)</li>
            <li> I had been too scared to shave everyday but decided shaving again under 24 hours of my last shave would be the ultimate test.  </li>
            <li> only wish they offered a couple of few in the same box</li>
            <li> I dont think they know how to use this properly, and expect a thick peaky lather.  </li>
            <li> Also annoyingly it drips/splashes on the sink, which my old more clumpy?</li>
            <li> Using this along with a Gillette Fusion Proglide I can shave up and down my neck IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS for the smoothest shaves with no red bumps that other razors gave me.</li>
            <li> A single tube last a long time since you use such small amount.  </li>
            <li> but razor burn is nearly a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> got out of the shower, pre-warmed my head and face with hot water before shaving, and applied a steamed wash cloth for approximately 30 to 60 seconds.</li>
            <li> my first shave with the Merkur safety razor tore up my face worse than it&#x27;s ever been torn up.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34; is pretty thin and transparent</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to have the tube sitting loose.  </li>
            <li> So depending on what price you paid, it&#x27;s not very much per month for a smoother, closer shave.  </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t get my technique down I might go back to using it.</li>
            <li> A little definitely goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and the creamy citrus smell is a big plus in my book.</li>
            <li> , I had more nicks on my face than any other time I can remember in the past few years - and I&#x27;m completely serious.  </li>
            <li> The shave left my skin feeling dry and tight around my face.  </li>
            <li> and I definitely will not be going back to the gels that I used in the past.</li>
            <li> and I definitely will not be going back to the gels that I used in the past.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t shave is a small goatee and so-called &amp;#34;soul patch&amp;#34; below my lower lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the current tube of Cremo Cream on July 4, 2014.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t shave is a small goatee and so-called &amp;#34;soul patch&amp;#34; below my lower lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the current tube of Cremo Cream on July 4, 2014.</li>
            <li> I was previously using Neutrogena Skin Clearing Shave Cream, but I&#x27;ll never go back now</li>
            <li> less than $10 a tube here or your local store</li>
            <li> He is now hooked and reluctantly used the rest of the enormous bottle of Jack Black when we got home.</li>
            <li> But mixed in with traditional creams like t.o.b.s makes them really slick.</li>
            <li> I will try the next shave with less than the almond size amount they say to start with.  </li>
            <li> B0034KULLG Bigelow Constant Comment Black Tea, 40 Count Box (2.37OZ)]</li>
            <li> I can shave less often and not have to worry about superiors saying I&#x27;m not shaving close enough and my skin feels healthier.</li>
            <li> When taking cost into consideration (several dollars less than Proraso)</li>
            <li> I actually bought this in Walmart and was a bit skeptical, but after the first use I didn&#x27;t want to use anything else.  </li>
            <li> If it reduces irritation for me it is only slightly.  </li>
            <li> Get the Jack a Black Beard Lube and never look back!</li>
            <li> There has been the occasional bad shave with this cream, maybe I didn&#x27;t wet my face long enough or use hot enough water, or maybe my DE razor needed to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was never able to get a good lather going and got some bad razor drag.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for shaving cream with WOW factor I suggest &amp;#34;Jack Black - Triple Cushion&amp;#34; (it&#x27;s not cheap</li>
            <li> I used a drop a little bigger than a pea on each leg</li>
            <li> It does work as advertised and as they note in the instructions, a little goes a loooong way, meaning you can get a lot of mileage out of one tube versus several cans of shaving foam.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken some trial and error to figure out the proper amount (too little</li>
            <li> so my needs in a shaving cream are probably a little bit different than the cartridge shaver.</li>
            <li> Actually I think Proraso is a a little bit &amp;#34;slicker&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> With Cremo, I only need a little</li>
            <li> , however I was pleasantly surprised that it did not gum up my razor and the &amp;#34;slickness&amp;#34; was maintained with hard water.</li>
            <li> I black, so I only use clippers on my face due to razors breaking me out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works for some folks and its not as bad as others regarding the closeness and cuts from the shave, so thats why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I wet my head and face with the water</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d spoil him instead of his everyday Barbasol brand and is now only wanting me to buy this.  </li>
            <li> I have absolutely no idea</li>
            <li> The shave ended up being rough and</li>
            <li> and so I switched it and gave it another shot a few days later.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been wet shaving with a DE safety razor for almost two years.</li>
            <li> I have a moderately heavy beard with hair growing in multiple directions --</li>
            <li> When shaving, keep the blade wet -- the moisture makes Cremo slicker and the shave closer</li>
            <li> My Norelco is designed for wet shaves</li>
            <li> take a dab of Cremo and smear it around my wet face.</li>
            <li> After a few years of trying various products, I settled on, of all things, Barbasol shave cream....</li>
            <li> it grabs the razor and stretches my skin like rubber, I feel like I would look like the aged Walter Matthau after using it for a month.  </li>
            <li> product is designed to coat the skin in a thin lubricating layer *without much lather at all</li>
            <li> I heard the commercial on Sirius radio and after a few weeks of hearing about the product, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> Despite all that, Cremo provided no real protection for my face.</li>
            <li> Just keep this stuff wet</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a noticeably closer shave with absolutely no burn whatsoever regardless if I am using a disposable razor or a &amp;#34;hi end&amp;#34; DE razor and blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been &#x27;wet shaving&#x27; for a couple of years now</li>
            <li> I spent on it.</li>
            <li> used it a few times,  went back to using soap.  </li>
            <li> I followed instructions carefully - use lots of water resulting in drips everywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for years and tried all kinds of shave creams.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t worry if you aren&#x27;t a fan of pink lemonade</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t lather it, just apply to a wet face and rub it on.  </li>
            <li> I shave everyday, and a tube will last over 9 months.</li>
            <li> I have been using this only a few days</li>
            <li> And unlike Shave Secret which coats your skin in a layer that can&#x27;t be removed simply by shaving, Cremo is like shaving cream in that the action of shaving will remove it as well, leading to another one of my complaints.</li>
            <li> Several years ago I grew tired of the ineffective shaving creams/gels and the wildly overpriced cartridge type blades</li>
            <li> It does not lather well with a brush, but that&#x27;s not a huge issue for me personally.  </li>
            <li> With my thick whiskers, that&#x27;s a thumbnail-sized amount, meaning this product not only outperforms the store brands, but actually saves me</li>
            <li> I hardly ever cut myself, whereas I used to cut myself frequently with the other method.</li>
            <li> After trying it I thought it was ok but found it weird that it didn&#x27;t leave a thick foam on my face like other ones do.</li>
            <li> Bigelow Earl Grey Black Tea, 20 Tea Bags]] and [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> tip-Don&#x27;t use the flip up red cap-it gets a messy build up, instead, just unscrew the red cap and squeeze out a small amount, about a toothpaste</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I find CREAMO CREAM to be a quality product, itâ€™s not as widely marketed as other shave gels</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I find CREAMO CREAM to be a quality product, itâ€™s not as widely marketed as other shave gels</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell, other than that works as expected</li>
            <li> After turning my back to the heavily marketed disposable razors, aerosol creams and other shaving junk, I was actively seeking alternatives to meet my needs.  </li>
            <li> It is not a good fit for mug and brush, the lather is thin.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll end up with a very thin layer of cream that the first few times won&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s enough ...</li>
            <li> Overall I have to say I found this product hard to use, messy, hard to clean up, hard to rinse out of the razor, and ineffective for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way as well...</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of the whole no nicks or red marks claim but it lives up to the hype.</li>
            <li> I should reveal that I usually shave with an [[ASIN:B00CD1QU80 electric shaver]], and only use a blade if I&#x27;ve missed shaving for a few days and my beard is too long for the electric one to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Only need a Small amount</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for years but always gave other brands a chance.</li>
            <li> so I have shaved with the shave gel on one side and the cremo cream on the other.</li>
            <li> Only a small almond sized amount is needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not any slicker than any other quality creams.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s activated by water and invented by some genius scientist who&#x27;s invented other well known things we use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the result that the other reviews did.  </li>
            <li> Mixes well with any of my other soaps.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely course beard, and shave 6 days per week.....</li>
            <li> I can now shave my face every other day if needed.</li>
            <li> Everything that all the other 5-star reviews say.</li>
            <li> After hearing someone rave about this stuff the other day I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> It took some getting used to the much smaller quantity of cream on my face and the slick texture.</li>
            <li> I used to have problems going against the grain on my neck, but with this stuff I don&#x27;t get the ingrown hairs that I used to get with the other products.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say since the label and website don&#x27;t mention it, and unlike some other reviewers, my attempts to contact the company have been unsuccessful.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how well this works with other razors, but with the Pro Glide it works wonders.</li>
            <li> , I actually returned it to the store to exchange for my usual shaving soap and not be out the $9</li>
            <li> Good shave cream, but why not add a few pennies to the cost and use real essential oil and not the horrible synthetic scent?</li>
            <li> I hope you will try it after reading my post along with other user posts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably used 50 different kinds of shaving creams throughout my life, if not more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd tube and this stuff is slick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given all my other gels and foams to my sons.</li>
            <li> It does feel slick and the blade (Merkur) slides well enough; I have not nicked myself.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a convert and will never buy any other.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes the cream is tacky to the touch and requires the addition of more water to use it again, which isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> so I did research and purchased a samoug brush, and still same results, I&#x27;ve tried different techniques and still not great lather.</li>
            <li> I have a difficult face to shave with a coarse beard and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I read some of the bad reviews and it is plain many people try to make this stuff foam.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking for an alternative to conventional shaving foam and happened across this in the store.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s faint, and certainly doesn&#x27;t warrant dropping this to 4</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feels like you are putting a little silky lotion on your wet skin.</li>
            <li> only downside is that it&#x27;s hard to follow the directions when you are not doing it in the shower</li>
            <li> The entire secret is having enough water on your face and just use a little bit of the product</li>
            <li> You hardly have to use any, so this small container will last a long time and since it doesn&#x27;t wash away if you get water on area</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not stay slick for long.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the smell-</li>
            <li> I have also noticed it doesn&#x27;t make a mess of my sink like other shave creams and gels have in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has lasted a long time because I usually use just the recommneded &amp;#34;almond&amp;#34; sized</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I really get put off by overblown claims in the description a manufacturer says about</li>
            <li> so its not really an issue unless you like to go a few days between shaves (I can&#x27;t,</li>
            <li> I felt the shave on the cremo side was far worse, but it could be I was a bit timid from the cuts.</li>
            <li> you have a thin and/or soft beard</li>
            <li> I have a thick, coarse beard.</li>
            <li> It produces a thin, light lather that doesn&#x27;t require hardly any force with the razor, and it&#x27;s very slick.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t pin down what itsmells like.  </li>
            <li> My Face  push down spout dispensing plastic bottles.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve got it down now</li>
            <li> one beats them all hands down.</li>
            <li> The lather is lighter and &amp;#34;fluffier&amp;#34; than other creams instead of the thick lather you might be used to with similar products, but I find the Cremo to be much slick or slippery than other brands</li>
            <li> Yes it was slick, but had to be re-wetted three or four times just to make a single pass.  </li>
            <li> and you can rub it in your hands and apply it without half of it running down your wrist or arm.  </li>
            <li> You only need to you a very small amount - about the size of dime/nickel.</li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount to cover your face.</li>
            <li> completely simple and idiot proof; get your face wet with hot water, rub it in and shave.  </li>
            <li> I have much less razor burn and skin issues.</li>
            <li> find I cut myself much less with it.  </li>
            <li> But since I shave my head in the shower and do not use a mirror to see the back of my head, it&#x27;s difficult to differentiate between what is the tackiness left by Proraso and what is stubble that I missed shaving.  </li>
            <li> I was previously an exclusive user of Headslick, until I tried Cremo.  </li>
            <li> I previously reviewed the 3oz.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this on vacation one year, as he had forgotten his Jack Black Beard Lube and this was all they had at CVS.</li>
            <li> I think I would get the Cremo again because I like a less scented and less tingly feeling shave.</li>
            <li> and there is less residue to wash off the razor and face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a typical cartridge blade user who shaves in the shower, using Edge gel or the like.</li>
            <li> There is a slight citrus smell to it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used everything from Clinique to Jack Black to King of Shaves and everything in between.</li>
            <li> No nicks, less irritation, and a smoother shave.</li>
            <li> typically shave every two or three days, so my beard is always a challenge.</li>
            <li> and I found myself using almost half the tube up in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As the tube empties and gets to half or less</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get as close a shave on my legs or bikini line, but I had a lot less razor burn.</li>
            <li> â€¦ itâ€™s the only product Iâ€™ve ever used that minimizes the uncomfortable tugging associated with shaving longer facial hair.er</li>
            <li> â€¦ itâ€™s the only product Iâ€™ve ever used that minimizes the uncomfortable tugging associated with shaving longer facial hair.</li>
            <li> and you tend to use less per shave.</li>
            <li> and I find it nicer to have less to rinse off the razor - and</li>
            <li> the (slight) downside</li>
            <li> Not only is it not superior</li>
            <li> I tried this product with various states of hydration and it was no good in all states.  </li>
            <li> It does provide a slick surface, but you do need to keep your face wet</li>
            <li> I put a small dab on a wet brush and work up a lather.</li>
            <li> Hardly any razor bumps and lasts a long time!  </li>
            <li> To maximize performance, use very little (a tube lasts a long time)and add continuous small amounts of water while shaving.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is product didn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s hype for me.</li>
            <li> Picked up randomly at Walgreens, but can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy for me to find and it beats the crap out of air-lubricated foams.</li>
            <li> lather I got from this product was pretty much the worst lather imaginable.  </li>
            <li> I rub my hands together a little and rub it into the skin on my head and face in circular motions</li>
            <li> A little dab will do.</li>
            <li> But, just use a little.</li>
            <li> I think this product is a little overhyped by all the ratings on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> and it lathers up with just a little water from the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Work well just wish it was a little slicker.</li>
            <li> I discovered was to rub Cremo between my hands a little bit before applying to my face.</li>
            <li> wife purchased Cremo cream for me as a little stocking stuffer a year or two ago.</li>
            <li> I had difficulty finding my usual shave cream (tube variety, not from a can), and decided to look at some reviews of other shave creams and to try these three and compare:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In years past, I tried some other  creams but they made me break out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cremo for a little over three weeks ...</li>
            <li> I also find Proraso feels a little drying on the skin.</li>
            <li> It is a fraction of the cost of the Murad (minus a few of the Murad exfoliating extra&#x27;s, I guess) and still less expensive than Anthony.  </li>
            <li> The Prorasso product I&#x27;m referring to is the red striped tube (for tough beards) that had a scent that reminded of an old-school barber shop...</li>
            <li> Thumbs Down!</li>
            <li> With regular shaving cream his razor burn was out of control and he was cutting his neck fairly regularly.</li>
            <li> This is by far the slickest and least irritating.</li>
            <li> I have since switched to Shave Secret Shaving Oil and won&#x27;t switch back.</li>
            <li> Not sticky, per se but not nearly as smooth as Cremo.</li>
            <li> , I use a gilette 5 blade razor and get a few cuts.  </li>
            <li> I shave everyday</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s when i realized the lather, foaming, bla bla bla - not important.  </li>
            <li> I feel that I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving with Cremo for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Nicked myself a few times before I found this.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently began shaving my head, and the amount of Shave Secret</li>
            <li> But not only will that give you a worse shave, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a cheap can of sticky foam.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time writing this review if I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many kinds of sensitive skin shaving creams and gels over the years and was used to cutting and scraping myself bloody.</li>
            <li> I even ruined a few shirts.</li>
            <li> I used to be a fan of Palmolive green tube but that disappeared years ago.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and you tend to waste a lot).</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I use a razor from the .99 cent store and I have a heavy werewolf beard.</li>
            <li> I now shave everyday, one pass with the grain, using a Parker 26C.</li>
            <li> Not a smooth glide all the time as promised.</li>
            <li> But if it works for me, with a heavy beard, it should work for everybody.</li>
            <li> Some days I like it, other days its greasy and hard to shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve trashed all the other expensive creams and gels, and a big plus is I don&#x27;t even have to use after-shave!</li>
            <li> Hard to compare to other products.  </li>
            <li> Not much lather, but a very slick and slippery cushion for the blade.  </li>
            <li> and I will say with a stiff brush and a bit of effort you can get it to lather.  </li>
            <li> The Axe stuff was pretty bad...</li>
            <li> The gels I used in the past came in pressurized containers that always ended up messy and sometimes even rust would form on the canister</li>
            <li> The gels I used in the past came in pressurized containers that always ended up messy and sometimes even rust would form on the canister</li>
            <li> me use blades a few weeks longer than I ordinarily would have&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is weird, shaving with such a low visibility and thin product.</li>
            <li> I am currently deployed overseas and the small chapel on our base has a room where care packages sent to unspecified military members are left out for anyone to rifle through.</li>
            <li> Oh well, I like to live life dangerously.</li>
            <li> it lasted a little over 6 months!  </li>
            <li> Lot&#x27;s of hype but delivers very little.</li>
            <li> No better than than hi-quality shave creams (Aveeno, Nivea)</li>
            <li> it is impossibly slick.</li>
            <li> I am not sure but a tube may have lasted me 1 year.  </li>
            <li> for the skin softeners, I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> I usually place aftershave moisturizing lotion on my face immediately after shaving, so I dont know if their skin softeners work or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But I usually like unscented stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You really can&#x27;t go wrong with either of these terrific products.</li>
            <li> I applied the cream as per the instructions with a small amount and using water to activate it.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount is needed, and you can rinse your face and touch-up without reapplying.  </li>
            <li> They bill it as a slick gliding shave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually get nicks and irritation with Dove soap.</li>
            <li> This cream goes on slick and lets me shave up to three times with one application.</li>
            <li> /&gt;NO lies.. this thing is SLICK and re-slicks well.  </li>
            <li> Same lousy bumps and redness again.</li>
            <li> I have used creams in the past e.g. Aveda &amp; Bath &amp; Body Works.  </li>
            <li> This one works as well if not better at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> did have to keep re-wetting my face to keep the slick factor going...</li>
            <li> Just use a small dab and spread it all over.  </li>
            <li> It is indeed a slick product.</li>
            <li> So a tube might last me 10-15 shaves, and at $6 a tube, that&#x27;s a bit expensive.  </li>
            <li> Thank&#x27;s to Amazon, I found one brand that worked well but was very expensive, came in a harder plastic bottle and left waxy residue on the shaver and</li>
            <li> It is a step out of the ordinary that we have become accustomed to and because of that, your face will thank you...and anything else you need to shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> SLICK WATER</li>
            <li> -- Put a small amount of Cremo on your finger tips.  </li>
            <li> and I usually do three.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is not memorable.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this a try as my usual shaving cream (Aveeno Oatmeal) appears to have vanished from the stores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your face slick</li>
            <li> I have two cans of some other brand foam in my cabinet that I will have to donate to some unfortunate charity as I will never wish that other stuff on anyone now that I&#x27;ve tried your product.</li>
            <li> over the past two decades.</li>
            <li> no better then canned cream</li>
            <li> It was pointless.  </li>
            <li> It works, but not better.</li>
            <li> No sure why the others are so jacked off on the product.</li>
            <li> purchased Creamo on a whim as I was running out of my usual gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply</li>
            <li> Not sure why they felt compelled to make a &amp;#34;lady&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll gunk up your razor as you shave and requires excessive rinsing.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely slick.</li>
            <li> Apply a small dollop and massage onto skin.</li>
            <li> No more nicks, no more razor burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what that ingredient is.  </li>
            <li> It was meant to be a short term solution until I got to the fancy shaving store to buy there highly expensive luxury shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t particularly slick, and it clogs in the razor.  </li>
            <li> No more hair pulling.</li>
            <li> slick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> May seem expensive, but you only use a small amount so the tube lasted  him for months.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and can only shave every few days without it being very painful.</li>
            <li> Very few nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> Apply only a very thin layer to your skin before shaving.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased a lot of items on Amazon and written very few reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for 2 mos now and am addicted to studying, reading, and trying products and honing in on that &amp;#34;perfect shave&amp;#34; (especially i&#x27;m a tough cookie with sensitive skin yet extremely strong/thick hair</li>
            <li> For example, I use two razors - a Gillette Sensor (cheaper) for my face and a Gillette Mach 3 (more expensive) for my head - because blades are crazy expensive</li>
            <li> The smell is certainly not overwhelming as some reviews say, and I think the scent fades quickly, or at least blends with my aftershave.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t very slick, it offered no buffer and my face was raw all day.</li>
            <li> The smell is annoying, the taste is horrible and it burns your eyes much worse than almost anything I&#x27;ve experienced short of mace.</li>
            <li> Not *quite* to the level of razor burn, but an uncomfortable, tight feeling like a slight sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and shaving used to be a painful process, this has blown my mind.</li>
            <li> Some of the claims made by the manufacturer seem hard to believe.</li>
            <li> Hard to imagine that after you&#x27;ve shaved once, you add a splash of water and your face is slicker than ever.</li>
            <li> And you hardly have to use any to coat your beard.</li>
            <li> I like how my skin feels after shaving but in some areas of my face and neck its hard to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> Cremo is hard to rinse out of a double-edge single-bladed safety razor and tended to &amp;#34;gum up&amp;#34; the blade.</li>
            <li> This stuff sticks to your skin - hard to wash off.  </li>
            <li> This does it very well without alcohol or stupid foam.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read almost all of the negative reviews, and they show a misunderstanding of what to expect and of how to use this product.</li>
            <li> Or it least it never was for me.</li>
            <li> What surprises me is that I spent lots of money buying shaving cream, a brush and pre-shave oil from the art of shaving, and Cremo cream beats that expensive combo</li>
            <li> Do not warm in tube.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sucks and you can buy in walmart for cheaper.</li>
            <li> After each disappointment, he comes back to this tried-and-true Cremo.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for anyone to try at least one tube.</li>
            <li> It is basically just a thick lotion on your face.  </li>
            <li> Though it is a bit thick and won&#x27;t drain from the dispenser fully, it does work well in there.</li>
            <li> I have used Shave Secret for a few years.</li>
            <li> Thick cream.  </li>
            <li> It is the definition of a 3 star rating - I&#x27;m not going to throw the rest of the tube away because I hate it so much</li>
            <li> I wont be using this again unless I am forced to.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make a thick foam</li>
            <li> Like the packaging says, this stuff is rediculously slick!</li>
            <li> Expensive as compared to other shaving products.</li>
            <li> Very slick stuff</li>
            <li> Very slick and softens well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I do prefer the foam ones and this one despite being very slick it doesn&#x27;t work well for me for the fact that it doesn&#x27;t lather.</li>
            <li> Very Slick.  </li>
            <li> Bed Bath &amp; Beyond with coupon is less expensive</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Difficult to impossible to rinse from my double edge razor much less my face.</li>
            <li> They seriously need to rethink the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gets so bad that my face breaks out in rashes and bumps from daily shaving.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as the ratings would have you believe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Die Hard Brush And Cream / Soap Shaving Fan!</li>
            <li> Recently I became very frustrated with the affects of shaving everyday on my neck.  </li>
            <li> Too bad it took me so long to come across getting this product.  </li>
            <li> This stuff makes your face so slick that your nose just about slides off your face if you get careless with it..</li>
            <li> The smoother the cutting blade travels down the skin the smoother the results.</li>
            <li> Creates very thin but slick lather.  </li>
            <li> Very thick and sticks to sink.</li>
            <li> If you want mountains of white foamy shave cream on your face, you&#x27;ve got the wrong product!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy how little it takes.  </li>
            <li> Introduced to my husband who had been using Shave Secret.  </li>
            <li> Secret always clogged my razors.  </li>
            <li> I actually use Cremo as a base before applying my D R Harris soap with my brush.  </li>
            <li> I tried.&lt;br /&gt;One thin coat will work like it says.  </li>
            <li> complaint is the smell is a weird citrus-y/medicine-y smell that isn&#x27;t altogether pleasing.</li>
            <li> The cream does not give you any foam, just a thin layer on your skin.</li>
            <li> Shaving used to be such an ultra-expensive necessity between the multi-blade razors and worthless creams.  </li>
            <li> Now the game changer.  </li>
            <li> flat out hate it.</li>
            <li> The bad or less than 4 reviews seem to me like they do not know how to use it?</li>
            <li> I am sad to report that I really found this product horrible.</li>
            <li> He had trouble shaving with breakouts, and on his legs got bad razor bumps and burn.  </li>
            <li> so I think I will use this as a base before my other creams.</li>
            <li> Been using this for 8 months now, it&#x27;s difficult to build a lather, I thought it was my brush</li>
            <li> All this means to me is, I have to stick with the expensive Crabtree and Evelyn brand.  </li>
            <li> Its expensive, but its the closest shave I get and get zero cuts (almost all the time).  </li>
            <li> I ordered this for my hubby,  unfortunately he hasn&#x27;t got to use it</li>
            <li> Third night I used a Derby blade and didn&#x27;t cut myself but had a horrible shave on each side.</li>
            <li> so when I ran out of my expensive cream I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Anyway,  I give it 3 stars for being mediocre for the price.  </li>
            <li> Even she is not impressed.</li>
            <li> perhaps a bit expensive, but, keep you longer and quality shaving cream...</li>
            <li> Not impressed..</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product merely by happenstance.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to squeeze the product out and onto my finger tips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from spray foam to expensive creams to shaving soap whisked with distillers water with a silvertip badger brush.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to throw away those lousy Gillette disposable razors that never give me a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> A very thin film does the job.</li>
            <li> The goal is to have a very thin layer - and your razor will glide across your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thin cream.  </li>
            <li> It provides a very thin lubricating layer between the skin and blade.</li>
            <li> It smells like a creamsicle bar or drink, with an artificial orange scent.  </li>
            <li> and I end up cutting myself.  </li>
            <li> I had to rub it like crazy to spread it across my face.</li>
            <li> Shaving will be like cutting through butter...</li>
            <li> Sorry to say I was somewhat disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have not always followed this instruction, but I have yet to experience a bad shave with this cream.  </li>
            <li> It was so bad</li>
            <li> My face breaks out after shaving so bad that I had given up shaving against the grain altogether.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It failed miserably.</li>
            <li> Man, was I disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Whether for yourself, for a friend, your partner, or your hairy gym bud, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I admit that I hate shaving</li>
            <li> I find this product annoying.  </li>
            <li> And knock one off for having annoying &amp;#34;founders&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> CRAP.</li>
            <li> But the fact that it dries up soquickly is annoying.</li>
            <li> I used the Edge crap for years until Dollar Shave Club turned me on to Shave Butter.</li>
            <li> It smells citrusy, which isn&#x27;t terrible or particularly bad</li>
            <li> Ditch your cruddy shave gel now; you owe it to your face.</li>
            <li> I have a horrible time with redness and irritation after shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with creams for years, and this is the worst I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> but this is the worst stuff I&#x27;ve used I can remember.  </li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, who always has terrible razor burn.</li>
            <li> Ignore the 5 star reviews praising the scent, it smells like rotting oranges, is overpowering, and lingers all day like a nasty hangover.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have always had trouble with razor burn, but this shaving cream fixed it for me.  I have been using it for almost two years.  Each bottle has enough cream to last over 100 shaves for me.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> All the good things you have read about this product is true, and I will add one thing in addition to the close shave, ease of use, lack of cuts, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff will not clog your razor. A pet peeve of mine is that some of these creams take forever to rinse out of the razor, especially if your sink&#x27;s water pressure is low. This rinses easily, so if you don&#x27;t have high water pressure, this could be the shave cream for you.</li>
            <li> This is the best shave cream I&#x27;ve ever used, including shave gels or bars. I was surprised on how good this was. My face was very smooth. It also smells really good, almost citrus smelling. This is one of the products that I am placing on my &amp;#34;exclusive use for life&amp;#34; list.</li>
            <li> Best shaving product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would be writing a review on shaving cream, however this product deserves praise. Let me start by admitting that I have not tried very many different shaving creams in my lifetime. Although I do have fairly sensitive skin, more so when I was in my teens and twenties, I just never really put much thought into the type of cream I used. I always believed that the type of razor mattered most, and thus I always gravitated toward the latest and greatest Gillette had to offer, finally settling on their Fusion 5 blade razor. As for shaving creams, I have always purchased the gels from Gillette or Edge. I have used foams from time to time but never really cared for them and only really used them if I had to purchase a travel size of if they were provided at a hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began researching different shave creams/gels when I decided to purchase bulk toiletries on Amazon and a simple search for shave creams returned more options than I had time to consider. I quickly narrowed my search down to some shave soaps and this product based on reviews alone. All of them had excellent reviews and probably all would have been worthy of purchase, however I did not have a badger hair brush so I decided to give Cremo a try. The price point on Cremo was much more attractive than the soaps and only a few dollars more than the gels I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cremo arrived a week ago and in that time I have shaved three times. I followed the instructions to a tee, choosing the hot water with a cloth option since I do not like to shave in the shower. The Cremo Cream lathered nicely on my skin, almost invisible but not so much that I couldn&#x27;t tell it was on. It lubricates my skin exceptionally well and permits my razor to glide smoothly allowing an extra close shave. I apply Cremo twice per shave,  the first time so that I can shave with the grain, then I apply it once more and shave against the grain. Rinsing off the cream was very easy and fast, and my skin felt very smooth to the touch and refreshing. It also has a very nice smell which I have come to appreciate. The verdict for me is that the is a very satisfying shave cream and I definitely will not be going back to the gels that I used in the past. One more thing I really appreciate about this is the tube it comes in. The gels I used in the past came in pressurized containers that always ended up messy and sometimes even rust would form on the canister no matter how hard I tried to keep them clean and dry. The squeeze tube that Cremo comes in is very easy to keep clean and it does not ooze out after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are interested, I used this cream with a Gillette Fusion 5 blade the first two shaves and a Edwin Jagger DE89 Lbl for the last shave. While searching for shave creams I stumbled across double edge razors and decided to try one out. You can see my review for the double edge under the Edwin Jagger DE89 Lbl. I have only shaved one time with the Edwin Jagger and I already know that I am sticking with it. The Edwin Jagger combined with the Cremo Cream was the best shave I have ever experienced. I now know that creams and razors matter and only wish that I had considered these great products years earlier.very smooth to the touch and refreshing.

            <li> great product, using water as hot as you can take it before application really makes the product shine.</li>
            <li> Been using this for 8 months now, it&#x27;s difficult to build a lather, I thought it was my brush so I did research and purchased a samoug brush, and still same results, I&#x27;ve tried different techniques and still not great lather. Hope you guys have better results.  Update 6/17/2015   User error by me, this is a very simple soap to use, wet the face squeeze out an almond size into your hands and apply to face in a circular motion.  Very slick stuff, scent is lite. To me this is a top soap for travel, I&#x27;m more of a traditional way shave guy and prefer to use a brush and lather up soap.</li>
            <li> No better than than hi-quality shave creams (Aveeno, Nivea) but a lot more expensive. Why?&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s in this stuff, diamond dust?</li>
            <li> Honestly, the best shave cream you&#x27;re going to get for the money. Great product, good smell. Customer for life.</li>
            <li> Lot&#x27;s of hype but delivers very little. I would gotten a better shave with Barbasol or Edge gel.</li>
            <li> The cream lathers well but it tends to wear off  easy</li>
            <li> This is just the best shaving cream ever. It lasts forever and really gives you the best shave for men and women.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions on the tube labeled &amp;#34;STOP! Read this first&amp;#34; so I know I did it right. I was never able to get a good lather going and got some bad razor drag. Not sure if this is just the nature of a cream vs a soap, but in my experience, this wasn&#x27;t very good. I ended up throwing the rest away.</li>
            <li> Stop the presses; This is better than advertised. I have been working thru several shave creams since returning to a DE razor. I was able to work up a good lather with my brush,enough for 3 passes,no pulling from the Astra blades, smells good and the shave is absolutely unbelivable. I do think I have found the creme that I am going to combine with KMF Cool Mint just for a change-up. They both are very good cremes. The price is very reasonable. This 6 oz. tube should last awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for other brands,not nearly as effective as this.</li>
            <li> I bought a tube of this after hearing an enthusiastic radio advertisement for it.  I normally use a [[ASIN:B00T7WNHK2 shaving gel]] and a [[ASIN:B003EMVVMM Gillette Fusion Razor]], and only experience nicks or cuts when using a new blade for the first time.  I should reveal that I usually shave with an [[ASIN:B00CD1QU80 electric shaver]], and only use a blade if I&#x27;ve missed shaving for a few days and my beard is too long for the electric one to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While shaving with Cremo is comfortable, it&#x27;s much harder to apply than gel, and an \\&quot;almond-sized\\&quot; amount is completely insufficient (although it might work with only one day&#x27;s growth).  It&#x27;s also harder to wash off the razor (although I don&#x27;t have to wash it off as frequently since less of it accumulates than gel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an interesting product, probably more appropriate for a barbershop than for home use.</li>
            <li> Not much lather, but a very slick and slippery cushion for the blade.  Takes a little experimenting, but worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to DE and brush shaving a couple of years ago.  While the shaves are better, finding a decent soap or cream is difficult at any price point.  Most leave my face irritated and dry feeling, which makes after-shave balm a necessity.  Cremo is intended to be brushless, but I find that applying a small dot to a wet brush before each of 2-3 passes works fine.  As the package says, less is more.</li>
            <li> What an awesome product! I have sensitive skin and this has really worked especially during the winter when I have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> The best shaving cream I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> In my 68 years, I have always prided myself in good grooming and especially a great shave. In the search for the perfect shave I have spent north of $25 for 6 oz. of shave cream, and an additional $15 on pre-shave oil. Now I tried Creamo because of the radio ad. This is the BEST sheve cream I have ever used, even removing the need for shaving oil. With this I am getting a better shave and saving 75% in the process!</li>
            <li> I have a difficult face to shave with a coarse beard and sensitive skin.  I am in my 60s so have been around long enough to have tried it all.  This stuff is fantastic.  It shaves so closely, you can skip a day with no sweat.  It is really comfortable with no burn or nicks.  I read some of the bad reviews and it is plain many people try to make this stuff foam.  It will not foam.  It also seems they do not use enough water.  Forget all you know about shaving and follow the directions.  You will not be disappointed.  This is the best shave cream I have ever used without exception.</li>
            <li> They are right- it is impossibly slick. A little goes a very long way. I am not sure but a tube may have lasted me 1 year.  Big fan and will be my go-to from now on.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve used, and that includes proraso, some soaps with a badger brush, etc. Really works well for me and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Ive had better, almost prefer a good slippery foam.</li>
            <li> For my birthday (yesterday 9/12), my wife took this item off my Amazon wish list. First the results are fantastic if you are coming from a \\&quot;can\\&quot; of shave creme. I read the instructions TWICE and tried to follow them to the letter. I don&#x27;t like the idea of shaving in the shower as our water bill is high enough without spending more time in the shower shaving. So I use warm sink water. First the instructions are wrong in regards to how much you should use. The instructions call for about a almond size amount! This &#x3D; way TOO Much. Tomorrow I am going to try about a pea (the vegatable) size, and warm sink water. I shaved but did not rinse my face. I added warm water and shaved those areas I missed the first time again. Then washed off my face. My goodness it is 4 hrs since I shaved and my face is silky smooth. I have never had such a great shaving results!</li>
            <li> Tried many shaving creams. This one is as smooth as it gets. Love it!</li>
            <li> Closest shave I have ever had.  Love this stuff.  Smells good too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read almost all of the negative reviews, and they show a misunderstanding of what to expect and of how to use this product. So I&#x27;ve divided this review into the following labeled sections:&lt;br /&gt;  1. MY PERSPECTIVE&lt;br /&gt;  2. WHAT TO EXPECT ON FIRST USE&lt;br /&gt;  3. HOW I SHAVE WITH CREMO CREAM&lt;br /&gt;  4. HOW LONG DOES A TUBE OF CREMO CREAM LAST?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s get going...&lt;br /&gt;1. MY PERSPECTIVE&lt;br /&gt;This review is for both head shavers and others. I mention this only because those of us who shave our heads are especially cautious about our products. For example, I use two razors - a Gillette Sensor (cheaper) for my face and a Gillette Mach 3 (more expensive) for my head - because blades are crazy expensive but I feel the need to invest more in my scalp. Before I switched to Cremo I used Aveeno Positively Smooth Shave Gel exclusively for years. I still say it is the best shave gel and the only thing I would use if Cremo weren&#x27;t available. A can of Positively Smooth costs about the same as a tube of Cremo Cream but it lasts perhaps 1/5th as long and isn&#x27;t as good. If Cremo went out of business or changed its formula, I would switch back to Aveeno. I hope that never happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. WHAT TO EXPECT ON FIRST USE&lt;br /&gt;See the next section for specifics on how I use Cremo. The package claims that it creates a light lather. I think that&#x27;s a misleading statement. When you wet your skin and apply the cream in the appropriate proportion, you may see a little white cream on your skin at first, but it will be very little and will likely disappear very quickly. Don&#x27;t worry - it&#x27;s still there and will still protect you well. It is simply not made to create a lather. Expect more like what you&#x27;d  experience with a skin conditioning cream or hand lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll also feel a sort of gritty texture at first. I&#x27;m not certain the purpose of this - maybe the grit contains some of the magic. But it doesn&#x27;t stay like an exfoliator would. The grit disappears quickly too. Because the cream and grit disappear quickly, you&#x27;ll need to switch your mindset from knowing where to shave by where there&#x27;s still foam to knowing where to shave by where there&#x27;s still stubble. It&#x27;s an easy switch, and I&#x27;ve grown to prefer it this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, you will probably feel a little more &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; against the stubble than you&#x27;re used to. This actually took me the most to get used to. It doesn&#x27;t hurt, it&#x27;s just different from the feel of shaving with other products. I&#x27;ve realized that the upside of this is that you are getting a much closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. HOW I SHAVE WITH CREMO CREAM&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my method and the one I recommend to everyone. If you don&#x27;t shave your head you can easily adapt it to your needs.&lt;br /&gt;  a. I fill the sink with very hot water&lt;br /&gt;  b. I wet my head and face with the water&lt;br /&gt;  c. I squeeze an amount of Cremo into my hand that is only about the amount of toothpaste advertisers show on toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;  d. I rub my hands together a little and rub it into the skin on my head and face in circular motions&lt;br /&gt;  e. I re-wet my hands a little and pat fresh hot water on my head only&lt;br /&gt;  f. I shave my head as normal (I ALWAYS shave against the growth) - I rinse my razor in the sink frequently&lt;br /&gt;  g. I re-wet my hands and rub the water on my face to re-activate the Cremo that I put there before&lt;br /&gt;  h. I shave my face (again, always against the growth, and again rinsing the razor frequently)&lt;br /&gt;  i. When done I simply rub the remaining Cremo into my skin. It makes a nice conditioner too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. HOW LONG DOES A TUBE OF CREMO CREAM LAST?&lt;br /&gt;Much longer than the tube says! I am now on my 3rd tube of Cremo Cream. This time I decided to measure how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First you should know that I have an extra-large head (XL hats don&#x27;t fit me), I have a very coarse beard, and the hair on my head is somewhat coarse too. Both grow back enough to shave once per day, but to be economical I actually shave every 1.5 days (if I shave this morning, my next shave will be tomorrow night, etc.). I also shave the back of my neck once per week but I don&#x27;t increase the amount of Cremo I use. The only thing I don&#x27;t shave is a small goatee and so-called &amp;#34;soul patch&amp;#34; below my lower lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the current tube of Cremo Cream on July 4, 2014. Today is January 2, 2015 - 6 months later. I&#x27;m certain I still have enough in the tube for at least another month!&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;EDIT&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;My tube finally ran out today. It lasted for this headshaver from July 4, 2014 to March 3 2015, 8 months. You can&#x27;t beat this for around $6-$7, and you get the best shave as well!lly shave every 1.5 days (if I shave this morning, my next shave will be tomorrow night, etc.). I also shave the back of my neck once per week but I don&#x27;t increase the amount of Cremo I use.

            <li> Probably the best shaving cream I have ever used.  Reduced cuts and bumps significantly.  Also, 1 bottle lasts a very longtime.  I would probably use 4 to 6 cans of shave cream in the time I used 1 bottle of Cremo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for 50 years and using Cremo Cream for about two years.  It&#x27;s the best shave product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I recently went back to using a safety razor and double edge blades motivated by sticker shock over the price of cartridge blade replacements.  I tried using a brush and shaving soap, but quickly returned to Cremo Cream--closer shave and no nicks, so far.  Lately, I&#x27;ve experimented with adding two drops of shaving oil (Somersets) to my dab of Cremo and that works even better!  As other reviewers note, follow the instructions when applying--wet hands and wet face are important..&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is Cremo staying on the market.  I notice that it has migrated to the bottom shelf at several local retailers.</li>
            <li> Keep skin soft and smooth.  A single tube last a long time since you use such small amount.  Does not gum up the drains and makes for easy clean up when shave is finished.  A tube usually last me 3 to 4 months shaving daily.</li>
            <li> I apply my dime sized amount with a brush and find that it lathers just fine for me.  While not necessary, I find the wet brush method a more enjoyable part of shave prep.  This product is nicely scented, really softens the skin and makes it slick enough for a razor to comfortably glide over facial contours with amazing ease.  The result is a burn and knick free shave that allows you to reactivate selected areas by simply rubbing again with a bit of warm water.  A cool water rinse at the conclusion of the shave caps off a great shaving experience.....at a very affordable price.  I highly recommend Cremo.  Treat youself and give it a try!!</li>
            <li> It really works.  The entire secret is having enough water on your face and just use a little bit of the product</li>
            <li> Great shave every time.</li>
            <li> Gives me a great shave. It really is better than the normal canned shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This stuff is outstanding.  Once you use it, as it says on the package, you will use it for life.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL...different ....but WONDERFUL, especially on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery</li>
            <li> started using this with a safty razor and have gotten the best shave ever! has a clean scent and I have saved $$$</li>
            <li> The lather of this really reminds my husband of the old fashion soap and brush application.  It makes for a smooth and comfortable shave and the smell is wonderful with a very mild citrus influence.  Dispensing is also very clean as the cream comes out in a toothpaste consistency.  He really hates the gel in a can stuff that continually expands after the cap is replaced - creating a gooey mess for the next shave.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I have been spoiled by this product. I will never use regular soap or regular shaving cream/gel again.</li>
            <li> Love it. I have much less razor burn and skin issues. Love the scent as well.</li>
            <li> At first, wasn&#x27;t used to needing only a thin layer. Quickly adapted and really impressed by how close and smooth a shave is by using this product. Smells nice like an Orange peel. A little pricey and worth it. Now a new regular customer for this product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  I  shave q 3 days because this stuff allows that goodovva clean shave. My razor blades last longer too because this stuff softens my gruff beard that good. Baught 5 tubes.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is surprisingly good and a single tube lasts a long time.  I tried this the first time because I had a coupon for a free tube.  Otherwise, I probably never would have taken the plunge.  This is now the only shave cream I will use.  I get a great close shave and I don&#x27;t suffer any irritation to my skin when using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very different than traditional shave creams.  If you follow the directions, which I recommend, you will think you do not have enough product on your face.  Go ahead and shave anyway.  You will find that your face is well lubricated and that you do not need to have your face buried in foam.  One advantage is you can see where you are shaving much better than with traditional shaving creams.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Price not so much.  Bed Bath &amp; Beyond with coupon is less expensive</li>
            <li> This cream works great and lasts a lot longer than expected.</li>
            <li> great , makes shaving easier</li>
            <li> Like the bottle says -- it works astonishingly well.  Best shave I have ever had -- couldn&#x27;t believe it.  Monday shaving is normally a bit rough for me.  This stuff took my whiskers off like it was butter.  They claim to just being super slippery -- but it seemed like it must have softened my whiskers.  At any rate, if you have sensitive skin and shaving is sometimes a problem for you -- definitely get this stuff.</li>
            <li> This shave cream is a nice alternative to the regular canned shave creams.  I do Like the light scent and it gives a nice smooth feel once you are finished.</li>
            <li> Heard it advertised on the Savage Nation radio program&lt;br /&gt;Works great.&lt;br /&gt;One tip-Don&#x27;t use the flip up red cap-it gets a messy build up, instead, just unscrew the red cap and squeeze out a small amount, about a toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;load. A little goes a long way with my Merkur Progress Long-Handle Adjustable Safety Razor #510 !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aerosol shaving foams are a rip off-(mostly propellant) as are cartridge razors-(over priced, and dull fast)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not messing around with this stuff. I get a remarkably closer shave with this cream than with a grocery store cream or gel. You really don&#x27;t need to use muchâ€”I think the packaging recommends a quarter-size dollop, and I think you could even get away with a little less. Because you&#x27;re massaging it into your skin, it really is best to shave right after a shower, when your face is softest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crucially, the smell is the right mix of pleasant and masculine. Highly recommended. Ditch your cruddy shave gel now; you owe it to your face.</li>
            <li> You will never use normal shaving cream again...I guarantee it. My face literally turned into a baby&#x27;s butt without the hourly diaper change. Oh so smooth.</li>
            <li> Made the switch to the this from regular sensitive shaving cream and boy am I glad I did.  Far fewer skin bumps after shaving and this really goes along way.</li>
            <li> Whether I am using a brush or rubbing it straight on a wet face, it works well and keep my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, one the greatest shaving creams I have found - I use it daily and it doesn&#x27;t leave any scents or dry skin.  Been using it for over 2 years and have no desire to even try anything else.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream I&#x27;ve used in my life. No joke!  Smooth and no razor burn. Incredible stuff. I&#x27;m sold on it. Not sure how it works, but compared to the cheap gel I was using g, it is night and day difference. Buy it. You won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> I suppose this is a product meant for men, but I&#x27;m writing this so that women know how great this stuff is! My boyfriend uses this on his head, he loves it, so he put it in the shower and told me to try it. I fell in love!! After 27 years of trying literally everything in the book, hands down this is the best. I used a drop a little bigger than a pea on each leg and it was plenty. It&#x27;s the smoothest my legs have ever felt and the smell is sort of a light orange, its really nice. Sooo.....it worked so well on my legs....I tried it in, um..other places. No nicks AT ALL!  I&#x27;m just going to say I highly recommend this product to all women and I would be very surprised if they didn&#x27;t like it. TRY IT!!!</li>
            <li> Positives -&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my face incredibly smooth&lt;br /&gt;Lets me use blades a few weeks longer than I ordinarily would have&lt;br /&gt;I rarely bleed when using this (bleeding was a normal thing with other creams)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives -&lt;br /&gt;I do not get quite as close of a shave&lt;br /&gt;The scent does linger no matter what you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick discussion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on a whim at a drug store one day when I saw it and saw here it had good reviews (I needed it immediately so I overpaid locally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about 10 shaves to fully understand how it lathers and that you really don&#x27;t need that much  - you can get away with an almond size dollop.  It is basically just a thick lotion on your face.  It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;puff up&amp;#34;.  If normal stuff makes a 1/4&amp;#34; layer, this is going to be 1/8&amp;#34; - just a film on your face really, but its adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave quite as close of a shave as other products, but it leaves your skin stupidly smooth.  I rarely use a lotion afterwards it feels so nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find I cut myself much less with it.  A cut was a daily thing with other creams.  Now I don&#x27;t get cuts on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intentionally pushed my current blade well past where I would have changed (about 10 shaves now) and its still working.  That&#x27;s a nice side benefit (I clean and preserve my blades with alcohol to cut down on rust/oxidation.  I normally get 25 shaves out of a blade - this one is at 35 and probably about time to be replaced.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I find myself with a thicker beard the next morning, its easier to shave the next day because my face is far less irritated - so its not really an issue unless you like to go a few days between shaves (I can&#x27;t, so it doesn&#x27;t matter)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a scent, and it does linger.  I shave before showering, and even soap &amp; hot water in the shower doesn&#x27;t get it out.  It may bother some people or affect allergy sufferers in an office setting.  I can&#x27;t pin down what itsmells like.  Its not bad, just... different.</li>
            <li> My husband who is not a &amp;#34;foo-foo&amp;#34; kind of guy LOVES this shaving cream. Thought I&#x27;d spoil him instead of his everyday Barbasol brand and is now only wanting me to buy this.  A little definitely goes a long way.  It may be more expensive up front, but in the long run you&#x27;ll save more money because less is more with this shaving cream :)</li>
            <li> Had always used aerosols until I started traveling by air, so I switched to creams.  I&#x27;ve tried several creams and Cremo is about 3 out of 10 (Aerosols being 1).  Next up the ladder is Proraso Eucalyptus/Menthol (white tube w/Green)  at 5 out of 10 and so far, the C.O. Bigelow Premium (Green tube) is 10 out of 10.  Performance is pretty much in line with the retail price.  Of the 3 creams, the Cremo has the least lubricity and least after shave conditioning with the Bigelow premium far and above the best lubricity and conditioning.  All 3 of the creams are good values, and I recommend getting small quantities to test for your personal preferences.  I agree the Cremo is &amp;#34;Astonishingly Superior&amp;#34; as their marketing states - but it is only so when compared to aerosols.  For my money, the Bigelow Premium gets the nod.</li>
            <li> Great shaving cream. I doubt though, that it will last 99 days as advertised. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I like that it isn&#x27;t foamy like most of the canned shaving creams.  I use this to my advantage by putting it into the wall-mounted shampoo dispenser so I don&#x27;t have to have the tube sitting loose.  Though it is a bit thick and won&#x27;t drain from the dispenser fully, it does work well in there.</li>
            <li> I tried it and it was better than foaming can creams, but I still experienced shaving irritation after using it and I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the smell, it has hints of oranges in it and stuck with me all day. I have since switched to Shave Secret Shaving Oil and won&#x27;t switch back.</li>
            <li> Good product, but it is the second best shaving cream I have used. Best is still Dr. Carver&#x27;s Easy Shave Butter from Dollar Shave Club. I wanted this to work just as well and save a buck, but Dr Carver&#x27;s is smoother and easier to use. This product works best after the foam is washed away a little, but with Dr. Carver&#x27;s, the cream starts out that way. No need to lather and apply water.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes shaving so easy and fun. Great to take when you travel. A little dab will do.</li>
            <li> Best shave cream ever. It is everything it claims to be. I had to buy another tube because my wife keeps stealing it.</li>
            <li> Okay, I tried it. Here&#x27;s my opinion...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got out of the shower, pre-warmed my head and face with hot water before shaving, and applied a steamed wash cloth for approximately 30 to 60 seconds. (My wifey has a cool washcloth steamer which I also use regularly. Pop a moistened, rolled-up wash cloth in there 5 minutes before I jump in the shower, and it is ready for me when I get out.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cremo was slippery and clear. But it definitely needed water/moisture to stay slick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a few times that I needed to \\&quot;reactivate\\&quot; the slickness by placing water on my face with my free hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not stay slick for long. But when reactivated with water, it is super slippery again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is okay for my face, but I&#x27;d be hesitant to use it on my head. Why? Because if it were to go dry, and I did not notice it...I&#x27;d possibly slice a chunk of skin off my scalp from the dry swipe of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is awesome. I personally like it super much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that it never claims to actually soften the hair. It makes the shaving surface super slippery, but it makes no claim to softening the actual hair before the shaving process. (Is that what the \\&quot;hot water\\&quot; was for in the directions)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the skin softeners, I&#x27;m not sure. I usually place aftershave moisturizing lotion on my face immediately after shaving, so I dont know if their skin softeners work or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed a cornucopia of different synthetic materials in the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, it is SUPER SLICK when kept moist, which is what they advertised. And I also love the scent. But (yuup...here it comes), I did not dig the fact that I had to keep reactivating it (causing excess water to drip off my face and hands)...and the fact that it had a bunch of unpronounceable synthetic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell...I loved. But I usually like unscented stuff. Why pay for good cologne, and then use scented:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;Aftershave lotion&lt;br /&gt;Deodorant&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is why I like unscented (and organic, if possible) products the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The friend who recommended it to me shaves in the shower. (He DOES NOT shave his head). So I can see how the shower moisture/heat would help it work better in that environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep the Cremo Shaving Cream...but I like the \\&quot;Dr Carver&#x27;s Shave Butter\\&quot; more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the Shave Butter has a slightly (natural) citrusy smell, but I think it works/feels better for me. And I use the AWESOME unscented \\&quot;Aveeno Shave Lotion\\&quot; to drown out any smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JMHOunscented (and organic, if possible) products the best.

            <li> My go-to shave cream.  The best on the planet.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that my shaving life has changed quite a bit after discovering both of these products. I stumbled upon Cremo in my local CVS and decided to try it. I had been a life long off and on user of Kiehl&#x27;s but it&#x27;s not all that easy to find and costs a fortune. Besides, Cremo had a rebate to cover the full purchase price so why not try it. The results were astonishing. I went to Amazon to read reviews and saw that many people drew comparisons with Proraso so I decided to try a tube of that as well. Again, it totally lived up to its claim and the results were just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So which is better? The answer is Cremo for one very good and very specific reason. Cremo leaves your skin very smooth while Proraso leaves it kind of tacky. Not sticky, per se but not nearly as smooth as Cremo. So why should this matter? For most people it shouldn&#x27;t. But since I shave my head in the shower and do not use a mirror to see the back of my head, it&#x27;s difficult to differentiate between what is the tackiness left by Proraso and what is stubble that I missed shaving.  If you are shaving just your face, either will work fine and, in all fairness, Proraso does smell incredible. There is no comparison between it and the soapy fresh smell of Cremo which is also pretty damn good only not as refreshing smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really can&#x27;t go wrong with either of these terrific products. I have absolutely no idea how anyone could try them and ever resort to using a can of shaving cream again.</li>
            <li> I picked up a tube of this at the local drugstore when the company was offering a \\&quot;Try it Free\\&quot; promotion, and refunding the purchase price.  As many of the reviewers have said, it does not lather like a traditional shaving soap or cream.  However, it does the job it&#x27;s designed to do.  Every time I use it, about halfway through my shave I resign myself to the fact that I&#x27;ll need to reach for my brush and Taylor of Old Bond Street and re-shave.  Upon finishing though, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at the results.  It creates a slick surface and provides excellent protection, especially against DE blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent could be better, but personally I have a \\&quot;I like it in a weird way\\&quot; attitude towards it.  It smells like a creamsicle bar or drink, with an artificial orange scent.  I mainly use this cream when I don&#x27;t have the time or want to put forth the effort to soak my brush and whip up lather in a bowl.  It&#x27;s worth the price, and from what I&#x27;ve seen it will last a while, and like all creams it takes some getting used to.  Once you find what amount works for you, it&#x27;s worth using when you&#x27;re in a rush.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product! It works very well, doesn&#x27;t require a lot, and smells great!</li>
            <li> Some days I like it, other days its greasy and hard to shave and I end up cutting myself.  I like the idea and like not using the foam mess, but so far I am not a convert.</li>
            <li> Not for me. Didn&#x27;t find it any different than most shaving creams. The one I&#x27;ve found works best for me is Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
            <li> Great Shaving Cream, Very good Lubrication . Only need a Small amount</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for years but always gave other brands a chance. I even tried the more expensive butter stuff from Dollar Shave Club but that required timely soaking.</li>
            <li> Ever since they discontinued the generic AAFES brand foamy sensitive shave cream, I have struggled to find a replacement.  I have tried many, cheap and expensive.  I had high hopes for this based on the reviews, but it might as well be any other shave cream that doesn&#x27;t work for me.  With the AAFES shave cream, I could use pretty much any razor and I would get a very close shave and zero cuts.  This shave cream, I use a gilette 5 blade razor and get a few cuts.  All this means to me is, I have to stick with the expensive Crabtree and Evelyn brand.  Its expensive, but its the closest shave I get and get zero cuts (almost all the time).  I&#x27;m sure it works for some folks and its not as bad as others regarding the closeness and cuts from the shave, so thats why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Just wow! I can&#x27;t believe the difference when you use this product vs the regular aerosol kind. I have a teenager who is just going to begin to shave soon so I wanted to find something that would provide him with a good product to use on his teenage sensitive skin. I bought a few different items to try and this one wins hands down!&lt;br /&gt;1- This small tube will last as long as 3 of the aerosol cans in my opinion, you only need to use an almond sized dab for your entire face. (Ok I used it for my legs but an almond size dab was more than enough for one leg and actually probably enough for two.&lt;br /&gt;2- Read the directions! Soak the area you are going to shave in hot water before you start, it does make the shave even closer however I have been in a hurry and rushed it but still had great results. Just better when you can soak a little first.&lt;br /&gt;3- It glides on so easy, it&#x27;s not this huge mess like aerosol shaving creams. It&#x27;s feels like you are putting a little silky lotion on your wet skin. You don&#x27;t need to have a big white glob on the area you shave. You can tell you got the entire area because it has this smooth silky lightwieght film on it.&lt;br /&gt;4 - No big mess to clean up after, wipes off easily but make sure to clean your razor well as you go and after you are done. I don&#x27;t know about you but cleaning up after a teenage boy isn&#x27;t easy to begin with and this definitely makes it much easier for us! No arguments about shaving cream left all over the sink!&lt;br /&gt;5 - It makes my legs feel as smooth as if I had just had them waxed, same with my underarm area. I get a very close shave when I use this (I also bought the women&#x27;s version which just smells a little more &amp;#34;girlie&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;6 - No irritation at all after shaving, even in those places that are easy to irritate&lt;br /&gt;7 - Works great for those with acne issues, doesn&#x27;t burn when you use in on irritated sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will never go back to the aerosol again! I feel that it&#x27;s an excellent product and when you compare 1-1 it&#x27;s actually not any more expensive!nd when you compare 1-1 it&#x27;s actually not any more expensive!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my hubby,  unfortunately he hasn&#x27;t got to use it bc i took it!!  I LOVE it! Its great for shaving my lady bits,  no razor burn and smells really clean too</li>
            <li> I am willing to admit it - I purchased this &amp;#34;superior shave cream&amp;#34; because I wanted a shave cream that didn&#x27;t come in a can that would leave marks on the shower tub. This one had high reviews, so I figured &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34; I am thrilled I gave it a chance as it is literally everything they advertise. I might never shave my legs with anything again. You hardly have to use any, so this small container will last a long time and since it doesn&#x27;t wash away if you get water on area you&#x27;re trying to shave, there is no need to reapply over and over again. Overall, this allowed for a much closer (better) shave.</li>
            <li> I love this shaving &amp;#34;cream!&amp;#34; Follow the directions and you will get the closest shave ever. Much better than your regular shaving creams or gels!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many gel/creams/oils for shaving my head over the past few years. I&#x27;ve had good results with Headblade Headslick Mentholated Shave Cream (the best one I had previously tried), Proraso (not as smooth as headblade; smells a bit too strong), AHAVA shaving gel (nice smell,pricey, smooth but gunks up the blade).  When I got this I followed all the instructions and found that this has become my favourite shaving cream.  The 2 cm amount can cover my whole head and chin area.  The smell is a very pleasant fruity, a very unique scent.  It does not stay after the wash though.  The most surprising thing for me was that shaving with a gillette blade was a very smooth affair, it really glides through the bristle. It&#x27;s even smoother than headblade! I could not also believe that it was actually the closest shave I ever experienced (and it wasn&#x27;t even a new blade).  I didnt think a cream could do that.  And the amount you use is so lilttle, I find that the tube would last months.  All in all the best shaving cream ever.....that is not even considering the price.</li>
            <li> A great shaving cream.  I like good shaving creams and soaps and this is one of the best.  A smooth shave, a pleasant feeling afterward, a light scent -- it is excellent stuff.  If you currently use some product like Edge shaving gel give this a try;  you will understand why it is worth an extra few dollars.</li>
            <li> I am sad to report that I really found this product horrible. I hav very sensitive pale skin and course hair. I have a horrible time with redness and irritation after shaving. I have recently started using a DE Safety razor and been very pleased with the superior shave. I have been using a blade sample pack to figure out the best blade for me skin. I didn&#x27;t think I would like using a safety razor so I didn&#x27;t invest in anything more than a sample pack of blades and a Feather Safety Razor. I have only used a Gillette shave gel for sensitive skin and had considered upgrading to something better. I don&#x27;t relish the idea of mixing my own lather with a brush so I was considering creamo cream based on the ratings. I saw it at Walmart and decided to give it a try. This is a bit of a challenge to rate since I am changing blades every day to figure out what I like so I have shaved with the shave gel on one side and the cremo cream on the other. On my first attempt, I used an ASTRA super stainless blade. I applied the cream as per the instructions with a small amount and using water to activate it. I cut myself three times on the creamo side and none on the Gillette side. I hadn&#x27;t cut myself once before using this. I felt the shave on the cremo side was far worse, but it could be I was a bit timid from the cuts. Also, I had very irritated skin on the creamo side. Next night I used an ASTRA platinum blade, and switched the Gillette and cremo sides. I cut myself once with the cremo side and again none on the Gillette side. I thought the creamo side did deliver a closer shave with this attempt. Third night I used a Derby blade and didn&#x27;t cut myself but had a horrible shave on each side. Finally, I used a Feather blade. Again, I didn&#x27;t cut myself, but there was no difference in the shave on either side and skin was more irritated on the creamo side. So, in my opinion, not only it the blade person dependent, but the cream seems to be person dependent.</li>
            <li> My skin takes a beating from shaving. It&#x27;s gets so bad that my face breaks out in rashes and bumps from daily shaving. Cremo, while not eliminating the bumps and rashes has really diminished the area the shaving rash covers and the number of bumps I get. It also smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Out of other cream i find this being the best as i like the smell, the consistence of the cream and the feeling once you are shaved.</li>
            <li> Not as great as Chuck Woolery would have you believe in his TV/Radio pitches.</li>
            <li> Best shaving product ever! I tried shaving with this about a year ago because I had a coupon for it and discovered it&#x27;s the closest shave you will ever get.  A must have!</li>
            <li> Good product. Enjoy using it. Different from canned shave soap. Works better . Use per direction.</li>
            <li> Husbands favorite shave cream!</li>
            <li> Save your time and just get the shave butter from Dollar Shave Club.  I tried the full tube of Cremo Cream I ordered to give it a fair trial and ended up regretting it.  Clogs up between your blades and does not leave your skin in as good a condition as it claims.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for us to try, since I&#x27;m forever complaining about razor burn and having to shave so often. Well, since I started using this, even on super sensitive areas, I have little to no razor burn, and I only have to shave about once every 1.5-2 weeks. I would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I switched over to a safety razor and was looking for a shaving cream that would would allow me to shave close without the burn. I was told by a friend that this was what he was using, and he was very satisfied with the results. It is not like the other creams, which are mostly air - goes on more like a lotion - but with water, forms a nice slick surface for the razor to glide on. Only a small almond sized amount is needed. So far, it has worked out well.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions... I had to rub it like crazy to spread it across my face. It immediately started to dry and disappear. I shave everyday so I don&#x27;t always have a lot of beard so as it drys I can&#x27;t really tell where I&#x27;ve shaved and later realize that I missed spots. It&#x27;s not any slicker than any other quality creams. I&#x27;m sticking to Taylor of Old Bond Street as it works perfect and they have variety. Thumbs Down!</li>
            <li> In the beginning I just used this product because it had a full refund rebate. After trying it I thought it was ok but found it weird that it didn&#x27;t leave a thick foam on my face like other ones do. BUT after awhile of use I must admit, this product works very well and I&#x27;m sold. It lathers on clear but leaves your face very slick, better than any other shaving cream I&#x27;ve tried. It also saves me money on switching out my razor blades because now they can go a bit further before I have to switch them out. Great ingredients that makes up this product too.</li>
            <li> Slicker than a 70s Chicago Alderman. Creamier than whipped Swiss cowbutter.  Fresher than an April lilac meadow after a sunshower.  I almost want to put it on toast. Almost.</li>
            <li> Some of the claims made by the manufacturer seem hard to believe. But, in fact, this is an insanely good product that actually delivers. I&#x27;ve been shaving with Cremo now for a couple months and it is, hands down, the best I&#x27;ve ever used, better even than Trader Joe&#x27;s Cream Shave, which had previously topped my list. And at this price?! Seriously. Buy it now. As long as they keep making this and selling it at a reasonable price, I&#x27;ll keep using it. Try it - you&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Works great, will not use anything else now.</li>
            <li> was not what I expected, so after several uses I replaced it with a foam shave</li>
            <li> Cremo is amazing. Before shaving was an irritating nightmare, but Cremo changed that and made it pleasant again. Better than any canned product</li>
            <li> I gave this a 5 star rating earlier, but I wanted to test it with a cheap disposable razor, instead of my good razor. Even with a cheap razor, this is still the best shave cream I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Better now that I am using less.</li>
            <li> Recently I became very frustrated with the affects of shaving everyday on my neck.  My wife recommended that I move on from the drugstore brands and buy luxury cleansers, shaving cream and aftershave.  I followed her recommendation and noticed the difference.  However, each item cost nearly twenty bucks and therefore pretty expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the internet and looked for cheaper alternative and found Cremo Cream.  I aslo noticed that they offered a full rebate on your first bottle.  So I thought I would try it.  I purchased it and sent in the rebate, but never received it.  Because I never received, I no longer trusted the claims on the bottle so when I ran out of my expensive cream I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, using Cremo Cream for a couple of weeks, I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong.  I amazed at my close shave.  I now can shave against the grain without major neck irritation.  My blade glides even better then the luxury  cream.  Also amazing is the amount that I need to use.  It&#x27;s crazy how little it takes.  Had I recieved the rebate I definitely would have give 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.  It lives up to the hype.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream, in conjunction with a fresh brand new gillette fusion proglide power blade with the power button on, shaving with it in the hot shower with a proper LED light shaving mirror and a proper pre shave oil beforehand, will give you like it does for me, the closest and smoothest shave you can ever imagine.  I use a new gillette fusion proglide power blade with each shave since my hair is so thick and cuts up the blade after each shave, and this cream really helps to make the blade just glide along my face and neck like butter on a scalding hot pan.  Beautiful stuff indeed.....</li>
            <li> Easily the nicest shaving cream that I have ever used. I was previously using Neutrogena Skin Clearing Shave Cream, but I&#x27;ll never go back now that I&#x27;ve discovered Cremo Cream. Not only is the shaving experience with Cremo far superior, but compared to the medicinal, slightly chemical smell of the Neutrogena, this one smells all natural, and absolutely fantastic! Combined with my new Edwin Jagger De87bl razor, I now actually look forward to shaving!</li>
            <li> Never used anything but shave cream out of the can before.  Will never go back to that anymore.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff rocks.</li>
            <li> Got this on sale at Walmart and fell in love with it. The best shave ever. I have been a fan of this type of shave cream for several years. Have tried many premium blends and brands costing 3-4 times as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use just a dab, apply water, and the smoothest shave I have ever experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I am actually excited about a shaving cream. Go figure.</li>
            <li> This product works very well to facilitate a close, comfortable shave.  I recently switched from Gillette blades to the Dollar Shave Club&#x27;s program with their &amp;#34;Executive&amp;#34; blades, and am very happy with the quality of shave that I&#x27;m getting.  I&#x27;m assuming that a big part of the improved closeness and softness of my face is the use of Cremo.  I plan on continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT! I was skeptical, like most people, when it says it is the best shave cream you will ever buy, and at $6-$7 a bottle, you would hope so. However, it is great stuff. The most important thing about successful use of this product is to read the directions. I&#x27;ve used Barbasol and Edge for years, but this stuff really takes the cake. Very close shave on the first run (against the grain with a safety razor) and came out very smooth with little or no burn. I cannot stress to make sure you follow the directions on the back of the bottle (Rub Hot Water onto Face for 30 seconds, only an Almond Size portion rubbed in (it DOES make a lot of lather, do NOT overdo it!)). A great buy!</li>
            <li> This is the best shave cream I have ever tried.  Excellent!  The razor glides over my face.  It is a close shave with no irritation.  They had a promotion.  Get a refund of the purchase price.  They did it.  They also send me periodic offers by email.  Great stuff.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best shaving cream that I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve tried gels, creams and even products from artofshaving.com and this product provides the closest shaving experience without a bit of irritation on my skin.  I&#x27;ve had irritation on my neck after using every product I&#x27;ve tried with the lone exception being Cremo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many shave creams and soaps ranging from high end stuff like Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat and Tabac to Godrej, Palmolive and Proraso. Some gave me great results while others disappointed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give Cremo a try because I was looking for something I could use on the go. I don&#x27;t always have time to lather up with a brush, so Cremo provides me with a nice shave when I&#x27;m pressed for time. The results so far have been good. I like that it doesn&#x27;t require much in order for me to make a 3 pass shave and that it keeps your skin nice and slick when more water is applied. Overall a decent product for a decent price.</li>
            <li> This is the best shave cream I used thus far and I am 62 years old.  Too bad it took me so long to come across getting this product.  Was using Kiss My Face and was satisfied with the shaving results and price paid to buy this, but I feel the Cremo advantage is that the cream more easily washes off the razor slots (I use Gillette Sensitive cartridges and use the vibration feature), leaving the razor clean and ready for the next shaving pass.  I gave Cremo four stars because I think they can improve their product by offering them in larger sizes and dispensing options, like the Kiss My Face  push down spout dispensing plastic bottles.  So, there are pros and cons between KMF and Cremo, from my perspective anyway.  Right now, I am using the Cremo Cream.</li>
            <li> No matter what amount I use (deviating more and less than the recommended &amp;#34;almond size&amp;#34;) the cream never seems to form a consistent layer.  The cream doesn&#x27;t foam up and instead stays in its original form.</li>
            <li> Really slickens up your face.  Adding water at the end for touch ups is all you need for a good shave with a blade.  Use a hot towel before shaving, it really helps.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and bought this based on the &amp;#34;Astonishingly&amp;#34; high claims and very good reviews. I have to optimize all the variables in my shave to get a comfortable BBS shave. Even so I get irritation issues too often. My skin tells me how I have done very clearly each and every shave.  At first I got several poor shaves with this. I gave it a 1 star review and now am revising it out of fairness due to the latest results. The trick was to maximize the slickness with a uniform addition of water, using a small brush (my fingers did not do a good and uniform job of mixing water into the face bound cream).  Now, I get good shaves this way, although not quite up to the level I get with the majority of tallow based soap/cream products available. It seems to be in the range with the good quality vegan (tallow/animal free) products out there. Not bad at all; but, not &amp;#34;Astonishingly&amp;#34; great either. It is weird, shaving with such a low visibility and thin product. There is no so called foam cushion effect with this.  An extra star off (3 to 2) for the over hyped advertisement. This product should work real well for most shavers as long as the hydrating issue is well done and they adapt to the lack of foam..</li>
            <li> I rarely write a review but thought this product warranted one. This is quite simply the BEST shave cream I&#x27;ve ever tried. It will reduce or illuminate nicks and cuts and the razor glides smoothly on the skin. It&#x27;s activated by water and invented by some genius scientist who&#x27;s invented other well known things we use. It&#x27;s better than Proraso and even my previous favorite, Harry&#x27;s shave cream and comes in at an attractive price point, although more expensive than some cheaper brands, but well worth the money. A little goes a long way. In fact less is more. This stuff is superb.</li>
            <li> I purchased a tube of this at a local store several months ago. It was on clearance, and as I had never heard of it before, I took a chance. Now that I&#x27;m half-way through the tube, I am glad to have found it here because it is by far the best shaving product I have ever used. Just a small amount is needed, and you can rinse your face and touch-up without reapplying.  A tube will easily last 6-8 months. A superior product worth three times the price.</li>
            <li> Introduced to my husband who had been using Shave Secret.  Shave Secret always clogged my razors.  We are both appreciating this product.  Available in 3 oz and smaller for travel purposes.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first ordered Cremo Cream since it seemed too good to be true.  This product gives you the best shave possible with no irritation.  I would recommend it to anyone who has sensitive skin or someone who is looking for a close and great shave.  A bottle also lasts a very long time.  Best shaving cream out there.</li>
            <li> This is the best shave cream I ever used in over 60 years of wet shaving. Prior to using Cremo Shave Cream I was using Proraso, which I thought was terrific. While in my local CVS pharmacy, I saw the Cremo display which offered a refund of the entire selling price (less sales tax.) I purchased a tube and figured I had nothing to lose but the sales tax of $.56. The first time I tried shaving with this new cream, with my Gillette Proglide Power razor, I was amazed at the smooth, nick-free, close shave I got. It does not lather as much as some of the other shave creams I have used, but it still provided a small amount of lather and a very smooth shaving experience. The second pass resulted in no lather, but there was sufficient lubrication on my face so that my face was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. Just follow the directions on the tube and you will be amazed at the great shave you get. The Cremo Shave Cream is now the only one I will purchase when this tube runs out.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product - a whole new shave.</li>
            <li> After a week, I&#x27;m getting the hang of this product. If you overuse, the shave is not as good. A very thin film does the job. Once the quantity is right, the shave is amazingly good. Best shave cream I have used! But, just use a little.</li>
            <li> Having used Kiehl&#x27;s shaving products for years I have to say that this gives a shave that is every bit as good for a heck of a lot less money. I&#x27;ve seen it on the shelf in discount retailers even cheaper. Absolutely would recommend trying it especially if you suffer every time you have to drag that razor over your neck like I do.</li>
            <li> This cream provides for a slick and smooth shave. You only need to you a very small amount - about the size of dime/nickel. The goal is to have a very thin layer - and your razor will glide across your face. I am using an old school 1965 Gillette DE adjustable razor. A great combination.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic . Hard to imagine that after you&#x27;ve shaved once, you add a splash of water and your face is slicker than ever. I use it with the Panasonic ES8243A Men&#x27;s 4-Blade Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver and have never had a better closer shave.</li>
            <li> Totally underwhelmed with this product.  Not only is it not superior, I get better results from a $2.00 can of Edge gel.  Honestly, I cut myself more using this stuff than any other product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  No exaggeration.  If you use a multi-blade razor as I do, this stuff will clog it up as it doesn&#x27;t rinse well.  It also doesn&#x27;t rinse off the skin very easily, and it left me smelling like a can of furniture polish due to the lemony scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cremo for over a year. I rotate among Foamy shaving creme and a gel. Cremo gives me the best &amp; closest shave. I use about 3 dots (2 cheeks and 1 neck) per use. Very few nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> Vastly overrated really the product of a marketing campaign and nothing more. They bill it as a slick gliding shave. In reality no friction or traction is generated and it is in fact an inferior product. I am very picky about my shave creams, and I would prefer Barbarosa to this.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving a lot easier and it keeps the shaved area smooth.</li>
            <li> Very good shave cream. Follow the directions and you will be able to enjoy the best qualities of the product. Prepare your face with hot water, or a hot towel, and apply a very small amount. The product is very slick and protects your face very well. Whether or not you get a closer shave might depend on your shaving style, but this product stays slick longer than usual and allows several strokes to the same areas, so you are more likely to do a better job shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the tube because I am not afraid of it bursting all over the inside of my suitcase when I put it on an airplane or take it to a high altitude.</li>
            <li> My husband and sons absolutely love Cremo.  My daughter uses it as well (the woman&#x27;s variety) and loves it.  They say that it makes shaving so easy and pleasant and leaves their skin soft.  A truly superior product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product.  Though I&#x27;m not as estatic as the 5 star reviews, this product really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, everyones facial hair is different.  My whiskers are pretty thick.  I followed the EXACTLY what the directions said on the back.  More than once.  I didn&#x27;t get the result that the other reviews did.  A little frusterated at first.  Out of due respect for everyone, I do believe it works for some, but I was left wondering if some of the reviews were exaggerated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later on, I bought a Boar Bristle brush.  I let the brush soak in hot water for a few minutes.  I shook the water off the brush &amp; put a almond-sized amount on/in the brush.  Then applied the brush my face(Wet of course).  I got a really good lather.  Felt good on the skin.  I got a nice shave from it.  I still had enough cream on the brush for a second pass/shave.  After that, I was impressed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creamo Cream has a nice citrus scent that isn&#x27;t over-powering.  The price is pretty good.  You can get it pretty much at any retail outlet (Walmart-Target-CVS-Amazon for example).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think Creamo Cream is a good buy.  The directions may work for you like the other reviewers, but in my experience, it works best with a brush.  I recommend creamo cream for a shaving alternative.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as the ratings would have you believe. I have the unenviable combination of a very coarse beard and soft skin. Thus I tend to get at least a little razor burn and nicks pretty much every time I shave.  Cremo smells great, but it doesn&#x27;t soften the beard at all, is very thin, and dries to a flaky consistency within a minute or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a thin and/or soft beard it&#x27;ll probably be great. Otherwise, keep looking. I am.</li>
            <li> I bought a tube of Cremo as an impulse buy at a local chain pharmacy.  I was very surprised the difference it made in getting a close comfortable shave and the way my skin felt afterwards.  I admit that I hate shaving and I&#x27;ve tried everything from the old hot lather machines (remember them?) to expensive electric shavers, but the Cremo cream was the first product that made this daily task more tolerable for me.  I&#x27;ve stocked up from Amazon at a much better price than my local store.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is product didn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s hype for me. I have sensitive skin, especially the neck area, and get better results from a bar of Dove soap and a semi sharp Hydro5. The shave is smooth, but left my skin feeling very irritated and several knicks, even with a fresh blade. I don&#x27;t usually get nicks and irritation with Dove soap. I&#x27;ve shaved four times with this cream and it&#x27;s not getting any better. Time for me to give up,,,</li>
            <li> Comes in handy if I&#x27;m in a real hurry. Also seems to work well as a preshave.  Mixes well with any of my other soaps. Good for making uber lather.</li>
            <li> I actually use Cremo as a base before applying my D R Harris soap with my brush.  I love it because there is still a nice slick surface when going back and touching up tough areas.  I have an extremely course beard, and shave 6 days per week.....if I&#x27;m in a rush I&#x27;ll use straight Cremo.  Wonderful product that you do not have to break the bank for.  Why anyone would use the mass produced gels/foams when this is on the market is beyond me.</li>
            <li> Very good indeed, but Proraso Sandalwood is the best in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I think this product is a little overhyped by all the ratings on Amazon.  I do like it.  It does lubricate the face well.  The thing I like best about it is that you can see the hair you are shaving while you do it.  Shaving cream hides the hair.  I do not think this is some kind of miracle product, but I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is easily the best shaving cr&amp;egrave;me I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s super slick, super easy to use, and a little bit goes a long way. This is my new go-to shaving cr&amp;egrave;me.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a DE razor for about a year working up a lather from shaving soaps and gels and working it in with a badger bristle brush. Wanting to improve my shaving experience and perhaps get a closer shave I tried Cremo. Sorry to say I was somewhat disappointed. Following the instructions on the tube very carefully, and having put a fresh Wilkinson Sword blade in my Parker 99 I proceeded to shave using the Cremo. Suffice to say I found that my shaving experience was in the kindest way I can describe, less than satisfying. My blade did not glide over my skin nearly as well as a lather soap, I nicked my chin and found enough stubble left that I lathered up with my brush and shaved again. The next day I gave Cremo another try with similar results. Finally I mixed it in my shaving soap but noticed no improvement. Oh well, it was worth a try, but again, I will not buy.</li>
            <li> I use a shaving &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; applicator -- one of those things that go with the mug, but I don&#x27;t use the mug with this stuff.  I just put it on my hand and swirl that hair thing around on my palm and it lathers up with just a little water from the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% best stuff out there.</li>
            <li> To say Cremo Cream gives you a smooth shave is an understatement. This product truly is the BEST! I have corresponded with the Cremo Cream company and found they are TOTALLY focused on the customer. You can&#x27;t go wrong. TRY IT!</li>
            <li> There has been the occasional bad shave with this cream, maybe I didn&#x27;t wet my face long enough or use hot enough water, or maybe my DE razor needed to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after a good shave, my skin felt as smooth and as soft as ever before. I&#x27;ve tried another brand which I felt gave me the same results (Proraso for sensitive skin) but this could have a more pleasing scent for others (this brand has a citrus/sweet smell, Proraso was more menthol and grown-up male smelling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over time I found myself applying more of this to my face for a second pass, again maybe this was user error because of bad blades or not letting my face be in hot enough water or something. So I can&#x27;t remove a star from my review for an issue that may not be the products fault.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different ways to shave my bear-like beard, and this one is the best. I have to shave twice, once with the grain, and then a second time against the grain, and sometimes a third time, because my face eats razors BEFORE breakfast. This cream goes on slick and lets me shave up to three times with one application. It smells really good, but not like perfume. It leaves my face soft so I don&#x27;t need an aftershave or moisturizer (tried more than 15 of those too). I&#x27;ve subscribed for a new tube every 4 months because this stuff lasts. I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest, face shaving isn&#x27;t very fun. Or it least it never was for me. Every morning was filled with in-grown hairs, nicks and lots of irritation. All this despite spending lots of time and money on supposedly better tools and products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those problems all went away after I bought Cremo Cream at the store two months ago. I&#x27;ve now added it to my list of regular Amazon purchases.</li>
            <li> My favorite brushless cream.</li>
            <li> Best shaving creme.  Used it for about 6 months and plan on continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to replace the discontinued Provence Sante Shave Cream that I used for over 5 years. I use a standard Gillette razor and wanted a shave cream that smelled as good, gave as close, smooth shave, and was reasonably economical. The Cremo shave cream was certainly cheap, smelled ok, but did not give me a close or very comfortable shave. I needed to use a fair amount of it (and it doesn&#x27;t lather which is how I like it) and it just didn&#x27;t lubricate my skin very well at all. The shave ended up being rough and just not that close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up trying The Art of Shaving Shave Cream (good lubricated shave, smells good, but comes in a ridiculously small tube 2.5 oz for a hefty price of $16) and settled on Kale Naturals Smooth Shave Cream. For whatever reason, the Kale Naturals had no reviews but it is a wonderfully smelling, all natural ingredients, smooth, close shave. Coming in a large 8oz tube that lasts a long time, a \\&quot;luxury\\&quot; shave cream for $24 is actually a good deal.</li>
            <li> So Im in my mid 20&#x27;s and can&#x27;t say I have a bunch of experience with shaving creams but I have previously used Gillette Fusion gel and most recently Axe chilled shaving gel.  The fusion stuff was okay for me. The Axe stuff was pretty bad... I quickly began dreading shaving often while using that stuff as I would often cut myself despite using a 5 blade razor.  I loved the cooling sensation but it wasn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I later found Cremo Shaving Cream at my local Walgreens in desperation for somethig better. I had been too scared to shave everyday but decided shaving again under 24 hours of my last shave would be the ultimate test.  Results were amazing. Not only did I not cut myself, but I was actually able to enjoy shaving without any irritation or pain. I was able to overlap the same spot more than once without complaining as I did before.  And if that wasn&#x27;t enough, when I was done, my face was softer and smoother than I have felt it in many years.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent but it does still leave a light and pleasant smell that can be easily overpowered by your favorite cologne or aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;At less than $10 a tube here or your local store, it&#x27;s a steal and definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> Work well just wish it was a little slicker. Not the best for heavy beards.</li>
            <li> Best shave cream I have used.  I am a head shaver and use Cremo to shave in the shower. It&#x27;s super slick, as advertised, and allows multiple passes with minor reapplication of some water and a tiny bit of cream. If you are into brushes, this does not lather. It&#x27;s a very thin cream.  I was previously an exclusive user of Headslick, until I tried Cremo.  It allows me to get an even closer shave, not to mention it&#x27;s cheaper and more available in brick and mortar stores near me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for 2 mos now and am addicted to studying, reading, and trying products and honing in on that &amp;#34;perfect shave&amp;#34; (especially i&#x27;m a tough cookie with sensitive skin yet extremely strong/thick hair ~ i tend to wear out a blade after 1 head shave and maybe 2 beard shaves).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway.. back to Cremo CrÃ¨me - i found this at a CVS (so it&#x27;s locally available) and decided to give it a try.  It was the re-activating/slickness that caught my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO lies.. this thing is SLICK and re-slicks well.  In my 2 mos as a newbie, i&#x27;m discovering that slickness is really what&#x27;s most important in wet shaving.  Scents and foam and lather are great, but in the end it comes down to how a shaving crÃ¨me/soap COMES OFF your face, not how it goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I unfortunately had my first razor break (EJ de89) and used that opportunity to go ahead and try a Merkur Classic Safety (since it was alos the rage for beginners and somebody said they felt it was more aggressive than the EJ).  WEll they were right and my first shave with the Merkur safety razor tore up my face worse than it&#x27;s ever been torn up.  Redness and blotches EVERYWHERE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple days later I decided to just do a &amp;#34;quickie&#x27; and use this crÃ¨me in the shower and not do a full-up shave since i was still healing.  Wouldn&#x27;t you know it. had the smoothest/best shave yet with this crÃ¨me while in the shower - and tha&#x27;ts with super torn up/sensitive/healing skin happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when i realized the lather, foaming, bla bla bla - not important.  SLICKNESS is!  The best glide of razor to skin to avoid irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#34;m still on the lookout for even better slickness or longerlasting slickness with shave soaps - but this is the best so far and best performer for comfort, slickness, and an effective shave.  Until i find somethign better i&#x27;m going to make sure i have some of this around (or will always have some of this around anyway for those days i need to quickly shave but still want to be safe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this as your basic/goto while you search for your perfect soap/creme or as your travel/quickie crÃ¨me (figuring you may not be able to travel or want to with your full brush+mug/bowl kit.. this crÃ¨me doesn&#x27;t require brush or bowl!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lastly.. somebody asked about the scent.  Trust me.. that doesn&#x27;t matter nearly as much as shave performance.  But just so you know. this has a slight citrusy scent and it wont be the best one out there.  It also does not stick around post-shave though so you will be able to fully use your own lotion/aftershave/cologne to go out smelling the way you want.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> excellent as described</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that the cream is very dense, but that does not in fact lead to a closer shave. I get the same shave as I do with regular shaving cream. My face does feel smoother afterwards, but that&#x27;s because of the greasy film this leaves. Also because it doesn&#x27;t lather a lot, you have to use more than is indicated, and I would say I got about 30days from a tube max, nothing close to the 90 it claims. I feel that I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with creams for years, and this is the worst I&#x27;ve used.  I followed the directions to a t - and the fact that you need instruction for this cream should be a warning in and of itself - and managed to scrape a quarter sized area of skin off the side of my face. That&#x27;s a a first for me. I also cut my chin pretty good, and I haven&#x27;t cut myself shaving in years. Good thing I didn&#x27;t use this on my balls.  This cream gets 5 stars from the Spanish Inquisition and House Bolton of the Dreadfort.  One star from myself.  No stars from Theon Greyjoy.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly great shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving with Cremo for a few weeks now and I have to say I&#x27;ll not go back to gels. It took me several shaves to figure this stuff out but now that I have, it provides a silky smooth, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I discovered was to rub Cremo between my hands a little bit before applying to my face. Initially, I was squeezing the small amount on my fingertips and applying directly to my beard then rubbing it in. For some reason, I seemed to feel razor tugs with that method but now that I get the cream activated in my hands, then rub into my beard, it works fantastic! If it helps, I shave religiously with a Gillette Fusion Powered Proglide and the addition of Cremo makes my shave that much more enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bizarre product, because you don&#x27;t need much. In fact, I feel I often use too much. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I previously reviewed the 3oz. travel pack but a lot of that applies here as well. Let me recap that really quick in the paragraph below...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife purchased Cremo cream for me as a little stocking stuffer a year or two ago. Ever since then I&#x27;ve been hooked! I&#x27;ve tried the big name brands of shaving cream and I&#x27;ve even whipped up my own for a safety razor I shave with. Even after trying dozens of products this is what I come back to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recall how long I&#x27;ve had this bigger bottle. It&#x27;s been quite awhile though. You don&#x27;t need much and it just keeps gliding on. I still haven&#x27;t found a product that gives a smoother shave.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this on vacation one year, as he had forgotten his Jack Black Beard Lube and this was all they had at CVS. He is now hooked and reluctantly used the rest of the enormous bottle of Jack Black when we got home. Now we buy this, and he swears by it. I am glad because it is about half the cost.</li>
            <li> Never thought I would consider a different shave cream after using the same brand for over 40 years but I heard some really great things about Cremo cream. The stuff is truly amazing. Close comfortable shaves are now the norm. Thank you Cremo!</li>
            <li> I recently re-discovered shaving with a double-edge safety razor. Nicked myself a few times before I found this. I bought it for travel, but use it often at home, too. I still enjoy using mug soap and a good brush, but this is outstanding for the smoothest shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s that I get from Target for over a year and its pretty good but too pricey. I switched over to this to give it a shot. This cremo cream left a load of razor bumps and redness under my neck like no other. I thought it was my razor (5 blade) and so I switched it and gave it another shot a few days later. Same lousy bumps and redness again. I threw my bottle of cremo straight in the trash where it belongs and I&#x27;d rather pay an extra 2 bucks and go back to Burt&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this will be my cream.  So far, it has done better than all the soaps I tried.&lt;br /&gt;One thin coat will work like it says.  Even have enough on to make a second pass without putting any more on.</li>
            <li> so far so good works well</li>
            <li> I had difficulty finding my usual shave cream (tube variety, not from a can), and decided to look at some reviews of other shave creams and to try these three and compare:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C.O. Bigelow Premium Shave Cream with Eucalyptus Oil 5.2 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every Man Jack Shave Cream for All Skin Types-6.7 oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cremo Astonishingly Superior Shave Cream 6 oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that I felt all three provided a nice smooth shave, I can&#x27;t say that I noticed anything different about the end result of my shave in terms of closeness or smooth skin. The difference primarily comes in the creams themselves. The C.O Bigelow had a rich (but not foamy) lather that covered nicely. I liked the eucalyptus scent, though it was not as nice if you happened to get it in your mouth, and it left a tingly sensation. The Cremo too had a nice lather and a pleasant, more subtle scent. The Every Man Jack had a texture that felt more like a skin lotion and not much of a lather. And after a razor stroke it didn&#x27;t always feel like it left enough lubrication to go over the same area more than once or twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,  I would have to say I preferred the C.O. Bigelow and the Cremo. I think I would get the Cremo again because I like a less scented and less tingly feeling shave. The Cremo would work fine as an every-day shave cream  for me.</li>
            <li> Super awesome shaving cream for when I shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it&#x27;s hard to follow the directions when you are not doing it in the shower</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to - it doesn&#x27;t lather up like regular foam - but it works just as well and there is less residue to wash off the razor and face. Wonderful fragrance!</li>
            <li> I heard a commercial and ordered it.  I love it.  I get a closer shave with no irritation.  Some have mentioned clogged razors.  If you use the almond sized amount as directed, it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.  I have used a Shick Quatro and a disposable Mach 3 without clogging.  I shave in the shower.  I have used creams in the past e.g. Aveda &amp; Bath &amp; Body Works.  This one works as well if not better at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and tried it. Not sure if it provides a better shave (because I can&#x27;t really tell the difference), but I like the story. And the inventor is American, not French - like Gillette. Buy American.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. I have tested many other shave creams, most more expensive, and think this one of the best, perhaps the best. The only &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; is that they don&#x27;t sell a travel-size tube.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shave cream for close to two years and I am very satisfied. I also use the face cleanser and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product is so good that I will NEVER go back to shaving cream. Aside from making shaving easier and more enjoyable, I am mostly impressed by the smoothness of my skin hours after shaving!</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love this product and started a subscribe and save subscription we liked the quality and price so much. Such a nice lather and clean rinse it makes shaving a pleasure.</li>
            <li> I saw it on a store shelf and read the description. It had me sold so I bought a tube. I tried it 3 times with the same outcome: irritation, razor burn, and no lubrication aside the water. Keep in mind I used a new cartridge for my razor to insure the best performance from this new setup and I shave after I get out of the hot shower (even before I used this stuff). Well...Cremo sucked. My skin is very sensitive and I believed it was going to beat every man jack shaving cream according to the description on the tube. It failed miserably. Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to every man jack products as they were super effective and cheaper than this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin, prone to get razor burn on my neck. I&#x27;ve tried many types of shave foams/creams/gels/oils over the years to control the irritation and still get a close shave. So far, Cremo has been the best I have found for this purpose.  It produces a thin, light lather that doesn&#x27;t require hardly any force with the razor, and it&#x27;s very slick. You do have to make sure to keep the product moist during the shave to maximize it&#x27;s benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be replacing my Schick Hydro Sensitive gel that I had been using daily.</li>
            <li> Better than aerosol shave products.</li>
            <li> I like soap and brush better. This has very nice after-smell and feeling. but doesn&#x27;t shave as close or smoothly as a fine lather.</li>
            <li> I mean it this is seriously better than Art of Shaving the women shave cream is also amazing for ladies legs my husband swears by the shave cream for his face and has had a large container of The Art of Shaving shaving cream and uses this instead. Bonus no fake gross stuff and it smells awesome</li>
            <li> simply the best shaving cream I have ever used. period.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a 1 because 0 wasn&#x27;t an option. I&#x27;m 15 and I&#x27;ve been wet shaving with a DE safety razor for almost two years. Just recently, I got my dad into with me so he could save money as well. A month ago, he recommended to me that I get some Cremo. He said that he loved the smell and that it gave a good lather. It does have a nice smell, but no matter how hard I tried, I could not get it to lather. It was so sudsy and watery, you could barely use it. It dissipated almost instantly. I think the next cream I&#x27;ll try is Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s Sandalwood. Overall, I feel like I got ripped off with this. If you enjoy a thick, luscious lather, DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
            <li> I have been using the King of Shaves brand gel which works very well for just about any blade I&#x27;ve tried.  This cream smells much better and has a more user-friendly consistently, but I don&#x27;t think it is better than King of Shaves in terms of skin protection.  It is certainly much better than a can of Edge or Barbasol!!  If you have tried the &amp;#34;Harry&#x27;s&amp;#34; shave cream, it is about like that in a bigger tube.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;It&#x27;s so smooth and hydrating. It&#x27;s like watery butter!&amp;#34; - Husband</li>
            <li> I had been looking for an alternative to conventional shaving foam and happened across this in the store.  It does work as advertised and as they note in the instructions, a little goes a loooong way, meaning you can get a lot of mileage out of one tube versus several cans of shaving foam.  It does give you a very close shave, that feels very &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; (their word, not mine).  I use it for both shaving my face and head and it works great in both locations.  It&#x27;s taken some trial and error to figure out the proper amount (too little and it doesn&#x27;t do what it needs to do, too much and your eyes can become overwhelmed), but I&#x27;ve got it down now and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is the smell is a weird citrus-y/medicine-y smell that isn&#x27;t altogether pleasing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I&#x27;ve been shaving with a DE razor for a while and no matter what kind of cream or soap I used, my face wouldn&#x27;t allow a shave but every 5-6 days. I started using this mixed in with other shaving creams and all that changed. I can now shave my face every other day if needed. I still go every 3 days though as I shave my head at the same time and every other day would be to much for my schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally don&#x27;t care for this product as a stand alone though. But mixed in with traditional creams like t.o.b.s makes them really slick. I won&#x27;t shave without it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember, this stuff loves water. So use a decent amount of water with the super lather.</li>
            <li> Best shave cream I have tried. Lasts forever. I have sensitive skin and this is far better than anything in a can...I would compare this to Jack Black shave cream but better.</li>
            <li> I think most five star reviews are from people abandoning the rattle can shaving cream. Without a doubt Cremo is better than that Gillette garbage. However Cremo overall is just OK, it&#x27;s not great or even really good. I gave it a fair tryout, used it for a week, followed directions and ended up tossing it in the trash. Cremo can&#x27;t come close to the glide and lather you get from a traditional shaving soap applied with a badger hair brush. Currently my favorite is D.R. Harris shaving soap, I love the Marlborough scent, it can be purchased in a wood container. I use a quality Italian badger hair brush with it. The only reason I&#x27;d buy Cremo is if I ran out of traditional soap and it was either Cremo or spray can soap, there are tons of better shaving soap brands.</li>
            <li> Works better than all those foamy things</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different higher end shave creams - Murad, Anthony, Prorasso - and I like this one quite well. It is a fraction of the cost of the Murad (minus a few of the Murad exfoliating extra&#x27;s, I guess) and still less expensive than Anthony.  While similarly priced to Prorasso, I like the lighter scent of Cremo better. The Cremo scent is of the citrus variety and washes away easily. The Prorasso product I&#x27;m referring to is the red striped tube (for tough beards) that had a scent that reminded of an old-school barber shop... it was the scent that just kept on giving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find there to be some sort of iridescent sheen associated with the very slickest of creams and Cremo has it; so did Murad and Prorasso but, again, Murad is exponentially greater in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works great!  Will not be going back to what I used to use for a long time!</li>
            <li> Works better than you will believe.</li>
            <li> I use this shaving cream with my safety razor. The combo of a safety razor with this cream beats any combo I&#x27;ve tried using the saftey razor with brush/cream/pre-shave oil. I hardly ever cut myself, whereas I used to cut myself frequently with the other method. Just use your fingertips to apply it. No brush needed. I&#x27;ve tried it with a brush and it doesn&#x27;t work as well. What surprises me is that I spent lots of money buying shaving cream, a brush and pre-shave oil from the art of shaving, and Cremo cream beats that expensive combo EASILY and it only costs like $7. It&#x27;s also way faster and doesn&#x27;t make a mess/clog the sink.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2YDMK59FBK5VX]]I have a super tough beard. I like to prime with hot water and Parker soap, then either use Cremo Cream or Premier Dead Sea Luxury Facial Cleanser, both work pretty good and soften my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ Easy to use, comes in a large tube.&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ Very slick and softens well.&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ Easily applied with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ Works best if brush is primed with hot water then shaken down.&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ No bad nor lingering smell.&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ Rinses away well in shower.&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ Lessens drying if primed with soap first.&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ Does not clog up razor, even multi blade razors. It actually seems to extend their life.&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ Does not take much, one tube lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ Works well if warmed in microwave. Do not warm in tube.&lt;br /&gt;â™¦ Warms nicely if placed in a small stainless bowl and placed on a candle warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â–º I prefer to put the Cremo in a stainless bowl and whip with my hot brush. It keeps the soap from drying out and I do not have to rewet. This is also available at CVS pharmacy in you run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â–º The video is to give you an idea of what it looks like and the ingredient list. Best viewed in FULL SCREEN so you can read easier. Hit PAUSE to read label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Everything that all the other 5-star reviews say. I&#x27;m a full-head shaver who has tried a great many products, and Cremo is hands-down the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion: buy it before you run out of your normal shaving cream/gel. Go every-other-shave between the two until you use up your old one. Every shave with the old stuff is disappointing and gets more and more so, until you just throw it out and use the Cremo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, my &amp;#34;old-one&amp;#34; cream was the best of everything I&#x27;ve tried in 20-years of shaving. I threw it out this morning.</li>
            <li> Just bought a tube of this because my local pharmacy quit carrying my favorite puck.  I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.  If you are a D.E. shaver then do not use this product!  It is not a good fit for mug and brush, the lather is thin. On the label it tout&#x27;s &amp;#34;water activated molecules&amp;#34;.  I tried this product with various states of hydration and it was no good in all states.  Although it is slick, that doesn&#x27;t make a good shave medium.  Good old cheapo Williams is a far better product.  If you are a cartridge shaver, I suppose this is fine, although you could also use whatever soap or body wash and get away with it just fine.  Threw the tube away, will not repeat.</li>
            <li> Smooth and provides for the best possible shave. Vendor was quick on the shipping..only wish they offered a couple of few in the same box</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaving cream!  He no longer has razor burn or razor bumps, and is definitely enjoying the straight razor experience.</li>
            <li> I find this product annoying.  I&#x27;ve used dozens of high end shave care products and this stuff is squarely in the middle.  Thank goodness it was free.  It doesn&#x27;t alleviate the pull, it doesn&#x27;t allow a real close shave as well as others.  Sure the guys who buy Barbasol and are now getting the free tube with the rebate love it, because they&#x27;ve tried nothing else, and it is better than aerosol shave cream.  Mainly it seems like a vehicle for a couple of vain and egotistical men called Kyle Schroeder and Mike Boone to brag about how cool they were to start a company which makes mediocre high end shave creme, which they seem to have to give away to get distribution.  Based on their profiles and promotional information, they seem to think they&#x27;re special to have started a business.  And they want everyone to know it.  And the fact that the Kyle guy quit his job at an internet company to be a fashion model does seem to indicate some vanity.  Anyway,  I give it 3 stars for being mediocre for the price.  And knock one off for having annoying &amp;#34;founders&amp;#34;.  BTW - if you want to try something better, go to West Coast Shaving, click on creams and soaps and almost every product will be better than this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a typical cartridge blade user who shaves in the shower, using Edge gel or the like. In years past, I tried some other  creams but they made me break out. Recently, I decided to try something new. So I bought a Cremo because it was the one upmarket cream on the shelf at Wegman&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the very first, I was impressed. The consistency is great - not thick at all but not watery either. And you hardly have to use any to coat your beard. It has a subtle, very nice light citrus/orange fragrance. Topping it off, I can get a good, close shave with zero blade drag and zero irritation. The difference between this and what I used  before is very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried a lot of competitors. There probably are others that as good or even better. But this is one purchase I plan to make again and again.</li>
            <li> As a recent convert to the DE shaving systems, I&#x27;m trying all sorts of blades, balms, soaps, and creams.  While I like my Shave Secret oil, I am quite impressed with this product.  For those who don&#x27;t like it because it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34; read the directions.  It tells you it won&#x27;t and isn&#x27;t a foam product.  Doh!  While it does say &amp;#34;light lather&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve used enough to know that means it won&#x27;t be like a can of Barbasol or Edge Gel foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice and when paired with my personna razor blades, my DE razor performed very, very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have to keep re-wetting my face to keep the slick factor going...hence the 1 star dock for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, if you like this stuff, your local WallWorld carries it for $5.97 which is a very good deal considering I will try the next shave with less than the almond size amount they say to start with.  $5.97 could last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> Okay, these guys claim this is the &#x27;impossibly slick&#x27; blah blah. CRAP. I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for years now and nothing beats good ol&#x27; Proraso or Speick shaving cream in a metal tube. This stuff isn&#x27;t the worst in the world, but it&#x27;s just not what they say it is, and yes I have followed the directions perfectly. I literally just gave the tube to my wife to use for shaving her legs. Even she is not impressed. Barbasol works just as well. Sorry guys, nice try.</li>
            <li> I started using them when I found it in a local drug store.  It&#x27;s slippery and cleans up easily.  Best of all, it&#x27;s not a foam and it&#x27;s not a Gillette product.  Between this and Dorco razors, I am no longer being ripped off by Gillette and I&#x27;m not cutting my face up on a daily basis.  Is this the best shave cream on the market?  I don&#x27;t know, but it&#x27;s easy for me to find and it beats the crap out of air-lubricated foams.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. The only way to shave.</li>
            <li> The absolute BEST shaving cream i&#x27;ve tried. I have very sensitive skin and shaving used to be a painful process, this has blown my mind. If you have sensitive skin or just want a very pleasant shaving experience look no further. A little goes a long way, and the creamy citrus smell is a big plus in my book. I&#x27;ve trashed all the other expensive creams and gels, and a big plus is I don&#x27;t even have to use after-shave!</li>
            <li> Really is astonishing (!) if used properly.  Apply only a very thin layer to your skin before shaving.  Hard to compare to other products.  This feels much richer than general lathers.  Excellent skin-feel.</li>
            <li> I heard about this fine product on the Dr. Savage radio program. I tried it and I love it. It does just what it&#x27;s supposed to: deliver a smooth, safe, comfortable shave. Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, this product is very economical because you need/use so much less than a typical gel or foam. With Cremo and a safety razor, you will have a better shave and save money too! You will love this product.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream I have ever used.  I will never use anything else.  Just use a small dab and spread it all over.  Smooth shave with one stroke.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I wish I knew about this cream a long time ago. I have used gel for about ten years. Heard a commercial on the radio about this cream and thought I would give it a try. With the Gel I have to shave every two days and my skin feel dry. I also nick myself a lot (I shave my head with the gel only). Now since I started using the cream, I can go three to four days between shaves. I black, so I only use clippers on my face due to razors breaking me out. I&#x27;m still to scared to put this on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Also if you are a big gel user, you will be use to all the foam the gel gives you. The cream does not give you any foam, just a thin layer on your skin. The more water you water the creamer the layer will become.&lt;br /&gt;I will not go back to gel.</li>
            <li> This stuff works as advertised. I have far fewer cuts, get a closer shave, and have no irritation.</li>
            <li> Great shave cream. Adds to the process which adds time to the task but we&#x27;ll worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love Cremo Creme and I will never go back to anything else!! It smells great, plus I can shave both my legs with only a quarter-sized amount and a glass of water to rinse. There&#x27;s no fluffy residue to clog up the razor and it rinses clean! It really does last for 3 months and both me and my husband use it. Try it now and you really will love it.</li>
            <li> I keep about 4 or so different shave creams/soaps on rotation and like to try new ones as i run out. Cremos notable trait is it does seem to lather up easily and to a fairly large amount in comparison to many other brands. If you haven&#x27;t tried it definitely give it a chance</li>
            <li> Wow. I have used traditional creams and soaps (Proraso, Tabac, TOBS, etc.) for several years now and finally decided to give this a whirl. Like the packaging says, this stuff is rediculously slick! Closest, most comfortable, and most effortless shave I have had in YEARS. The &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34; is pretty thin and transparent so I think I will use this as a base before my other creams. I did not use a brush and I don&#x27;t think I ever will with this. Just use my hands to apply a thin lather, then use my brush with the traditional products on top of the super slick goodness that is Cremo Cream. Buy some.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream on market especially for body shaving.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it smells pleasant. It makes your skin very slick and easy to shave. I just wish they made it in smaller packages so I can carry on planes (if they have one, I haven&#x27;t seen it).</li>
            <li> I have used Shave Secret for a few years. And while it&#x27;s perfectly safe to leave on your face after shaving (it will condition your skin, according to the company) I don&#x27;t care for the smell of cloves, and I don&#x27;t want the extra oil on my face, so I wash my face after using it (beyond just wiping with a wet washcloth.)  I recently began shaving my head, and the amount of Shave Secret I had to use combined with the extra step of washing all the oil off made me decide to try this product out. I had seen it at Wal-Mart recently.  It is indeed a slick product. It shaves well, and the smell is great. They say it&#x27;s bergamot-scented. It doesn&#x27;t smell like Earl Grey tea to me, it just smells like a bright, citrusy smell. It does dry up, however. After several minutes I have to rewet it to keep shaving. But eventually it dries up completely and I have to reapply the product to finish shaving. This is for shaving your head, shaving your face shouldn&#x27;t take that long.  I have also tried it shaving my face, and I do find Shave Secret a superior shave, but for the two reasons stated above, I am likely to continue using this to shave my head.  Update: After using this several times to shave both my head and face, I&#x27;ve come to the opinion that it just dries up too fast. After a few minutes the cream is tacky to the touch and requires the addition of more water to use it again, which isn&#x27;t that bad. However shortly after this, it dries up too much and requires application of more product.  If you shaved your face fast, you might not encounter this. But not only will that give you a worse shave, but if you&#x27;re using a double-edged razor or straight razor, you&#x27;re going to cut yourself.  While shaving my head, it requires application of a considerable amount more than your face. So a tube might last me 10-15 shaves, and at $6 a tube, that&#x27;s a bit expensive.  I still really like the smell of it, and I&#x27;ll probably keep using it for my head for right now. But the fact that it dries up soquickly is annoying. Docking another star for that.  Second Update: I&#x27;ve used this quite a bit since my original review and update, and I believe I was a little too hard on it. I was coming from Shave Secret, which gives a really good shave, and is superior to this product (except in scent, Cremo blows it away.) But as I mentioned earlier, washing it off my head takes awhile so that&#x27;s why I prefer something like this. And unlike Shave Secret which coats your skin in a layer that can&#x27;t be removed simply by shaving, Cremo is like shaving cream in that the action of shaving will remove it as well, leading to another one of my complaints. But compared to shaving cream, Cremo is absolutely superior.  I&#x27;ve cut back on the amount I use, and I haven&#x27;t really noticed as much of a &amp;#34;drying-out&amp;#34; problem as I did before. If I seem to be running low on it, I just add a little bit more to my head and add a little water as well, and it&#x27;s good to go again.  I&#x27;m adding another star because I feel like being fair to the product. It really is a good product, I just wish it was easier to find. Only one Wal-Mart in my town sells it, and even then not all the time. I eventually ordered a 3-pack from Amazon for what 3 tubes from a store would cost me.  It&#x27;s also great to transfer to one of those 3-ounce travel squeeze tubes also available from Wal-Mart, to put in your travel bag. I know the company itself offers a travel size, but this way you get half a tube to use at home, and a travel tube to take with you.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this from amazon, instead I bought it at my local store. I have used this cream regularly for the last two weeks and will continue to do so until the tube is gone, however I am not a fan of its abilities as a shaving cream. I prefer a nice thick lather and application via a badger hair brush and mainly shave with a safety razor or a straight razor so my needs in a shaving cream are probably a little bit different than the cartridge shaver. I probably will not buy again.</li>
            <li> As advertised. I liked it better than king of shaves.</li>
            <li> When my old favorite Gel Gillette was no longer made, I had to start a search for shave cream / gel that would be comfortable for shaving my head in the shower.  Thank&#x27;s to Amazon, I found one brand that worked well but was very expensive, came in a harder plastic bottle and left waxy residue on the shaver and shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This started a new search that has ended happily with the Cremo Shave Cream.  Super comfortable shaves.  It seems to leave no residue, is easy to squeeze just the right amount and has a more than fair price.  Some reviewers mention products that work better for them but I am happy to have my search stop here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a cheap can of sticky foam. It&#x27;s not a gel. There&#x27;s nothing here that will rust. It is a step out of the ordinary that we have become accustomed to and because of that, your face will thank you...and anything else you need to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed upon my first shave is the aroma. It does not resemble the smell of gels or foams from a can. There is a slight citrus smell to it. The smell reminds me of a mixture between [[ASIN:B00JQQBEQ8 Bigelow Earl Grey Black Tea, 20 Tea Bags]] and [[ASIN:B0034KULLG Bigelow Constant Comment Black Tea, 40 Count Box (2.37OZ)]] If you have ever enjoyed drinking these teas, then you are familiar with the smell of Cremo Cream. It&#x27;s different, luxurious and provides you with the best shave out there bar none!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The words on the front of the tube says it better than any reviewer could...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;THE ASTONISHINGLY SUPERIOR SHAVE CREAM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPOSSIBLY SLICK WATER ACTIVATED MOLECULES DRAMATICALLY REDUCE NICKS AND RAZOR IRRITATION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GIVES YOU THE CLOSEST, MOST COMFORTABLE LONGEST LASTING SHAVE&lt;br /&gt;LEAVES YOUR SKIN ASTONISHINGLY SOFT AND SMOOTH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRY IT ONCE TO BELIEVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;ENJOY IT FOR LIFE.

            <li> Grabbed this at the store because they didn&#x27;t have the shave gel I wanted. After a quick check of reviews on amazon I bought this product. I tried it that day. Wow! What a shave. I was using a shave gel everyone swore by and got great reviews on amazon and this is so much better. I have extremely sensitive skin and can only shave every few days without it being very painful. I had a week&#x27;s worth of beard and this allowed the razor to slide right through it. Really great product.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used (I&#x27;m 62)â€¦and I&#x27;ve used everything from Clinique to Jack Black to King of Shaves and everything in between. It works so well in fact that one day when I didn&#x27;t have the time I simply didn&#x27;t shave one morning and by the next morning my beard was still pretty low. Amazing. HOWEVER: You absolutely must do the following to get this product to work. It&#x27;s not a big deal but it&#x27;s the difference between phenomenal success in utter failure: squeeze the prescribed amount into your Palm, rub your palms together, and then work the shaving cream into a lather rather VIGOROUSLY onto your face. It&#x27;s essential. I recommend this product in the strongest possible terms. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time writing this review if I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Very nice product; lives up to its claims of &amp;#34;use very little&amp;#34; and lots of glide. After I bought it, I saw it at Target.</li>
            <li> This is different. Those that are expecting a conventional lather shaving cream seem to be surprised at the lack of same. Cremo is a an aqueous based lubricant. It provides a very thin lubricating layer between the skin and blade. This prevents the razor from clogging, while allowing the blade very close contact with the skin. To maximize performance, use very little (a tube lasts a long time)and add continuous small amounts of water while shaving. When used properly, it&#x27;s like a Teflon coating on your skin.</li>
            <li> If you know how to shave properly this stuff works like a charm! You will like it! I find I have to use twice as much as the almond size indicated, but this stuff is cheap and not messy! I safety razor too! The bad or less than 4 reviews seem to me like they do not know how to use it? IDK...</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband who, much to his chagrin, has had to return to shaving at least once a day for work. With regular shaving cream his razor burn was out of control and he was cutting his neck fairly regularly. Looking to make his shaving experience more enjoyable (and less painful), I purchased Cremo, and we&#x27;re both so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;In the month that he&#x27;s been using the cream, not only is he nick and burn free, his shaves are closer and his complexion more even. His face looks so good that the fellas at work have even asked what he is doing differently and some have even switched to Cremo as well.&lt;br /&gt;My husband is pretty basic when it comes to grooming products but he has had no qualms about switching to this great product. Not sure one tube will last him the full 90 days it claims to, but he&#x27;ll certainly be buying another when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaving cream.  He just raves about it.  I assume this is all he will buy from now on.  Suggest you men give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cremo for a little over three weeks ... so, have enough experience now to write a reasonable review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works well.  I have a moderately heavy beard with hair growing in multiple directions -- so, historically have to pass the razer over the same area a few times from different directions ... it also causes occasional nicks.  Cremo is a lot slicker than the gel I&#x27;ve historically used -- gets a closer shave on the first pass or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re used to a gel or foaming shave cream, it takes a bit of getting used to.  It will not lather up ... so, don&#x27;t overdo the amount you apply else it will clog your razer and the shave won&#x27;t be as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found to be the most effective way to use it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Make sure your face is wet.  I shave immediately after getting out of the shower and don&#x27;t dry my face beforehand.  (I don&#x27;t bother with the rubbing of the face with water -- which is in the directions)&lt;br /&gt;- Run hot water and get your hands wet.&lt;br /&gt;  -- Put a small amount of Cremo on your finger tips.  (I use a pea-sized amount for each area of the face/neck)&lt;br /&gt;  -- Rub it onto your face and re-wet the fingers tips as necessary to spread it (Water doesn&#x27;t seem to take it off and does let you spread the cream more effectively)&lt;br /&gt;  -- Repeat on next area&lt;br /&gt;- You&#x27;ll end up with a very thin layer of cream that the first few times won&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s enough ... but, it is (less is actually more with this product)&lt;br /&gt;- When shaving, keep the blade wet -- the moisture makes Cremo slicker and the shave closer</li>
            <li> On my second tube of this.  I have tried a number of shaving creams and lotions and this one is my favorite so far.  A little goes a long way, it has pleasant feel, provides a close shave and the scent is not overpowering or negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue buying and now my wife is stealing mine, so we added this to our Amazon Subscription.</li>
            <li> Works Great !  Has a nice citrus fragrance, razor just slides on the face, no nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I found this stuff, works better than any can shave cream or gel.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I shave with a Norelco Electric Razor in the Shower. Shaving dry can be a hassle in the warm months with high humidity. Your skin is sticky and even with a clean face the razor will drag. Sometimes I have to use a hair dryer to dry off my face while shaving so the razor won&#x27;t stick. I&#x27;ve tried the pre shave lotions that supposedly dry and lubricate your face, but they leave your face oily and you have to wash or shower afterwards. Might as well do it all in the shower if you can. My Norelco is designed for wet shaves so I started shaving in the shower with shaving cream.  This did not turn out well given that electric razors do not handle that much volume of shaving cream well.  Next I started using bar soap, which was a little better but after the first shave on my face it did not leave enough lubricant to go back over my face and get it closer. Just adding more soap did not seep to work that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had heard this product advertised and decided to try it. I found it locally but the local Walmart is not very reliable on keeping things in stock so I will purchase future shipment from Amazon now I know it is good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the evaluation of Cremo....  it is amazing.  You put a dab about the size of an almond on your fingers and then smooth it over your wet face. It does not seem like an adequate layer of soap if you are used to a shaving lather, but this cream is such an excellent lubricant that it works far better than lather. The electric razor glides across my face and after I have finished the first shave I wet my hand and rub it over my face again. When you do the lubricant seems to reappear making it easy to go back over those sections where you still feel uncut beard growth. The light level of lather allows my razor to cover a lot of area before I have to rinse it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this sounds corny but I actually look forward to shaving given how well this product works.  I have also compared it to some of the high end shaving creams that I also tried. They work well in the shower with electric razors as well, but Cremo is not only priced right but it provided an excellent excellent shave.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have a beard but use this whenever I shave my neck and cheeks. Better than shaving cream or soap, soothes my face for a nice smooth shave, leaves my skin soft. Good stuff. My wife uses it on her legs</li>
            <li> I like how my skin feels after shaving but in some areas of my face and neck its hard to get a close shave. (Chin and between my throat and neck muscle on my neck)</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  Looks like 1940&#x27;s packaging, but it&#x27;s a very modern preparation.  Works exactly as advertised--great skin protection when shaving, use only an &amp;#34;almond&amp;#34; size portion, lather it in, and you&#x27;re good to go.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I wanted something better than the cheap shaving cans you get in the store, and randomly heard about this product. Was the best choice I could have made. After only a few shaves, I am already really glad I made the change. No nicks, less irritation, and a smoother shave.</li>
            <li> A heavy advertising of this product and promise the first will be free...Try and just Love it....perhaps a bit expensive, but, keep you longer and quality shaving cream...Highly recommended !</li>
            <li> After hearing someone rave about this stuff the other day I decided to give it a try.  Not impressed.. The Trader Joes shave cream is less than half the price and gives me a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with TJ&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they&#x27;re only comparing themselves with the old school foams. Soaping up your face and shaving is better then the old foams!</li>
            <li> Thick and rich, by far the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used. Apply with a Clarisonic for a really close shave.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying. Amazing stuff. Smooth, perfect for sensitive skin, washes off actually cleanly. For the price, the best stuff out there.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my face smooth and cut free.</li>
            <li> This a superior shave cream. I like using shaming creams in pretty pink bottles, but the heavy fragrance just seemed to irritate my skin, so even though this is technically a men&#x27;s shaving cream, I decided to give it a try. It has a unusual consistency, but it gives a really close shave and leaves your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Smells like an orange creamsicle and has to be reapplied more or less after each pass and I usually do three.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is amazing. It&#x27;s super slick as advertised. Slicker than any shaving cream or soap I&#x27;ve used before. My only complaint is the smell- it reminds me of a pomegranate orange scent. Its really fruity and not my thing. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it was more manly or fresh smelling. Also, it leaves your face incredibly smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Best shaving creme ever! Once you try it, you won&#x27;t go back!</li>
            <li> Excellent cream.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; up, but will lather.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, the first day I used it, I thought I made a mistake buying this.  THEN, I read the instructions.  If you follow the instructions, you WILL get a closer shave.  Particularly if you use HOT water to soak a towel and wrap your face in it first.&lt;br /&gt;Very smooth results.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it lasts and lasts and lasts.  I shave every day, use about a &amp;#34;small almond&amp;#34; size amount, and it lasted a little over 6 months!  So depending on what price you paid, it&#x27;s not very much per month for a smoother, closer shave.  Buy it!</li>
            <li> Cremo works as advertised. I have a rough beard that grows every which direction, especially on my sensitive neck. I&#x27;ve used many kinds of sensitive skin shaving creams and gels over the years and was used to cutting and scraping myself bloody. Cremo has ended the bleeding and lets me get a closer and smoother shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take a dab of Cremo and smear it around my wet face. Then I splash on more hot water and work up a bit of lather. Then I simply shave it off, rinsing off the razor with every other swipe. The blades slide smoothly across my visage, even when I take a second and third pass without adding more lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically shave every two or three days, so my beard is always a challenge. I use Cremo with Dorco Pace 6+1 razors, but I get good performance without chafing even when I use a cheap Gillette Good News or drug store generic disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only finishing my first 6 oz. tube that I started eight months ago. I would be on my third can of Nivea Shave Gel by now, so even though Cremo costs more per unit, its cheaper to use than my favorite drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it&#x27;s an ok product. I guess I&#x27;ll throw in notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I used this for head also. So obviously this didn&#x27;t last the 90 days and I obviously used more than the recommended size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The instructions require you to use alot of water per usage. Basically you&#x27;re wetting your skin with the hottest water possible for about a minute or so. This might be a contributing reason why it left my face smooth etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. On the head it does good - pretty good. Occasionally I&#x27;d have to over. On the facial hair it didn&#x27;t really cover like I&#x27;d expect it to. There would be points where I&#x27;d go to the mirror to work and notice areas missed. Even with new blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Bumps were drastically less and skin was noticeably better. No redness etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really debating on whether to get this again.  I did recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is not bad, but not the best either. It is not as thick as the instructions indicate and you have to use more than an almond size especially if you have significant beard growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I reach for the cremo when I want an easy brushless shave. The cream applies almost translucently and activates with water. It doesn&#x27;t work well with a brush (neither badger fine nor synthetic), but it&#x27;s okay for a quick shave every now and then. It also doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin as it has no harsh ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not memorable. Overall this is what a shaving cream should be, but it&#x27;s not a standout.</li>
            <li> great product! Best shaving cream Ive ever used.</li>
            <li> I use this shaving cream on my legs, no cuts or razor burn, I love it.</li>
            <li> I was given this as gift.  I use DE razors and have tried a number of shave soaps, cremes and foams.  After a few years of trying various products, I settled on, of all things, Barbasol shave cream....$1.69 per can at my local grocery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Cremo about six times since receiving it and it does give a good shave though not any better than Barbasol.  It is certainly better than the high dollar soaps that require a brush and is much better than the higher end Italian and British tubed creams.  While I don&#x27;t find it &amp;#34;Astonishing&amp;#34; or a miracle, I do find that it does the job with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price since I can achieve the same results with a can of Barbasol but if that wasn&#x27;t available or if they changed the formula, I would switch to this product.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this a try as my usual shaving cream (Aveeno Oatmeal) appears to have vanished from the stores.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like it almost instantly- first the heady perfume smell which seems to linger on you all day.&lt;br /&gt;The stuff goes on paper thin, it doesn&#x27;t lather worth a darn and I found myself using almost half the tube up in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real problem I have with this is the stickiness.... it grabs the razor and stretches my skin like rubber, I feel like I would look like the aged Walter Matthau after using it for a month.  I thought at first I just had a dull razor but switched to brand new (and got the cuts to prove it) still it grabs and doesn&#x27;t slide.  Also annoyingly it drips/splashes on the sink, which my old more clumpy? cream never does.&lt;br /&gt;I use single blade disposables maybe this is designed for a different razor?  Got me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw it out after two days, something I&#x27;ve never done.  I guess experiences may vary........... but this is the worst stuff I&#x27;ve used I can remember.  :/</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. I&#x27;m been on Plavix after having a stint plced in one of my coronary arteries. Anyone on this medication knows that if you cut yourself such as in shaving, it takes forever to stop bleeding. I even ruined a few shirts. I been using Cremo Cream for about six months and have not had any cuts or nicks.</li>
            <li> may not look like its covering your face well but razor burn is nearly a thing of the past. and 6 oz size will last a good long time.</li>
            <li> Ive tried a few of the big name brands and a couple old school brands off of amazon.  This is my favorite shaving cream.  I use it mainly to shave my scalp and this product works wonders.  Just some hot water and a dollop of this and youre good to go.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Okay, this is for all those 1 star reviews that complained about the lack of lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to read the tube...really. The makers state rather clearly that their problem with traditional shave cream is that too much of the product does nothing for you at all, due to too much lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is designed to coat the skin in a thin lubricating layer *without much lather at all*. If you want mountains of white foamy shave cream on your face, you&#x27;ve got the wrong product!! it&#x27;s not the maker&#x27;s fault, however, as they have stated so in a very obvious fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, forget everything you know about shave creams and gels for now and assume you&#x27;ve never shaved before. You only need a very small amount to cover your face. Again, the recommended amount is an &#x27;almond-sized&#x27; amount, not a pile of stuff in your hand. If you use too much it will, as some have complained, gum up your razor. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for almost a month now, and I use Gillette Fusion on my face and head. No gumming or clogging issues with my razor and this shave cream. I have also noticed it doesn&#x27;t make a mess of my sink like other shave creams and gels have in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you rub it into your face, or between your hands, it&#x27;s not going to lather up much at all. IT&#x27;S NOT SUPPOSED TO. by the way, I have found that the same amount will also cover my head along with my face, so you really don&#x27;t need much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a unique scent that takes some getting used to, but even at that it&#x27;s not overpowering or offensive in my view, and then aftershave works just fine to cover that up as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that, yes, this stuff is slippery, but then, that&#x27;s the point of their product, to lubricate the shave itself in a better way than other products do. By the way,it washes off just fine, and it doesn&#x27;t build up a layer of white flaky crud on your razor handle either. big plus there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it stands, I&#x27;mhooked. This stuff works very well, if not exactly as advertised by the maker. I haven&#x27;t noticed a superior shave to what I&#x27;m used to yet, however the level of irritation has all but disappeared. If I&#x27;m in a big hurry to shave, I&#x27;m going to get irritation no matter what&#x27;s on my face. If I take my time, this stuff works wonders. I&#x27;m nearly paranoid about not being able to find it when I need more, so I&#x27;ll be purchasing a few extra tubes promptly.</li>
            <li> I doubt it will last as long as they claim but it does give a good shave with my Phillips electric.  It stays on the face well and allows you to go back over areas unlike many others.  Good quality yes.</li>
            <li> This was my first foray into traditional shave cream and I have been very pleased with the performance of Cremo. I&#x27;ve been upgrading my shave kit with a better razor and better cream and aftershave, and this has become an essential part of my shaving routine.&lt;br /&gt;  It took some getting used to the much smaller quantity of cream on my face and the slick texture. Having used Barbasol and cheap shave gels all my life, I was used to applying massive amounts of Santa-Claus-beard foam that looks and feels on my skin a bit like spray sealant. Cremo, in contrast, has more of a soapy, even lotion-like texture. I lather it in my palms, and a good wet lather always gives me enough cream for complete beard and neck coverage. The shave is noticeably more pleasant than I&#x27;m used to with cheap foams.&lt;br /&gt;  It has a gentle citrus scent, tending toward grapefruit. I have sensitive skin, and after switiching to Cremo, as well as Shea Moisture&#x27;s Tea Tree alcohol-free aftershave, I have had nothing but close shaves, and smooth, bump-free skin that&#x27;s not left red and dried out. I shave about 4-5 days a week, and my first tube of Cremo lasted me 6 months. I usually only do one pass shaves, but in any case, I think the tube should last the average person quite a bit longer than the 2 months the bottle claims. This is well worth a try.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream I have ever used.  Works a lot better than any of the many Gillette products I have used over the years.  This stuff makes your face slick so the razor doesn&#x27;t catch on anything.  I used to have problems going against the grain on my neck, but with this stuff I don&#x27;t get the ingrown hairs that I used to get with the other products.  The directions tell you to rinse your face with the &amp;#34;hottest water you can stand for 30 seconds&amp;#34;.  I have not always followed this instruction, but I have yet to experience a bad shave with this cream.  So far the worst shave with this cream is better than the best shave I ever had with the Gillette or Neutrogena products.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely one of the best shaving creams I&#x27;ve tried.  I used to be a fan of Palmolive green tube but that disappeared years ago.  I heard the commercial on Sirius radio and after a few weeks of hearing about the product, I decided to try it. That was 3 months ago and today I picked up my second tube. I have two cans of some other brand foam in my cabinet that I will have to donate to some unfortunate charity as I will never wish that other stuff on anyone now that I&#x27;ve tried your product. Exceptional product and one that I recommend at least once or twice a week to my customers I talk to. Thank you for your product...</li>
            <li> Update 11/26/16&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve continued to use it as promised in the comments to the company. I now like it and would buy again. It is useful as a quick, good shaving cream when theres not time to sit and do the whole process for a true lather up wet shave. It has lasted a long time because I usually use just the recommneded &amp;#34;almond&amp;#34; sized amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t work that well for me. I normally use a brush and safety razor. This doesn&#x27;t protect from razor burn like a good lather from shave soap. When used with my brush to make a lather it is a little better. I tried some on top of &amp;#34;shave secret&amp;#34; oil and it was even a little better still, but still not going to buy again. Good lather/shave soap e.g. proraso&amp;#62; shave secret &amp;#62;&amp;#62; Cremo</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product merely by happenstance. I am currently deployed overseas and the small chapel on our base has a room where care packages sent to unspecified military members are left out for anyone to rifle through. It was here that I found this stuff in one of the boxes and am always on the look out for a better product. I took this back to my room and decided to give it a whirl. My first reaction was shock, honest to goodness. First, it&#x27;s kind of fun to put on. You literally only need a squeeze the size of an almond, just like the directions say. Then you scrub your face. Scrub scrub scrub, which of course feels good, but it&#x27;s opening your pores, the hot(ish, here) helps get your face ready, and then once that tiny little dab is all over, the shave is smooth and silky. I can shave less often and not have to worry about superiors saying I&#x27;m not shaving close enough and my skin feels healthier. The best part is I&#x27;m still using my first bottle(? container thingy) and I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 4 months. My shave cans never last that long and I&#x27;m not even halfway through it. Phenomenal product. I&#x27;m actually about to order the facial cleanser/moisturizer specifically because the shaving cream is so outstanding. Try it! You&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through all sorts of different shave cream brands, most recently using Aveeno. Cremo is the product I&#x27;ve ever used. Leaves a very close shave, no nicks, and no irritation, and I have very sensitive skin. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I was able to get this shave cream at Wal-Mart in this area, so I decided too shave with it this morning, the results are fantastic. The cream gave a real close smooth shave. I do recommend adding a good amount of water, because once the cream is added to your head it does dry quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying a lot of different creams so I can decide which one I&#x27;m going to keep and this one is very good. But not enough for me. I do prefer the foam ones and this one despite being very slick it doesn&#x27;t work well for me for the fact that it doesn&#x27;t lather. But still a very good one!!</li>
            <li> Shaved against the grain with a DE razor, no problem. Will try their cleanser and moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream for the price on the market.  Actually ends up being cheaper than Gillette or store-brand shaving gel since a tube lasts so long.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Very good. Thank you Dr. Michael Savage. Only time will tell if you can get 90 shaves out of a tube.</li>
            <li> I bought the product after reading all the good reviews. Don&#x27;t waste your money. It&#x27;s not worth it. I followed the instructions exactly, and it doesn&#x27;t work well.  Spend your money on a better product.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Edge or the Gels - pretty economical and smells good - does not protect very well and not very slippery.</li>
            <li> this is my husband&#x27;s new favorite!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Die Hard Brush And Cream / Soap Shaving Fan! Vintage Safety Razor Fan For Sure!&lt;br /&gt;With that said.. when on the run, off on a trip for business. This stuff works very well and moisturizes.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a quick Baby Butt Smooth shave without all the hassle of soaking a brush and building a mug soap lather.&lt;br /&gt;I still enjoy that aspect of shaving... but when on the run this stuff does a great job. One tube will last a long long time&lt;br /&gt;beating the socks off of your basic canned goop or gel, and far better for your skin. Love The Stuff!</li>
            <li> Best shaving lotion I have ever used. My skin is drier than when I used Neutrogena Shave Cream but the comfort and closeness of the shave is excellent.</li>
            <li> You have to wonder what&#x27;s going on when hundreds of people love a product a handful flat out hate it. I bought a tube of Cremo a few months back and waited awhile to review it because your first impression is not always accurate. After thirty years using the same type of shaving cream for my face there might be a period of adjustment involved. On the first use of Cremo, I loved everything about the stuff: the smell, the close shave, the compactness of the tube (I travel for a living). Now, two months later, I&#x27;m using the same tube and I still love it. I fill the sink with hot water prior to a shower, put the whole tube in to let it heat up, and have a nice hot shave after the shower, dipping the razor in the water between strokes. You&#x27;ll like Cremo, especially if you follow the directions on the tube.</li>
            <li> Expensive as compared to other shaving products. Difficult to impossible to rinse from my double edge razor much less my face. As the tube empties and gets to half or less it&#x27;s difficult to squeeze the product out and onto my finger tips. Greasy and feels slimy. I&#x27;ll stick to saving soap.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrific shave cream. Does not lather but that is no big deal. Very slick, it allows for a very comfortable glide. The shaves I get are the best ever. Smooth as a baby&#x27;s backside without razor burn or irritation. Highly recommended. And if you go to a certain big box retailer based in Arkansas, you can get it for $3.98.</li>
            <li> Best shave I have ever had. And the stuff lasts forever. Forget those cans of foam...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it, but this actually works. I&#x27;m amazed. I really thought it would end up in the trash with most of the ones making these claims.</li>
            <li> Very Slick.  I dont know what some people are complaining about. I dont think they know how to use this properly, and expect a thick peaky lather.  It doesnt lather the same as other shave products, but it is slick and leaves you with a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;Ive used it with DE shavers and Straight Edge, and with both i didnt get nicked and i got a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I bumped up my review from 1 star to three.  I did this because in part my original review was based on the fact that I repeatedly tried to contact Cremo and was never replied to.  Cremo did eventually reply to me,  and very kindly sent me at no charge both some replacement Cremo and their skin conditioner product (which is excellent). They also followed up with additional contact. Once I finally spoke to them I thought that they really were interested in being helpful, and that&#x27;s a rare thing these days (unfortunately).   I still don&#x27;t find the Cremo a good shaving solution **for me**.  Others find it to work well for them and that&#x27;s great.  One thing I did find Cremo is useful for however is to add to other shaving soaps.  It &amp;#34;slickens&amp;#34; them up and can improve a marginal shave soap quite a bit.  Of course that&#x27;s not its primary purpose but at least it&#x27;s not going to waste.    For those of you who comment that I failed to understand how to use Cremo, (because I tried to lather the Cremo just to see if it would lather), I would ask you to read more carefully.  I quote from the label instructions in the review and clearly state that the product is not meant to be used with a brush but rather is to be massaged onto one&#x27;s face with one&#x27;s fingers.  The original (rather harsh) review is below:  Found Cremo at my local drug store and had high hopes for it, but it did not live up to the hype on the label.  First for those who complain this product &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t lather&amp;#34; - it really isn&#x27;t supposed to be used with a mug and brush. The label says pretty clearly to massage this onto your skin and it will form a &amp;#34;light lather&amp;#34;. However it really won&#x27;t do that. The best I was able to achieve was a kind of film, like lotion. Just to see, I put Cremo in a mug and I will say with a stiff brush and a bit of effort you can get it to lather.  However there is no point in doing so.  Cremo made my hand slippery. It made my razor slippery. I had to wash both after applying Cremo in order to be able to hold on to the razor.  Cremo is hard to rinse out of a double-edge single-bladed safety razor and tended to &amp;#34;gum up&amp;#34; the blade. Despite all that, Cremo provided no real protection for my face. During the time I have been wet-shaving, I have had my share of nicks. I have used plenty of different soaps and creams and blades. Using Cremo was the only time I actually cut, not nicked but CUT myself. This with a blade and razor that I have used successfully many times (naturally when trying something new, I want every other factor to be a known quantity).  I have a thick, coarse beard. Maybe this product is not meant for me? I can&#x27;t say since the label and website don&#x27;t mention it, and unlike some other reviewers, my attempts to contact the company have been unsuccessful. Overall I have to say I found this product hard to use, messy, hard to clean up, hard to rinse out of the razor, and ineffective for its intended purpose. I found the citrusy scent to be pleasant enough but that&#x27;s the only good thing I can say. Based on reviews it is clear that this stuff is working well for some people, in fact lots of people. It did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Hardly any razor bumps and lasts a long time!  There&#x27;s a &amp;#34;lady&amp;#34; version but this does the same job and smells just as nice for less.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Astonishingly&amp;#34; I wasn&#x27;t astonished! &amp;#34;Superior&amp;#34; To what? Sorry, but I really get put off by overblown claims in the description a manufacturer says about it&#x27;s own product. Having said that, I think &amp;#34;Cremo&amp;#34; is a good product, but no better than &amp;#34;Proraso&amp;#34;. Actually I think Proraso is a a little bit &amp;#34;slicker&amp;#34;. When taking cost into consideration (several dollars less than Proraso) Cremo is a good product at a reasonable price. Oh, and yes I read and followed the instructions.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for shaving in the shower at the Y. It covers evenly and shaves off well, providing a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use L&#x27;Occitane at home that my wife gave me. That actually provides a smoother and thicker cream. Yet, it is tenacious and trough to rinse off. Oh, and costs a couple times as much. Cremo does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> I was confident that this would be an acceptable shave cream from reading the label, but my experiences with this were nothing short of awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to using higher quality creams like Proraso and C.O. Bigelow, and this is definitely inferior, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather I got from this product was pretty much the worst lather imaginable.  Imagine trying to shave with kid&#x27;s bubble bath soap.  It was watery and runny, and yet full of bubbles.  Pretty much the complete opposite of what the label on the back had claimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last shave I had with this, I had more nicks on my face than any other time I can remember in the past few years - and I&#x27;m completely serious.  I might have been better off just shaving with water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Creamo for about a year. I apply if with a brush, on my wet face and its great. I swipe the brush under warm water and reapply for a second pass. Rinse with washcloth. It&#x27;s a great shave cream.</li>
            <li> I am a woman and I use this for my legs and my underarms. It has a nice scent and functions well for its intended purpose. You really only need a little bit for a good shave. I will likely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I shave with a twin blade - Gillette Atra Plus - and this gives an excellent close shave with no irritation. Far superior to the typical gels and foams, better than other premium cremes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Horrible. If you like to spend extra time cleaning this gunk out of your razor, and you have plenty of time to spend in the bathroom working with this paste, this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the IMPORTANT directions, no lather. Give me the tried and true shave cream for $1.99 that works.</li>
            <li> Really good sharing cream; lasts a long time.  Better than most</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I shave my entire head and cremo is great for it. It smells great and worked as described. Just make sure to follow directions.</li>
            <li> I use a double-bladed safety razor so having a good shaving cream is important to me.  I&#x27;ve used Proraso and was reasonably happy with it but didn&#x27;t really like the extra time needed to prepare it or do multiple passes.  The aerosol creams are just a stopgap if nothing better is available.  I actually bought this in Walmart and was a bit skeptical, but after the first use I didn&#x27;t want to use anything else.  For such a small amount of lather, I had the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced, with no nicks, and all on the first application.  The cream is extremely slick, cleans easily out of my razor, and will probably last me for several months given how little is required to shave.  Shaving used to be such an ultra-expensive necessity between the multi-blade razors and worthless creams.  Between my double-blade razor and this stuff, I&#x27;ll probably spend 10% of what I did just three years ago, and am getting a far better shave to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget the spray cream junk, soap cups, or brushes.  You won&#x27;t regret using Creemo.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Works as advertised. It really does lubricate and protect (from razor burn) skin much better than even premium canned gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Too many ingredients including many I cannot even pronounce. If you&#x27;re looking for something a bit more &#x27;natural&#x27; than canned shave gels, this is a poor choice. This has twice as many ingredients as your standard Gillette shave gel including a whole load of synthetic chemicals not found in normal shave gels which are artificial enough at is it.&lt;br /&gt;2. Unlike gels, this stuff does NOT stay in place and will run all over the place. If you need to shave your head, this stuff will make a HUGE mess and get all in your eyes and mouth.. The smell is annoying, the taste is horrible and it burns your eyes much worse than almost anything I&#x27;ve experienced short of mace.</li>
            <li> Several years ago I grew tired of the ineffective shaving creams/gels and the wildly overpriced cartridge type blades so I went back to the basics, a nice quality DE89 razor, a badger brush, and a shaving bowl.  Wow, shaving this way is a treat, but there is one drawback.  Time.  I love whipping up a nice thick lather with a hot brush, and then working the lather into my beard before executing a perfectly smooth comfortable shave.  Now the game changer.  Cremeo!  Before using a brush I enjoyed shaving in the shower to expedite my morning routine, and since moving to a real shave I missed the convenience.  I had used Cremeo a few times when the idea came to me, and I blended the very best of both worlds.  A close comfortable shave, and convenience.  I call it the &amp;#34;Mud Method&amp;#34;.  Try this just once and you will be a fan, I promise.  So here it is, I have my badger brush, Cremeo, and my good razor in the shower.  To start, let the warm shower moisten your brush for a minute, just enough to get it saturated with water.  Shake out the excess water with a flick of the wrist and add about and almond size dollop of Cremeo directly on your brush.  Then whip up a nice lather by working your beard the brush, very quickly a nice lather will gather on your face.  Once lathered, grab your razor and shave.  The blade will slide across your face smoothly and effortlessly leaving behind a shave so smooth even your kids will notice.  I use the 3 pass method most often, and trust me, the brush will hold enough lather for all three passes.  Try this once, and I am convinced you will be a fan of this product, and of the Mud Method.  ;-)</li>
            <li> Smell is a little chemically, but it works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> The best shaving cream. I love it</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving with a DE for the past few years and have enjoyed it except when I traveled because most hotel etc do not have soft water and most soaps and creams gum up on the razor and do not perform as well as with soft water.  When I first traveled with this it was because of it&#x27;s ease of use (no brush, bowl etc.), however I was pleasantly surprised that it did not gum up my razor and the &amp;#34;slickness&amp;#34; was maintained with hard water.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to, but has a nice orange smell and does a good job.</li>
            <li> His Gleaming Baldness, Seth Godin, recommends this shave cream so I had to try it.  Converted!  Will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever... Will buy again,&lt;br /&gt;And this is from a guy who has 5 O&#x27;clock shadow at 1 already...</li>
            <li> This stuff really is &amp;#34;Astonishingly Superior&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve used everything from high-dollar shaving soaps and creams to low-dollar spray-cans of shaving foam, and this stuff beats them all.  Smoothest shave imaginable...requires just the right amount of water to lather up without getting too thin...then you can even get another pass by just working in a little more water with what&#x27;s left on your face.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of shave creams, gels, foams, etc. over the past two decades. Cremo&#x27;s Shave Cream is (along with a Proraso cream I also use) THE BEST I have ever used. I have skin that easily becomes irritated from shaving and this Cremo dramatically reduces irritation. Simultaneously, it does not irritate my sensitive skin and it helps to prevent the skin on my face from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other Reviewers who have noted that you need to prepare this cream correctly in order to get the maximum benefits, and it is very important to understand that this is a very concentrated product. Hotter water to the face prior to application makes shaving easier and makes this product work best (and it is worth noting that water that is hotter works better than water that is just warm). Then, a small size (I use about 2-3 peas worth) is what should be worked into the already wet skin on the face. REALLY work it in good and develop a nice lather that is neither runny nor so thick that it is difficult to rinse off of the razor. When you really work this cream into your skin, you are not just prepping for a close shave, but you are also massaging the moisturizers into your skin, and this WILL greatly reduce irritation. Now you are ready to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave using the Fusion Pro Glides as I find that reduces irritation over standard razors. I cannot tell you how well this works with other razors, but with the Pro Glide it works wonders. You can shave against the grain without irritation. To finish off the shave, I dry my face with a towel (I do not rinse but rather pat dry with a towel as I prefer to keep the moisturizers from the Cremo on my skin) and I then apply a Proraso aftershave lotion for sensitive skin. Amazingly, I get almost zero irritation despite this combination giving me the closest shaves I have ever had in my life. Additionally, I can now shave more frequently (if need be) than I did prior to using Cremo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a tendency to get acne or breakouts when your pores get clogged, I have some good news for you: despite Cremo having a ton of moisturizers in their shaving cream, it DOES NOT CLOG PORES! I have used quite a few products which do, so this is a huge plus to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this product does not irritate my sensitive skin, that says a whole lot about how good this Cremo really is, and I feel that indicates for most people this product will prevent irritation. You can get a super-close shave with this and you can even shave against the grain if you want without irritation. While much more expensive than other products, the 6 ounces will give you many shaves as the amount required per-shave is so little, plus you are getting a product that will not only give you a closer shave, but it will also reduce irritation while simultaneously moisturizing your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hundreds of glowing reviews here show that this is a very consistent product. While skin is unique in a sense that not all products may work equally-well for different people, these reviews show that Cremo gives outstanding results on many different skin types and sensitivities. So if you ask me I think this is well-worth the money and if you are chasing that ultimate, irritation-free shave, this is your product!o get acne or breakouts when your pores get clogged, I have some good news for you: despite Cremo having a ton of moisturizers in their shaving cream, it DOES NOT CLOG PORES! I have used quite a few products which do, so this is a huge plus to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this product does not irritate my sensitive skin, that says a whole lot about how good this Cremo really is, and I feel that indicates for most people this product will prevent irritation.

So if you ask me I think this is well-worth the money and if you are chasing that ultimate, irritation-free shave, this is your product!</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t grow much facial hair, and to some it may appear as none at all, this stuff still works great. You don&#x27;t have to heap it on, so it lasts a long time. You get such a clean shave and my skin has never been irritated using this. Just don&#x27;t go thinking you can be in those shaving commercials now! I would definitely buy this product again! I still have so much left even though I&#x27;ve had it so long. It&#x27;s a great addition to your daily routine!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this so much he purchased some for each of our (adult) children.  He says it feels amazing on sensitive skin and really promotes a smooth (and painfree) shave.</li>
            <li> Cremo makes for the smoothest shave I have ever had. I have used everything from a mug and brush to gels. Nothing matches this. There are others that jumped on the band wagon. But follicle, per follicle nothing has given me a closer shave except a hot towel and straight razor shave from a Barber. I learned how to shave from him, but I could never match what he could produce, until came across Cremo Shave Cream. This compensated for the absence of the straight razor due to the lubrication on your skin. The smoother the cutting blade travels down the skin the smoother the results. You won&#x27;t get much else better to lubricate shaving and leaving your skin smooth and soft. It is simply good.</li>
            <li> Awesome shaving cream.  Far better than any gilette or other commonly available brands of after shave</li>
            <li> I think this product is great. I&#x27;ve been using for about 5 month now and have noting but great things to say. It does not later up like regular shave cream unless you use more than suggested. Just keep this stuff wet and you will get a great shave.</li>
            <li> My favorite. good value for the money and a great shave!</li>
            <li> no better then canned cream</li>
            <li> Some of the best shaving cream I ever used. A lot of people write a review saying it doesn&#x27;t lather well, well it doesn&#x27;t lather like normal foamy shaving cream, but the point isn&#x27;t the lather of it. It&#x27;s a really good product because a little goes a long way; I bought one from the drug store what feels like 5 months ago and I&#x27;m not even done with the bottle. It&#x27;s very good for getting a close shave and for that reason I highly reccommend it over anything else you can get at a store. I haven&#x27;t tried any online fancy shaving creams but this one is great</li>
            <li> I felt compelled to comment after feeling duped into buying this junk.  Based on an online recommendation and reviews I gave it a try.  It was pointless.  Yes it was slick, but had to be re-wetted three or four times just to make a single pass.  It dries out super fast.  I&#x27;m good with the smell (seems citric - like oranges) , and it did allow a close shave with no irritation, but the extra mess and hassle and time of keeping it watered and having that running down my elbow constantly was just B.S.  If you are a shower shaver you may have better luck with this stuff as it needs to be very wet.  I guess sometimes high tech just doesn&#x27;t cut it when it comes to things that have been successfully done another way for 100+ years.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok. I went back to standard cream. It feels like it takes longer to wash this stuff off.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  So long aerosol cans of shaving cream.  What I love about this is that it really forces you to massage your beard before shaving setting up a great shave.  You have to read the directions though - this is a different method than your traditional Barbosol or Edge gel for shaving.</li>
            <li> So I bought this based on all the great reviews. Man, was I disappointed. It&#x27;s shaving cream. It works exactly 0% better than most any other product you might use. It works, but not better. Shampoo or conditioner works too. Astonishingly superior? No. You might as well spend $ 1.89. You get the same shave. Look to other products for a superior shave.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  I much prefer my Gillette Foamy.  This stuff sticks to your skin - hard to wash off.  Does not foam.  Thick cream.  I see no benefit.  A lot of marketing hype.  No sure why the others are so jacked off on the product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing... I heard about it on a radio commercial and figured it was another gimmick. Came to Amazon to read the reviews, laugh at the 2 star rating and move on with my life... When I saw that it got great reviews I figured i&#x27;d try it... The first time using this the only way to describe what happened is I had to check to make sure my razor was actually working. It was the smoothest, most close and pain free shave ever! Follow the directions on the package... you will be golden. Cannot possibly recommend this enough!</li>
            <li> Smoooooooth shave, smells great, and I only have to go over my skin one time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, who always has terrible razor burn. He does get a closer shave with less burn, but he says he can&#x27;t really tell and doesn&#x27;t really care. Oh well! He still uses it and he likes it; he just doesn&#x27;t care enough to keep buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it as well. I didn&#x27;t get as close a shave on my legs or bikini line, but I had a lot less razor burn. So we might keep buying it.</li>
            <li> I get much better results using regular bars of hand soap than Cremo. It wasn&#x27;t very slick, it offered no buffer and my face was raw all day.</li>
            <li> I have tried a great many shave cream / soap / gels over the past 40+ years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Creamo I used a &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; gel to shave in the shower at my gym and the excellent Bluebeard&#x27;s / Dreadnaught shave cream to use with a brush when shaving at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased Creamo on a whim as I was running out of my usual gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put I think Creamo is the best shave cream product I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that anyone who is not getting a superior result with Creamo must not be following the directions correctly.  This is a very concentrated product, and a small amount is all that is required.  You will not get a high volume lather.  Don&#x27;t worry, this is normal.  Creamo is the slickest shave cream you&#x27;ll ever use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a noticeably closer shave with absolutely no burn whatsoever regardless if I am using a disposable razor or a &amp;#34;hi end&amp;#34; DE razor and blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus, I was pleased to learn that a visit to the Creamo web site will provide new customers with a rebate equal to you purchase price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good work Creamo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become a Cremo convert.  Much better than traditional style shaving cream and better than shaving soap; works well in the shower too.  I get a great shave every time with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> It is astonishingly smooth. I will never use another shaving cream after having used this only twice. Amazing stuff here!</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been using gels and whatever was on sale, not anymore. This, along with a nice blade, has produced the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. As someone who used to shave sometimes twice daily for work (military), this has help provide such a close and smooth shave that I only have to shave once a day. Bravo.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I ordered the men&#x27;s original, and I love the scent! A very subtle citrus that suits me just fine. Not sure why they felt compelled to make a &amp;#34;lady&amp;#34; version. I love that it is in an all plastic bottle, so no rust in the shower. I have really sensitive skin and I have had no nicks, cuts, or irritation since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, it works. Use as directed</li>
            <li> Took a bit of getting used to but it is the real deal &amp; lives upp to the commercials</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff is the best.  No hype, works just as described.</li>
            <li> maybe it works better for some people but I would never buy it again, I&#x27;ve read the directions closely and for me it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> Lubricated the face sufficiently. Scent I would describe as a slightly sweet grapefruit or &amp;#34;grapefruit n cream&amp;#34; which was pleasant enough.</li>
            <li> I have been &#x27;wet shaving&#x27; for a couple of years now and I have experimented with a lot of different shave creams at varying price points.  I happened to see this online and thought &amp;#34;What the heck, why not?&amp;#34; so I ordered a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, it really does work well even though the generic labeling (which is fine) reminds me of the white cans in the 70&#x27;s that simply said &amp;#34;Beer&amp;#34;. No frills. However, it hasn&#x27;t changed my life and I didn&#x27;t hear clean-shaven angels singing from on-high when I first put it on my face. The purpose of shaving cream (as the directions state) is to do one thing and one thing only - LUBRICATE YOUR SKIN for the blade pass. That&#x27;s it. End of story. This does it very well without alcohol or stupid foam. I like it. Honestly, I have a personal preference for Neutrogena Shave Cream for men (it&#x27;s GREAT), however, it is also VERY runny and thin (which means it makes a mess and you tend to waste a lot). This particular product is very close to the Neutrogena product, except that it is MUCH thicker (like toothpase) and you can rub it in your hands and apply it without half of it running down your wrist or arm.  Well worth the money. You&#x27;ll get a great shave (well, at least from this cream) and I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use another shaving cream/gel. Closest, softest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. 1 tube has lasted a year so far and still more product to go (shave 3 times a week)</li>
            <li> This stuff is trash.  Filth.  Ignore the 5 star reviews praising the scent, it smells like rotting oranges, is overpowering, and lingers all day like a nasty hangover.  The water activated molecule nonsense on the bottle is a bunch of horse excrement.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t lather worth jack monkey squat, either by hand or with brush and bowl.  It&#x27;ll gunk up your razor as you shave and requires excessive rinsing.  That same oily gunkiness will stick to your brush and ruin its ability to make and keep a lather if you use it with the brush and bowl method repeatedly.  The shave left my skin feeling dry and tight around my face.  It was so bad, I actually returned it to the store to exchange for my usual shaving soap and not be out the $9 I spent on it.</li>
            <li> certainly a saucy cream</li>
            <li> Gave me the smoothest, closest shave I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
            <li> This shave cream takes a while to get used to. It does not foam up like conventional shave creams and you have to get your facial skin very warm and wet in order to make it work properly. Thus far I have used it three separate times and found it to give me an acceptable shaving experience though nothing to brag about and based on my experience up to this moment I do not plan to purchase it again once the tube has been used up!</li>
            <li> Cremo does give you a really nice and close shave. I rated it &#x27;OK&#x27; though because really, have you ever run out of shaving cream and used some conditioner instead?  The cheap 99 cent conditioner works just as well as Cremo does for my beard.  The smell of Cremo is not pleasing to me at all. This product is obviously geared towards men but it smells like some fruity-tooty funky bubble gum.  They seriously need to rethink the fragrance.  It works.  It gives you a smooth shave. But for that price?  I really think a cheap, creamy conditioner on your face would give you the same results.  It does for me, anyway.</li>
            <li> Not as Astonishing as I thought it would be. It was just ok.</li>
            <li> Heard Adam and Dr. Drew pitching this stuff on the podcast.  Decided to give it a try and love it.  Mahalo.</li>
            <li> I really cant tell a difference between this and the cheap Wal-Mart purchased creams.</li>
            <li> I usually use shave gels because most shave creams don&#x27;t give me enough lubrication for a smooth and comfortable shave. I couldn&#x27;t find either of the two gels that I used to use so gave this a try and very glad that I did. This stuff blows any gel or cream I&#x27;ve ever used away.</li>
            <li> I buy this as my only shaving cream. Once I used it I never looked back. I use it to shave my head and face and it gives me the closest shave , with minimal irritation by far. Follow the directions and mix it with water and it lasts forever. A must buy!</li>
            <li> I bought Cremo initially because of a rebate of the purchase price. I  had just  purchased  a Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver  after having used a Gillette Fusion razor  for a long time and decided to try some &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; shaving oils and creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been impressed by this shave cream for the following  reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It creates a  &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; shaving surface  as advertised and it  works equally well with a regular razor or a  wet electric shaver to produce a clean and comfortable shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  If after the initial shave, you find some skin areas that need more attention, just add a little water to the area and the slickness is renewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It is easily rinsed from a razor or an  electric shaver unlike some other shave creams, specifically American Crew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It is affordable. I bought my first tube at Meijer and have recently seen it  at  Walmart, both for under $7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was long time user of American Crew Shave cream when I could find it at less than the full retail price of about $16. I have now bid farewell to American Crew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cremo is a much better product!</li>
            <li> I tried this because of the strongly positive reviews and the moderate price point. After four days of use, I set it aside for several reasons: first, although it&#x27;s slick, it didn&#x27;t shave my beard any closer than other products in this price range; second, my skin felt tight and irritated after rinsing off; and third, I developed a patch of dermatitis on my chin--which quickly cleared up after I stopped using the product. It may work for you; didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kiehl&#x27;s &amp;#34;Close Shavers&amp;#34; Shaving Cream for about 15 years and was quite happy. I thought I was getting a great shave until I tried Cremo Cream. My brother suggested that I give Cremo Cream a try. Soon after using Cremo Cream, I received several unsolicited [favorable] comments having to with my face. Fast forward, on recent travel I was using the Kiehl&#x27;s Shaving Cream that was already packed in my dopp kit. I could not wait to get back to Cremo Cream. Used Cremo Cream today -- what a difference!</li>
            <li> I have a semi sensitive face but was optimistic.  I tried using a hit towel first then hot water. Every shave resulted in a cut. I concur with most othe posters on the 2 stars and less....save your $10, get something better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record I use both Gillette pro fusion and the Executive from dollar shave club. I&#x27;ve used $1 can of cream that worked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can, try using Dr. Cravers butter. It&#x27;s only $8 and I can run a rusty blade over my face with a great shave everytime.</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions!! If you just slap it on without water you are missing a great shave. I shave against the grain and always get a super shave. Great going guys.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. Advertised a lot on satellite radio, so I gave it try. It does work best if, as directed, you get your face and neck as hot as you can stand, but who has the time for that? It does provide a slick surface, but you do need to keep your face wet, I have a short beard that extends just below the jaw line, so most of my shaving is on the neck. My neck is no smoother afterwards than any other gel or traditional foam in a can. Unlike others, I found the smell pleasant. Would I buy it again? Maybe. Is it anything radically different as advertised? In my opinion, no.</li>
            <li> After turning my back to the heavily marketed disposable razors, aerosol creams and other shaving junk, I was actively seeking alternatives to meet my needs.  The standard aerosol gels generate a lot of foam/lather for one razor pass, but always left my face dry and the cans simply never stop oozing foam after the first use.  I tried CREAMO CREAM after hearing a radio add and decided to give it a try.  First impression was:  strange scent, but super slick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small dab of CREAMO with a sink or cup full of warm water is really all that is needed to provide a well-lubricated lather to accommodate multiple razor passes.  I found the key to this products success being the addition of a little water to each application of the cream.  Adding water to the cream is what generates the silky, slippery quality that allows your razor to glide effortlessly across your skin with having to apply pressure to your razor.  The only drawback to using this product was that it does create buildup on your razor that doesnâ€™t rinse away so easily and this can reduce the bladeâ€™s effectiveness over time.  The scent is rather unique and the only tangible aroma I can tie it to would be a hint of orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a brush to apply shaving soap and find CREMO to work just fine:  simply wet the brush, apply the dab of CREAMO CREAM to the brush and use your face as the mixing platform (dabbing your brush lightly in warm water every so often to generate more lather) â€¦ or you could use a mixing bowl (which I consider more of traditional tool than a necessity) â€¦ or use the palm of your hand as the mixing bowl (I used this method until I discovered the simple convenience of using my face to generate the lather).  The key is getting the water/cream ratio right â€¦ too little water &#x3D; dry/uncomfortable shave â€¦ to much water &#x3D; messy/uncomfortable shave.  Lightly dipping the edge of my brush into a sink of warm water allows me to add water in small increments to generate the lather I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I find CREAMO CREAM to be a quality product, itâ€™s not as widely marketed as other shave gels/creams and I can only buy it at one particular drug store in town.  The cost for a single tube seems high until you realize how many shaves a single tube will provide (with a pea-sized dollop for each shave) â€¦ itâ€™s definitely worth it.  The biggest drawback for me was the buildup on my razor, so I use CREMO as a back-up or add it to my shave soap when trying to shave several days of hair growth â€¦ itâ€™s the only product Iâ€™ve ever used that minimizes the uncomfortable tugging associated with shaving longer facial hair.er I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I find CREAMO CREAM to be a quality product, itâ€™s not as widely marketed as other shave gels/creams and I can only buy it at one particular drug store in town.

            <li> Good shave cream, but why not add a few pennies to the cost and use real essential oil and not the horrible synthetic scent?</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I was a little skeptical of the whole no nicks or red marks claim but it lives up to the hype. I use a Merkur DB safety razor with Feather blades and my face has never been happier than with Cremo. This is after having tried various other creams, gels, foams, multi-cartridge razors, and an electric razor. Of course, good razor etiquette is still important, but this stuff makes it that much easier to shave. Would highly recommend to anyone considering buying this stuff!</li>
            <li> used it a few times,  went back to using soap.  much easier.  so many positive reviews.  you may want to  give it a try.   it may work for you.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I&#x27;ll never use anything else!</li>
            <li> Pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;  I think Noxema shave cream is still the best I have used.</li>
            <li> Ok..so I got this for a gift.&lt;br /&gt;I never used a cream shave before, only the canned goop.&lt;br /&gt;You put an almond size dab in your hands,&lt;br /&gt;Rub into your wet face,&lt;br /&gt;You Will Not Get super foam ...&lt;br /&gt;It is not meant to put air bubbles on your face&lt;br /&gt;It puts a milky soapy film that smells good ...on your face&lt;br /&gt;It is meant to protect your skin from a razor blade...&lt;br /&gt;No burn..&lt;br /&gt;No rash...&lt;br /&gt;Good shave</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me or that I use this with an electric shaver, but I&#x27;ve managed to nick myself multiple times when using this, while it never happened in the year or two with my previous shave stuff (the real shaving co). I do like the lather that it gives, however. And it&#x27;s pretty darn slick and comfortable when I&#x27;m not nicking myself. I think it&#x27;s like a tradeoff between closeness (this stuff wins) and risk factor. Oh well, I like to live life dangerously.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t see a difference between this and most other gel shaving creams. For my face it did nothing special.</li>
            <li> I have both Cremo and Proraso in my shower. Cremo is a noticably better lubricant for shaving. I have tried both with new blades and old and with various water temperatures. I also find Proraso feels a little drying on the skin. My two cents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: If you want to pay five dollars more, Harry&#x27;s Foaming Shave Gel is better than both and is pressurized making it much easier to work with.  Just a button press and you tend to use less per shave. Comes in a plastic container with no metal parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Best yet - Gentleman&#x27;s Hangar Genuine Old School Natural Shaving Cream for Sensitive Skin sold here. No tube to squeeze nor button to push - it is in a flat jar. Good price and you can use it all.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great...lasts a long-time, and gives a nice, smooth rash free shave.  The only thing I am not ecstatic about is the smell.  It smells citrusy, which isn&#x27;t terrible or particularly bad, I would just prefer something a little &amp;#34;manlier&amp;#34; - but it isn&#x27;t a deal breaker as the smell is pretty mild anyway.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> My father introduced me to this. It only takes a little dab, about as much as you put toothpaste on your brush. Using this along with a Gillette Fusion Proglide I can shave up and down my neck IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS for the smoothest shaves with no red bumps that other razors gave me.</li>
            <li> My son is a teen bike racer, so he has to shave his face and his legs.  He had trouble shaving with breakouts, and on his legs got bad razor bumps and burn.  Cremo solved all problems. He is happy and shaving is not causing him pain anymore. We are buying a second tube today.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a lot of items on Amazon and written very few reviews.  This product came up as an add on when I purchased some razors, so I thought I would try it since it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive and I haven&#x27;t been satisfied with some of the mainstream big name shaving creams and gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that this is the best product (not just shave cream) that I have bought on Amazon.  It was a great &amp;#34;find&amp;#34; that I would never have learned about without Amazon.  The performance of the Cremo creme beats anything that I have tried (including the high end Clinique products).  Daily shaving really beats up my face and I end up with irritation, ingrown hairs, etc. despite using premium razors.  Cremo has eliminated this issue, I can shave every day without problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately purchased another tube for my dad, who&#x27;s been using the same product for 50 years.  he&#x27;s a convert now as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the citrus smell of the cream, as well.  I&#x27;m really happy to have found this great product.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff! Works just as well for me, too. He will use nothing else. That&#x27;s how good this works.</li>
            <li> I used a sample size of shave butter from the online shave club where I get my blades.  I was immediately hooked on the smooth shave I got.  When I was browsing the shaving cream selection at my pharmacy, I saw the Cremo and read the instruction on the back.  It seemed to be what I was looking for, so I bought it.  This stuff is amazing.  I followed the directions and was impressed that such a small amount can do so much.  Since I started using it about a month ago--along with my great blades, I have had no nicks, cuts, or scraps.  My face is very sensitive and dry, and since using the Cremo, I have enjoyed the way it leaves my face feeling smooth and moisturized.  I don&#x27;t rinse my face with water after I shave.  I just wipe my face with a towel and I&#x27;m ready to go.  There is plenty of cream in the tube and after a month of use everyday, I still have more than enough to last me a couple of months or more.  I hope you will try it after reading my post along with other user posts.</li>
            <li> I have been using Remington&#x27;s Shave Gel and the King of Shave&#x27;s equivalent for many years now. Recently I decides to try something new so I bought some KMF and also the Cremo Shave Cream. My personal experience is...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KMF &#x3D; Good&lt;br /&gt;Remington/KoS &#x3D; Better&lt;br /&gt;Cremo &#x3D; Best&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say though that all of these provide a quality shave. It is just that KMF is the most diluted of the three and does not create the same level of slickness as the others.</li>
            <li> One of the best shave creams I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> The best shave I&#x27;ve possibly ever had. My face breaks out after shaving so bad that I had given up shaving against the grain altogether. I bought this at a Walgreens because of a &amp;#34;free after rebate&amp;#34; offer and am about to buy for every guy in our family for Christmas. I will never buy regular shaving cream again.</li>
            <li> Best shave cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is garbage. Very thick and sticks to sink. It is like vaseline. Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Once you start using this product, you will never switch back to a can.  It makes even duller razors perform very well.  Takes some getting used to.  A pea sized amount really is all you need for your whole face.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream at very affordable price</li>
            <li> Use it daily, great shave product.</li>
            <li> This product is okay.  It is slick like it says because of its special &amp;#34;molecules&amp;#34; but for me, does not produce a closer shave.  If it reduces irritation for me it is only slightly.  The bad news for me (and good news for those who like this product) is that it really can go a long way.  It is the definition of a 3 star rating - I&#x27;m not going to throw the rest of the tube away because I hate it so much but I&#x27;m probably not going to buy another tube when it is gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably used 50 different kinds of shaving creams throughout my life, if not more. I settled on Cremo Cream a few years ago and it&#x27;s pretty amazing. I use a razor from the .99 cent store and I have a heavy werewolf beard. Even so, Cremo gives me the closest most comfortable shave ever...period. I also shave with a brush and cream (TOBS, etc.) on a pretty regular basis, but no product is as convenient or easy to shave with as Cremo.</li>
            <li> I am a 23 year old woman, and I absolutely love this product. Before this, I was using, IIRC, Skintimate brand shave cream (not a foam, their attempt at a cream). It was basically a glorified lotion branded for use in the shower, but even so, it was better than any other foaming products. Luckily for me, when I ran out of that stuff, the store I was at did not stock it, so I turned to the men&#x27;s shaving aisle and found Cremo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cremo Shave Cream has a light, pleasant scent, and goes on so, so smooth. I use it to shave my legs and armpits, and have used it in my bikini area before, but that&#x27;s an area I normally wax so I can&#x27;t speak much about it. To shave my legs, I use roughly an almond-size amount for each leg for the entire area from just above the knee on down, and that is plenty of product. I haven&#x27;t nicked myself once since using this, and the tiny dot I use for each armpit has effectively eliminated razor burn in that area as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also shaved my boyfriend&#x27;s face for him the other day, of course using Cremo, and although his facial hair was slightly longer than is best for shaving, it went great and his skin was very smooth after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t shave daily, I can say that my first tube has lasted me probably around five months now, and is still going strong, which is incredible. I&#x27;m so glad that this product is available with Prime, because the store I got my first tube at did not have it when I checked the other day, and I definitely plan to repurchase.</li>
            <li> Cremo Shave Cream is better than typical grade, but not much. Frankly, I was unimpressed and paid 3 times that of economy grade. (OKAY even that is not breaking the bank). I followed instructions carefully - use lots of water resulting in drips everywhere. I will admit - results were better using more than an &amp;#34;almond&amp;#34; size. If you&#x27;re looking for shaving cream with WOW factor I suggest &amp;#34;Jack Black - Triple Cushion&amp;#34; (it&#x27;s not cheap costing 9 times more than economy grade)</li>
            <li> I did not care for the fragrance when I first started using Cremo, but I have to say that after a week or two I actually quite enjoyed it.  I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year now and while I drift off to try other creams, I always seem to come back to this one.  You have to use so little that it seems it lasts forever too which makes it a great value.</li>
            <li> The best shave cream I&#x27;ve tried to date. Very slippery, a little goes a LONG way. I wish they had this item in a mentholated version. I use both straight razors and double edged (&amp;#34;safety&amp;#34;) razors and this cream works great with both. It really cuts down on the skin irritation--especially with the DE razor.</li>
            <li> Sucks and you can buy in walmart for cheaper. Get the Jack a Black Beard Lube and never look back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd tube and this stuff is slick. I just started using it with a safety razor and it works great.  Update 12/09/15: I&#x27;m 43 years old and I have a salt &amp; pepper beard. I now shave everyday, one pass with the grain, using a Parker 26C. I&#x27;ve switched between creams, gels, and soaps. This is by far the slickest and least irritating. I&#x27;ve given all my other gels and foams to my sons. The key is to have your face wet and to put the thinnest layer possible of this on.</li>
            <li> Works great with little water which is what everyone here in California needs. As I take very short showers now a days, this is the best shave crÃ¨me on the market.</li>
            <li> 3 great things about this stuff...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s readily available. I have seen this sold at my local drugstore, walmart, amazon, and even some of the fancier online shave shops that specialize in wet shaving accessories. It&#x27;s sold in many places which is convenient and everywhere I have seen it, its priced amazingly low compared to competitors products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Considering how cheap this stuff is, you&#x27;ll be amazed how well it works. I find that It makes a very airy lather. As soon as it makes contact with water bubbles just erupt out of it. Because of this I tend to use a generous amount, more than with other brands. However since it is so affordable I don&#x27;t really mind using a little extra. The lather is lighter and &amp;#34;fluffier&amp;#34; than other creams instead of the thick lather you might be used to with similar products, but I find the Cremo to be much slick or slippery than other brands so if you prefer lubrication over cushion, you will probably like this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The smell is fantastic. I have lots of different styles of creams, soaps, razors, aftershaves, balms etc...each have their own purpose. Because of the light refreshing citrus scent of this cream I usually use it in the summer months. On a hot summer day when I don&#x27;t want to spend too much time in a steamy bathroom wet shaving, I use Cremo. The scent is light and refreshing and it is very slick so I can get a quick quality shave with a DE safety razor without any skin irritation. Although, if your the type who only uses one cream all the time, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to keep anyone from using this cream anytime of year. It smells refreshing yet still masculine.</li>
            <li> I bought this when I first switched to a double edged razor and that was probably a mistake to switch two things at once.  I really didn&#x27;t like it at first and I blamed Cremo, switched to a badger brush and traditional soap, and worked my way through a sample set of blades.  After being pretty sure I liked feather blades the best of them all, I decided to give Cremo another try before throwing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow!  Now that I sort of know what I&#x27;m doing with the razor (Merkur Futur) this stuff is pretty great for me.  Way quicker and easier than a brush with soap and I can shave against grain on my upper lip on the second pass where it would rip things up even on a third pass with soap. I hope this continues and I will update my review if it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I bought Cremo Cream 6 oz at my local store for several reasons. My electric razor was giving out, and I didn&#x27;t want another because the newer ones look like high maintenance, low quality. I also didn&#x27;t want to use shaving cream because it gunks up the razor and doesn&#x27;t give a close shave because it doesn&#x27;t cling to the skin. So I picked Cremo Cream on a lark. I like it very much. It is extremely slick. Sticks to the skin. The razor glides very quickly. The directions are simple. Wet face with hot water. Apply a small dollop and massage onto skin. Shave. It couldn&#x27;t be simpler. And the razor cleans very quickly because the stuff is so slick. I highly recommend Cremo Cream.</li>
            <li> I am using this to shave my legs and it is a good shave cream.  I do wish it was more moisturizing</li>
            <li> Awesome product - you only use about an almond&#x27;s worth of product, and it doesn&#x27;t bubble a lot. I thought I needed to use more, but it was actually more than enough - extremely smooth shave and no irritation after 3 weeks or so of use! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> A good shaving cream that remains slick and provides a relatively smooth shave.  It does not lather well with a brush, but that&#x27;s not a huge issue for me personally.  As stated in the title, it can be found at stores like RiteAid, Duane Reade, etc. Not a bad choice overall.</li>
            <li> It shaves phenomenally close and smooth, and it only takes a tiny bit to do the job. With my thick whiskers, that&#x27;s a thumbnail-sized amount, meaning this product not only outperforms the store brands, but actually saves me money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;READ THE INSTRUCTIONS, though. It&#x27;s HEAT-ACTIVATED. That means use it right out of a hot shower, or else ONLY after hot moist towels have been applied. I can only imagine sub-5Star reviews being due to having ignored this. I simply cannot imagine another reason.</li>
            <li> My very finicky husband has used many shave products over the years, from very high-end creams all the way down to generic drugstore brands. After each disappointment, he comes back to this tried-and-true Cremo. No frills, reasonably-priced, and a small amount goes a long way---yet it performs admirably in the key categories: lubrication without excessive foaming, refreshing manly smell, suitable for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fancy shaving boutiques and designer stores are great for finding a pretty, unique, luxurious gift. But for daily shaving, keep your man&#x27;s shaving kit  stocked with the old standard Cremo!</li>
            <li> This worked great with my Mach 3 blades. I recently switched to using an old fashioned safety razor and this just doesn&#x27;t give enough protection. However, I still have seldom gotten as close a shave with my safety razor or straight edge as I did with my disposable and cremo. If I don&#x27;t get my technique down I might go back to using it.</li>
            <li> After years of trying to find a good shave cream that helps remove razor burn and not leave a rash, I bought this one for my son, who has a thick beard. It works like a charm, leaves his skin really soft and bump free. It is worth the price and the tube is easier to transport than those shave cream dispenser bottles. A little goes a long way as well...so it lasts a long time...totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> This is far and away the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s not even close.  Per instructions, I use an almond-sized, watered-down dollop for each shave.  Nicks and irritation are rare, and are usually just because I used an old blade.  I also get MUCH more mileage out of one container than they advertise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No-brainer.  Buy this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several months before reviewing to ensure I wasn&#x27;t just biased because its something new. This isn&#x27;t my favorite cream. It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as I&#x27;d hope and isn&#x27;t as lubricative as I&#x27;m looking for. I wont be using this again unless I am forced to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tossup between Cremo and Schick Hydro shave gel.  Both are great and work equally well with my Gillette Fusion razor. if you&#x27;re a senior with dry and thinning skin, finish it off with Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm.</li>
            <li> Bought a tube at Target on a whim and I&#x27;ll never go back to traditional shave cream/gel. Once you get the hang of it, this stuff is phenomenal. No more nicks, no more razor burn.</li>
            <li> Great price! Great product!</li>
            <li> Very nice to purchase an order that is made for my skin type at such a great price. Outstanding quickness in shipping and product packing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of things and I think I just found my favorite.  This stuff is fantastic!  Gave me a very close, smooth, comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I FIRST tried it, I probably expected slightly too much.  My beard is light and doesn&#x27;t stand up well, so I typically shave a second time against the grain to get a nice close shave.  Since the tube said that &amp;#34;most can comfortably shave against the grain&amp;#34;, I tried it that way right out of the gate.  THAT left me with some nicks!  I re-read the instructions and decided I&#x27;d misinterpreted them the first time and gotten a little over-ambitious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the next time, I shaved like normal...first with the grain, then quickly re-lathered and gave a second shave against the grain.  Perfecto!  No nicks, no discomfort and beautifully close and smooth.  The cream has a light, citrusy scent.  (It does also have a secondary scent that I don&#x27;t love.  I&#x27;m not sure what that ingredient is.  But it&#x27;s faint, and certainly doesn&#x27;t warrant dropping this to 4 stars.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I&#x27;m sold!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to a regular shave cream after using this product.  Product works exactly as promised (probably even better) when the directions on the tube are followed.  I use an almond-size squirt from the tube (and the tube will last you almost forever using this small of an amount), make sure face is warm and wet.  Creates very thin but slick lather.  This product is especially great for those with sensitive skin and acne (in my opinion) as I have both.  This product has helped with both.  Very enjoyable aroma, too.  In case nobody has noticed, the first tube is free with a mail-in rebate (up to $8.00, not including sales tax), but well-worth the price.  Tell all your friends.  At least most of you will never use another shave cream again.</li>
            <li> Works well. This is all I buy now</li>
            <li> This is ABSOLUTELY the best shave cream that I have ever used in my 70 years on this planet.  I don&#x27;t really feel the need to go into exhaustive details about a grooming product.  Either you trust me, or you don&#x27;t.  As far as I an concerned.  It is the BEST.  Period.</li>
            <li> Awesome! What else can I say. I bought this shaving cream because it was cheap. It was meant to be a short term solution until I got to the fancy shaving store to buy there highly expensive luxury shaving cream. I am glad I did! This is by far the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used. Yes, the BEST!!!! I have had this for 3 weeks now, and I have barely made a dent in the supply of one tube! And I shave every day. If you&#x27;re using the big name stuff still...STOP! Buy this...trust me...you&#x27;re reading this on the internet after all!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good shaving creme. Honestly, it&#x27;s no better then many of the brands I buy at the store. For the size and price, I won&#x27;t purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This is very slick and provides a close irritation free shave.  I feel no drag at all.  This product does not foam.  It has a fresh citrus scent which I like but some may not.  I have not yet used it long enough to determine if this 6 oz tube lasts longer than a normal 7 oz can of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for years and tried all kinds of shave creams. This one is spectacular. Because you rub the cream directly on the beard, it provides for a superior glide. There&#x27;s no foam to speak of, and that takes some getting used to, but the results are extraordinary. The smell is certainly not overwhelming as some reviews say, and I think the scent fades quickly, or at least blends with my aftershave.</li>
            <li> Creamo is unique.If you expect barber shop type hot lather,this cream is not for you. As advertised,a little dab goes a long way and needs plenty of warm water added as you are using it. I use it with my straight razors only as I can see through the cream on my face without nicking vital anatomy during the process. Keep you face well lubricated with creamo and use enough water to keep the blade slippery on your skin. Buy the 6 ounce tube,it&#x27;s cheaper by the ounce and will last 3 months and more with daily use if needed. Creamo works well with cartridge as well as safety razors.</li>
            <li> 6 Star  -  Best shave ever!  Good investment in your skin.</li>
            <li> this is awesome stuff all on its own but when combined with somersets shave oil (applied first) then followed by Creamo the results are impressive.&lt;br /&gt;it takes surprisingly little to achieve very good results since the shaving cream is so concentrated. forget the trendy overhyped scents that are overwhelmingly strong that mask rather than smell genuinely clean, if you want something that does a good job and is not that expensive this is a really nice choice</li>
            <li> Great product, but it does cause my razor to almost squeak across my face. Not a smooth glide all the time as promised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to get used to at first - you really don&#x27;t need a lot and a little water in your palm mixes with it to create a lather.  But once you get used to the size you need for your legs, etc it works great.  I have very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t break me out at all.  The smell is great but doesn&#x27;t linger so don&#x27;t worry if you aren&#x27;t a fan of pink lemonade - you won&#x27;t smell it after done rinsing.</li>
            <li> With Cremo, I only need a little and I get a fantastic shave.  It leaves my skin feeling great all day long.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, VERY FAST and reasonable shipping.</li>
            <li> This product works, but there are many better options. It isn&#x27;t particularly slick, and it clogs in the razor.  Kiss My Face is so much better.</li>
            <li> It works, I like it, I get a closer shave with Cremo than with gels or foams, and I will continue using it! Having said that, just don&#x27;t expect miracles. A lot depends on your face and beard. But if it works for me, with a heavy beard, it should work for everybody. The scent manifests itself on application and is sort of an orangy/citrusy aroma. But it fades as you finish up and rinse the Cremo off your face. It is much milder than the shave foam I was using (and is now in the trash). Give Cremo a try for a more comfortable, closer shave!</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my skin. Cleanest shave I&#x27;ve gotten in years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product in compilation with the Dollar Shave Club executive razors and it works great! However before you use read the instructions. You don&#x27;t need more than a dime sized amount of the cream and your face needs to be WET. I mean like soaking wet, it&#x27;s best to shave right out of the shower after allowing your face to soak for about 30 seconds in hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This is a great product for a great price and if you use it properly one tube can last you a long time. I would recommend for anyone to try at least one tube.</li>
            <li> completely simple and idiot proof; get your face wet with hot water, rub it in and shave.  Stuff was awesome and my razor glided so easily I had no problem shaving against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells good, easy to carry/travel and use....great value.  I am sticking with this!</li>
            <li> absolute garbage a bar of soap would do better. yes i followed directions, this is probably good for a man with soft baby hair</li>
            <li> Outstanding shave and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> foams up well, smooth shave and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I just bought my 2nd tube of Cremo Shave Cream and I will say this is truly a superior shave cream. Just follow the directions and you&#x27;ll get a very nice shave. I purchased my first tube late June 2014 and I still haven&#x27;t used the entire contents yet! (I shave about 5 days per week). It doesn&#x27;t make a thick foam but what it does is leaves a slick surface for your razor blade to glide over for a smooth shave. If the cream gets a bit dry, just dip your fingertips in hot water, rub them over your face and the cream gets slick again so you can keep shaving. A tube lasts so long because you use just a small amount which does a great job. This is a very good and cost effective product that deserves a place in your shaving kit. Try it and you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> First impression is a little goes a long way and I should get many months out of this tube. Very light or non scented and a very smooth cream shave that is non drying. I dropped a star just because there isnt anything remarkable about the product. I think for me altjhough not drying I need something a bit more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I just received Cremo Shave Cream today, and tonight was my first time using it. I am already impressed by how great this shaving cream is, if you can even call it that. The texture of this cream is like no other I have ever seen, and I&#x27;ve got a cabinet full of widely known brands of shaving cream. The directions instruct you to mix it with hot water at first, because the cream is so concentrated, so you don&#x27;t have to use but an almond sized amount of this miracle cream. After mixing it together with the hot water in my hands for about 30 seconds, I applied it on my face, and let me tell you, the consistency and feel of this cream is like no other! It is slippery, and not clunky at all, allowing for the best shave possible. After shaving and rinsing, I instantly recognized the lack of hair on my face. This creme made it all come off &amp; I can tell you I have never had a closer shave... EVER! I felt as though my skin was cleaner, and upon touching the area I just shaved noticed it felt instantly smoother than the rest of my skin. All together a great product! 5 STARS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from spray foam to expensive creams to shaving soap whisked with distillers water with a silvertip badger brush. Nothing has given me as nice a shave as Cremo. My only problem now is that my wife uses it, so we run out faster.</li>
            <li> Teflon for shaving - pretty amazing! No cuts, nicks or abrasions. Smooth as can be-blade or electric razor.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this, and it is very slick. You don&#x27;t lather it, just apply to a wet face and rub it on.  It is a nice cream. It is a little odd though using it over a lather able cream.</li>
            <li> I bought my Cremo locally.  I am a wet-shaver with several premium shave soaps and brushes, so I was happy to try another.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  Cremo is a decent cream that is much better than the glob of foam or gel from an aerosol can, but it does not stand up to soaps like Proraso, Woolfat or Taylor of Old Bond.  I have tried it both with fingers as directed and with a brush.  It does feel slick and the blade (Merkur) slides well enough; I have not nicked myself.  But the bottom line is that it leaves my face feeling more abused/abraded than with traditional soaps.  Not *quite* to the level of razor burn, but an uncomfortable, tight feeling like a slight sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep this tube and use it to save time on rushed mornings, but I won&#x27;t replace it when it&#x27;s gone.  If you&#x27;re considering it as an upgrade from an aerosol can, go for it; you&#x27;ll like it.  (Smell is very pleasant.)  But if you&#x27;re a shaving aficionado thinking of adding Cremo to your stable of premium soaps and creams, I&#x27;d skip it.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I used the Edge crap for years until Dollar Shave Club turned me on to Shave Butter. I was cancelling my DSC subscription so I went hunting for a comparable product and I must say this Cremo is astounding. Even my wife loved it. I&#x27;ll never go back to the foam junk.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell, other than that works as expected</li>
            <li> I use a DE razor. This cream is slick but will not lather and vanishes fast off your face. I would not recommend for DE shaving.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. No more hair pulling. Been shaving 35 yrs never had a better experience shaving while using Creamo. Btw smells great too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never tried cream from a tube before but this stuff is great.  Just squeeze a very small amount in your hand then add water and it whips into a nice lather.  Once applied to your face you can add a little more water and rub to create yet more lather.  If you choose you might even want to go the badger brush/shaving bowl route.  Cremo smells great and softens whiskers for a very pleasant shaving experience.  A 6 oz. tube will last a long, long time so give it a try.  You might just like it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two years now. I have found nothing better, or longer lasting. I shave everyday, and a tube will last over 9 months. I put a small dab on a wet brush and work up a lather. HAven&#x27;t had a cut or nick since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Cremo is so good I don&#x27;t want anyone else to buy it! I want it all! This stuff makes your face so slick that your nose just about slides off your face if you get careless with it.. There should be a warning on the tube that this product should be used by professionals only and not tried at home.&lt;br /&gt;Great shaving product.  It&#x27;s a shame you can&#x27;t eat it!  Hmmmmmmmmm......</li>
            <li> Great stuff, been using it for a few years now.  Very creamy, spreads very evenly on your face and you don&#x27;t need to use much so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I am waiting for my Mukur DE razor from Amazon and I can&#x27;t wait to throw away those lousy Gillette disposable razors that never give me a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Now, in my waiting for me DE razor, I used this Cremo with a disposable and got the very best shave ever!&lt;br /&gt;It really works as advertised and I am very please with it.&lt;br /&gt;When I soon throw away my disposables, I am also going to throw away my Barbersol shave cream that does nothing more than make a mess and works just a little better than plain soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give this productTen stars if I could, and by the way, I purchased it at my local Walgreen&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Read the top review - that&#x27;s basically what I&#x27;d like to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was BLOWN away at how smooth my face was during and after shaving. It felt sooo good to shave and afterwards to feel my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the instructions on the bottle to get the BEST experience - if you just slap it on and shave you&#x27;ll get good shave but not the best experience. Use the hot towel on your face and then apply the cream. Shaving will be like cutting through butter... slick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best shave cream I&#x27;ve ever used - well worth the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro - Price, High Quality product, Smells great, feels good during and after shave&lt;br /&gt;Con - none that I can think of...</li>
            <li> Husband says this is the best ever. This \\&quot;cream\\&quot; instead of a foam soap makes so much more sense for sensitive skin!   I love that I don&#x27;t have to deal with an aerosol can that leaves rust stains all over the bathroom! May seem expensive, but you only use a small amount so the tube lasted  him for months. The full title of this product is spot on!</li>
            <li> This works SO well.  Picked up randomly at Walgreens, but can&#x27;t live without it.  Thick facial hair is no match, and gives a clean quick shave.  Also seems to make blades last longer, which doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the package says, give it a try!</li>
            <li> Up front I should say that while I chose to give Cremo four stars (I like it) my wife would give it six stars (she loves-loves it).  Apparently Creamo gives me a much closer shave.  I thought she was just imagining a difference, so tested to see if she really could tell when I used Cremo or regular foam out of a can.  I&#x27;d shave with Creamo for a while, then throw in a day with regular old stuff.  She caught it every time. &amp;#34;You didn&#x27;t use Creamo, did you?&amp;#34;  (She&#x27;s since started using it with her lady&#x27;s razor.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The close shaves were a bit surprising because Creamo doesn&#x27;t give you a real thick lather.  The consistency is more like a coating of cold cream on your face.  But it makes the razor glide smoothly and I find it nicer to have less to rinse off the razor - and my face - when done shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently started using a shaving brush to apply it. (Very happy with the Perfecto Pure Badger Shaving Brush that currently costs about $12.)  Using my hands, I had as much Creamo on my palms as I did on my face.  Using the brush, I mix a small squirt of Creamo with a little warm water in a small bowl, then slap it on like the barbers of yore. I think it results on more cream on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the (slight) downside, I believe this works out to be more expensive than traditional canned creams.  I know Creamo claims the opposite, but I don&#x27;t think so. (No offense, Creamo.)  I use the amount the company advises and I&#x27;m pretty darned certain a can lasts longer.  Nevertheless, it&#x27;s worth it for the extra kisses from the wife.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to everyone.  Cremo Cream is one of the best shaving creams made, smells great, and makes the razor glide right over your skin without irritation.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my 15 year old grandson with oddly eclectric retro taste.  He loves it and uses it whenever he shaves and cleans up, I can&#x27;t swear how regular that is but it smells good, works as advertised and he seems happy.  That&#x27;s all I need from a Christmas present.</li>
            <li> The absolute best shaving cream there is. I have tried many; all have shortcomings. This one is THE shaving cream for straight edge shave fans. Get it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but EOS works better . I wouldn&#x27;t buy again .</li>
            <li> My husband has sensitive skin and this shave cream works great for him.</li>
            <li> Yo-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading all the hype - I had high expectations for this shaving cream - followed directions to the letter - disappointing shave even with Gillette Silver Blues - going to give to my bud with the lighter beard - maybe it will work better for him-eh!!</li>
            <li> This Cremo shave cream reminds me a little of the old style shaving cream that my grandfather use to shave with that you can no longer find.  Cremo is a white shave cream that has a slight pleasant scent that I can quite identify but it smells nice and isnâ€™t overpowering and fades after a bit.  The instructions say all you need is a small amount and that is true, a small almond sized amount was good enough to cover my face well but not as a thick lather that I would expect but more like a slick liquid on my face.  The more water you add during the shave the better.  So it is a bit of a different experience that what I have always been used to but since I shave while showering, this is fine because this gave me a very smooth close shave without irritated skin or cut skin.  My skin feels soft afterwards and the cream doesnâ€™t stick in the razor.  I have been using this only a few days so I will update my review with long term use and whether this really will last 90 days.  So far I am pleased with this as it seems like good stuff, especially if you follow the directions for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;You took the time to write a review about a shaving cream?&amp;#34; Yeah I did, because this stuff is AWESOME! I&#x27;ll admit, it took a couple of shaves to get used to the way this product lathers/works, but I will hands-down NEVER go back to another shaving cream. The citrus/bergamot smell is awesome, the lather (when used as directed) is terrific, and the shave is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Please do yourself a favor and drop the name-brand/household products and make this part of your morning routine. This 6oz tube is going to last me a good while as I use about the same amount of product as you&#x27;d put on a toothbrush. Whether for yourself, for a friend, your partner, or your hairy gym bud, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The first shaving cream I ever tried, and still the best!</li>
            <li> Does not work very well for me; the cream seems too liquid and tends to run down the shaver handle so making the grip slippery. Shaving too is not as smooth as I&#x27;d like, I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY shave creams.&lt;br /&gt;This one beats them all hands down. Even much more expensive \\&quot;premium\\&quot; brands found in high end department stores.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what is it about it that makes it so good, but it works. I&#x27;m a convert and will never buy any other.</li>
