            <li>I love this dryer.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years before they changed the brush a short time ago and the dryer and brush were awesome.</li>
            <li>I got it, and after one hilarious drying session, i gave it away to a friend with looser curls.</li>
            <li>It is a good price and it dries fast, Love it.</li>
            <li>My aunt has this same exact blow dryer and hers worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly without damaging the ends and the cool button feature is nice for those quick touch ups.  </li>
            <li>I experienced the same issue</li>
            <li>but it seems to sacrifice power for sound.</li>
            <li>I end up with fly away, dry looking hair,</li>
            <li>I had none of the fly away hair that looked dry and lifeless.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised about this product because I have several Gold N Hot dryers that are awesome.</li>
            <li>Drys quickly without burning and</li>
            <li>Preferred the old brush better than this one.</li>
            <li>I love the makeup of it, but my thick hair laughed at it.</li>
            <li>I mainly use the brush and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>Takes much longer to dry my hair and there aren&#x27;t any good attachments.</li>
            <li>I had nice gentle curls and some height and body to my hair, very similar to setting my hair in rollers and drying it that way.  </li>
            <li>I like the combs in the center and not on one sided liked they were 10 yrs.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot, which I like for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this Gold N Hot GH3202 1600 Watt Styler Dryer from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Not too hot.  </li>
            <li>This dryer has all the right attachments and the 3 heat settings make it very versatile.  </li>
            <li>Much lighter weight than similar brush blow dryers; therefore, better for travel.</li>
            <li>the Gold &#x27;N Got flat iron, but don&#x27;t use it as much because the hair dyer does most of the straightening as it dries.</li>
            <li>It makes it full and completely unmanagable.</li>
            <li>that gets flat very quickly.  </li>
            <li>however you have to be gentle.</li>
            <li>no matter how gentle I am, I always end up breaking it.</li>
            <li>It has detachable combs which also aide in help my hair get bone straight.</li>
            <li>When it works correctly, you can really get your hair straigt fast with the combs.</li>
            <li>I have VERY wavy, curly hair and this dryer</li>
            <li>- it also saves me sooo much time.</li>
            <li>I had purchased 2 other dryers from retail stores, but was not happy with the performance, this dryer is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that this is the case with this Gold n&#x27; Hot Styler, but I generally buy GnH styler every 2 years.</li>
            <li>I live in South Florida and the weather is nice enough for a blowout and it&#x27;s less than going to the hair salon every week.</li>
            <li>it makes it so easy to dry my hair because I can comb as if I&#x27;m using the actual comb or brush</li>
            <li>This dryer is much quieter than my last one</li>
            <li>I bought this hair dryer to replace one with comb &amp; brush attachments that I&#x27;ve had since the early seventies - the cord recently snapped near the unit.</li>
            <li>Used only once, so far.  </li>

            <li> I am hoping that the company goes back to the stiff brush before too long.....it is just sad that the company ruined a perfectly good product by changing the brush attachment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s size is more awkward for me to use in styling my hair</li>
            <li> The change in the brush has made it impossible for me to use this product any more.</li>
            <li> It was still less than purchasing from the local beauty supply.</li>
            <li> The combs are in the center; not like they were before 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> They are not strong enough for course kinky hair or any hair I would guess.</li>
            <li> I am not very good at blow drying my hair with a regular blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> It goes up and down everyday.  </li>
            <li> I was not very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer, because I could style as I dried my hair, and to my surprise, it did what it said it would do, style my hair.  </li>
            <li> If you have any type of kinky coily afro, steer clear of this bad boy.</li>
            <li> The brush is so weak it will not straighten my curley hair.</li>
            <li> Also the brush is weak....</li>
            <li> so weak</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this hair dryer.  </li>

            <li> I bought the product in March and while I was using it it stopped working. I immediately returned but and recieved a replacement immediately. However I did not rush to use the replacement dryer and when I did you use it I experienced the same issue but now I am outside of the return period. I am surprised about this product because I have several Gold N Hot dryers that are awesome.</li>
            <li> Much lighter weight than similar brush blow dryers; therefore, better for travel.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again. It is a good price and it dries fast, Love it.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace a blow dryer I had for 10 years that finally went out. it is different but effiecient and works well.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer to replace one with comb &amp; brush attachments that I&#x27;ve had since the early seventies - the cord recently snapped near the unit. I chose it also for the dual voltage.  It&#x27;s size is more awkward for me to use in styling my hair but I keep practicing.</li>
            <li> The price on this item was a moving target for weeks. It goes up and down everyday.  It was still less than purchasing from the local beauty supply. With Prime, it arrived at my door so I have no complaints. I can&#x27;t say that this is the case with this Gold n&#x27; Hot Styler, but I generally buy GnH styler every 2 years. I live in South Florida and the weather is nice enough for a blowout and it&#x27;s less than going to the hair salon every week.</li>
            <li> Great service.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> however you have to be gentle. I always use the wider tooth comb and no matter how gentle I am, I always end up breaking it. Luckily my local sallys store has replacements.</li>
            <li> The combs are in the center; not like they were before 10 years ago. I like the combs in the center and not on one sided liked they were 10 yrs.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my daughter&#x27;s hair. 2 of the 3 attachments broke and I haven&#x27;t use it even 5 times! They are not strong enough for course kinky hair or any hair I would guess.</li>
            <li> I mainly use the brush and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer.  Perfect replacement for my 10 year old dryer.  I had purchased 2 other dryers from retail stores, but was not happy with the performance, this dryer is perfect.  I have purchased three.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.  It gets really hot, which I like for my hair.  It has detachable combs which also aide in help my hair get bone straight.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Gold N Hot GH3202 1600 Watt Styler Dryer from Amazon. This styler/dryer was a very nice surprise for me.  I am not very good at blow drying my hair with a regular blow dryer.  I end up with fly away, dry looking hair, that gets flat very quickly.  I purchased this dryer, because I could style as I dried my hair, and to my surprise, it did what it said it would do, style my hair.  I had none of the fly away hair that looked dry and lifeless.  I had nice gentle curls and some height and body to my hair, very similar to setting my hair in rollers and drying it that way.  I didn&#x27;t think this was possible to do, all with one hand.  I am very pleased with the product, and would recommend it to anyone out there.  The option of two combs or a brush to style your hair, is also a great feature.</li>
            <li> Good dryer for those of us with stubborn, wavey hair that we don&#x27;t like!  This dryer has all the right attachments and the 3 heat settings make it very versatile.  Dries hair quickly without damaging the ends and the cool button feature is nice for those quick touch ups.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I saw it been used by someone on you tube that recommend it for Afro hair. Was very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My aunt has this same exact blow dryer and hers worked perfectly. I ordered this one because mine went out. Well, it over heats and shuts off until it cools off. My aunts never did that to me. When it works correctly, you can really get your hair straigt fast with the combs.</li>
            <li> The brush is so weak it will not straighten my curley hair. It makes it full and completely unmanagable. I have used this product for years before they changed the brush a short time ago and the dryer and brush were awesome. The change in the brush has made it impossible for me to use this product any more. I am hoping that the company goes back to the stiff brush before too long.....it is just sad that the company ruined a perfectly good product by changing the brush attachment.</li>
            <li> This dryer is much quieter than my last one but it seems to sacrifice power for sound. Takes much longer to dry my hair and there aren&#x27;t any good attachments.</li>
            <li> I like it makes straightening my hair easier.</li>
            <li> I like the dryer, working on liking the brush.  Used only once, so far.  Preferred the old brush better than this one.</li>
            <li> If you have any type of kinky coily afro, steer clear of this bad boy. I got it, and after one hilarious drying session, i gave it away to a friend with looser curls. I love the makeup of it, but my thick hair laughed at it.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this hair dryer.  I have VERY wavy, curly hair and this dryer just doesn&#x27;t have the power I need.  Also the brush is weak....so weak it won&#x27;t even make it through my hair.  Additionally, the unit had been opened before it reached me...it was a returned item from another retailer....I was not very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This dryer works well.  Adjustable heat settings are perfect.  Not too hot.  Lightweight and fits well in the hand.  Drys quickly without burning and the comb featire is perfect for drying hair straight with one hand.</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used. I have the Gold &#x27;N Got flat iron, but don&#x27;t use it as much because the hair dyer does most of the straightening as it dries. The way it&#x27;s made is perfect...it makes it so easy to dry my hair because I can comb as if I&#x27;m using the actual comb or brush - it also saves me sooo much time.</li>
