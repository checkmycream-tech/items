    <ol>
            <li>A AT BEST,</li>
            <li>product smells good and DOESN&#x27;T STAIN YOUR SKIN!!!!!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wonderful!!!</li>
            <li>Happy coloring!</li>
            <li>It was awesome at fisrt.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Now for the cons: Yes you probably will have to bleach your hair for the best results......</li>
            <li>Not at all impressed.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t quite look like the picture, but it was very beautiful.</li>
            <li>the best combo for me...</li>
            <li>Ones with dimethycone are best</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the best combo I found for me.</li>
            <li>From what everyone says about it I thought it would be awesome.</li>
            <li>lol!</li>
            <li>LOVE THE COLOR!!!</li>
            <li>That too came out brilliant, however after extended reapplication the dye stopped working.</li>
            <li>Really bright!  </li>
            <li>I loved it!</li>
            <li>good luck and happy coloring!!!!!!!!!!...</li>
            <li>Lol bummer.</li>
            <li>Still didn&#x27;t use, but I think the color look great</li>
            <li>and yes I know this isn&#x27;t great for your hair</li>
            <li>I was told that this product would be great for me.</li>
            <li>just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for but shipping was great</li>
            <li>product is great</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this on my extensions and it&#x27;s great on those too.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>It really is great.</li>
            <li>and i loved it but was nothing how the box said</li>
            <li>The color was a bit lighter than i wanted but gorgeous.</li>
            <li>They said my hair was in too good of condition.</li>
            <li>The color shows up brilliantly in her light brown hair, and she didn&#x27;t even use bleach to lighten it beforehand!</li>
            <li>So I loved the way this turned out.</li>
            <li>Which for some people is good, but for someone who changes their hair color quite a lot</li>
            <li>Just didn&#x27;t seem to take as good as I thought.</li>
            <li>You need to bleach the hair but even then I dont think it a good product/paint.</li>
            <li>Then after you rinse this dye out use a really good conditioner to help close the cuticle.</li>
            <li>Wish I could find a good permanent hair color in this shade.</li>
            <li>you want a good quality, lovely purple, Ion Brilliance Brights Purple is a great choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light brunette color, around a 7, which the instructions said was ideal for purple.</li>
            <li>My daughter is becoming irritated by the numbers of people who approach me to tell me how beautiful my purple hair is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>She is very pleased with the way it turned out.</li>
            <li>But I have used many of their colors with great results....</li>
            <li>Love this dye!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
            <li>Love the color!</li>
            <li>love the color!</li>
            <li>I love these colors!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>product was exactly what I ordered and in great condition!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had lots of experience with many brands, colors &amp; types of hair dyeing products!</li>
            <li>Hair dye does smell great and easy to apply but didn&#x27;t show up in my hair.</li>
            <li>Great purple and easy application.</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s what you get for buying cheap dye lol.</li>
            <li>Ion however is an AMAZING product.</li>
            <li>but the color is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my best friend, who wanted to dye her whole head of hair purple.</li>
            <li>Ok so I read a review on here that said her hair was not prelightened and it came out this gorgeous purple</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it smells really nice.</li>
            <li>I liked that it dyed evenly without splotching; I just wish it had lasted longer.  </li>
            <li>u can see more of the purple and in the sun you can notice it much more!</li>
            <li>Easy to wipe off surfaces, AND skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m much more satisfied with this, although it would be nice if it lasted longer.</li>
            <li>I first Tried Splat - which had a great color</li>
            <li>Also it has a great smell, the whole time!</li>
            <li>and it was very light.</li>
            <li>Love how my hair turned out.</li>
            <li>Stunning.</li>
            <li>Believe the reviews when they say to buy more than you need.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Plus, both the purple and fuchsia fade into a pretty color, which is always nice!</li>
            <li>Purple is one of my favorite colors...</li>
            <li>is much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dyed my hair many times, but never used this brand before and never will again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a lot more permanent and brighter than it was.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m neither pleased nor displeased.</li>
            <li>This was just a lighter, more pinky purple.</li>
            <li>My hair just all around looks a more even color and darker with a purple tint.</li>
            <li>Ok, soooo...</li>
            <li>She added more purple, let it sit longer, and it did not make a difference</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>This purple held for sure.</li>
            <li>I may mix more or use a bottle instead of a brush.</li>
            <li>Ok bye.</li>
            <li>Ok bye...</li>
            <li>For best results you will need to pre-lighten or bleach out your hair, especially for the more pastel/lighter colors.</li>
            <li>I added a couple tablespoons of water to make it a more yogurt-like consistency.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Like most semi-permanent dyes, this stuff can get all over the place.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will post more pictures as time</li>
            <li>I LOVE this color.</li>
            <li>but most times I mix it with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The mix of the two give me an awesome, deep purple.</li>
            <li>Gotta love humans. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>I like manic panics consistency better.</li>
            <li>Left it on my son&#x27;s hair for 3.5 hours and it came out great!</li>
            <li>more dark.&lt;br</li>
            <li>sky blue (my favorite and the one that turned out the best)........</li>
            <li>(or else I may end up bald!!!:).......</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it will fade into a more purple color.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll have to try again to get better results.</li>
            <li>I ordered 3 more tubes and decided I was going to give it another go...</li>
            <li>I just love this brand and always recommend them .  </li>
            <li>you must prelighten and make sure its light!</li>
            <li>and I could have done better with another box or two</li>
            <li>Like with most dyes, keep a damp paper towel with dish soap on it nearby to easily wipe dye off skin to prevent unwanted dying.</li>
            <li>I love the color, and it&#x27;s easy to apply with a coloring brush and bowl</li>
            <li>This would probably be the perfect contrast with some whose hair is naturally blonde or light brown</li>
            <li>I read how light your hair needs to be for the dye to look like a nice purple and if your hairs too light it won&#x27;t take etc etc.</li>
            <li>Ion does leave the best shine of most of the other vegetable or protein dyes.</li>
            <li>the color is very cool</li>
            <li>I had a bunch left over) and it has incredibly reduced the amount of color bleeding.</li>
            <li>PROCESSED THE ENTIRE 40 minutes, &amp; let&#x27;s just say, I was pretty MIFFED to discover that whilst my AWESOME 1/3SKY BLUE section was indeed, AWESOME!!</li>
            <li>color turned out exactly how I wanted, and I am very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>and it comes with a mini bleach kit (if your product requires bleach to work, you should probably include it with your product or say so very boldly on the packaging)</li>
            <li>I really liked the depth of the violet color at first.  </li>
            <li>It looks fine, but I haven&#x27;t use it yet.</li>
            <li>: I really like the consistency of the dye, it was really easy to apply, and it smells nice.  </li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 ⭐ until I&#x27;m able to see the full outcome of the dye, once I lighten my hair &amp; can spend more time &amp; effort on it!!</li>
            <li>(time 2)--they both came out vibrant hot pinks with the magenta more bright and the fuschia</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thicker dye, so it doesn&#x27;t drip much and it coats your hair nicely.</li>
            <li>but I knew Ion was cheaper and readily available at Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Your hair needs to be platinum or as light as you can get it WITHOUT DAMAGING your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you get this on the floors or sink you can use Scrub Free Bathroom Cleaner with Oxy-clean.</li>
            <li>AS LIGHT AS YOU CAN GO.</li>
            <li>But I got my hair as light as I could anyways.</li>
            <li>I use sulfate free shampoo and try to keep my showers lukewarm (to my dismay).</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy and don&#x27;t see the need to try anything else--yet.</li>
            <li>I have light brown hair</li>
            <li>(light purple)</li>
            <li>prefer the Splat Lusty Lavender because it dyes over natural hair color to create a gorgeous purple tint</li>
            <li>But I have gone temporary purple before with another (discontinued) product and it had the amazing effect of turning my hair “black” then showing purple in bright lights.</li>
            <li>It kept its original color for 2+ weeks and then faded gradually to fuschia after 6-8 washes (on bleached hair).</li>
            <li>originally writing this review</li>
            <li>Okay, so I admit that I am a first time dyer.</li>
            <li>sure theyr are pretty purple.  </li>
            <li>I was excited.  </li>
            <li>bleached bangs dyed well, but they were bleached 3 times to get them light enough for it to look good</li>
            <li>think I&#x27;ll stick with special effects for now.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful dark violet color with 2 boxes of dye and bleached hair....</li>
            <li>out!!!!!I&#x27;d say the pros are: Lots of cool colors to choose from.....</li>
            <li>I have been using Special Effects, but I was In a pinch and needed something quick.  </li>
            <li>and this is the most vibrant my hair has ever been.</li>
            <li>Of course it&#x27;s going to fade quickly, all brights do.</li>
            <li>but the drawback is that it FADES QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>I received my product quick (3days</li>
            <li>so I could only really see the purple in the light (unlike Splat&#x27;s where it was just bright).</li>
            <li>It could be really great as is if your wanting a more subtle look, but if (like me)</li>
            <li>Completely gone within a week even though i washed with color safe shampoo and conditioner and cool water.</li>
            <li>I recently did fuchsia and get so many compliments!</li>
            <li>First rinse!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what I got!</li>
            <li>I shampooed 2-4 days/week, so I was THRILLED TO STILL HAVE SO MUCH BLUENESS after NEARLY 6!</li>
            <li>SOOOOO, same day as bleach, applied purple, freely, EXACTLY ACCORDING 2 DIRECTIONS!!!!</li>
            <li>It was simple to apply and a very good price, especially for the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Then I rinsed it in hot water instead of cool.</li>
            <li>Wanted to have purple hair for fun.</li>
            <li>EVERY FIBER of my being, LOVE, AM SATISFIED WITH, ENJOY, REVEL IN my EPIC \\&quot;BLUEness\\&quot; and otherwise am FOREVER A DEVOTEE OF ION, C.B. BRITES(SKY BLUE)!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;We used 2 complete tubes of the Purple Dye, most of the developer (4 oz)</li>
            <li>complete tubes of the Purple Dye, most of the developer (4 oz)</li>
            <li>Use this on freshly shampoo-ed, but not conditioned hair~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So i imagine the lavender and light pink-ish color will be more red and or orange.</li>
            <li>I tried the lavendar (fades prettu quick), the red was vibrant, the blue fades to a teal, the purple was awesome.  </li>
            <li>but ti&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>But for the price, 4.49$ a box at Sally&#x27;s, it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>and it did get lighter and more noticeable, but it also had spots where it came out completely</li>
            <li>Plus, when mixing the two, it give my/your hair much more color depth as some strands of hair will pick up more of one dye than the other.</li>
            <li>Right now I am trying the darker purple.....</li>
            <li>Its litterally on my hair right now.............</li>
            <li>Right now doing the purple on 75% of my head on shoulder length hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of money and this was pretty cheap with decent reviews.</li>
            <li>There are some parts that are darker in my hair where i used the Azure, so it looks greenish, other than that, where my hair is light enough it looks great.</li>
            <li>The rest of my hair has a slight purple-y tint that is gorgeous in sunlight.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re curious - the \\&quot;we\\&quot; in this adventure - was mostly my husband - who works in a metals fabrication shop!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re curious - the \\&quot;we\\&quot; in this adventure - was mostly my husband - who works in a metals fabrication shop!</li>
            <li>The red and purple fade kind of fast, but the blues last forever (not as bright as when you first dye it, but as a very faded patchy light blue).</li>
            <li>I started using them right when they launched with only 4 colours, so I am not sure if they have changed their product since it launched, but it is always great when I use it!</li>
            <li>it was a little too bright for me.</li>
            <li>(it was closer to the shade I wanted), I lightened my hair first and then applied the dye.</li>
            <li>Pretty color but the thicker formula makes it harder to color your own hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It turned out exactly as I hoped.  </li>
            <li>I left the dye on for about an hour to make sure it took.  </li>
            <li>I had two people helping me to make sure everything was covered and then left it in for over 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>When I rinsed it out that&#x27;s exactly what happened, it all rinsed out.</li>
            <li>I even let the color set an extra 10 minutes; just to be sure it had time to take.</li>
            <li>The picture of this color shows exactly what it will look like.</li>
            <li>It fades pretty fast, but i would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>I did a claryifying treatment first</li>
            <li>I think I could&#x27;ve used more color so next time</li>
            <li>Within a week it went from a gorgeous deep violet to a pastel purple just from regular showers and color safe shampoo (barely using any to conserve the color).</li>
            <li>Then my first wash almost all of it came off 99% of my hair and now my hair looks brown.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I did it by myself, at home.</li>
            <li>The faded color is actually pretty</li>
            <li>I nevet buy anything anymore without checking out reviews on the product first ,if I can........</li>
            <li>I always left the color on for 2 hours with a shower cap over it to create some heat to help thecolor develop better.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive...</li>
            <li>the first 4 pictures are purple to fuchsia ombre</li>
            <li>LOVE this color, trying some blues next, looking forward to those results.</li>
            <li>Lightening fast shipping and never got the colors messed up EVER!</li>
            <li>This was the first purple I used in my journey to purple hair.</li>
            <li>Other then that I love the product!</li>
            <li>Its the first product I&#x27;ve seen do that</li>
            <li>I am always up for a pretty shade of purple, so when I saw the ION brights purple</li>
            <li>you want a more dramatic look deffinetly make sure you lighten first!!</li>
            <li>In early May I had a stylist bleach about a 4\\&quot; dip on the bottom and dye it bright pink</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t bright to begin with, showing up as a rather dark purple and it got washed out with only a couple of shampoo-ings (even using special color shampoo and conditioner from Garnier).</li>
            <li>It also seemed to fade pretty fast.</li>
            <li>So if you have think or long hair, be prepared to buy more than one tube.</li>
            <li>so figured it wouldn&#x27;t really Pop unless I lighten first.</li>
            <li>After removing the foil I used an old school bonnet style hair dryer for 30 min., then cool rinsed, followed by the Ion Color Brilliance</li>
            <li>It kind of just looked black, then faded away after a couple washes, never turning purple.  </li>
            <li>I had dyed my hair previously with the Fuschia shade, while it was a nice shade</li>
            <li>I tried this as an alternative to Manic Panic, but the color didn&#x27;t even last a full two weeks on freshly bleached hair.</li>
            <li>Other products smell OK at first or have a hint of a fruit smell mixed with the strong chemical smell, but this is nothing like the norm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so upset with the results because I was so excited to finally dye my hair purple in the first place.</li>
            <li>I used magenta a couple months ago and it was very vibrant however for whatever reason it didn&#x27;t take to my roots very well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to be too vibrant since the first time I used it I didn&#x27;t lighten my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was previously pink from splat use so should be fine right</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it didn&#x27;t really dye my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to die the underside of my hair purple, and a lot of people said that this was the brightest.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like how fast the color disappeared from my hair</li>
            <li>and I used almost two whole tubes, the aqua and teal</li>
            <li>and then it didn&#x27;t even work, thanks.</li>
            <li>Very upset.</li>
            <li>Giving my hair a whole week of oil treatment.</li>
            <li>but it bled so much by the end of the week</li>
            <li>REALLY FREAKING</li>
            <li>So for now I can&#x27;t say how fast it will fade</li>
            <li>It works really well, so dose acetone nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really irritated.</li>
            <li>Even when diluting it with conditioner, it is still very chunky.</li>
            <li>If your hair isn&#x27;t blonde it doesn&#x27;t show at all not even a tint on light brown hair</li>
            <li>I have really been slathering it on half-hazzardly</li>
            <li>so I didnt wait for it to turn light yellow......</li>
            <li>For the price there wasn&#x27;t much and the color really didn&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li>Really really dislike this brand of purple.</li>
            <li>has kept it&#x27;s color very well.</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t really stain skin (because it doesn&#x27;t really work)&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>It faded much quicker than I would have hoped.  </li>
            <li>I decided after sometime to apply it straight out of the tube and go darker.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t take much to my confusion.</li>
            <li>When I washed it out it looked more like a blue-purple than an actual purple, but to my horror I found that nearly 50% of my hair wasn&#x27;t purple.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually had people, more than just a few, honestly ask me if my purple hair is natural.</li>
            <li>Other shades of magenta/purple have shown up fine, but this color did nothing!</li>
            <li>I bleached my hair a pale blonew and diluted the product with conditioner until it was a nice lavender.</li>
            <li>It is really a vibrant color and a fantastic deep shade of purple.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t til I tried to dye my hard a dark burgundy(Loreal) to even out the tones that somehow my hair became a wonderful purple color.</li>
            <li>, my hair seems to be none the less healthy and the color is very vibrant.</li>
            <li>There was no bold bright or deep purple for this product unlike the color swatch.</li>
            <li>Finally, to keep the color going, use some Ion semi bright in your shampoo and conditioner...equal parts or less.</li>
            <li>so imagine that at most this is lasting 10 washings before being pretty faded, which for me is a light pink with the bleached yellow showing through.</li>
            <li>To my surprise - amazing purple color over my naturally unbleached medium dark brown hair!</li>
            <li>The color was gorgeous when it was first dyed, but since it faded so quickly I&#x27;m quite unhappy.</li>
            <li>I have used other purple before, like Manic Panic and got a good deep purple over my natural hair color.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair and applied the dye to the top half of my head where all the highlights were.</li>
            <li>She previously tried the Manic Panic hair dye, and she finds that this one shows up better and lasts longer.</li>
            <li>I bought Ion Color Brilliance mainly because I was at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and didn&#x27;t feel like paying $12 for a teensy thing of manic panic.</li>
            <li>I got the purple and it is so vibrant.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions, used over light natural red hair.  </li>
            <li>I will keep using Ion colors mainly because of how well the color has held up.</li>
            <li>Love the color but it only lasted till the next wash.</li>
            <li>Turned out more of a dark blue/purple than just dark purple but still very pretty and color is holding fast!</li>
            <li>Fun colored hair is in right now, and this is an affordable option other than the salon.</li>
            <li>I had a light pink color.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re ready to rinse, run your hair under water until the water runs rather clear.</li>
            <li>Top part was my natural dark brown with silver.</li>
            <li>And on top of that it was uneven.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure about the fading, but it actually took to my hair surprising well.</li>
            <li>I would normally use Pravana</li>
            <li>Bit of a tip, dilute it a bit with water to get full coverage if your hair is long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li>A few weeks ago I had colored my hair with Garnier Nutrisse in Black Cherry and loved the color for about 2 days till it faded to a light brownish red.</li>
            <li>After-Color Sealer 20 oz.]]another cool rinse, and blow dry.</li>
            <li>The color took very well and gave me a delicate pale purple that i loved!</li>
            <li>My hair stylist touched up my roots and the new bleached spots did not take the color well.  </li>
            <li>so I drove an hour to pick out a manic panic product since these types of coordinating sold where I live.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so vibrant and so far</li>
            <li>You can see a very, very slight tint in a certain light, or maybe I&#x27;m just seeing things.</li>
            <li>one tube doesnt go very far...</li>
            <li>All my previous purple, looked fine.  </li>
            <li>so use to using Manic Panic and it giving me even vivid tones</li>
            <li>for the first wash, then 4 days later 90% of the product washed out.</li>
            <li>So as far as I am concerned you must have lighter then a level 6 for this to even show up!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t bleach my hair first and it only took to the previously bleached area even though i had light brown roots.</li>
            <li>I waited a little over an hour before I washed it out and still had hope it be fine after it</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair, the day before I heavily chunked my hair with level 9 highlights, then the following day applied the product, i needed 2 tubes, I allowed to process for an hour and 15 minutes,the results were great</li>
            <li>, the lack of mess, the \\&quot;relative\\&quot; ease, the stunning results - this is the only \\&quot;alternative\\&quot; hair color I will ever buy.</li>
            <li>, the lack of mess, the \\&quot;relative\\&quot; ease, the stunning results - this is the only \\&quot;alternative\\&quot; hair color I will ever buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very vibrant violet hue, which sometimes can take on different tones, depending on the lighting.</li>
            <li>But that may be because I WANTED my hair to be very dark and then purple when the light hits it.</li>
            <li>I am a natural redhead.</li>
            <li>The blonde is a deep purple that will fade to a bright purple in the next few weeks.</li>
            <li>My hair is really soft now but again, not at all purple.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair nearly every shower -</li>
            <li>B004AGJTLQ Ion Crystal Clarifying Treatment]], and thinned out the dye with the Ion Sensitive Scalp Developer (10)[[ASIN:B005NISMF4</li>
            <li>Ion Sensitive Scalp 10 Volume Creme Developer 32 oz.]</li>
            <li>So this is about as far out of his \\&quot;normal\\&quot; zone as you can get.</li>
            <li>So this is about as far out of his \\&quot;normal\\&quot; zone as you can get.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Didn&#x27;t dye my natural hair at all, no \\&quot;tint\\&quot; as it claimed it would do&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To be fair - I have difficult hair to dye.</li>
            <li>: Is very dark at first, then fades too fast, leaving splotchy bleached purply hair.</li>
            <li>With the last color I had, it looked normal in dim indoor lighting but purple in sunlight.</li>
            <li>When I went they only had one box of this particular purple and the girl who worked there</li>
            <li>Came as a thick paste that goes straight into your hair, which is convenient and low-mess; however, it makes it more tedious to apply than the more liquid types of dyes.</li>
            <li>Not my first time dying hair purple or other colors and my hair is naturally brunette.</li>
            <li>Later that same day I realized that blonde is Not the right color for my personality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, the new roots still had a ting of yellow in them.  </li>
            <li>Varying shades of deep purples that absolutely pop in different lighting and with movement.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a side note, if you plan on using the pastel colors, you really do need your hair to be platinum blonde unless you can tone it white.</li>
            <li>the rest is pretty much a dark brown which is my natural hair color.</li>
            <li>I think with the thick consistency it is easy to miss spots.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not drippy  and super messy......</li>
            <li>ACTUALLY, AFTER SAID reBleach, a pretty deep shade O&#x27; BLUE REMAINED!!!!!</li>
            <li>my hair is back to close to its original color but a little darker.  </li>
            <li>My natural red picked up almost no dye.</li>
            <li>I was supposed to be a natural blonde, but turned out orange.</li>
            <li>my hair, then attempted 2 add some EPIC PURPLE AWESOMEness 2 my 1/3sky BLUE HAIR!!!!</li>
            <li>THE 2/3 that was meant 2 BE AN EQUALLY EPIC SHADE, (as the blue side)was, well...</li>
            <li>dark brown natrual hair, is to use a permanent dye first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle in dim light but really stands out against dark hair in the sun.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s just been a mess, if you want fun colors I would use a different brand..</li>
            <li>I have very short spiky hair (less than two inches long) and I really had to work to get this tube to stretch to my whole head.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t overwhelming, or eye burning, you don&#x27;t have to open a window, or fear you just killed half of your brain cells</li>
            <li>I used the color lavender and it only turned certain parts of my hair purple and other parts green/brown.</li>
            <li>so I usually use Loreal Quick Blue (from Sally&#x27;s) with 30 vol or 40 vol creme developer.</li>
            <li>I only wanted to change the blonde and not my natural red, I didn&#x27;t follow the directions.</li>
            <li>Literally only noticeable when sun is hitting it, and barely.</li>
            <li>tried the vitamin c method multiple times and giving my hair bleach baths and after 30 minutes you can barely see a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The purple is kinda dull and fades quickly.</li>
            <li>The dye is super thick, but it gets the job done well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that, decent results though I had to cover mine up with another brand as well to cover all of my hair because I didn&#x27;t have enough.</li>
            <li>First time, I bleached to a few shades above platinum blonde and is already showing through.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands of purple - Manic Panic and Splat - and they both washed out or faded to hot pink after only 2 washes.</li>

            <li> Happy coloring!</li>
            <li> It was awesome at fisrt.</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> Now for the cons: Yes you probably will have to bleach your hair for the best results......</li>
            <li> Not at all impressed.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t quite look like the picture, but it was very beautiful.</li>
            <li> the best combo for me...</li>
            <li> Ones with dimethycone are best</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the best combo I found for me.</li>
            <li> From what everyone says about it I thought it would be awesome.</li>
            <li> lol!</li>
            <li> LOVE THE COLOR!!!</li>
            <li> That too came out brilliant, however after extended reapplication the dye stopped working.</li>
            <li> Really bright!  </li>
            <li> I loved it!</li>
            <li> good luck and happy coloring!!!!!!!!!!...</li>
            <li> Lol bummer.</li>
            <li> Still didn&#x27;t use, but I think the color look great</li>
            <li> and yes I know this isn&#x27;t great for your hair</li>
            <li> I was told that this product would be great for me.</li>
            <li> just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for but shipping was great</li>
            <li> product is great</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this on my extensions and it&#x27;s great on those too.</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> It really is great.</li>
            <li> and i loved it but was nothing how the box said</li>
            <li> The color was a bit lighter than i wanted but gorgeous.</li>
            <li> They said my hair was in too good of condition.</li>
            <li> The color shows up brilliantly in her light brown hair, and she didn&#x27;t even use bleach to lighten it beforehand!</li>
            <li> So I loved the way this turned out.</li>
            <li> Which for some people is good, but for someone who changes their hair color quite a lot</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t seem to take as good as I thought.</li>
            <li> You need to bleach the hair but even then I dont think it a good product/paint.</li>
            <li> Then after you rinse this dye out use a really good conditioner to help close the cuticle.</li>
            <li> Wish I could find a good permanent hair color in this shade.</li>
            <li> you want a good quality, lovely purple, Ion Brilliance Brights Purple is a great choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light brunette color, around a 7, which the instructions said was ideal for purple.</li>
            <li> My daughter is becoming irritated by the numbers of people who approach me to tell me how beautiful my purple hair is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> She is very pleased with the way it turned out.</li>
            <li> But I have used many of their colors with great results....</li>
            <li> Love this dye!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
            <li> Love the color!</li>
            <li> love the color!</li>
            <li> I love these colors!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> product was exactly what I ordered and in great condition!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had lots of experience with many brands, colors &amp; types of hair dyeing products!</li>
            <li> Hair dye does smell great and easy to apply but didn&#x27;t show up in my hair.</li>
            <li> Great purple and easy application.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s what you get for buying cheap dye lol.</li>
            <li> Ion however is an AMAZING product.</li>
            <li> but the color is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my best friend, who wanted to dye her whole head of hair purple.</li>
            <li> Ok so I read a review on here that said her hair was not prelightened and it came out this gorgeous purple</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it smells really nice.</li>
            <li> I liked that it dyed evenly without splotching; I just wish it had lasted longer.  </li>
            <li> u can see more of the purple and in the sun you can notice it much more!</li>
            <li> Easy to wipe off surfaces, AND skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m much more satisfied with this, although it would be nice if it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I first Tried Splat - which had a great color</li>
            <li> Also it has a great smell, the whole time!</li>
            <li> and it was very light.</li>
            <li> Love how my hair turned out.</li>
            <li> Stunning.</li>
            <li> Believe the reviews when they say to buy more than you need.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Plus, both the purple and fuchsia fade into a pretty color, which is always nice!</li>
            <li> Purple is one of my favorite colors...</li>
            <li> is much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dyed my hair many times, but never used this brand before and never will again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a lot more permanent and brighter than it was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m neither pleased nor displeased.</li>
            <li> This was just a lighter, more pinky purple.</li>
            <li> My hair just all around looks a more even color and darker with a purple tint.</li>
            <li> Ok, soooo...</li>
            <li> She added more purple, let it sit longer, and it did not make a difference</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> This purple held for sure.</li>
            <li> I may mix more or use a bottle instead of a brush.</li>
            <li> Ok bye.</li>
            <li> Ok bye...</li>
            <li> For best results you will need to pre-lighten or bleach out your hair, especially for the more pastel/lighter colors.</li>
            <li> I added a couple tablespoons of water to make it a more yogurt-like consistency.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Like most semi-permanent dyes, this stuff can get all over the place.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will post more pictures as time</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color.</li>
            <li> but most times I mix it with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The mix of the two give me an awesome, deep purple.</li>
            <li> Gotta love humans. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I like manic panics consistency better.</li>
            <li> Left it on my son&#x27;s hair for 3.5 hours and it came out great!</li>
            <li> more dark.&lt;br</li>
            <li> sky blue (my favorite and the one that turned out the best)........</li>
            <li> (or else I may end up bald!!!:).......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it will fade into a more purple color.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll have to try again to get better results.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 more tubes and decided I was going to give it another go...</li>
            <li> I just love this brand and always recommend them .  </li>
            <li> you must prelighten and make sure its light!</li>
            <li> and I could have done better with another box or two</li>
            <li> Like with most dyes, keep a damp paper towel with dish soap on it nearby to easily wipe dye off skin to prevent unwanted dying.</li>
            <li> I love the color, and it&#x27;s easy to apply with a coloring brush and bowl</li>
            <li> This would probably be the perfect contrast with some whose hair is naturally blonde or light brown</li>
            <li> I read how light your hair needs to be for the dye to look like a nice purple and if your hairs too light it won&#x27;t take etc etc.</li>
            <li> Ion does leave the best shine of most of the other vegetable or protein dyes.</li>
            <li> the color is very cool</li>
            <li> I had a bunch left over) and it has incredibly reduced the amount of color bleeding.</li>
            <li> PROCESSED THE ENTIRE 40 minutes, &amp; let&#x27;s just say, I was pretty MIFFED to discover that whilst my AWESOME 1/3SKY BLUE section was indeed, AWESOME!!</li>
            <li> color turned out exactly how I wanted, and I am very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> and it comes with a mini bleach kit (if your product requires bleach to work, you should probably include it with your product or say so very boldly on the packaging)</li>
            <li> I really liked the depth of the violet color at first.  </li>
            <li> It looks fine, but I haven&#x27;t use it yet.</li>
            <li> : I really like the consistency of the dye, it was really easy to apply, and it smells nice.  </li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 ⭐ until I&#x27;m able to see the full outcome of the dye, once I lighten my hair &amp; can spend more time &amp; effort on it!!</li>
            <li> (time 2)--they both came out vibrant hot pinks with the magenta more bright and the fuschia</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thicker dye, so it doesn&#x27;t drip much and it coats your hair nicely.</li>
            <li> but I knew Ion was cheaper and readily available at Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Your hair needs to be platinum or as light as you can get it WITHOUT DAMAGING your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you get this on the floors or sink you can use Scrub Free Bathroom Cleaner with Oxy-clean.</li>
            <li> AS LIGHT AS YOU CAN GO.</li>
            <li> But I got my hair as light as I could anyways.</li>
            <li> I use sulfate free shampoo and try to keep my showers lukewarm (to my dismay).</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy and don&#x27;t see the need to try anything else--yet.</li>
            <li> I have light brown hair</li>
            <li> (light purple)</li>
            <li> prefer the Splat Lusty Lavender because it dyes over natural hair color to create a gorgeous purple tint</li>
            <li> But I have gone temporary purple before with another (discontinued) product and it had the amazing effect of turning my hair “black” then showing purple in bright lights.</li>
            <li> It kept its original color for 2+ weeks and then faded gradually to fuschia after 6-8 washes (on bleached hair).</li>
            <li> originally writing this review</li>
            <li> Okay, so I admit that I am a first time dyer.</li>
            <li> sure theyr are pretty purple.  </li>
            <li> I was excited.  </li>
            <li> bleached bangs dyed well, but they were bleached 3 times to get them light enough for it to look good</li>
            <li> think I&#x27;ll stick with special effects for now.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful dark violet color with 2 boxes of dye and bleached hair....</li>
            <li> out!!!!!I&#x27;d say the pros are: Lots of cool colors to choose from.....</li>
            <li> I have been using Special Effects, but I was In a pinch and needed something quick.  </li>
            <li> and this is the most vibrant my hair has ever been.</li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s going to fade quickly, all brights do.</li>
            <li> but the drawback is that it FADES QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> I received my product quick (3days</li>
            <li> so I could only really see the purple in the light (unlike Splat&#x27;s where it was just bright).</li>
            <li> It could be really great as is if your wanting a more subtle look, but if (like me)</li>
            <li> Completely gone within a week even though i washed with color safe shampoo and conditioner and cool water.</li>
            <li> I recently did fuchsia and get so many compliments!</li>
            <li> First rinse!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what I got!</li>
            <li> I shampooed 2-4 days/week, so I was THRILLED TO STILL HAVE SO MUCH BLUENESS after NEARLY 6!</li>
            <li> SOOOOO, same day as bleach, applied purple, freely, EXACTLY ACCORDING 2 DIRECTIONS!!!!</li>
            <li> It was simple to apply and a very good price, especially for the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Then I rinsed it in hot water instead of cool.</li>
            <li> Wanted to have purple hair for fun.</li>
            <li> EVERY FIBER of my being, LOVE, AM SATISFIED WITH, ENJOY, REVEL IN my EPIC \\&quot;BLUEness\\&quot; and otherwise am FOREVER A DEVOTEE OF ION, C.B. BRITES(SKY BLUE)!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;We used 2 complete tubes of the Purple Dye, most of the developer (4 oz)</li>
            <li> complete tubes of the Purple Dye, most of the developer (4 oz)</li>
            <li> Use this on freshly shampoo-ed, but not conditioned hair~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So i imagine the lavender and light pink-ish color will be more red and or orange.</li>
            <li> I tried the lavendar (fades prettu quick), the red was vibrant, the blue fades to a teal, the purple was awesome.  </li>
            <li> but ti&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> But for the price, 4.49$ a box at Sally&#x27;s, it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> and it did get lighter and more noticeable, but it also had spots where it came out completely</li>
            <li> Plus, when mixing the two, it give my/your hair much more color depth as some strands of hair will pick up more of one dye than the other.</li>
            <li> Right now I am trying the darker purple.....</li>
            <li> Its litterally on my hair right now.............</li>
            <li> Right now doing the purple on 75% of my head on shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of money and this was pretty cheap with decent reviews.</li>
            <li> There are some parts that are darker in my hair where i used the Azure, so it looks greenish, other than that, where my hair is light enough it looks great.</li>
            <li> The rest of my hair has a slight purple-y tint that is gorgeous in sunlight.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re curious - the \\&quot;we\\&quot; in this adventure - was mostly my husband - who works in a metals fabrication shop!</li>

            <li> The red and purple fade kind of fast, but the blues last forever (not as bright as when you first dye it, but as a very faded patchy light blue).</li>
            <li> I started using them right when they launched with only 4 colours, so I am not sure if they have changed their product since it launched, but it is always great when I use it!</li>
            <li> it was a little too bright for me.</li>
            <li> (it was closer to the shade I wanted), I lightened my hair first and then applied the dye.</li>
            <li> Pretty color but the thicker formula makes it harder to color your own hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It turned out exactly as I hoped.  </li>
            <li> I left the dye on for about an hour to make sure it took.  </li>
            <li> I had two people helping me to make sure everything was covered and then left it in for over 40 minutes.</li>
            <li> When I rinsed it out that&#x27;s exactly what happened, it all rinsed out.</li>
            <li> I even let the color set an extra 10 minutes; just to be sure it had time to take.</li>
            <li> The picture of this color shows exactly what it will look like.</li>
            <li> It fades pretty fast, but i would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I did a claryifying treatment first</li>
            <li> I think I could&#x27;ve used more color so next time</li>
            <li> Within a week it went from a gorgeous deep violet to a pastel purple just from regular showers and color safe shampoo (barely using any to conserve the color).</li>
            <li> Then my first wash almost all of it came off 99% of my hair and now my hair looks brown.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I did it by myself, at home.</li>
            <li> The faded color is actually pretty</li>
            <li> I nevet buy anything anymore without checking out reviews on the product first ,if I can........</li>
            <li> I always left the color on for 2 hours with a shower cap over it to create some heat to help thecolor develop better.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not expensive...</li>
            <li> the first 4 pictures are purple to fuchsia ombre</li>
            <li> LOVE this color, trying some blues next, looking forward to those results.</li>
            <li> Lightening fast shipping and never got the colors messed up EVER!</li>
            <li> This was the first purple I used in my journey to purple hair.</li>
            <li> Other then that I love the product!</li>
            <li> Its the first product I&#x27;ve seen do that</li>
            <li> I am always up for a pretty shade of purple, so when I saw the ION brights purple</li>
            <li> you want a more dramatic look deffinetly make sure you lighten first!!</li>
            <li> In early May I had a stylist bleach about a 4\\&quot; dip on the bottom and dye it bright pink</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bright to begin with, showing up as a rather dark purple and it got washed out with only a couple of shampoo-ings (even using special color shampoo and conditioner from Garnier).</li>
            <li> It also seemed to fade pretty fast.</li>
            <li> So if you have think or long hair, be prepared to buy more than one tube.</li>
            <li> so figured it wouldn&#x27;t really Pop unless I lighten first.</li>
            <li> After removing the foil I used an old school bonnet style hair dryer for 30 min., then cool rinsed, followed by the Ion Color Brilliance</li>
            <li> It kind of just looked black, then faded away after a couple washes, never turning purple.  </li>
            <li> I had dyed my hair previously with the Fuschia shade, while it was a nice shade</li>
            <li> I tried this as an alternative to Manic Panic, but the color didn&#x27;t even last a full two weeks on freshly bleached hair.</li>
            <li> Other products smell OK at first or have a hint of a fruit smell mixed with the strong chemical smell, but this is nothing like the norm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so upset with the results because I was so excited to finally dye my hair purple in the first place.</li>
            <li> I used magenta a couple months ago and it was very vibrant however for whatever reason it didn&#x27;t take to my roots very well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be too vibrant since the first time I used it I didn&#x27;t lighten my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was previously pink from splat use so should be fine right</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it didn&#x27;t really dye my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to die the underside of my hair purple, and a lot of people said that this was the brightest.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like how fast the color disappeared from my hair</li>
            <li> and I used almost two whole tubes, the aqua and teal</li>
            <li> and then it didn&#x27;t even work, thanks.</li>
            <li> Very upset.</li>
            <li> Giving my hair a whole week of oil treatment.</li>
            <li> but it bled so much by the end of the week</li>
            <li> REALLY FREAKING</li>
            <li> So for now I can&#x27;t say how fast it will fade</li>
            <li> It works really well, so dose acetone nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really irritated.</li>
            <li> Even when diluting it with conditioner, it is still very chunky.</li>
            <li> If your hair isn&#x27;t blonde it doesn&#x27;t show at all not even a tint on light brown hair</li>
            <li> I have really been slathering it on half-hazzardly</li>
            <li> so I didnt wait for it to turn light yellow......</li>
            <li> For the price there wasn&#x27;t much and the color really didn&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li> Really really dislike this brand of purple.</li>
            <li> has kept it&#x27;s color very well.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t really stain skin (because it doesn&#x27;t really work)&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> It faded much quicker than I would have hoped.  </li>
            <li> I decided after sometime to apply it straight out of the tube and go darker.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t take much to my confusion.</li>
            <li> When I washed it out it looked more like a blue-purple than an actual purple, but to my horror I found that nearly 50% of my hair wasn&#x27;t purple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually had people, more than just a few, honestly ask me if my purple hair is natural.</li>
            <li> Other shades of magenta/purple have shown up fine, but this color did nothing!</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair a pale blonew and diluted the product with conditioner until it was a nice lavender.</li>
            <li> It is really a vibrant color and a fantastic deep shade of purple.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t til I tried to dye my hard a dark burgundy(Loreal) to even out the tones that somehow my hair became a wonderful purple color.</li>
            <li> , my hair seems to be none the less healthy and the color is very vibrant.</li>
            <li> There was no bold bright or deep purple for this product unlike the color swatch.</li>
            <li> Finally, to keep the color going, use some Ion semi bright in your shampoo and conditioner...equal parts or less.</li>
            <li> so imagine that at most this is lasting 10 washings before being pretty faded, which for me is a light pink with the bleached yellow showing through.</li>
            <li> To my surprise - amazing purple color over my naturally unbleached medium dark brown hair!</li>
            <li> The color was gorgeous when it was first dyed, but since it faded so quickly I&#x27;m quite unhappy.</li>
            <li> I have used other purple before, like Manic Panic and got a good deep purple over my natural hair color.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair and applied the dye to the top half of my head where all the highlights were.</li>
            <li> She previously tried the Manic Panic hair dye, and she finds that this one shows up better and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I bought Ion Color Brilliance mainly because I was at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and didn&#x27;t feel like paying $12 for a teensy thing of manic panic.</li>
            <li> I got the purple and it is so vibrant.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions, used over light natural red hair.  </li>
            <li> I will keep using Ion colors mainly because of how well the color has held up.</li>
            <li> Love the color but it only lasted till the next wash.</li>
            <li> Turned out more of a dark blue/purple than just dark purple but still very pretty and color is holding fast!</li>
            <li> Fun colored hair is in right now, and this is an affordable option other than the salon.</li>
            <li> I had a light pink color.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re ready to rinse, run your hair under water until the water runs rather clear.</li>
            <li> Top part was my natural dark brown with silver.</li>
            <li> And on top of that it was uneven.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure about the fading, but it actually took to my hair surprising well.</li>
            <li> I would normally use Pravana</li>
            <li> Bit of a tip, dilute it a bit with water to get full coverage if your hair is long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I had colored my hair with Garnier Nutrisse in Black Cherry and loved the color for about 2 days till it faded to a light brownish red.</li>
            <li> After-Color Sealer 20 oz.]]another cool rinse, and blow dry.</li>
            <li> The color took very well and gave me a delicate pale purple that i loved!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist touched up my roots and the new bleached spots did not take the color well.  </li>
            <li> so I drove an hour to pick out a manic panic product since these types of coordinating sold where I live.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so vibrant and so far</li>
            <li> You can see a very, very slight tint in a certain light, or maybe I&#x27;m just seeing things.</li>
            <li> one tube doesnt go very far...</li>
            <li> All my previous purple, looked fine.  </li>
            <li> so use to using Manic Panic and it giving me even vivid tones</li>
            <li> for the first wash, then 4 days later 90% of the product washed out.</li>
            <li> So as far as I am concerned you must have lighter then a level 6 for this to even show up!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bleach my hair first and it only took to the previously bleached area even though i had light brown roots.</li>
            <li> I waited a little over an hour before I washed it out and still had hope it be fine after it</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair, the day before I heavily chunked my hair with level 9 highlights, then the following day applied the product, i needed 2 tubes, I allowed to process for an hour and 15 minutes,the results were great</li>
            <li> , the lack of mess, the \\&quot;relative\\&quot; ease, the stunning results - this is the only \\&quot;alternative\\&quot; hair color I will ever buy.</li>
            <li> , the lack of mess, the \\&quot;relative\\&quot; ease, the stunning results - this is the only \\&quot;alternative\\&quot; hair color I will ever buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very vibrant violet hue, which sometimes can take on different tones, depending on the lighting.</li>
            <li> But that may be because I WANTED my hair to be very dark and then purple when the light hits it.</li>
            <li> I am a natural redhead.</li>
            <li> The blonde is a deep purple that will fade to a bright purple in the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> My hair is really soft now but again, not at all purple.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair nearly every shower -</li>
            <li> B004AGJTLQ Ion Crystal Clarifying Treatment]], and thinned out the dye with the Ion Sensitive Scalp Developer (10)[[ASIN:B005NISMF4</li>
            <li> Ion Sensitive Scalp 10 Volume Creme Developer 32 oz.]</li>
            <li> So this is about as far out of his \\&quot;normal\\&quot; zone as you can get.</li>
            <li> So this is about as far out of his \\&quot;normal\\&quot; zone as you can get.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Didn&#x27;t dye my natural hair at all, no \\&quot;tint\\&quot; as it claimed it would do&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To be fair - I have difficult hair to dye.</li>
            <li> : Is very dark at first, then fades too fast, leaving splotchy bleached purply hair.</li>
            <li> With the last color I had, it looked normal in dim indoor lighting but purple in sunlight.</li>
            <li> When I went they only had one box of this particular purple and the girl who worked there</li>
            <li> Came as a thick paste that goes straight into your hair, which is convenient and low-mess; however, it makes it more tedious to apply than the more liquid types of dyes.</li>
            <li> Not my first time dying hair purple or other colors and my hair is naturally brunette.</li>
            <li> Later that same day I realized that blonde is Not the right color for my personality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , the new roots still had a ting of yellow in them.  </li>
            <li> Varying shades of deep purples that absolutely pop in different lighting and with movement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a side note, if you plan on using the pastel colors, you really do need your hair to be platinum blonde unless you can tone it white.</li>
            <li> the rest is pretty much a dark brown which is my natural hair color.</li>
            <li> I think with the thick consistency it is easy to miss spots.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not drippy  and super messy......</li>
            <li> ACTUALLY, AFTER SAID reBleach, a pretty deep shade O&#x27; BLUE REMAINED!!!!!</li>
            <li> my hair is back to close to its original color but a little darker.  </li>
            <li> My natural red picked up almost no dye.</li>
            <li> I was supposed to be a natural blonde, but turned out orange.</li>
            <li> my hair, then attempted 2 add some EPIC PURPLE AWESOMEness 2 my 1/3sky BLUE HAIR!!!!</li>
            <li> THE 2/3 that was meant 2 BE AN EQUALLY EPIC SHADE, (as the blue side)was, well...</li>
            <li> dark brown natrual hair, is to use a permanent dye first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle in dim light but really stands out against dark hair in the sun.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s just been a mess, if you want fun colors I would use a different brand..</li>
            <li> I have very short spiky hair (less than two inches long) and I really had to work to get this tube to stretch to my whole head.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overwhelming, or eye burning, you don&#x27;t have to open a window, or fear you just killed half of your brain cells</li>
            <li> I used the color lavender and it only turned certain parts of my hair purple and other parts green/brown.</li>
            <li> so I usually use Loreal Quick Blue (from Sally&#x27;s) with 30 vol or 40 vol creme developer.</li>
            <li> I only wanted to change the blonde and not my natural red, I didn&#x27;t follow the directions.</li>
            <li> Literally only noticeable when sun is hitting it, and barely.</li>
            <li> tried the vitamin c method multiple times and giving my hair bleach baths and after 30 minutes you can barely see a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The purple is kinda dull and fades quickly.</li>
            <li> The dye is super thick, but it gets the job done well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that, decent results though I had to cover mine up with another brand as well to cover all of my hair because I didn&#x27;t have enough.</li>
            <li> First time, I bleached to a few shades above platinum blonde and is already showing through.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of purple - Manic Panic and Splat - and they both washed out or faded to hot pink after only 2 washes.</li>
            <li> Everything so far has given a reddish tint to it, whether from having it dyed red prevously or some other reason.  </li>
            <li> Again, the only downside is how thick it is so you&#x27;ll need to buy a bit extra or be willing to dilute it with some conditioner or even water.</li>
            <li> They are vibrant and last way longer then Pravana and are half the price!</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those that have read this review previously - please make note of the new information added regarding using Developer.</li>
            <li> A couple days later I noticed small sections of purple streaks, but very suttle.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair with a barely there purplish tint that barely shows up in the sun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you want blue hair for a long time and you plan to keep dying it blue buy this 😊&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if I didn&#x27;t use enough dye (I used 2 tubes but my hair is pretty long), or I didn&#x27;t leave it in long enough.  </li>
            <li> only qualm I had with the product was that a tube did not last me very long.</li>
            <li> Warning if you even have slightly dirty blonde hair it will not work for you; so if you have a darker than blonde hair color make sure to bleach it before you dye it.</li>
            <li> For safety measures, I cover my pillow when I sleep at least for the first week.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long though</li>
            <li> help your color last as long as possible:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Color doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I had been using splat but it wasn&#x27;t lasting long</li>
            <li> Let me just say that the color was very dark, and hardly noticeable in the light, either.  </li>
            <li> - the purple is really dark and blended in with my dark hair color too much</li>
            <li> I was careful in application and even left it on an extra 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have been dying a few streaks or ends of my hair fun colors for a while, and never had any trouble.</li>
            <li> I mixed 1 tube with the same amount of conditioner and left it on for about an hour and a half.</li>
            <li> The only thing this ended up coloring was my bathtub, followed instructions and it left absolutely no color in my blond hair, no change at all!</li>
            <li> but this was very patchy and dull.</li>
            <li> But this dye took so long to apply, hard to spread and the tubes dont hold much.</li>
            <li> It looks like a very dark brown/black from far away,up close</li>
            <li> I also use the deep conditioner from my dark brown hair dye...why don&#x27;t they make that stuff for individual sale?</li>
            <li> A silvery lavender... which then faded quickly to grey.</li>
            <li> I have/had medium brown hair that&#x27;s long (almost to my pants line).</li>
            <li> proceeded to keep going after spending long time applying and checking for spots that the dye didn&#x27;t get to.</li>
            <li> on my hair which crown to tip is 2 ft. long.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see how long it lasts!2</li>
            <li> on my hair which crown to tip is 2 ft. long.</li>
            <li> My hair was too long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair purple for a long time without bleaching it.</li>
            <li> I will also mention I have grey hair</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t mix this dye with developer so if you&#x27;re trying tof dye long hair you should get 2.</li>
            <li> For hair as long as mine I would recommend like 3 or 4.</li>
            <li> Used purple once and turned my hair grey.</li>
            <li> The color didn&#x27;t seem to last as long as other dyes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see how long it lasts!</li>
            <li> For the other colors I did bleach my hair until it was  a gold yellow</li>
            <li> Because I don&#x27;t use products or even blow dry my hair that often.</li>
            <li> Also my hair is long; down to just above my elbows.</li>
            <li> I have long (halfway down my back)</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark hair and had it pretreated at the salon, but the color doesn&#x27;t last longer than 2 weeks in my hair.</li>
            <li> I applied this to unbleached medium brown hair, although half of my hair is lighter brown because the red dye I used ages ago had a lifter in it.</li>
            <li> Ion Purple and Punky Plum last longer than any other purple dyes from other brands I&#x27;ve tried - and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of purple dyes over the years.</li>
            <li> Although Ion and Punky dyes seem to bleed a bit longer than some of the other brands, I think it&#x27;s because they also last longer than the other</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a very very dry dye</li>
            <li> I rinsed in tepid water and then applied the Ion After Color Treatment, left it on for a few minutes, rinsed, and then let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> but it just turned back dark, like I didn&#x27;t do anything!</li>
            <li> My hair is a very, very dark purple that actually looks closer to a dusky/ gray.</li>
            <li> one color on top of another (which is actually a bad Idea</li>
            <li> : Didn&#x27;t have a bad smell, more like grape scented markers.</li>
            <li> Wash with cold water and a sulfate/parabens free shampoo and don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday to make it last</li>
            <li> but I expected that.</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair, waited a week, and dyed with pravana pink.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wet wash your hair too often and use a dry/spray shampoo in between wet washes</li>
            <li> It looked like I had dark grey hair.</li>
            <li> just did ombre hair with the colors on the last few bottom inches of my hair....</li>
            <li> Total waste, no purple color.  </li>
            <li> I washed my hair a few times in the next two weeks</li>
            <li> The only downside is that my hair is black - and i have thick chunks i&#x27;ve streaked (bleached to white)</li>
            <li> Also, the tube was so small I have short hair and the colorist needed two tubes of this to cover it.</li>
            <li> It turned out extremely streaky.</li>
            <li> I will be going back to my usual hair color.</li>
            <li> but I will be trying to shampoo every other day with a no sulfate shampoo (Regis DesignLine Enchanted Midnight Color Luxury)</li>
            <li> and it was not pretty.</li>
            <li> I have dyed my hair purple several times, but not for the past two years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely dissapointed in this dye.</li>
            <li> I like the other colors they have,</li>
            <li> I have only a couple of strands a very pale pastel purple and</li>
            <li> very thick hair naturally a level 3-4 ( darkest brown)</li>
            <li> I have dark hair, so I wasn’t expecting miracles.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair, and it didn&#x27;t change my color at all, what should I do?</li>
            <li> I cover the floor with a dark colored towel and use a dark color towel whenever I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> in mind DO NOT ADD DEVELOPER (it ruins the dye) and</li>
            <li> I wanted to have purple hair so badly...but dark brown purple.  </li>
            <li> However indoors my hair looks dark brown.</li>
            <li> I used 1 tube (2.05 oz)  of this with 1/2 jar (2 oz) Manic Panic in Purple Haze (after reading reviews about Ion being too thick) Mixed it up in a bowl with a brush and saturated my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is still a faded out pale pink...</li>
            <li> but if you have dark hair like mines, dark brown to black, you need to use developer.</li>
            <li> Money down the drain.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like them as they seal the ability of conditioning properties eventually and weight down hait.</li>
            <li> I have dark almost black brown hair, I lightened my hair to about three shades lighter and put in the hair dye</li>
            <li> and so before using this my hair was a very dark blue-purple shade, and not a tremendously pretty one.</li>
            <li> I am a natural dirty blonde and I dye my hair dark brown.</li>
            <li> I ran out of dye with only a very small section done.</li>
            <li> After a few washes, Its a dull, muddy brownish red in the sun.  </li>
            <li> but in less than 1 week it was gone</li>
            <li> dyed my hair black, even after bleach.</li>
            <li> Previously, when dying my hair, I&#x27;ve used splat brand hair dye</li>
            <li> and it took LESS than before.</li>
            <li> Needless 2 say, I totally ENDORSE THE SKY BLUE SHADE!!!!</li>
            <li> [probably could have used less]</li>
            <li> [probably could have used less]</li>
            <li> My hair color is naturally black</li>
            <li> I had black and purple hair before using this.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy it from amazon though you can get it for less than $5 at Sally&#x27;s with the beauty club card</li>
            <li> I have naturally black hair, so I wanted some streaks of purple around my black.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m sad, and my hair is a normal color.</li>
            <li> I used SPLAT before and it is a MESS.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair, plan on getting at least 3-4 packages of this.</li>
            <li> not much comes in the small tube.</li>
            <li> Not cool.  </li>
            <li> Get one of those little bowls and application brushes squeeze tube in bowl and mix with brush until it gets creamier and easier to apply.</li>
            <li> They all take a little work keeping them up</li>
            <li> This dye us really dark!</li>
            <li> I have used this and other semi, demis over the past few years.</li>
            <li> I have always dyed my hair fun colours, my go to has always been manic panic, until a friend of mine who is a colour specialist told me it&#x27;s bad for your hair and reccomended either this or pravana.&lt;br /&gt;this</li>
            <li> but I only wash my hair once a week with cold water and only use conditioner.</li>
            <li> When it dried, there was no visible difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never bleached my hair, and I&#x27;ve been dying it for a few months</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t make my hair smell like harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I recommend buying a few tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - it was messy, it stained me -</li>
            <li> This honestly looked terrible and didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Mixed this dye with some conditioner to thin it out and applied it to my hair.</li>
            <li> Outside of that I left it in for a few hours before rinsing in cold water, and this stuff has some staying power if you know how to maintain it.</li>
            <li> The color is fading to green</li>
            <li> The purple faded within a few weeks</li>
            <li> am I missing something??</li>
            <li> my roots are that color past that is lightened to about a 5-6.and ends are previously bleached to a level 8-9 from an ombre color.  </li>
            <li> Super disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Once you get the color in your hair, either wear a processing cap or use just plain saran wrap and wait up to an hour.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with a little conditioner to thin it out as others have said its really thick.</li>
            <li> My hair is dark, but I wanted the purple to be subtle.</li>
            <li> My hair is also thick and a little bit past the shoulders</li>
            <li> I really had a bad experience with this brand.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easier to style and manager if I at least condition it everyday.</li>
            <li> I recommend picking up the ION conditioner that locks in color - I&#x27;ve since used splat again to dye my hair and used the conditioner (because i&#x27;m looking for a more shocking hair color -</li>
            <li> (not sure what brand).</li>
            <li> I bought two of these what a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Dry shampoo when need be, and with wet washings cold water and color protecting shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> texture is thick, paste-like, and not easily spread&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Bleached roots and a very pale orange for the rest of it).</li>
            <li> I must have got a bad tube or something because half of my hair was brown, half looked gray and half was a little purple.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to put on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely thick and hard to spread and</li>
            <li> hairs is purple ill give it that but not the intensity I expected.</li>
            <li> I would suggest leaving the dye on for at least an hour</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li> and yes it is thick.</li>
            <li> Being that it is so thick...</li>
            <li> I have shoulderlength, yet moderately thick hair, and I ended up using three tubes.</li>
            <li> i have a red hair and it didnt work in my hair :(...but maybe with other color, like blond !</li>
            <li> Bleached my hair twice, no previous color in it, and it faded SO bad</li>
            <li> and there was no color Extremely not satisfied!</li>
            <li> But if you just want a subtle contrast with drak hair this will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> It also ran like crazy if my hair got wet (or even damp).</li>
            <li> This was complete Crap.</li>
            <li> It is very thick so dripping wasn&#x27;t an issue.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY thick</li>
            <li> day before I also used a natural dye by this brand on my boyfriend&#x27;s sister and it also turned out horribly.</li>
            <li> This is the worst dye I&#x27;ve ever used, it stuck to nothing but my scalp, it completely washed out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed, so I went to Sallys and picked up Ion Magenta and a protein spray AND shower caps and still paid less than what I did for Pravana at Amazon.</li>
            <li> BUT, don&#x27;t waste TIME/MONEY/OR ANYTHING ELSE ON THE PURPLE SHADE!!!!</li>
            <li> But sadly what did I end up with?</li>
            <li> I do not know what the hell I did wrong, but it says no developer needed, so I did not use any with it.</li>
            <li> it stained everything - and it was difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> Yeah I&#x27;m angry.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> So sad.  </li>
            <li> After a horrible experience with Splat Lusty Lavender, I went and bought this brand to cover up the mess that was my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It was hard to get out and faded to a nasty color.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch, or what.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad looking but not at all</li>
            <li> it smelled bad and the smell would not go away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so disappointed in a hair color (and I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for years).</li>
            <li> and I was quite disappointed with it.&lt;br /&gt;Ion</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this brand and was horribly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I HATE it.</li>
            <li> This is crap.</li>
            <li> Absolutely hate it.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed by this product, it lasted one wash.</li>
            <li> My hair turned out horrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible....faded horribly after 1 wash.  </li>
            <li> it looked horrible.</li>
            <li> would say this is probably the worst product she has ever bought and should be reported to the trading standards.</li>
            <li> And it looks awful.</li>
            <li> The 20% from the permanent dye opens the cuticles,( 20 % lightens like a shade or 2 without the horrific affects of pre lightening on your hair).</li>
            <li> shocking I know!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My former highlights were a medium/light brown so I was hoping those pieces would come out purple.  It kind of just looked black, then faded away after a couple washes, never turning purple.  After a few washes, Its a dull, muddy brownish red in the sun.  Oh well, maybe If I started off fully blonde.</li>
            <li> Love how my hair turned out. Top part was my natural dark brown with silver. Bottom part was bleached.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bleach my hair first and it only took to the previously bleached area even though i had light brown roots. It also seemed to fade pretty fast. On the plus side, it didn&#x27;t really dye my skin at all. But it did dye my bath tub so choose your poison. I have since chosen to use a different dye.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after a lot of research and reading. I really wanted to die the underside of my hair purple, and a lot of people said that this was the brightest. I&#x27;m a college student, so I don&#x27;t have a lot of money and this was pretty cheap with decent reviews. I refuse to bleach my hair. It&#x27;s a light brunette color, around a 7, which the instructions said was ideal for purple. My roommate helped me apply it and I covered it for 35 minutes. After that, I went and rinsed it out. When it dried, there was no visible difference. You can see a very, very slight tint in a certain light, or maybe I&#x27;m just seeing things. I&#x27;m only giving it two stars because it came on time and it smells like grape. But I definitely would not recommend this to anyone and I will not buy this again. Now I&#x27;m sad, and my hair is a normal color.</li>
            <li> I had dyed my hair previously with the Fuschia shade, while it was a nice shade it was a little too bright for me. A couple of months later I decided to give the purple a chance (it was closer to the shade I wanted), I lightened my hair first and then applied the dye. I HATE it. I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch, or what. My hair is a very, very dark purple that actually looks closer to a dusky/ gray. I&#x27;ve never been so disappointed in a hair color (and I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for years).</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t have even used one star if I had a choice. My hair turned out horrible. Not even the color shown. I must have got a bad tube or something because half of my hair was brown, half looked gray and half was a little purple.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like how fast the color disappeared from my hair I thought it would last aleast 3 weeks but in less than 1 week it was gone</li>
            <li> Stunning. My daughter is becoming irritated by the numbers of people who approach me to tell me how beautiful my purple hair is. I used SPLAT before and it is a MESS. It dyed my skin and took weeks to wear off - no amount of scrubbing would get it off of my scalp. It also ran like crazy if my hair got wet (or even damp). My pillows and towels are permanently stained too. But this stuff has NONE of those problems. Believe the reviews when they say to buy more than you need. I have very short spiky hair (less than two inches long) and I really had to work to get this tube to stretch to my whole head. The color also seems to have hi and low lights in it...my head is not one solid purple color (I don&#x27;t look like a stuffed animal). The color has dimension and shine. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have always dyed my hair fun colours, my go to has always been manic panic, until a friend of mine who is a colour specialist told me it&#x27;s bad for your hair and reccomended either this or pravana.&lt;br /&gt;this dyed my hair black, even after bleach.</li>
            <li> Pretty color but the thicker formula makes it harder to color your own hair. The color didn&#x27;t seem to last as long as other dyes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I got the Fuschia color and i loved it but was nothing how the box said</li>
            <li> I am a natural redhead. Recently I decided to get blonde highlights. Later that same day I realized that blonde is Not the right color for my personality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing some research, I settled on Ion purple.&lt;br /&gt;Because I only wanted to change the blonde and not my natural red, I didn&#x27;t follow the directions. I washed my hair and applied the dye to the top half of my head where all the highlights were. After combing it through, I put it in a shower cap for 15 minutes instead of the recommended 30. Then I rinsed it in hot water instead of cool. Then I shampooed it with Head and Shoulders (the shampoo recommended for stripping out dye). After that I did a deep conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turned out exactly as I hoped.  The blonde is a deep purple that will fade to a bright purple in the next few weeks. My natural red picked up almost no dye. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair, plan on getting at least 3-4 packages of this. It&#x27;s extremely thick and hard to spread and not much comes in the small tube. Other than that, decent results though I had to cover mine up with another brand as well to cover all of my hair because I didn&#x27;t have enough.</li>
            <li> I bought Ion Color Brilliance mainly because I was at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and didn&#x27;t feel like paying $12 for a teensy thing of manic panic. It was only $5 at Sally&#x27;s, granted there was only enough dye in the tube to dye my hair once, whereas my bottle of rockabily blue has enough to dye my hair twice and then some. Anywho, i mixed Manic Panic&#x27;s rockabilly blue (amplified) and the ion brilliance for the shade i got.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product. I tried it on my hair and the dye didn&#x27;t take.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use again, the color didn&#x27;t hold at all.</li>
            <li> I used this hair color without pre lightening my hair.  I have a streak of white i wanted to color for the summer.  I applied it all over.  It is very thick so dripping wasn&#x27;t an issue.  I chose to not use heat.  I left the dye on for about an hour to make sure it took.  The color was a bit lighter than i wanted but gorgeous. The rest of my hair has a slight purple-y tint that is gorgeous in sunlight.</li>
            <li> Hair dye does smell great and easy to apply but didn&#x27;t show up in my hair. I have dark almost black brown hair, I lightened my hair to about three shades lighter and put in the hair dye but it just turned back dark, like I didn&#x27;t do anything! Lol bummer.</li>
            <li> Love this dye! I got the purple and it is so vibrant. I recently did fuchsia and get so many compliments! Plus, both the purple and fuchsia fade into a pretty color, which is always nice!</li>
            <li> I really had a bad experience with this brand. I have been dying a few streaks or ends of my hair fun colors for a while, and never had any trouble. Purple is one of my favorite colors... But sadly what did I end up with? A silvery lavender... which then faded quickly to grey. It wasn&#x27;t bad looking but not at all what I wanted.. And on top of that it was uneven. So it&#x27;s just been a mess, if you want fun colors I would use a different brand.. I like Manic Panic, it&#x27;s about the same price and I have not had a problem with it ever!</li>
            <li> Previously, when dying my hair, I&#x27;ve used splat brand hair dye and I was quite disappointed with it.&lt;br /&gt;Ion is much better. It&#x27;s a thicker dye, so it doesn&#x27;t drip much and it coats your hair nicely. I have short (chin-length) hair but it&#x27;s thick and I used almost two whole tubes, the aqua and teal colors.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never bleached my hair, and I&#x27;ve been dying it for a few months one color on top of another (which is actually a bad Idea and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it) and so before using this my hair was a very dark blue-purple shade, and not a tremendously pretty one. I had a friend help me paint my hair with the dye and I let it sit for an hour before washing it out and this is the most vibrant my hair has ever been. With the last color I had, it looked normal in dim indoor lighting but purple in sunlight. My hair now looks blue in all lighting.</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair over a week ago and then last night I used three tubes of this product on my hair. I had two people helping me to make sure everything was covered and then left it in for over 40 minutes. When I washed it out it looked more like a blue-purple than an actual purple, but to my horror I found that nearly 50% of my hair wasn&#x27;t purple. It left the un-purple parts of my hair a gray-brown color. I&#x27;ve dyed my hair many times, but never used this brand before and never will again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day before I also used a natural dye by this brand on my boyfriend&#x27;s sister and it also turned out horribly. I was supposed to be a natural blonde, but turned out orange. I should have returned all the purple I bought for myself after that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrible product, but here&#x27;s the rest of the review all the same: Didn&#x27;t have a bad smell, more like grape scented markers. Came as a thick paste that goes straight into your hair, which is convenient and low-mess; however, it makes it more tedious to apply than the more liquid types of dyes. Like with most dyes, keep a damp paper towel with dish soap on it nearby to easily wipe dye off skin to prevent unwanted dying.</li>
            <li> I got this hair color at a salon after a cut and bleach, so I thought it would be a lot more permanent and brighter than it was. It wasn&#x27;t bright to begin with, showing up as a rather dark purple and it got washed out with only a couple of shampoo-ings (even using special color shampoo and conditioner from Garnier). I don&#x27;t recommend it! Also, the tube was so small I have short hair and the colorist needed two tubes of this to cover it.</li>
            <li> I have/had medium brown hair that&#x27;s long (almost to my pants line). I mixed 1 tube with the same amount of conditioner and left it on for about an hour and a half. When I rinsed it out that&#x27;s exactly what happened, it all rinsed out. My hair is now a bit darker but not purple at all. I just consider it a time consuming deep conditioning. My hair is really soft now but again, not at all purple. I&#x27;m neither pleased nor displeased.</li>
            <li> This is the worst dye I&#x27;ve ever used, it stuck to nothing but my scalp, it completely washed out of my hair. I had to scrape up the money to buy a tube and then it didn&#x27;t even work, thanks.</li>
            <li> I got this dye from my local Sally as opposed to on here. When I went they only had one box of this particular purple and the girl who worked there said that I could mix it with the fushia. This was just a lighter, more pinky purple. I applied this to unbleached medium brown hair, although half of my hair is lighter brown because the red dye I used ages ago had a lifter in it. I left it in for 2 hours with a plastic bag over my head. I heated it with my hair dryer for 5 minutes 4 times periodically throughout the 2 hours. I just did this last night so I&#x27;m not sure about the fading, but it actually took to my hair surprising well. My roots dont show as well as the ends but I expected that. My hair just all around looks a more even color and darker with a purple tint. I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
            <li> Terrible....faded horribly after 1 wash.  Completely gone within a week even though i washed with color safe shampoo and conditioner and cool water.</li>
            <li> Ok, soooo...I do not know what the hell I did wrong, but it says no developer needed, so I did not use any with it. Well It did nothing to my hair, did darken my shade, but otherwise literally just washed off. A couple days later I noticed small sections of purple streaks, but very suttle. Literally only noticeable when sun is hitting it, and barely. So I do not know, but was unsuccessful for me.</li>
            <li> Still didn&#x27;t use, but I think the color look great</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using this product.. I would normally use Pravana but I knew Ion was cheaper and readily available at Sally&#x27;s so I went out and bought it. I used the color lavender and it only turned certain parts of my hair purple and other parts green/brown. I used this color on platinum blonde hair. It turned out extremely streaky. It was hard to get out and faded to a nasty color. I guess that&#x27;s what you get for buying cheap dye lol. I&#x27;m gonna stick to Pravana and Scruples!</li>
            <li> This hair color does not work i even bleached my hair and the color still did not stick I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> i have a red hair and it didnt work in my hair :(...but maybe with other color, like blond !</li>
            <li> Super disappointed with this product. I have dark hair, so I wasn’t expecting miracles. But I have gone temporary purple before with another (discontinued) product and it had the amazing effect of turning my hair “black” then showing purple in bright lights. I loved it! This product was a bust. I followed the instructions to the letter. I even let the color set an extra 10 minutes; just to be sure it had time to take. I rinsed the color…. And it all came out. First rinse! 100% gone! My hair didn’t even look a shade darker! Very upset. Wish L’Oreal hadn’t discontinued their temporary line.</li>
            <li> I have been using Special Effects, but I was In a pinch and needed something quick.  So, I purchased ION Purple.  My hair stylist touched up my roots and the new bleached spots did not take the color well.  All my previous purple, looked fine.  She added more purple, let it sit longer, and it did not make a difference, the new roots still had a ting of yellow in them.  I do not recommend this product.  I will be going back to my usual hair color.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair, and it didn&#x27;t change my color at all, what should I do?</li>
            <li> Wanted to have purple hair for fun. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be too vibrant since the first time I used it I didn&#x27;t lighten my hair. It didn&#x27;t take AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;So I lightened my hair. Did it again and it took LESS than before. This is crap. I will NEVER buy this product again.</li>
            <li> The purple is kinda dull and fades quickly.</li>
            <li> Love the color! Great purple and easy application. Doesn&#x27;t last long though</li>
            <li> it smelled bad and the smell would not go away</li>
            <li> Warning if you even have slightly dirty blonde hair it will not work for you; so if you have a darker than blonde hair color make sure to bleach it before you dye it.</li>
            <li> The picture of this color shows exactly what it will look like. It fades pretty fast, but i would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> It kept its original color for 2+ weeks and then faded gradually to fuschia after 6-8 washes (on bleached hair). I used a &amp;#34;color safe&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;ve tried other brands of purple - Manic Panic and Splat - and they both washed out or faded to hot pink after only 2 washes. I&#x27;m much more satisfied with this, although it would be nice if it lasted longer. The dye is super thick, but it gets the job done well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the color! It&#x27;s subtle in dim light but really stands out against dark hair in the sun. It also doesn&#x27;t make my hair smell like harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair with a bleached section that I normally color. Other shades of magenta/purple have shown up fine, but this color did nothing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. But you get what you pay for. I paid 2.99 at my Sally&#x27;s store. Purchased two bottles. Left it in for an hour and it was very light. I&#x27;ll be purchasing manic panic next week. Giving my hair a whole week of oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find a purple that held for an extended period of time. I wash my hair nearly every shower - and yes I know this isn&#x27;t great for your hair but I have a combination hair type and it&#x27;s easier to style and manager if I at least condition it everyday. I first Tried Splat - which had a great color but it bled so much by the end of the week I had a light pink color. This purple held for sure. The only downside is that my hair is black - and i have thick chunks i&#x27;ve streaked (bleached to white) - the purple is really dark and blended in with my dark hair color too much so I could only really see the purple in the light (unlike Splat&#x27;s where it was just bright). I am going to try the magenta or blue next because they are a lot brighter than the purple. This would probably be the perfect contrast with some whose hair is naturally blonde or light brown so you can see the contrast in color. But if you just want a subtle contrast with drak hair this will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I recommend picking up the ION conditioner that locks in color - I&#x27;ve since used splat again to dye my hair and used the conditioner (because i&#x27;m looking for a more shocking hair color - I had a bunch left over) and it has incredibly reduced the amount of color bleeding.</li>
            <li> *THE PURPLE SHADE REALLY FREAKING SUX/VACCUMS!!!!!*&lt;br /&gt;BLEACHED my hair, then attempted 2 add some EPIC PURPLE AWESOMEness 2 my 1/3sky BLUE HAIR!!!! SOOOOO, same day as bleach, applied purple, freely, EXACTLY ACCORDING 2 DIRECTIONS!!!!

A AT BEST, \\&quot;HALF-arsed\\&quot; shade of bleach/Blonde &amp; let&#x27;s just call it \\&quot;sporadic, gray, patches\\&quot;....  The fricking  purple went A.W.O.A.T.(AWOL) ie: \\&quot;Absent W/O A TRACE!!!\\&quot; RINSED OUT IMMEDIATELY!!!,I GUESS...... Needless 2 say, I totally ENDORSE THE SKY BLUE SHADE!!!! BUT, don&#x27;t waste TIME/MONEY/OR ANYTHING ELSE ON THE PURPLE SHADE!!!! BUYER BE MIFFED/BEWARE! STAY TUNED! 4 MY COMMENTARY RE: MY experience with.the sky blue shade!!!!&lt;br /&gt;OK.

SERIOUSLY. I shampooed 2-4 days/week, so I was THRILLED TO STILL HAVE SO MUCH BLUENESS after NEARLY 6! FREAKING WEEKS!!!!</li>
            <li> I was told that this product would be great for me. But this dye took so long to apply, hard to spread and the tubes dont hold much. I recommend buying a few tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I proceeded to keep going after spending long time applying and checking for spots that the dye didn&#x27;t get to. I waited a little over an hour before I washed it out and still had hope it be fine after it dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im so use to using Manic Panic and it giving me even vivid tones but this was very patchy and dull. I will have to redye it. Im using manic panic from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairs is purple ill give it that but not the intensity I expected.</li>
            <li> Its always been my dream to have purple hair, but not PURPLE hair  - I wanted brown hair that was purple if that makes any sense! Last week I tried a brand called SPLAT! - it was messy, it stained me - it stained everything - and it was difficult to apply.Then it rinsed out in some places, not in others - it looked horrible. To be fair - I have difficult hair to dye. Because I don&#x27;t use products or even blow dry my hair that often. I had a 3 hr dye job in a salon rinse out once too. They said my hair was in too good of condition. But still - I wouldn&#x27;t recommend SPLAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that have read this review previously - please make note of the new information added regarding using Developer. Ion however is an AMAZING product. and I tried it because of the reviews on here and Sally Beauty Supply website. I did a claryifying treatment first [[ASIN:B004AGJTLQ Ion Crystal Clarifying Treatment]], and thinned out the dye with the Ion Sensitive Scalp Developer (10)[[ASIN:B005NISMF4 Ion Sensitive Scalp 10 Volume Creme Developer 32 oz.]] because everyone said it was so thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since originally writing this review I have been instructed that I should not use the Developer with this type of dye as it has peroxide in it. I was told I should use conditioner instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used a bowl and brush to apply it, and put hair sections in tin foil by the roots to bundle the dyed sections. After removing the foil I used an old school bonnet style hair dryer for 30 min., then cool rinsed, followed by the Ion Color Brilliance After Color Treatment [[ASIN:B00784RLJ4 Ion Color Defense After-Color Sealer 20 oz.]]another cool rinse, and blow dry. Result? To my surprise - amazing purple color over my naturally unbleached medium dark brown hair! Varying shades of deep purples that absolutely pop in different lighting and with movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product smells good and DOESN&#x27;T STAIN YOUR SKIN!!!!!! I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but it&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used 2 complete tubes of the Purple Dye, most of the developer (4 oz) [probably could have used less] on my hair which crown to tip is 2 ft. long. And it took about 4.5 hours start to finish. I recommend buying 3 tubes of dye - for just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you&#x27;re curious - the \\&quot;we\\&quot; in this adventure - was mostly my husband - who works in a metals fabrication shop! So this is about as far out of his \\&quot;normal\\&quot; zone as you can get. And the results are stunning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Ions price point, the lack of mess, the \\&quot;relative\\&quot; ease, the stunning results - this is the only \\&quot;alternative\\&quot; hair color I will ever buy. Can&#x27;t wait to see how long it lasts!2 complete tubes of the Purple Dye, most of the developer (4 oz) [probably could have used less] on my hair which crown to tip is 2 ft. long.

            <li> It looks fine, but I haven&#x27;t use it yet. I will write another review after I finish dying my hair.</li>
            <li> when you buy hair dye at the store (same brand) it comes in a box with a foil packet of conditioner and plastic gloves. the instructions that came with this tube instructed you to use these items and they weren&#x27;t in the box.</li>
            <li> bleeds and stains everything.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my best friend, who wanted to dye her whole head of hair purple. The color shows up brilliantly in her light brown hair, and she didn&#x27;t even use bleach to lighten it beforehand! She is very pleased with the way it turned out. It&#x27;s a very vibrant violet hue, which sometimes can take on different tones, depending on the lighting. She previously tried the Manic Panic hair dye, and she finds that this one shows up better and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> So I loved the way this turned out. But that may be because I WANTED my hair to be very dark and then purple when the light hits it. That&#x27;s exactly what I got! I used 1 tube (2.05 oz)  of this with 1/2 jar (2 oz) Manic Panic in Purple Haze (after reading reviews about Ion being too thick) Mixed it up in a bowl with a brush and saturated my hair. I put a processing cap over it and left it on for 1 hour. I rinsed in tepid water and then applied the Ion After Color Treatment, left it on for a few minutes, rinsed, and then let my hair air dry. A few weeks ago I had colored my hair with Garnier Nutrisse in Black Cherry and loved the color for about 2 days till it faded to a light brownish red. I have yet to wash my hair after my Ion/Manic Panic application, I colored it Friday night and it is now Sunday morning. I&#x27;ll probably wait until Monday. So for now I can&#x27;t say how fast it will fade but I will be trying to shampoo every other day with a no sulfate shampoo (Regis DesignLine Enchanted Midnight Color Luxury) it&#x27;s wonderful!!! Also my hair is long; down to just above my elbows. I think I could&#x27;ve used more color so next time I may mix more or use a bottle instead of a brush. Happy coloring!</li>
            <li> This was the suckiest hair dye I have ever had. I put it in, let it oak for an hour, used the color sealer shampoo and everything. It was awesome at fisrt. Then once I took a shower, it all came out. Don&#x27;t buy this if you have darker hair. This was complete Crap. Ok bye. This sucked. Yeah I&#x27;m angry. Ok bye...</li>
            <li> 1. BLEACH YOUR HAIR: For best results you will need to pre-lighten or bleach out your hair, especially for the more pastel/lighter colors. My hair color is naturally black so I usually use Loreal Quick Blue (from Sally&#x27;s) with 30 vol or 40 vol creme developer. Your hair needs to be platinum or as light as you can get it WITHOUT DAMAGING your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. BUY ENOUGH: This dye is a lot thicker than Punky Colour, SFX or Manic Panic. I added a couple tablespoons of water to make it a more yogurt-like consistency. I used purple, azure and teal (see customer picture) along with about a third a bottle of Beyond the Zone Candy Apple Red.My hair is also thick and a little bit past the shoulders and I went through all three tubes. So if you have think or long hair, be prepared to buy more than one tube. And of course wear gloves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. BE PREPARED: Use this on freshly shampoo-ed, but not conditioned hair~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most semi-permanent dyes, this stuff can get all over the place. I cover the floor with a dark colored towel and use a dark color towel whenever I wash my hair. Obviously use a white towel when using bleach. For safety measures, I cover my pillow when I sleep at least for the first week. If you get this on the floors or sink you can use Scrub Free Bathroom Cleaner with Oxy-clean. It works really well, so dose acetone nail polish remover. If you get this on your hands or skin, hair line, face, scalp, etc use Colortrak Color Remover Wipes which can also be found at Sally&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. SET: Once you get the color in your hair, either wear a processing cap or use just plain saran wrap and wait up to an hour. The longer you leave it in, the brighter brighter results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. RINSE: When you&#x27;re ready to rinse, run your hair under water until the water runs rather clear. DO NOT SHAMPOO YOUR HAIR. Use conditioner specifically for colored hair and leave it in for about 20 minutes. You might want to do this for the next couple of washes, so thecolor sets and stays in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post more pictures as time passes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***On a side note, if you plan on using the pastel colors, you really do need your hair to be platinum blonde unless you can tone it white. There are some parts that are darker in my hair where i used the Azure, so it looks greenish, other than that, where my hair is light enough it looks great. So i imagine the lavender and light pink-ish color will be more red and or orange.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this product and it did not change the colour of her hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;I would say this is probably the worst product she has ever bought and should be reported to the trading standards. It does NOT do what it says on the tin.</li>
            <li> I just used it! It sucked! Washed out 1st shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;Less than 1 star!</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair, waited a week, and dyed with pravana pink. The dye did not take at all! I was so disappointed, so I went to Sallys and picked up Ion Magenta and a protein spray AND shower caps and still paid less than what I did for Pravana at Amazon. Immediately went home and dyed my hair. I LOVE this color. Of course it&#x27;s going to fade quickly, all brights do. Wash with cold water and a sulfate/parabens free shampoo and don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday to make it last</li>
            <li> I love these colors!  They are vibrant and last way longer then Pravana and are half the price!</li>
            <li> Beautiful dark violet color with 2 boxes of dye and bleached hair....but the drawback is that it FADES QUICKLY. Within a week it went from a gorgeous deep violet to a pastel purple just from regular showers and color safe shampoo (barely using any to conserve the color). Was expecting it to last longer. Also...BLEACH YOUR HAIR AS LIGHT AS YOU CAN GO. First time, I bleached to a few shades above platinum blonde and is already showing through.</li>
            <li> I adore the Ion Brilliance Brights Purple! It is really a vibrant color and a fantastic deep shade of purple. Sometimes I use it alone but most times I mix it with [[ASIN:B0015R5WYG Punky Semi-Permanent Colour Cream Plum 3.5 Oz.]]. The mix of the two give me an awesome, deep purple. Plus, when mixing the two, it give my/your hair much more color depth as some strands of hair will pick up more of one dye than the other. I&#x27;ve actually had people, more than just a few, honestly ask me if my purple hair is natural. Seriously. I always say yes and they always believe me. Gotta love humans. &#x3D;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both Ion Purple and Punky Plum last longer than any other purple dyes from other brands I&#x27;ve tried - and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of purple dyes over the years. Although Ion and Punky dyes seem to bleed a bit longer than some of the other brands, I think it&#x27;s because they also last longer than the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a good quality, lovely purple, Ion Brilliance Brights Purple is a great choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help your color last as long as possible:&lt;br /&gt;- wash/rinse your hair in cool/cold water [just like protecting your colors in your laundry]&lt;br /&gt;- use quality color-protect shampoo/conditioner such as Paul Mitchell Color Protect Shampoo/Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;- don&#x27;t wet wash your hair too often and use a dry/spray shampoo in between wet washes&lt;br /&gt;- stay away from any products with Tea Tree Oil as they will strip your color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the red, purple and all the blues. The red and purple fade kind of fast, but the blues last forever (not as bright as when you first dye it, but as a very faded patchy light blue). Which for some people is good, but for someone who changes their hair color quite a lot it can be a bit annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the vitamin c method multiple times and giving my hair bleach baths and after 30 minutes you can barely see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you want blue hair for a long time and you plan to keep dying it blue buy this 😊&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Keep in mind DO NOT ADD DEVELOPER (it ruins the dye) and I would suggest leaving the dye on for at least an hour**</li>
            <li> This honestly looked terrible and didn&#x27;t work at all. It looked like I had dark grey hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really irritated. I read how light your hair needs to be for the dye to look like a nice purple and if your hairs too light it won&#x27;t take etc etc. But I got my hair as light as I could anyways. (Bleached roots and a very pale orange for the rest of it). And it looks awful. Mixed this dye with some conditioner to thin it out and applied it to my hair. Left that in for 2 hours and rinsed. Then my first wash almost all of it came off 99% of my hair and now my hair looks brown. Not to help that I ran out of dye so I have some bleached spots showing. I&#x27;m going out to get some SPLAT today to re bleach my hair and redye it. I can&#x27;t have hair that looks like this. It&#x27;s gross.</li>
            <li> I like the color but I don&#x27;t care for the chunky consistency of this hair color. Even when diluting it with conditioner, it is still very chunky. I like manic panics consistency better. I got both ion color and manic panic both at Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get my hair dye</li>
            <li> Wow.  Left it on my son&#x27;s hair for 3.5 hours and it came out great! Really bright!  It&#x27;s a bluer purple which is what he wanted.  If you want a redder purple I would mix this with magenta.  Great product!</li>
            <li> If your hair isn&#x27;t blonde it doesn&#x27;t show at all not even a tint on light brown hair just makes your hair look darker just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for but shipping was great</li>
            <li> Okay, so I admit that I am a first time dyer. This was the first time I did it by myself, at home. I did it on unbleached hair, though I did use heat while processing it for forty minutes. Do I have purple hair? Nope. I have dark hair with a barely there purplish tint that barely shows up in the sun.</li>
            <li> the color is very cool but it&#x27;s hard to put on, it&#x27;s a very very dry dye</li>
            <li> I am a natural dirty blonde and I dye my hair dark brown. In early May I had a stylist bleach about a 4\\&quot; dip on the bottom and dye it bright pink (not sure what brand). Since then I have dyed at home twice using the Ion magenta (time 1) and the fuschia (time 2)--they both came out vibrant hot pinks with the magenta more bright and the fuschia more dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair 1-2 times a week so imagine that at most this is lasting 10 washings before being pretty faded, which for me is a light pink with the bleached yellow showing through. The faded color is actually pretty but I don&#x27;t like the bleach shade. My stylist if I go lighter my hair will start falling off--removing almost-black dye from hair is a damaging process...maybe I can tone the yellow at some point. I would like to move throught the rainbow so purple is next for me and then I will see if my bleach level will let me turn blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use one tube and yes it is thick. Get one of those little bowls and application brushes squeeze tube in bowl and mix with brush until it gets creamier and easier to apply. Def wear gloves adn use foil. I have really been slathering it on half-hazzardly but I recommend sectioning it out... I think with the thick consistency it is easy to miss spots. Directions say wait 10 minutes; I wait 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end, my hair seems to be none the less healthy and the color is very vibrant. I use sulfate free shampoo and try to keep my showers lukewarm (to my dismay). I also use the deep conditioner from my dark brown hair dye...why don&#x27;t they make that stuff for individual sale? Overall I&#x27;m happy and don&#x27;t see the need to try anything else--yet.</li>
            <li> I nevet buy anything anymore without checking out reviews on the product first ,if I can........So Amazon is where I learned about Ion haircolor brights.I dint buy it off Amazon cuz its easier and cheaper for me to go to Sally&#x27;s......But I have used many of their colors with great results....I have medium red-brown hair......I have tried magenta,fuschia...sky blue (my favorite and the one that turned out the best)........!!I just did ombre hair with the colors on the last few bottom inches of my hair....Right now I am trying the darker purple.....Its litterally on my hair right now.............For the other colors I did bleach my hair until it was  a gold yellow....I dont really like bleach because of how harsh it is...so I didnt wait for it to turn light yellow......and every color Ive tried has come out like its supposed to.I always left the color on for 2 hours with a shower cap over it to create some heat to help thecolor develop better.....Now for this purple...I have not pre-lightened it......(or else I may end up bald!!!:).......So we&#x27;ll see how it turns out!!!!!I&#x27;d say the pros are: Lots of cool colors to choose from.....It&#x27;s not expensive...It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s thick so it&#x27;s not drippy  and super messy......and for me every color came out perfecty..Now for the cons: Yes you probably will have to bleach your hair for the best results......Being that it is so thick...one tube doesnt go very far...Right now doing the purple on 75% of my head on shoulder length hair I needed 2 tubes and even then it had to be thinned out with a dollop of conditioner mixed in.......So that&#x27;s my experience with Ion.....So to everyone out there...good luck and happy coloring!!!!!!!!!!...::</li>
            <li> Bit of a tip, dilute it a bit with water to get full coverage if your hair is long. Outside of that I left it in for a few hours before rinsing in cold water, and this stuff has some staying power if you know how to maintain it. Dry shampoo when need be, and with wet washings cold water and color protecting shampoo and conditioner. Love it!</li>
            <li> Not at all impressed. I tried this as an alternative to Manic Panic, but the color didn&#x27;t even last a full two weeks on freshly bleached hair. The color was gorgeous when it was first dyed, but since it faded so quickly I&#x27;m quite unhappy.</li>
            <li> I used it and it didn&#x27;t do anything. I have light brown hair so I didn&#x27;t use the lightener but after I rinsed this out my hair looks like I didn&#x27;t do anything to it.</li>
            <li> Color doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> For the price there wasn&#x27;t much and the color really didn&#x27;t come out. Wasn&#x27;t til I tried to dye my hard a dark burgundy(Loreal) to even out the tones that somehow my hair became a wonderful purple color. I did bleach my hair twice and used the clips to put it up into 4 segments and blah blah. Just didn&#x27;t seem to take as good as I thought. Not my first time dying hair purple or other colors and my hair is naturally brunette. Soooo, ya. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> You need to bleach the hair but even then I dont think it a good product/paint.</li>
            <li> Fun colored hair is in right now, and this is an affordable option other than the salon. I have naturally dark hair and had it pretreated at the salon, but the color doesn&#x27;t last longer than 2 weeks in my hair. It says 28 washes, but I only get about 14. I love the color, and it&#x27;s easy to apply with a coloring brush and bowl, I just wish it wasn&#x27;t as temporary.</li>
            <li> Really really dislike this brand of purple. Bleached my hair twice, no previous color in it, and it faded SO bad and it was not pretty. Absolutely hate it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get my medium-dark brown hair purple for the last four months.  Everything so far has given a reddish tint to it, whether from having it dyed red prevously or some other reason.  This product has gotten me closest to purple.  After using Ion Color Brilliance Purple my hair is back to close to its original color but a little darker.  I&#x27;m hoping it will fade into a more purple color.  Not sure if I didn&#x27;t use enough dye (I used 2 tubes but my hair is pretty long), or I didn&#x27;t leave it in long enough.  I think I&#x27;ll have to try again to get better results.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t quite look like the picture, but it was very beautiful. The color lasted longer with this brand than Splat.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions, used over light natural red hair.  The dye did not take at all.  Total waste, no purple color.  I have used other purple before, like Manic Panic and got a good deep purple over my natural hair color.</li>
            <li> I had been using splat but it wasn&#x27;t lasting long so I drove an hour to pick out a manic panic product since these types of coordinating sold where I live. The lady in the store recommended this brand. I chose magenta. My hair was previously pink from splat use so should be fine right no. After coloring my hair there was nothing. Didn&#x27;t take at all. My hair is still a faded out pale pink...Orange in some places.  Money down the drain.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed by this product, it lasted one wash. I have dark brown hair, the day before I heavily chunked my hair with level 9 highlights, then the following day applied the product, i needed 2 tubes, I allowed to process for an hour and 15 minutes,the results were great (light purple) for the first wash, then 4 days later 90% of the product washed out. There was no bold bright or deep purple for this product unlike the color swatch. Pass this one by!</li>
            <li> I wanted to have purple hair so badly...but dark brown purple.  I ordered one tube.  My hair was too long I should have ordered 2 tubes.  It didn&#x27;t take at all.  I was so disappointed.  I ordered 3 more tubes and decided I was going to give it another go...no luck.  So sad.  Could have been user error...but I don&#x27;t thing so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair purple for a long time without bleaching it. This stuff did not work for me....</li>
            <li> The colours fade to another colour, not a washed out colour.  I tried the lavendar (fades prettu quick), the red was vibrant, the blue fades to a teal, the purple was awesome.  I just love this brand and always recommend them .  I started using them right when they launched with only 4 colours, so I am not sure if they have changed their product since it launched, but it is always great when I use it!</li>
            <li> I have used this and other semi, demis over the past few years. the best combo for me...dark brown natrual hair, is to use a permanent dye first. I color purple so I use the brightest I can find,( that&#x27;s the hardest part) using a 20 % solution. Then you can put these types of dyes immediantly over them. The 20% from the permanent dye opens the cuticles,( 20 % lightens like a shade or 2 without the horrific affects of pre lightening on your hair). Then after you rinse this dye out use a really good conditioner to help close the cuticle. Ones with dimethycone are best but I don&#x27;t like them as they seal the ability of conditioning properties eventually and weight down hait. ( I like tresemme). Finally, to keep the color going, use some Ion semi bright in your shampoo and conditioner...equal parts or less. That&#x27;s the best combo I found for me. Ion does leave the best shine of most of the other vegetable or protein dyes. They all take a little work keeping them up but ti&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This dye us really dark! In the sun you can see the purple. However indoors my hair looks dark brown.</li>
            <li> Amazon isn&#x27;t showing all my pictures so here is a link to an album http://imgur.com/a/xQWYa&lt;br /&gt;I bought this through sally&#x27;s because it&#x27;s about 6 dollars cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;This product is great but if you have dark hair like mines, dark brown to black, you need to use developer. I left mines in for about 30 minutes. Till it went yellow. It faded after 3rd week but I only wash my hair once a week with cold water and only use conditioner. The last 2 pictures are after 2-4 months. The color is fading to green but I still like it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this on my extensions and it&#x27;s great on those too. the first 4 pictures are purple to fuchsia ombre I did and the 4th one is the extension after 3 months, when I took it out.&lt;br /&gt;6 and 7 pictures are a dye job with purple, I didn&#x27;t spread it out evenly so it came out silver blonde on where I missed it.&lt;br /&gt;8th picture is a purple to shark blue to azure.</li>
            <li> Ok so I read a review on here that said her hair was not prelightened and it came out this gorgeous purple so I thought &amp;#34;thats what I want&amp;#34; so I bought 3 tubs.  I have long (halfway down my back) very thick hair naturally a level 3-4 ( darkest brown) my roots are that color past that is lightened to about a 5-6.and ends are previously bleached to a level 8-9 from an ombre color.  So I used all 3 of the bottles and let it sit heating it with a hairdryer every so ofter for an hour.  My roots it never even touched my middle nope not even a tint the ends sure theyr are pretty purple.  So as far as I am concerned you must have lighter then a level 6 for this to even show up!  I will also mention I have grey hair and this did not touch that either atleast, splat made it shiney purple this, not at all.  Do not buy this product expecting to just throw it on and tada purple hair you must prelighten and make sure its light!</li>
            <li> I had black and purple hair before using this. I bleached my hair twice to get the level I wanted and used 3 boxes. It&#x27;s VERY thick and I could have done better with another box or two but the color is AMAZING. It does run a lot, but I would deal with that anytime for this color. It&#x27;s so vibrant and so far has kept it&#x27;s color very well. I will keep using Ion colors mainly because of how well the color has held up. Again, the only downside is how thick it is so you&#x27;ll need to buy a bit extra or be willing to dilute it with some conditioner or even water. I didn&#x27;t dilute it but you can. LOVE this color, trying some blues next, looking forward to those results.</li>
            <li> The purple faded within a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have dyed my hair purple several times, but not for the past two years. I decided to try this brand and was horribly disappointed. I was careful in application and even left it on an extra 30 minutes. When I washed it out, it just washed out. There was nothing left on my hair. My hair is dark, but I wanted the purple to be subtle. It didn&#x27;t cover my grays at all. It looks like I did nothing. I just used the tube, no developer or anything....am I missing something?? On the plus side, it smells really nice.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t really stain skin (because it doesn&#x27;t really work)&lt;br /&gt;My bleached bangs dyed well, but they were bleached 3 times to get them light enough for it to look good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The texture is thick, paste-like, and not easily spread&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t dye my natural hair at all, no \\&quot;tint\\&quot; as it claimed it would do&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opinion:&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the Splat Lusty Lavender because it dyes over natural hair color to create a gorgeous purple tint and it comes with a mini bleach kit (if your product requires bleach to work, you should probably include it with your product or say so very boldly on the packaging)</li>
            <li> I really liked the depth of the violet color at first.  It faded much quicker than I would have hoped.  I liked that it dyed evenly without splotching; I just wish it had lasted longer.  I even used the ION color sealer, but there was no noticeable difference in longevity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely dissapointed in this dye. From what everyone says about it I thought it would be awesome. I even bleached my hair twice to a very blonde and I then used 2 bottles of the purple on ONLY the front of my hair and I kept it in for 45 minutes. I have only a couple of strands a very pale pastel purple and the rest is pretty much a dark brown which is my natural hair color. I&#x27;m so upset with the results because I was so excited to finally dye my hair purple in the first place. Don&#x27;t let this discourage you because everyone&#x27;s hair is different but this s*** doesn&#x27;t like mine lol</li>
            <li> After a horrible experience with Splat Lusty Lavender, I went and bought this brand to cover up the mess that was my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The color turned out exactly how I wanted, and I am very pleased with the result. It was simple to apply and a very good price, especially for the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again and recommend this to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;The only qualm I had with the product was that a tube did not last me very long. I have shoulderlength, yet moderately thick hair, and I ended up using three tubes. But for the price, 4.49$ a box at Sally&#x27;s, it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE COLOR!!! Lightening fast shipping and never got the colors messed up EVER!</li>
            <li> I tried it twice and there was no color Extremely not satisfied!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t mix this dye with developer so if you&#x27;re trying tof dye long hair you should get 2. For hair as long as mine I would recommend like 3 or 4. I ran out of dye with only a very small section done. And had to improvise with another color. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The only thing this ended up coloring was my bathtub, followed instructions and it left absolutely no color in my blond hair, no change at all! I bought two of these what a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I used magenta a couple months ago and it was very vibrant however for whatever reason it didn&#x27;t take to my roots very well. The dye smells like acetone mixed with a floral bath and body works perfume. don&#x27;t buy it from amazon though you can get it for less than $5 at Sally&#x27;s with the beauty club card</li>
            <li> This was the first purple I used in my journey to purple hair. I bleached my hair a pale blonew and diluted the product with conditioner until it was a nice lavender. The color took very well and gave me a delicate pale purple that i loved! I decided after sometime to apply it straight out of the tube and go darker. That too came out brilliant, however after extended reapplication the dye stopped working. It wouldn&#x27;t take much to my confusion. Up until that point it had been the only dye I ever used and had to find different alternatives to making my hair purple. Had it continued to work I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I received my product quick (3days I think) product was exactly what I ordered and in great condition! I tested out just a strip of hair,I have darker brown hair so figured it wouldn&#x27;t really Pop unless I lighten first. I mixed it with a little conditioner to thin it out as others have said its really thick. I left it on about 45min. It looks like a very dark brown/black from far away,up close u can see more of the purple and in the sun you can notice it much more! It could be really great as is if your wanting a more subtle look, but if (like me) you want a more dramatic look deffinetly make sure you lighten first!! Other then that I love the product! Easy to wipe off surfaces, AND skin! shocking I know! Its the first product I&#x27;ve seen do that and I&#x27;ve had lots of experience with many brands, colors &amp; types of hair dyeing products! Also it has a great smell, the whole time! Other products smell OK at first or have a hint of a fruit smell mixed with the strong chemical smell, but this is nothing like the norm. It isn&#x27;t overwhelming, or eye burning, you don&#x27;t have to open a window, or fear you just killed half of your brain cells lol! It really is great. I only gave it 4 ⭐ until I&#x27;m able to see the full outcome of the dye, once I lighten my hair &amp; can spend more time &amp; effort on it!!</li>
            <li> Love the color but it only lasted till the next wash. Wish I could find a good permanent hair color in this shade.</li>
            <li> Used purple once and turned my hair grey. Left in for 40 mins and used heat. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hey all.  I am always up for a pretty shade of purple, so when I saw the ION brights purple I was excited.  I like the other colors they have, so I gave it a shot.  I processed it for longer after bleaching the hair I wanted dyed. I have naturally black hair, so I wanted some streaks of purple around my black.  Let me just say that the color was very dark, and hardly noticeable in the light, either.  I washed my hair a few times in the next two weeks and it did get lighter and more noticeable, but it also had spots where it came out completely and you could see my bleached hair underneath.  Not cool.  I used the ION conditioner after doing my&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll stick with special effects for now.  Maybe if the product improves I might try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I really like the consistency of the dye, it was really easy to apply, and it smells nice.  It also doesn&#x27;t drip everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Is very dark at first, then fades too fast, leaving splotchy bleached purply hair.</li>
            <li> I dyed over already blue fading hair. Turned out more of a dark blue/purple than just dark purple but still very pretty and color is holding fast! Thank you!</li>
