            <li>the skin clean without scratching.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I will repurchase this product in the full size once I&#x27;m out of the travel size.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t see paying full retail price,</li>
            <li>This is a most unusual product</li>
            <li>Only place I could find in the travel size &amp; price was fair.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, comes in a white powder form, and gently exfoliates the skin.</li>
            <li>The dust particles from cars can accumulate quickly on the face.&lt;br /&gt;The microfoliant powder scrubs</li>

            <li>The price is right and it arrived very fast!</li>
            <li>Best kept secret.  </li>
            <li>99.8% of scrubs ALWAYS irritate my skin and make it more red, more dry, and wind up givibg me more breakouts.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast shipping, I really needed this product :]</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use it everyday but every 3rd day I use it and that is perfect.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>

            <li>This is exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It definitely made it smoother and feel like it&#x27;s better prepped for either makeup or night cream...</li>

            <li>At first it doesn&#x27;t feel like its exfoliating my skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>yet I have found that I truly love it and it has made a big difference in the appearance and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Good Lord this was so small</li>
            <li>So i&#x27;m not a fan of those scrubs that use huge apricot granules or similar.  </li>
            <li>However i found my skin felt very tried out</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Since I travel a lot this size bottle is really convenient.  </li>
            <li>But once I wash it off and I can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>microbeads (which many other scrubs contain)</li>
            <li>This stuff makes your skin feel clean and terrific!</li>
            <li>It is a good price/quantity if an individual just wants to try it for a little while to see if they like it.</li>
            <li>Totally unexpected and def appreciated!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel better, is has a little glow and my skin seems a little more youthful after using it.</li>
            <li>I suffer from adult acne and this stuff really does the trick.</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying the full-size dermalogica daily microfoliant, and transferring a small amount into a good travel-size container.</li>
            <li>This container is somewhat messy, and the travel-size bottle costs more per oz than the full-size.</li>
            <li>I have combination oily to normal skin and it does well without over drying my skin.</li>
            <li>I use it for daily exfoliation and it helps keep my skin clear and fresh looking.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since I got my first facial in November.</li>
            <li>and it was the exact same stuff as I remembered.</li>
            <li>and I can never get a full use out of the bottle no matter how careful I am to avoid any excess water getting to it.</li>
            <li>my skin is soft, firmer, less acne and fine lines are going away.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite facial exfoliation product, the beads are like soap</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft, smooth &amp; never dried out or tight afterwards.</li>
            <li>This powder does its work without stripping the skin of its natural oil.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive, oily skin that is prone to breakouts and skin reddening.</li>
            <li>However, I developed contact dermatitis in the skin around both of my eyes.</li>
            <li>Gently but deeply exfoliates skin &amp; gets dirt/makeup/oil build up out of your pores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just gentle enough for me to use once every day and not get irritated breakouts from the texture.</li>
            <li>only dried out my skin even more.  </li>
            <li>This usually does not happen with the full size dermalogica microfoliant bottle, which I have traveled with, and the lid remains clean as long as the lid is screwed on properly.   </li>
            <li>Leaves skin, clean and smooth with out it being rough or irritating.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that the packaging could be better in the travel size version.</li>
            <li>I love this small size because it lasts a LONG time</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I have used daily that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lasted so much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>will purchase again in the near future.</li>
            <li>I first found out about the product from a facial spa, and she told me that with my skin I should use it every other day.</li>
            <li>The large size is expensive and way more product than I need for those occasions when my face is extremely dry.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for anyone with combination, dry, acne prone, and/or sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> This powder does its work without stripping the skin of its natural oil.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive, oily skin that is prone to breakouts and skin reddening.</li>
            <li> However, I developed contact dermatitis in the skin around both of my eyes.</li>
            <li> Gently but deeply exfoliates skin &amp; gets dirt/makeup/oil build up out of your pores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just gentle enough for me to use once every day and not get irritated breakouts from the texture.</li>
            <li> only dried out my skin even more.  </li>
            <li> This usually does not happen with the full size dermalogica microfoliant bottle, which I have traveled with, and the lid remains clean as long as the lid is screwed on properly.   </li>
            <li> Leaves skin, clean and smooth with out it being rough or irritating.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the packaging could be better in the travel size version.</li>
            <li> I love this small size because it lasts a LONG time</li>
            <li> This is the first product that I have used daily that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasted so much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> will purchase again in the near future.</li>
            <li> I first found out about the product from a facial spa, and she told me that with my skin I should use it every other day.</li>
            <li> The large size is expensive and way more product than I need for those occasions when my face is extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for anyone with combination, dry, acne prone, and/or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> at first, it made me breakout a little, but it all cleared up after a few days.</li>
            <li> People with dryer skin may want to not leave it on as long.</li>
            <li> She informed me that instead of using proactiv which is topical to use dermalogica which is medical, because it gets rid of all the little bumps that aren&#x27;t pimples.</li>
            <li> if i used the product daily or every other day.  </li>
            <li> I have a dry skin.</li>
            <li> My friend is an esthetician and recommended this product for when my skin is dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> But, do not use it every day as recommended as it may dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> Also, if you just want the travel size of this product you normally have to purchase an entire kit which can get expensive when you&#x27;re only buying it for one product.</li>
            <li> Dermologica skin care products seem to work but they are expensive and definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Like others have said, expect the package to be about half full of product and avoid getting moisture in the bottle or it will set up and be useless.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and did notice using every other day as suggested</li>
            <li> After wiping off the powder from the bottle and lid, screwing the lid back very tightly, and shaking (mimicking traveling conditions), I found quite a bit of product gathered in the lid again.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely too harsh for daily use, or at least for my skin.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to it and it ended up giving me an intense red rash.</li>
            <li> For a month after discontinuing this wash, that skin was tight, peeling, BLEEDING, and itchy until I got a prescription to heal it.</li>
            <li> It is a powder you add a little water to a moistened face.</li>
            <li> Just need a few drops of water to make a paste and then work it into the face.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I am beauty junkie, and I usually dont do online reviews, but here it goes..</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and it works for what I need</li>
            <li> Just sprinkle a small amount in the palm of your hand, add water, and massage all over your face.</li>
            <li> so if you scrub too hard it just becomes soapy.</li>
            <li> The item is very expensive otherwise.</li>
            <li> Just wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive!!</li>

            <li> Awesome exfoliating powder. I have a dry skin. This powder does its work without stripping the skin of its natural oil.  I have used it with a facial brush. It leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I got my first facial in November. She informed me that instead of using proactiv which is topical to use dermalogica which is medical, because it gets rid of all the little bumps that aren&#x27;t pimples. It&#x27;s clogged pores, and I always wondered why proactiv didn&#x27;t work for me! Definitely a necessity. It works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, comes in a white powder form, and gently exfoliates the skin. The only complaint I have is that the packaging could be better in the travel size version. Got this in the mail with quite a bit of product in the lid, which ended up getting everywhere when I opened it. After wiping off the powder from the bottle and lid, screwing the lid back very tightly, and shaking (mimicking traveling conditions), I found quite a bit of product gathered in the lid again. This usually does not happen with the full size dermalogica microfoliant bottle, which I have traveled with, and the lid remains clean as long as the lid is screwed on properly.   I would recommend buying the full-size dermalogica daily microfoliant, and transferring a small amount into a good travel-size container. This container is somewhat messy, and the travel-size bottle costs more per oz than the full-size.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best exfoliant for city living. The dust particles from cars can accumulate quickly on the face.&lt;br /&gt;The microfoliant powder scrubs the skin clean without scratching.&lt;br /&gt;The brightened look is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I placed my order on Monday, and I received my package on Thursday! This is hands down my favorite facial exfoliation product, the beads are like soap so if you scrub too hard it just becomes soapy. Thanks for the fast shipping, I really needed this product :] Also, if you just want the travel size of this product you normally have to purchase an entire kit which can get expensive when you&#x27;re only buying it for one product. The value of this is awesome!</li>
            <li> I am beauty junkie, and I usually dont do online reviews, but here it goes.. I have sensitive, oily skin that is prone to breakouts and skin reddening. 99.8% of scrubs ALWAYS irritate my skin and make it more red, more dry, and wind up givibg me more breakouts. I know Dermalogica is a good brand, so I decided to try this scrub from them and all I can say is WOW. It does irritate my skin at all and leaves it perfectly smooth and soft (without being oily) making it perfect for make-up application. at first, it made me breakout a little, but it all cleared up after a few days. Another thing that was great was that I got a few days after ordering it and the free shipping was a bonus.. but overall great, easy problem free service. Overall, I love this product and would purchase it again from this seller.</li>
            <li> Been using Dermalogica products for years and the only problem with this microfoliant is that it absorbs moisture and I can never get a full use out of the bottle no matter how careful I am to avoid any excess water getting to it.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I thought it would be. It makes my skin feel better, is has a little glow and my skin seems a little more youthful after using it. I can&#x27;t use it everyday but every 3rd day I use it and that is perfect. It is a good price/quantity if an individual just wants to try it for a little while to see if they like it.</li>
            <li> Has a very mild smell and feel.  Just need a few drops of water to make a paste and then work it into the face.  I like to use a rubber face cloth that I purchased from Aveda.  Dermologica skin care products seem to work but they are expensive and definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product so far but the best part was I was sent EXTRA travel size products like the hydro boost and multivitamin mask! Would def purchase this again</li>
            <li> Great!  I use it for daily exfoliation and it helps keep my skin clear and fresh looking.</li>
            <li> Very great seller, Love this product!!!! Awesome!! Will buy from again. This item leaves your skin silky smooth. I first found out about the product from a facial spa, and she told me that with my skin I should use it every other day. Works great!</li>
            <li> this is a great product and ladies if  you want to make sure you get your face clean ...buy it and use it.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely too harsh for daily use, or at least for my skin.  Product smells nice and leaves skin feeling very clean and smooth at first.  However i found my skin felt very tried out if i used the product daily or every other day.  Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Leaves skin, clean and smooth with out it being rough or irritating. I have used a lot of dermal office products and this is one of my favs.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my skin feel after taking off makeup with my cream cleanser. It definitely made it smoother and feel like it&#x27;s better prepped for either makeup or night cream... will be buying the larger version. Just wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive!!</li>
            <li> My esthetician gave me a sample of this product and I instantly fell in love. I suffer from adult acne and this stuff really does the trick. I only need to use it once a week.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the travel size of this awesome product. It is a powder you add a little water to a moistened face. Leaves your skin glowing and smooth. Great for exfoliating,  even better as not a liquid for travel ;-)</li>
            <li> Flawless skin, super smooth.  Best kept secret.  Can use daily.</li>
            <li> Amazing products and company!!!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend needed something to increase moisture on her face to prevent drying this product does just that I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> My friend is an esthetician and recommended this product for when my skin is dry and flaky. The large size is expensive and way more product than I need for those occasions when my face is extremely dry. This size is perfect and ideal for those rare occasions and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to use everyday. Leaves skin clean and soft&lt;br /&gt;Dermalogica is a great brand and has fantastic skin products.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Devoted fan!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It brightens my skin.  Have been using for four months and can tell the difference when I go for a week without using.</li>
            <li> I love this small size because it lasts a LONG time and I travel a lot so it is so easy to throw in my suitcase. This stuff makes your skin feel clean and terrific!</li>
            <li> the best face wash product I have ever used</li>
            <li> Have been using travel size every night for 2 months and still have plenty left.  After a month of using this (nightly) and the acne/clear skin wash (am and pm) my skin is soft, firmer, less acne and fine lines are going away.  (I am 29).</li>
            <li> Love it. Have used it for years</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and it works for what I need but I can&#x27;t see paying full retail price, so I figured why not try here and it was the exact same stuff as I remembered. Very prompt delivery and fair price. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I love this scrub as it leaves my son feeling so fresh and clean. Plus it is rice based so doesn&#x27;t contain any harmful to the environment microbeads (which many other scrubs contain)</li>
            <li> Great price to sample product or use for travel. It&#x27;s lasted so much longer than I expected. Like weeks longer! A little goes a long way! The product itself is fabulous. Works great and is gentle enough to use daily.</li>
            <li> This stuff works,  I will admit that. My skin looked brighter and smoother after using this product. However, I developed contact dermatitis in the skin around both of my eyes. For a month after discontinuing this wash, that skin was tight, peeling, BLEEDING, and itchy until I got a prescription to heal it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I like it very much. It&#x27; s gentle and after using the skin is perfect.</li>
            <li> Love this, and it was a great size for travel.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Gently but deeply exfoliates skin &amp; gets dirt/makeup/oil build up out of your pores. Skin feels soft, smooth &amp; never dried out or tight afterwards. I think the salicylic acid also helps keep breakouts from happening. I use every morning in the shower &amp; all you need is a tiny amount of powder.  The bottle will last about 2months.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it everyday. I have very sensitive skin and this leaves my skin feeling great!  I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this once before from my sister and thought it was nice, but I decided to give it a true go and test it for my skin. Been using it over a week and I can say I love it! It&#x27;s just gentle enough for me to use once every day and not get irritated breakouts from the texture. I&#x27;m pretty sure I will repurchase this product in the full size once I&#x27;m out of the travel size. Would definitely recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I got acne after using it</li>
            <li> Nice for travel. I love this product and don&#x27;t like to be without it.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty mild exfoliant but makes my face feel so clean and fresh.  I use daily in the mornings and I just love how it makes my skin feel and look.</li>
            <li> Best product for acne. Why i gave it 4 stars is because you cannot see through the bottle to know what quantity is left so you can order another one. The bottle has a lot of weight which will make you thinks you still have enough quantity left. Please manufacturer it would be so good if this bottle is made to be transparent. I recommend this product to everyone one though.</li>
            <li> I use this microfoliant on my face every day.  It makes my skin really smooth and soft.  Since I travel a lot this size bottle is really convenient.  This is a great product and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. So i&#x27;m not a fan of those scrubs that use huge apricot granules or similar.  I already have the larger size microfoliant. I wanted this one for travel, so I can continue my beauty routine on the road. Its a great size and a very good price. At first it doesn&#x27;t feel like its exfoliating my skin. But once I wash it off and I can really tell the difference. It leaves my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Bought this to put in my bridesmaids&#x27; gift bag.  They loved that it was a perfect travel size and they loved the product as well!</li>
            <li> I am a Esthetician and I use this product for sensitive skin and acne skin, beautiful product, great size for traveling</li>
            <li> A great product- leaves skin smooth and extremely clean.  I have very dry skin and did notice using every other day as suggested only dried out my skin even more.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> The item was just as decribed and it arrived on time.  Very useful purchase.  The item is very expensive otherwise.</li>
            <li> Really great for cleansing the face.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the bonus items. Totally unexpected and def appreciated!</li>
            <li> This is a most unusual product yet I have found that I truly love it and it has made a big difference in the appearance and texture of my skin. Imagine a powder with the scent of Ivory soap and the texture of powdered laundry detergent and that is this product. Just sprinkle a small amount in the palm of your hand, add water, and massage all over your face. You might need to add a bit more water to your face once it is on to get it to suds up and spread evenly. The longer you leave it on the better it seems to work. I let it sit on there until it drys like a mask and then I rinse it off. It leaves my face feeling soft and smooth. I probably use it a couple times a week. I have combination oily to normal skin and it does well without over drying my skin. People with dryer skin may want to not leave it on as long. Like others have said, expect the package to be about half full of product and avoid getting moisture in the bottle or it will set up and be useless. I would not recommend using this in the shower for that reason.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m the only person this didn&#x27;t work on. I had a bad reaction to it and it ended up giving me an intense red rash.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth the money.  This is the first product that I have used daily that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  Love it!</li>
            <li> works great! good price ...and great for traveling size. will purchase again in the near future. love how smooth it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> Only place I could find in the travel size &amp; price was fair. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for anyone with combination, dry, acne prone, and/or sensitive skin. But, do not use it every day as recommended as it may dry your skin out. Use it once or twice a week instead. Great product!</li>
            <li> This products is superb!  The price is excellent.  Try buying this at Sephoria or Ulta or any spa shop, you&#x27;ll pay a fortune! The price is right and it arrived very fast!</li>
            <li> Good Lord this was so small I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  Great stuff, but Image products are way better for the money.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser! I buy the regular size all the time but needed a travel size.</li>
