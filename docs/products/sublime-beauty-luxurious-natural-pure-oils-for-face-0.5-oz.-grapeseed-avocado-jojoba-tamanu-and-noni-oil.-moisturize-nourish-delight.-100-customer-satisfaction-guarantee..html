            <li> All skin needs extra attention, particularly after a winter of being caged in by socks, shoes, long sleeves, and tights, and the exposure to extremes of temperatures.  </li>
            <li> Recently, I added Sublime Beauty Luxurious Natural Pure Oils to the other Sublime Beauty products I use for daily and weekly skin care.  </li>

            <li> this facial oil only contains the 6 different oils and no other additives.</li>
            <li> It really penetrates deep down and nourishes my skin.</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is that occasionally too much product comes out of the dispenser.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually been using this oil on my hands because they tend to get really dry.</li>
            <li> The lines around my eyes are less noticeable and my skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> I also use a tiny bit on my nails and cuticles as I have a thyroid condition that makes my nails dry.</li>
            <li> The biggest surprise was when I started to use it on my keratosis pilaris, commonly dubbed &amp;#34;KP&amp;#34;, (the rough, sugar granule-like bumps) on the backs of my arms and thighs, since I switched from argan, dry oil, lotions, etc, to the pure oil mixture, the bumps are almost gone.</li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;ve removed nail polish and &amp;#34;scrub my nails&amp;#34; my nails are dry and somewhat brittle.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product because my face tends to be dry at times.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face if I have any dry areas.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I purchased the full size.</li>
            <li> It did absorb well, but I was left with a slight oil sheen.</li>
            <li> The only thing I found odd was the smell.</li>
            <li> I switched from plain Squalane or Argan oil to this as my last application.</li>
            <li> I also rubbed what was left over on my fingers throughout the ends of my hair after being stuck somewhere without products to help with my frizzies and it helped tame them.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Takes only a small amount and my skin is radiant.  </li>
            <li> I was looking forward to seeing what these other oils would do on my skin.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount to use on your face and neck.  </li>
            <li> The pump is sorta hard to pump which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> I like to use this facial oil at least 2 nights a week</li>
            <li> I use it every other day since the moisture lasts!</li>

            <li> The product at 1st seems like your going to be rubbing vegetable oil on your face but once you apply it it&#x27;s absorbed into your skin.  It leaves your skin soft and smooth. The pump is sorta hard to pump which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Product is great</li>
            <li> I love this product! It make my skin feel so soft and supple. The oils are all natural and its just and amazing product! I use a small dab under my makeup and it absorbs great. At night I use a lot more!!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for anyone with sensitive skin, such as myself. I do not wear makeup, but a few drops of this oil preparation makes my face feel nourished and even textured. I carry it in my purse and apply it during the day to give my face a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Sublime Beauty is the only skin care I use.  I put this on my face after washing my skin at night (with Sublime cleanser) and putting my serums and anti aging lotions on.  Makes the perfect finish.  Takes only a small amount and my skin is radiant.  In the morning I can still see it and feel how vibrant and soft my skin looks.  This is a must have in my regimen!  I am never without.  I would encourage any man or women to look into all of the Sublime products.  I talk about this line alot but only when people comment on my skin and ask me what I do for it.  When something works you like to tell people.</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discounted price in exchange of an honest and unbiased review and at first I was skeptical of using oils in my face as I have oily skin but this immediately became one of my favorite products to use. Amazingly my skin does not have an oily feeling after I use it. It just feels really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Non greasy, makes my skin look great!</li>
            <li> I really like this facial oil and I am totally surprised by that because I have naturally oily skin. I thought for sure that I would use this and end up with all kinds of breakouts. That was not the case at all. I absolutely love the Sublime Beauty line and I have had great success with their products. I wasn&#x27;t sure about using this oil, but I trust this company, so I was happy to be able to try this for my honest review. I like that this facial oil only contains the 6 different oils and no other additives. I have used Jojoba and Tamanu oils before on my face and I liked the way my face looked and felt, so I was looking forward to seeing what these other oils would do on my skin. I did not have to use much of this facial oil to cover my entire face. It did absorb well, but I was left with a slight oil sheen. I thought that this might happen due to my skin being oily anyway, so I made sure to use this on a day that I wasn&#x27;t going anywhere. I have since decided to use this at night though, so it doesn&#x27;t matter if my skin looks oily. What amazed me about this facial oil, was how young, healthy and hydrated my skin looked. I had a couple of acne spots and this facial oil actually helped heal them, which is the opposite of what I had thought it would do. I like to use this facial oil at least 2 nights a week and I love the results that I have seen so far.</li>
            <li> This is a light thin oil that absorbs quickly and leaves skin silky soft</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have only been using a short time and it leaves your face silky smooth. There is no greasy feeling and I apply my foundation afterwards with no caking. It also smooths out some of my wrinkles on the jaw line, making them look less noticeable. I am really happy with this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is really a luxurious oil. I use it morning and night, and see huge improvement in the texture of my skin. It makes my skin so smooth, soft, glowing and hydrated. The scent is very pleasant, and absorbs fast in the skin. It would recommend for anybody to try.</li>
            <li> This facial oil is wonderful! It makes my skin look super healthy and adds a special glow. It really penetrates deep down and nourishes my skin. Thank you Sublime Beauty for creating such good products!</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.  If I just want to achieve a bit of a glow, without makeup, this does the trick.  I also use this oil on my fingernails and cuticles.  Once I&#x27;ve removed nail polish and &amp;#34;scrub my nails&amp;#34; my nails are dry and somewhat brittle.  I&#x27;ll take a miniscule amount of this oil and rub into each nail and cuticle.  My nails obtain a nice sheen.  I&#x27;ll rub any excess into my hands it absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because my face tends to be dry at times. Unfortunately it seems like I have a acne breakout after every time I use it. If you are acne prone I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. So I have mixed feelings because it does go on smooth and you don&#x27;t feel oily but not for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I love the combination of oils in this product and the pump makes applying it easy. You don&#x27;t risk contaminating the product by putting your fingers in the oil. My face felt great after putting it on. It did not leave a messy residue. The only thing I found odd was the smell. It did not smell rancid but it was not exactly appealing either. My face does feel softer.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually been using this oil on my hands because they tend to get really dry. It leaves my skin feeling really soft, but not oily at all. You don&#x27;t need to use much because a small dab really goes a long way.There&#x27;s no odor to it which is good for people who have issues with scented products. I love that it is 100% organic and has no harsh chemicals. Definitely happy to have this for my hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my genuine and honest review.</li>
            <li> This oil has a very nice feel, it absorbs quickly and has no odor.  I use this twice daily on my neck and my nails and cuticles.  I use it on my face if I have any dry areas.  The only complaint that I have is that occasionally too much product comes out of the dispenser.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use nutrient or special oils as my &amp;#34;sealant&amp;#34;. I switched from plain Squalane or Argan oil to this as my last application. Every night a thin layer on my face after my serums, eye and face creams to keep the moisture and nutrients in. The biggest surprise was when I started to use it on my keratosis pilaris, commonly dubbed &amp;#34;KP&amp;#34;, (the rough, sugar granule-like bumps) on the backs of my arms and thighs, since I switched from argan, dry oil, lotions, etc, to the pure oil mixture, the bumps are almost gone. I&#x27;m going through it really quickly because of the use on my arms and thighs, but it&#x27;s worth it! Nice silky and smooth skin and extra overnight moisture on my face - This is a must have for me now.</li>
            <li> Anti-Aging Defense with Antioxidants, vitamins and minerals Too, My skin is Loving this really loving this stuff.  The oils really do soak in quickly, I was pleasantly surprised.  Usually for me at least, oils cause me to break out.  Grapeseed, Avocoda, Jojoba, Macadamia, tamanu, and Noni, are the  6 pure natural oils works great.  Feels great, no sticky or greasy feeling.  Great nourishment for the skin.  Amazon Disclaimer, This is my own honest and unbiased review of product.</li>
            <li> I love how this oil makes my skin feel!!  The lines around my eyes are less noticeable and my skin feels so soft.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Love this. I use it every other day since the moisture lasts! My skin feels so lovely</li>
            <li> I mix mine with a face lotion so it will not be so oily.  It works great!  I will reorder.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use. You only need a small amount to use on your face and neck.  Keeps your skin moisturized all day:)</li>
            <li> Sublime Beauty ALL Natural Pure OILS for face and hands is an excellent product; it has made my face feeling extremely soft and smooth. My face was lacking the proper oils and felt dry to the point where you could see it and Sublime Beauty has made my face feel wonderful all day long. Just by putting a few drops on my fingertips each day onto my face has made a different; I would have to say I love this product. It came in a nice little bottle easy for my purse. It came in a beautiful net wrapping tied in a bow. I would recommend this product for personal use as well as a gift that you wont regret.</li>
            <li> Sublime Beauty ALL NATURAL PURE OILS for Face and Hands works wonders. Plus smells fantastic. I love how its  ALL-NATURAL and ORGANIC!!! Your skin will feel fabulous and look stunning after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil for my hands. I&#x27;ve tried the facial oil sample on my hands at night especially rubbing into my cuticles. Neglecting my hands, they were becoming very dry adding years to my age. In about 2-3 weeks, I was waking up with hydrated, soft hands that added youthfulness to my look. Needless to say, I purchased the full size. It&#x27;s true if your face doesn&#x27;t give your age away your hands usually will.  Thank you so much Sublime. Your products are a step or two above the rest! Your forever customer.</li>
            <li> Sublime luxurious facial oil says it all! Just one or two drops  of these pure oils on my face and neck makes my skin feel like silk without feeling greasy. I also use a tiny bit on my nails and cuticles as I have a thyroid condition that makes my nails dry. I am so happy that I purchased this product it made a believer out of me.</li>
            <li> I am in love with how my skin feels using this.  A+</li>
            <li> I love how smooth this has made my skin feel in just the short amount of time using it. I also rubbed what was left over on my fingers throughout the ends of my hair after being stuck somewhere without products to help with my frizzies and it helped tame them. Would have to try it on my hair more often to see if I&#x27;d get double benefits from this product. Will recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Feels Smooth and Velvety</li>
            <li> This oil is very absorbing and does not leave an oily feeling on your face.  Really softens the skin.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly light. Blends in very fast and leaves very soft but no oily feel. Rub any extra into hair to smooth flyaways. Received product at discount for review.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about two weeks and I can already see a difference.  I use this everynight in place of my moisturizer. It takes about 10 minutes or so to soak into the skin. In the morning my face feels like baby skin !  I love this product. The only negative thing I can say is I wished that it smelled better.  The smell didn&#x27;t linger so it isn&#x27;t a problem but I wish it had a  more pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> Recently, I added Sublime Beauty Luxurious Natural Pure Oils to the other Sublime Beauty products I use for daily and weekly skin care.  Where do I use it?  Heels and toes, elbows, and the areas our dermatologist refers to as &amp;#34;barnacles,&amp;#34;  those rough small patches that accrue to the skin as ones gains life experience.  All skin needs extra attention, particularly after a winter of being caged in by socks, shoes, long sleeves, and tights, and the exposure to extremes of temperatures.  A small application after the bath or shower works wonders on these extra-dry area, making  the skin soft once more.</li>
            <li> i really really like this!!! i was skeptical, but it doesn&#x27;t make my face oily. my skin is sooooo soft. my husband said it felt awesome. really great product</li>
