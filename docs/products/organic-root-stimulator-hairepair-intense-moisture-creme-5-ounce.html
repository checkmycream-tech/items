            <li>a nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked forever to find a suitable moisturizer to help with my hair and</li>
            <li>The smell is really good and sweet</li>
            <li>Love it .</li>
            <li>but after sampling the anti breakage creme from this line (I love this item), I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li>I also love the buttery/melt in your mouth chocolate texture of this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s looks glossy and feels healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>I just LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Organic Root Stimulator Line.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Her braids looks better if I wash her hair then use this.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>at this time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing more of this.</li>
            <li>First off this creme smells so good.</li>
            <li>If it was super moisturizing and amazing, then I could</li>
            <li>first, I thought I would need to buy another jar of this to alternate with the anti-breakage cream, but that works out excellent on its own for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very rich and full of oils that actually penetrate the hair shaft, And it smells delicious !</li>
            <li>but I can this product for me lasting about four months or more and again for $5 that is a great steal.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I struggle styling her hair because it gets frizzy easily.</li>
            <li>This stuff can easily keep my hair moisturized for about four days</li>
            <li>My hair is soo strong now</li>
            <li>smells pretty nice too.  </li>
            <li>just fine</li>
            <li>cheap easy fix.</li>
            <li>This cream smells good but very loud.</li>
            <li>Available at your local kmart for just over $5.00 Smells like candy, great for curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>this stuff smells good, is not heavy on my hair.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure --</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a candy, sweet smell that is cloying and obnoxious after a while.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff soo much</li>
            <li>now I have a new favorite.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>The root simulator product seems to calm her itching as well.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes my hair still gets a bit frizzy, but just some extra brushing (without applying any more product) makes it smooth and silky again.  </li>
            <li>So, I would say it&#x27;s a great product in general, especially for anyone with permed hair, or if you use alot of heat when styling.</li>
            <li>i knew exactly what was going on.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s only okay.</li>
            <li>I use it after styling and it leaves it feeling soft and light weight.</li>
            <li>I love this product couldn&#x27;t find it in stores and finally found on amazon.</li>
            <li>The smell was something I&#x27;d expect from a Lush product, very fresh and organic smelling...</li>
            <li>loved this product and used it until i was literally scraping the last bit out the jar to moisturize and seal (i only use organic coconut oil).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not changing my rating, because it did EXACTLY what it is supposed to do: provide intense moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I most certainly plan to keep this item apart of my hair care for the long haul.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because it is the complete package, it smells good, it has a rich thick texture and its non greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it makes and keeps my hair smooth and silky (for the whole week) until the next shampooing.</li>
            <li>But if you really want to mend the damage that processing and styling causes your hair...</li>
            <li>I have not used this much but it has the ingredients that I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product&#x60;</li>
            <li>Makes combing and brushing much easier.  </li>
            <li>When they say \\&quot;intense moisture\\</li>
            <li>When they say intense moisture, they wasn&#x27;t kidding.  </li>
            <li>and I have very porous hair.  </li>
            <li>There are some great ingredients in this cream such as coconut oil, avocado oil, green tea &amp; olive fruit oil to name a few all of which are very beneficial to maintaning healthy growing hair.</li>
            <li>Also, this product cost my $5 at walmart and my all natural products usually cost somewhere between $10-20$ so as you can see this product is a steal monetary wise.</li>
            <li>already like the olive oil lotion this company makes, but given the price point, it wasn&#x27;t high on my list since its wasn&#x27;t really \\&quot;special\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is very dry, and it breaks easily.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and leaves it feeling silky</li>
            <li>this tops anything I&#x27;ve used purchased from my local BSS about a week ago and fell in love instantly</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Strangely enough, my hair was still very moisturized from this product, as it felt the way it did when I had first used it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light weight doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and keep my hair and ends moisturized very well.</li>
            <li>The consistency is super rich and thick but absorbs well into my hair strands.</li>
            <li>So I do a deep conditioner, roller set and light flat iron on Saturday and then from Tuesday to Saturday</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed the difference using this after shampooing and at night, especially in the hot TX summer.  </li>
            <li>I applied to scalp bcuz I have braids and its good.so far.</li>
            <li>however, makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Totally recommend!r soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>product kept my hair soft and managable and also kept my ends from breaking.</li>
            <li>So with that said, I am jumping off the all natural bandwagon.</li>
            <li>I use this on my hair as well as my 7 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>whether i&#x27;m going naturally curly or straightening.  </li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:604cdf70aaa633db42ed6735a2b85a2d]]My almost 3 year old has Eczema.</li>
            <li>B00634THEM Organic Root Stimulator Hairepair Vital Oils for Hair and Scalp, 4.3 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any product build up issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to slick my hair back with no problem.</li>
            <li>hair is back to normal.</li>
            <li>I use to be one of those all people who only bought all natural products for my all natural hair (5B/apl)</li>
            <li>It may work well for a hair dress and moisturize the hair, if your hair is not excessively dry and thirsty like mine.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the entire line of ORS hairepair products if you have dry and/or curly hair.</li>
            <li>I hardly make reviews, except it&#x27;s extraordinary.</li>
            <li>this stuff moisturizes fine, not great,</li>
            <li>However, between having very dry, natural 4b/4c hair and living in Arizona..this didn&#x27;t provide enough moisture for me, but it did help with detangling and temp moisture.</li>

            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s so dry that I only wash it once a week, and I have to apply leave-in conditioner daily to keep in controlled.</li>
            <li> I was visiting Nashville,TN and because of the heat and humidity it was becoming difficult to manage my relaxed, flat ironed hair.</li>
            <li> I actually really really like (not love) but realllllly like this product.</li>
            <li> and everybody (especially with dry hair issues)</li>
            <li> I have this natural dried hair but when i used this product, it didn&#x27;t only soften my hair, it improved the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> I received two sample packs of this creme and not too long ago, applied it to my hair.  </li>
            <li> Still my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin &amp; scalp</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry and frizzy hair, which is gray and color-treated.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s dry and prone to breakage</li>
            <li> i would definaatly recommend it to anybody with dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It did not live up to product claims.</li>
            <li> Less greasy than your standard coconut oil.</li>
            <li> My scalp is very dry and this oil does wonders for my hair.  </li>
            <li> On one side, I put shea moisture leave in conditioner for dry and damaged hair and then on the other side I put this product.</li>
            <li> It made her hair somewhat wavy which is hard to do after the Exederm strips the natural</li>
            <li> So I decided to pull my hair back but didn&#x27;t want to use a harsh gel.</li>
            <li> Within the next 3 to 4 weeks I would go to the hair salon for my regular service but what I noticed week after week was how thick my hair was getting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this item along with the other companion items from the ORS HAIRepair line. First off this creme smells so good. The consistency is super rich and thick but absorbs well into my hair strands. This creme doesnt feel heavy or weigh my hair down. There are some great ingredients in this cream such as coconut oil, avocado oil, green tea &amp; olive fruit oil to name a few all of which are very beneficial to maintaning healthy growing hair. Another hit and a repurchase for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very rich and full of oils that actually penetrate the hair shaft, And it smells delicious ! A must buy for relaxed and naturals !</li>
            <li> I have this natural dried hair but when i used this product, it didn&#x27;t only soften my hair, it improved the texture of my hair. I hardly make reviews, except it&#x27;s extraordinary.</li>
            <li> Just purchased 3/11/12 I applied to scalp bcuz I have braids and its good.so far. I&#x27;ll try this until finished</li>
            <li> UPDATE: Just a heads up- if you are likely to suffer from moisture overload- be VERY careful with this product. I&#x27;m not changing my rating, because it did EXACTLY what it is supposed to do: provide intense moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product and used it until i was literally scraping the last bit out the jar to moisturize and seal (i only use organic coconut oil). One day when i tried to roller set, my rollers would droop (NEVER happened before, and i had to re-roll several times. When i got to the front, my hair started stretching and then just popped. I squeezed my hair, and it felt rather mushy. Watching a few hair videos in the past and reading some hair forums- i knew exactly what was going on. 3 hard protein treatments later- hair is back to normal. Strangely enough, my hair was still very moisturized from this product, as it felt the way it did when I had first used it. However, it was balanced this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This helped me in a sense because I had no idea that i was \\&quot;moisture sensitive\\&quot; (if there is such a term), and that my hair loves protein (its very hard to protein overload with my hair- even using an egg doesn&#x27;t over-harden my hair). So i now use the anti-breakage cream, which gives me enough moisture, and gives me the strength I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I thought I would need to buy another jar of this to alternate with the anti-breakage cream, but that works out excellent on its own for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just posting this so others can take it into consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got 2 sample packs of this from the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fist of all, the smell....omg like heaven. It wasn&#x27;t overpowering, but i felt like I didn&#x27;t need perfume, either. The smell was something I&#x27;d expect from a Lush product, very fresh and organic smelling...if that&#x27;s possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already like the olive oil lotion this company makes, but given the price point, it wasn&#x27;t high on my list since its wasn&#x27;t really \\&quot;special\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS however, makes my hair soft and manageable. This is the moisturizing creme, but my breakage was cut down to almost nothing in 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend!r soft and manageable. This is the moisturizing creme, but my breakage was cut down to almost nothing in 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend!</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this product on vacation. I was visiting Nashville,TN and because of the heat and humidity it was becoming difficult to manage my relaxed, flat ironed hair. So I decided to pull my hair back but didn&#x27;t want to use a harsh gel. So I was at Walmart whenI saw this product..I liked that it was a creme and that it had a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was able to slick my hair back with no problem. So I brought the product back home with me and continued to use it. I work out 5-6 Days a week and struggle with managing my hair because of sweat. So I do a deep conditioner, roller set and light flat iron on Saturday and then from Tuesday to Saturday I wear my hair pulled back because I do a cardio workout 4-5 days a week. Everytime I pulled my hair back I would use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product kept my hair soft and managable and also kept my ends from breaking. Within the next 3 to 4 weeks I would go to the hair salon for my regular service but what I noticed week after week was how thick my hair was getting. Even with new-growth my hair is thicker, softer and manageable with minimum breakage. No product had ever achieved this with my hair. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not light weight and can weigh your hair down a bit but if you don&#x27;t mind ...a dab with do.  But if you really want to mend the damage that processing and styling causes your hair...this product is it! It does what it says...it repairs the hair!</li>
            <li> leave her nice texture</li>
            <li> Love it . Great moisturizer</li>
            <li> I have not used this much but it has the ingredients that I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing. I use it at night to help moisturize my hair. You could use it as a serum in the day as well. Less greasy than your standard coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Where to begin. I would rate this product 4.5 stars but that option isn&#x27;t given. I actually really really like (not love) but realllllly like this product. I use to be one of those all people who only bought all natural products for my all natural hair (5B/apl) but after sampling the anti breakage creme from this line (I love this item), I decided to give this product a try. Now, I tested this product for a week and I wore my hair in two braids. On one side, I put shea moisture leave in conditioner for dry and damaged hair and then on the other side I put this product. I usually put moisturize my hair twice a day. Once in the morning and once in the evening, at each session, I would ask my husband if he could feel a difference in the texture or moisture of my hair. He couldn&#x27;t and I couldn&#x27;t. So with that said, I am jumping off the all natural bandwagon. I still plan to buy but not being a junkie about it. Also, this product cost my $5 at walmart and my all natural products usually cost somewhere between $10-20$ so as you can see this product is a steal monetary wise. I also love the buttery/melt in your mouth chocolate texture of this product. OMG...it feels so good. It does not feel greasy. It has a great smell and I don&#x27;t use a lot but I can this product for me lasting about four months or more and again for $5 that is a great steal. I most certainly plan to keep this item apart of my hair care for the long haul. Oh, my only downfall is that this product contains mineral oil...I am little worry about how this will affect my hair over an extended time. We&#x27;ll see. I will def recommend this product.  UPDATE. I DO NOT KNOW HOW I MISSED THAT THIS PRODUCT HAS PETROLEUM IN IT. I RECENTLY RELAXED MY HAIR AND dont use a sulfate shampoo often. My hair has bern very very dry lately so i increase from using a dime soze to quarter size. Still my hair is dry. So just looking at the jar, i flip snd saw petroleum is the second ingredient. Will not be using anymore.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair moisturized, healthy and happy. I have dry skin &amp; scalp and this has my scalp moisturized for days, up to a week, unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried in the past. I usually buy this at my local cvs or Walmart but for the past two months or so they haven&#x27;t had these on their shelves and when I saw it on here I was delighted. I will definitely be buying the twin or three pack next time I order. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I brought this product and me and my daughter both tried it. I have curly hair and she has relaxed. The smell is really good and sweet ( it smells like bananas- not coconut - I hate coconut so that was a plus). Our results were that, it made my hair well moisturized but turned my curls into a baby fro, my daughter on the other hand loves it. So, I would say it&#x27;s a great product in general, especially for anyone with permed hair, or if you use alot of heat when styling.</li>
            <li> My scalp is very dry and this oil does wonders for my hair.  It&#x27;s looks glossy and feels healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this.  I let my hair air dry and I&#x27;ve noticed the difference using this after shampooing and at night, especially in the hot TX summer.  My hair is softer without being greasy.  Very little buildup.  I highly recommend the entire line of ORS hairepair products if you have dry and/or curly hair.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure -- this stuff moisturizes fine, not great, just fine BUT I cannot get past the smell. It&#x27;s a candy, sweet smell that is cloying and obnoxious after a while. I just can&#x27;t get past it. If it was super moisturizing and amazing, then I could but it&#x27;s only okay.</li>
            <li> Since using the ors hair repair , I have 98% less hair breakage!  My hair is soo strong now I could probably hang off a tall building by my hair and I won&#x27;t lose a strand.  I love this stuff soo much I ordered a second jar because I could not find it at any of the local beauty supply stores like Sally&#x27;s or cvs,Walgreens or Kmart .  I previously used the olive oil hair creme for years,  now I have a new favorite.  I just LOVE it. I wish that it came in a larger jar.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it is the complete package, it smells good, it has a rich thick texture and its non greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to any and everybody (especially with dry hair issues)</li>
            <li> works great I use this on my hair as well as my 7 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> Very good product, i love the smell</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. I absolutely love the Organic Root Stimulator Line. This Hairepair moisturizer is great for moisturizing and sealing every night which is how I use it. My hair is shiny and smells so good when I use it. I really recommend this product&#x60;</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry and frizzy hair, which is gray and color-treated. In fact, it&#x27;s so dry that I only wash it once a week, and I have to apply leave-in conditioner daily to keep in controlled. When I use this product after washing, I only need to apply it once and it makes and keeps my hair smooth and silky (for the whole week) until the next shampooing. Sometimes my hair still gets a bit frizzy, but just some extra brushing (without applying any more product) makes it smooth and silky again.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. It also smells delicious!</li>
            <li> I will not be reordering. It did not live up to product claims. No difference in condition of my hair</li>
            <li> This cream smells good but very loud. It may work well for a hair dress and moisturize the hair, if your hair is not excessively dry and thirsty like mine. For a short while..hmm...about an hour after I put in, my hair felt moisturized. However, between having very dry, natural 4b/4c hair and living in Arizona..this didn&#x27;t provide enough moisture for me, but it did help with detangling and temp moisture.</li>
            <li> I like the cream for my hair but it breaks my skin out.  Not sure what i might be allergic to in the product but it works great on my hair.  whether i&#x27;m going naturally curly or straightening.  Puts a nice moisturizing coat on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have short african-american hair its not damaged but Im trying to grow it out..this stuff smells good, is not heavy on my hair. I use it after styling and it leaves it feeling soft and light weight.</li>
            <li> I use it for my beard.  Makes combing and brushing much easier.  Gives the beard a nice look without any greasy sheen. NO SHEEN.  smells pretty nice too.  the downside FOR ME is it accelerates my dandruff and I have to shower and wash my whiskers daily where before I could go 2 days.</li>
            <li> Never gave a review before but I simply felt the need to rave on this product...i have apl relaxed hair that&#x27;s dry and prone to breakage I&#x27;ve looked forever to find a suitable moisturizer to help with my hair and this tops anything I&#x27;ve used purchased from my local BSS about a week ago and fell in love instantly it&#x27;s light weight doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and keep my hair and ends moisturized very well. I&#x27;ll never use anything again definitely a staple thank you ORS 🙌</li>
            <li> this product does what it claims to do i would definaatly recommend it to anybody with dry, frizzy hair. cheap easy fix.</li>
            <li> Available at your local kmart for just over $5.00 Smells like candy, great for curly, frizzy hair. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product couldn&#x27;t find it in stores and finally found on amazon. I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and leaves it feeling silky</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:604cdf70aaa633db42ed6735a2b85a2d]]My almost 3 year old has Eczema. It is challenge because the only shampoo I have found that works for her is Exederm.  The [[ASIN:B0045J3AL8 Exederm Conditioner]] does not condition her 4b/c hair but relieves her itching. Therefore, I struggle styling her hair because it gets frizzy easily. Moreover, she is a very active child which I appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;I saw this product on the shelf at a local beauty supply store for about $8. It is the same brand as the [[ASIN:B00634THEM Organic Root Stimulator Hairepair Vital Oils for Hair and Scalp, 4.3 Ounce]] I use on her scalp. The root simulator product seems to calm her itching as well.  I previously completed a review on that product because I like it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros for the Hair Repair Product:&lt;br /&gt;- I washed my daughter&#x27;s hair and conditioned it with the Exederm and applied this product. It made her hair somewhat wavy which is hard to do after the Exederm strips the natural oils.&lt;br /&gt;- It gives her hair a nice shine.&lt;br /&gt;- I like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;- It works best if I put some on her pony tails at night and use a scarf to tie her hair up.&lt;br /&gt;- Her braids looks better if I wash her hair then use this.&lt;br /&gt;- So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any product build up issues.&lt;br /&gt;- When they say \\&quot;intense moisture\\&quot; they mean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;None at this time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing more of this.</li>
            <li> I notice a difference in my hair when I use it.  My hair is very dry, and it breaks easily.  The Hairepair stops the breakage, however don&#x27;t use it for moisturizing.  I have to use something else for that. It smells great too!</li>
            <li> bought this for my husband, great smell also</li>
            <li> I want another case of this product</li>
            <li> I received two sample packs of this creme and not too long ago, applied it to my hair.  When they say intense moisture, they wasn&#x27;t kidding.  This stuff can easily keep my hair moisturized for about four days and I have very porous hair.  The only reason why it doesn&#x27;t get a five stars is because it does nothing for the breakage with my hair.  But that is why ORS created one for breakage.  For some reason this one is easier to find than the breakage creme.  The anti breakage creme is darn near impossible to find within my usual spots and they can never keep it in stock.</li>
