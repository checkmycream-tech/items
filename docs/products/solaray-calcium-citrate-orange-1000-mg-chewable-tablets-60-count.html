            <li>They taste like sweet tarts!</li>
            <li>Chewable calcium citrate is not an easy product to find, and I appreciate that this company produces it.    </li>
            <li>Easy and tasty to use.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to take.  </li>

            <li> One tablet taste fine and is &#x27;blended&#x27; well. The next one has chunks of the various ingredients in it and tastes awful. I usually have good luck with Solaray quality, but not this time. I took about 4-5 of them and threw the rest away.</li>
