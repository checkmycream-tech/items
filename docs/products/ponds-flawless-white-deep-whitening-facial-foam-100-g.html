            <li>I really love the smell.</li>
            <li>Using it along with ponds day cream and night cream from more than a year.</li>
            <li>My skin is 100 times better than it was before I started using this line of products.  </li>
            <li>but ut really does smell great</li>
            <li>I just love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but it surely works.</li>
            <li>but I just use it 2 day ago so need more time</li>
            <li>I reserve my best experiences with a product (any, from vacuum cleaners to beauty products) to share with my sister.</li>
            <li>Thanks for lightening fast delivery, great price and a very nice product.  </li>
            <li>But great product, highly recommend, and awesome that I found it here on amazon, till I go back home...</li>
            <li>It leaves your face very clean and feeling better after using.  </li>
            <li>The smell is kind of sweet creamy/milky.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>What this does and its really good at it, is it cleanses really well.</li>
            <li>It works very well when you follow up with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a very pretty, light, and effective cleanser.</li>
            <li>Best money I&#x27;ve ever spent!</li>
            <li>but i still love it because it does clean my face and take off all the dirt and makeup.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t white your skin very much but it leaves your skin very very beautiful.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised with the good reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a little while now and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>All my breakout prone areas are smooth now</li>
            <li>After using this product, your face is super clean!</li>
            <li>face looks fair after washing, might not be suitable for very dry skin during winters</li>
            <li>it bubbles into a rich and frothy lather.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now when I was using this every day I was excited because I was noticing a difference in my acne scars</li>
            <li>Clean, whiten, smell good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this cleanser is wonderful, really gets your face squeaky clean without drying it, and yes seems to help in conjunction with my other whitening products to even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it is whitening at this point, but it does clean, exfoliate, therefore giving me nice clean bright skin.</li>
            <li>First time washing my face with the cleanser, you can clearly tell how bright my face looked.</li>
            <li>this is cool but it wasn&#x27;t what I thought it was.</li>
            <li>so this product leaves my face fresh and clean...</li>
            <li>Will leave your skin clean and fresh</li>
            <li>This product arrived quicker than estimated from Siam Super thru Amazon.  </li>
            <li>As for cleansing, this is a great, easy to foam cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, cleans off my makeup and leaves me feeling soft and prepped to put on moisturizer afterward.</li>
            <li>,i purchased this for only five dollars,and this worked amazing in a week.  </li>
            <li>Well money spent and better than most of the skin cleansers.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft :) I use it every night before I go to sleep</li>
            <li>i got it under control pretty quick ...</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t mind since I always moisturize right after anyways.</li>
            <li>I left it on for about 7 minutes exactly and washed it off with warm water.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time because you dont need too much, it foams really good.</li>
            <li>I was unsure at first about this product, because as we all know \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; products rarely come through for us.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday cleansing, or when you&#x27;ve done a peel and need something gentle to deal with redness and flakes.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and like it very much.</li>
            <li>i&#x60;ve always used ponds mostly because their products seem to work pretty well for me,i&#x27;m mexican with an olive type of skin,</li>
            <li>next time i&#x27;ll make sure it comes from within the USA cause</li>
            <li>Does nothing and contains mostly the same chemicals as the retail counter/drug stores.</li>
            <li>and it is not expensive.</li>
            <li>usually use a light cleanser for my face since I don&#x27;t like the abrasive ones, the smelly ones, or the kind that makes my face feel greasy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this so far, and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>I had been seeing the commercials for this product on Thai TV and didn&#x27;t believe it, but I finally decided it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>it has few micro scrubs (that i don&#x27;t see the use) but still works good for whitening.</li>
            <li>My skin feel clean and very soft after each use.</li>
            <li>cause the dark spots are super light light brown..</li>
            <li>My face is squeaky clean afterwards but not overly dry, although I follow up with a light moisturizer in the morning and evening.</li>
            <li>I hear it&#x27;s rare to find these products in the US, but so far, I think it is worth the search.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty thrilled with this stuff, and even though I can only find it through Amazon, as previous reviews have stated it only takes a tiny bit to foam up nicely!!</li>
            <li>I would better like it if it mentioned how long it needs to change anything</li>
            <li>What I love more is, it lathers up really well on your face with small, slippery bubbles!  </li>
            <li>i have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Okay two things, first of all I really do not agree with the whitening obsession in Asia and India.</li>
            <li>I certainly hope I&#x27;m using it correctly as there were no enlish instructions on this pacakaging.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants youthful skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference, however, my friends and coworkers have made comments of me getting lighter.</li>
            <li>it foams very well no smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really made my skin brighter &amp;#34;strong recommande it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I went out vacationing and got really tan</li>
            <li>So I went on YouTube to find some products/reviews that could possibly help and mostly importantly WORK.</li>
            <li>But When I used it, it didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it during the winter months, and I will update it if it dries out my face too much</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
            <li>This is one of my very few facial foam that really works great on my face.</li>
            <li>My skin is naturally very light, and i stay out of the sun, but i did have some dark spots and freckles.</li>
            <li>My face looked so healthy and my dark circles had lighten a shade lighter.</li>
            <li>After using it for two weeks, I started seeing my dark spots whitening and my face looks and feels so much better.</li>
            <li>It got rid of acne scars and definitely made my skin glow, although if your looking for a bleaching product this is not it many beauty products are not aloud to have bleach chemicals in them so its only a brightening product ^-^</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it you gotta try it.</li>
            <li>It foams up very well, and leaves my face feeling soft and looking noticeably brighter.</li>
            <li>it has a nice foaming action with exfoliating granules and it will last forever as you on only need a tiny bit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My cleanser of choice used to be Cetaphil, but after I&#x27;ve used this for a week, I know what my new go-to-cleanser will be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than origins or other facial products I have been using.</li>
            <li>The earlier version of this soap left your skin squeaky clean and atleast 2 shades lighter.</li>
            <li>I am for all intents and purposes a very pale Caucasian woman, and I don&#x27;t know how much more my skin could be whitened.</li>
            <li>I have seen a significant change on my dark spots.  </li>
            <li>First thing I noticed was that a half eraser head of this stuff will wash your whole face!  </li>
            <li>However you don&#x27;t need much to lather, and thats the only plus i can think of.</li>
            <li>Most face wash products are not cheap, especially those that work well.</li>
            <li>After just using this facial foam for a few days my skin looks smoother and more even.</li>
            <li>and if it was priced a little lower since I&#x27;m not seeing anything significant.</li>
            <li>I first heard about the Pond&#x27;s whitening product line after watching an Asian girl reviewing various products online.</li>
            <li>Okay, so as a WOC, I always find it hard to find products that actually work.</li>
            <li>This really works, and you only need a tiny dab and it&#x27;ll spread and lather all over your face and neck.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended male or female.</li>
            <li>I pretty much used common sense...applied it with water and rinsed it off.</li>
            <li>I dobt really see it making any dark spots whiter</li>
            <li>Besides that and a little blurb about how hard Ponds worked to get this cool formula, there isn&#x27;t much information.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i live in south california,really dry enviornment,and i came from very moderate environment,i got sunburns which i even didnt noticed,when i visited back home</li>
            <li>It takes only a very small amount of this product to clean the entire face/neck which is a plus.  </li>
            <li>I feel like the little bubbles work really well in taking away all the oily residue and make up off my face.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> As for cleansing, this is a great, easy to foam cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, cleans off my makeup and leaves me feeling soft and prepped to put on moisturizer afterward.</li>
            <li> ,i purchased this for only five dollars,and this worked amazing in a week.  </li>
            <li> Well money spent and better than most of the skin cleansers.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft :) I use it every night before I go to sleep</li>
            <li> i got it under control pretty quick ...</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t mind since I always moisturize right after anyways.</li>
            <li> I left it on for about 7 minutes exactly and washed it off with warm water.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time because you dont need too much, it foams really good.</li>
            <li> I was unsure at first about this product, because as we all know \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; products rarely come through for us.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday cleansing, or when you&#x27;ve done a peel and need something gentle to deal with redness and flakes.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and like it very much.</li>
            <li> i&#x60;ve always used ponds mostly because their products seem to work pretty well for me,i&#x27;m mexican with an olive type of skin,</li>
            <li> next time i&#x27;ll make sure it comes from within the USA cause</li>
            <li> Does nothing and contains mostly the same chemicals as the retail counter/drug stores.</li>
            <li> and it is not expensive.</li>
            <li> usually use a light cleanser for my face since I don&#x27;t like the abrasive ones, the smelly ones, or the kind that makes my face feel greasy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this so far, and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I had been seeing the commercials for this product on Thai TV and didn&#x27;t believe it, but I finally decided it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> it has few micro scrubs (that i don&#x27;t see the use) but still works good for whitening.</li>
            <li> My skin feel clean and very soft after each use.</li>
            <li> cause the dark spots are super light light brown..</li>
            <li> My face is squeaky clean afterwards but not overly dry, although I follow up with a light moisturizer in the morning and evening.</li>
            <li> I hear it&#x27;s rare to find these products in the US, but so far, I think it is worth the search.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty thrilled with this stuff, and even though I can only find it through Amazon, as previous reviews have stated it only takes a tiny bit to foam up nicely!!</li>
            <li> I would better like it if it mentioned how long it needs to change anything</li>
            <li> What I love more is, it lathers up really well on your face with small, slippery bubbles!  </li>
            <li> i have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Okay two things, first of all I really do not agree with the whitening obsession in Asia and India.</li>
            <li> I certainly hope I&#x27;m using it correctly as there were no enlish instructions on this pacakaging.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who wants youthful skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference, however, my friends and coworkers have made comments of me getting lighter.</li>
            <li> it foams very well no smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really made my skin brighter &amp;#34;strong recommande it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I went out vacationing and got really tan</li>
            <li> So I went on YouTube to find some products/reviews that could possibly help and mostly importantly WORK.</li>
            <li> But When I used it, it didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it during the winter months, and I will update it if it dries out my face too much</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
            <li> This is one of my very few facial foam that really works great on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin is naturally very light, and i stay out of the sun, but i did have some dark spots and freckles.</li>
            <li> My face looked so healthy and my dark circles had lighten a shade lighter.</li>
            <li> After using it for two weeks, I started seeing my dark spots whitening and my face looks and feels so much better.</li>
            <li> It got rid of acne scars and definitely made my skin glow, although if your looking for a bleaching product this is not it many beauty products are not aloud to have bleach chemicals in them so its only a brightening product ^-^</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it you gotta try it.</li>
            <li> It foams up very well, and leaves my face feeling soft and looking noticeably brighter.</li>
            <li> it has a nice foaming action with exfoliating granules and it will last forever as you on only need a tiny bit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My cleanser of choice used to be Cetaphil, but after I&#x27;ve used this for a week, I know what my new go-to-cleanser will be.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better than origins or other facial products I have been using.</li>
            <li> The earlier version of this soap left your skin squeaky clean and atleast 2 shades lighter.</li>
            <li> I am for all intents and purposes a very pale Caucasian woman, and I don&#x27;t know how much more my skin could be whitened.</li>
            <li> I have seen a significant change on my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> First thing I noticed was that a half eraser head of this stuff will wash your whole face!  </li>
            <li> However you don&#x27;t need much to lather, and thats the only plus i can think of.</li>
            <li> Most face wash products are not cheap, especially those that work well.</li>
            <li> After just using this facial foam for a few days my skin looks smoother and more even.</li>
            <li> and if it was priced a little lower since I&#x27;m not seeing anything significant.</li>
            <li> I first heard about the Pond&#x27;s whitening product line after watching an Asian girl reviewing various products online.</li>
            <li> Okay, so as a WOC, I always find it hard to find products that actually work.</li>
            <li> This really works, and you only need a tiny dab and it&#x27;ll spread and lather all over your face and neck.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended male or female.</li>
            <li> I pretty much used common sense...applied it with water and rinsed it off.</li>
            <li> I dobt really see it making any dark spots whiter</li>
            <li> Besides that and a little blurb about how hard Ponds worked to get this cool formula, there isn&#x27;t much information.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i live in south california,really dry enviornment,and i came from very moderate environment,i got sunburns which i even didnt noticed,when i visited back home</li>
            <li> It takes only a very small amount of this product to clean the entire face/neck which is a plus.  </li>
            <li> I feel like the little bubbles work really well in taking away all the oily residue and make up off my face.</li>
            <li> productive dark spots acne prone young Asian skin..</li>
            <li> Should last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> Who would have thought Asian skin care would work so well for a pale, Irish looking 40 year old woman like me?</li>
            <li> I can tell that this will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> If you just want to try a different cleanser that won&#x27;t break you out or leave you dry, this may be just the thing for you.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few weeks and will say that it does help to clear the skin tone, but also dries it out a bit.  </li>
            <li> it took so long for it to get here ...</li>
            <li> , I wanted to revert to my old complexion so my makeup wouldn&#x27;t be a waste.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m about to purchase 2 of them now, since it takes a litte bit long to get it in the mail</li>
            <li> not just once a day coz it doesn&#x27;t keep out your grease for long.</li>
            <li> Plus you have to apply it carefully and proper way.</li>
            <li> It just been a few days since I use this product and it seemed to be working so far.</li>
            <li> There are these tiny pink speckles in them that don&#x27;t feel at all like the scrubs I use once in a while.</li>
            <li> I will say this, that the cleanser is a bit drying, leaving a dry fleeing on the skin.</li>
            <li> My acne had stopped but my skin started to dry up.</li>
            <li> , It makes your skin feel really dry afterwards</li>
            <li> the sad part is that i order a lot right away again to stock up only to find out after awhile that it doesnt work on me and now i have a lot of unuse bottle and doesnt know what to do with them since i order them for a while now</li>
            <li> It gets really down in their and cleanses the skin and gets rid of all that dirt and gets rid of pores and white heads and blemishes so with that alone</li>
            <li> This product has tiny beads in it and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so this tube will last you months.</li>
            <li> It smells flowery and is pretty thick with a little bit of grit added.  </li>
            <li> but importantly I bought the product to help lightened the worst case over productive dark spots and so far I am very impress</li>
            <li> This foam wash is everything I expected..</li>
            <li> I got pimples whenever I use it not as expected</li>
            <li> Minus one star for lack of availability in the US.</li>
            <li> Facial foam was dried and did not foam well.  </li>
            <li> Every time I use this I can always get the dead skin cells and get white heads on my nose by just rubbing it.</li>
            <li> but it absolutely never lightened my skin whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Your pores and other factors play a big part on how dark your skin can get just from being dirty when you may think its clean.</li>
            <li> it only takes a little drop!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s has improve my skin in just 1 week.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> i would want to buy other products</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical, but this product made my skin looking lighter in just days.</li>
            <li> I only use a small amount (a little goes a long way) and this leaves my skin so much softer and smoother than the expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I do not see that I have less dark spots but at least my skin is not dry anymore.</li>
            <li> My face has an uneven complexion and I never really cared about it, until now that is.</li>
            <li> since i was 12 i had a slight problem with acne, not too severe</li>
            <li> ; Mind you I am a black woman</li>
            <li> Been using this for a week and a half.</li>
            <li> that it is a little to drying for my skin</li>
            <li> No significant results</li>
            <li> but it really dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> with my uneven skintone.</li>
            <li> now i&#x27;m 22 and having the worst acne of my life ( mostly cause i started on birthcontrol ) and looking for a product to diminish the scars i found this, it has worked wonders for me, but i also use the cream ....</li>
            <li> Not sure about the whitening effect though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to match foundations, concealers, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not effective yet</li>
            <li> I use this wash at least once a day.</li>
            <li> so, please beware that if you use this all over your face it will lighten your skintone significantly, at least for me anyway.</li>
            <li> Nothing negative to say, had no breakouts.</li>
            <li> When you get to your late 40&#x27;s you need something to start brightening your skin.</li>
            <li> so I use it to scrub my face with and even with a sore face from exfoliation, the foam is so thick it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> i mean i see results slowly</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after few weeks, i started getting a break out and pimples..</li>
            <li> It makes a very thick foam</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken out since I used this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my face hasn&#x27;t broken out yet, but time will be the judge of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (....what a big disappointment!!</li>
            <li> but they are damn expensive here.  </li>
            <li> but soon I was getting weird questions from people like &amp;#34;why</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this one fails to do so.</li>
            <li> I have really bad melasma (brown spots) on my face, this product helps to tone it down and not get worst.  </li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t too bad, either.</li>
            <li> Worthless product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this product for years and like it very much. I would recommend it to anyone who wants youthful skin.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works wonderfully, and I like that it only takes a little drop! I would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not effective yet I don&#x27;t see result, maybe If I finish it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken out since I used this product.  I think it&#x27;s because it dries out my skin.  I follow it up with a good moisturizer and it works just fine for me.  I have really bad melasma (brown spots) on my face, this product helps to tone it down and not get worst.  Great for using every day!  What I love more is, it lathers up really well on your face with small, slippery bubbles!  I feel like the little bubbles work really well in taking away all the oily residue and make up off my face.</li>
            <li> I use this wash at least once a day. It foams up very well, and leaves my face feeling soft and looking noticeably brighter. Personally, I think it is very well-priced when you considering a few facts; 1.) Most face wash products are not cheap, especially those that work well. 2.)This product is only sold in Thailand. 3.) A little goes a long way. I can tell that this will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> This foam wash is everything I expected..i only need smaller than a dime size to do its job..I have oily skin so this product leaves my face fresh and clean...I also use the day and night cream in conjunction to the foam wash..all the same skin care line...I notice my pores are slot smaller..my face is a lot softer and it&#x27;s only been 2Weeks since I have been using all 3 of the product to help with my oily over productive dark spots acne prone young Asian skin..but importantly I bought the product to help lightened the worst case over productive dark spots and so far I am very impress cause the dark spots are super light light brown..im on my way to flawless skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with every hope that I would get a shade lighter. I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference, however, my friends and coworkers have made comments of me getting lighter. So I was somewhat pleased with the purchase of the product. I am still continuing to use this product. I only wished that they made a body wash.</li>
            <li> i&#x60;ve always used ponds mostly because their products seem to work pretty well for me,i&#x27;m mexican with an olive type of skin, since i was 12 i had a slight problem with acne, not too severe but you know just enough to feel self counsious.. i got it under control pretty quick ... now i&#x27;m 22 and having the worst acne of my life ( mostly cause i started on birthcontrol ) and looking for a product to diminish the scars i found this, it has worked wonders for me, but i also use the cream .... i&#x27;m defenitly buying this product again but next time i&#x27;ll make sure it comes from within the USA cause it took so long for it to get here ...</li>
            <li> i have been using this for a month, dont see any difference or change in color. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> it foams very well no smell I like that it is a little to drying for my skin this would be very nice for someone with oilly skin</li>
            <li> I was unsure at first about this product, because as we all know \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; products rarely come through for us. I have to say that I am fair skinned to begin with, but have sun damage and acne scarring on my cheeks and chin. At 30 I also continue to break out monthly and had not been able to find a thing to help. After 1 week of use, my skin is looking noticibly brighter and softer, and even the scarring has lightened. All my breakout prone areas are smooth now and I&#x27;m happy to report no signs of anymore breakouts on the way. I&#x27;m pretty thrilled with this stuff, and even though I can only find it through Amazon, as previous reviews have stated it only takes a tiny bit to foam up nicely!! I recommend for sure!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this products actually whitens your face but it really dried out my skin. I stopped using it and gave it to my mom. It was just way too drying for my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really made my skin brighter &amp;#34;strong recommande it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I got pimples whenever I use it not as expected</li>
            <li> this cleanser is wonderful, really gets your face squeaky clean without drying it, and yes seems to help in conjunction with my other whitening products to even out my skin tone. def a good buy.</li>
            <li> I first heard about the Pond&#x27;s whitening product line after watching an Asian girl reviewing various products online. Whether or not this product will lighten my skin remains to be seen-- I am for all intents and purposes a very pale Caucasian woman, and I don&#x27;t know how much more my skin could be whitened. As for cleansing, this is a great, easy to foam cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, cleans off my makeup and leaves me feeling soft and prepped to put on moisturizer afterward. This product is definitely competition for Sheseido White Lucent cleanser. Even though it is a bit thicker in consistency, it foams up just as well and I get the same results. Who would have thought Asian skin care would work so well for a pale, Irish looking 40 year old woman like me? Great for everyday cleansing, or when you&#x27;ve done a peel and need something gentle to deal with redness and flakes. If you just want to try a different cleanser that won&#x27;t break you out or leave you dry, this may be just the thing for you. Minus one star for lack of availability in the US.</li>
            <li> Wish this was sold in the States!  Lasts forever!!!</li>
            <li> i live in south california,really dry enviornment,and i came from very moderate environment,i got sunburns which i even didnt noticed,when i visited back home,i purchased this for only five dollars,and this worked amazing in a week.  i would want to buy other products but they are damn expensive here.  but i would buy them later and will review.  till thn im very happy with this.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quicker than estimated from Siam Super thru Amazon.  It smells flowery and is pretty thick with a little bit of grit added.  First thing I noticed was that a half eraser head of this stuff will wash your whole face!  It&#x27;s almost as if it multiplies once you start washing with it.  Should last me a long time.  I bought this along with the Ponds Flawless White lotion, so I don&#x27;t&#x27;know which one is making a difference, but it&#x27;s only been a week and I can tell my flaws are more even. They are still there, but they do seem more faded. I&#x27;m going to continue to use it and see what happens. I hear it&#x27;s rare to find these products in the US, but so far, I think it is worth the search.</li>
            <li> This product I bought in the Philippines, after I asked a sales associate which one was the best for whitening the face. Is it ever - I use it once a day (she recommended two) and already in one week I see a noticeable difference in my skin tone. I went out vacationing and got really tan, I wanted to revert to my old complexion so my makeup wouldn&#x27;t be a waste. This really works, and you only need a tiny dab and it&#x27;ll spread and lather all over your face and neck. The scent isn&#x27;t too bad, either.</li>
            <li> love it, it not going to take over night for you to see the result. you have to keep using it for like a month to see the results but i still love it because it does clean my face and take off all the dirt and makeup. it does make your face to look refresh and not i like the way my skin torn is . i&#x27;m about to purchase 2 of them now, since it takes a litte bit long to get it in the mail</li>
            <li> Thanks for lightening fast delivery, great price and a very nice product.  It takes only a very small amount of this product to clean the entire face/neck which is a plus.  I have used over a month and noticed definite improvement.  My skin feel clean and very soft after each use.</li>
            <li> Well. it doesn&#x27;t white your skin very much but it leaves your skin very very beautiful. i love how this product change my skin.</li>
            <li> Worthless product. Does nothing and contains mostly the same chemicals as the retail counter/drug stores. Find something that works instead or buy this and regret it. I still have hope there&#x27;s a good in kind product somewhere.</li>
            <li> It is so good and it is not expensive. So I like it. Pond is really a good product. d</li>
            <li> Well money spent and better than most of the skin cleansers. Highly recommended male or female. Will leave your skin clean and fresh</li>
            <li> if you wanna get whiter face then i would definitely recommend you this product. it has few micro scrubs (that i don&#x27;t see the use) but still works good for whitening. this has newer product so just buy the latest one but if you got an oily face, you need to use this not just once a day coz it doesn&#x27;t keep out your grease for long.</li>
            <li> This actually works! At first I was a bit skeptical, but this product made my skin looking lighter in just days.</li>
            <li> Okay, so as a WOC, I always find it hard to find products that actually work. My face has an uneven complexion and I never really cared about it, until now that is. It&#x27;s hard to match foundations, concealers, etc. with my uneven skintone. So I went on YouTube to find some products/reviews that could possibly help and mostly importantly WORK. Through my search I found POND&#x27;S and I decided to give it a go. First time washing my face with the cleanser, you can clearly tell how bright my face looked. My face looked so healthy and my dark circles had lighten a shade lighter. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of days now, so I can&#x27;t say just yet if it will even everything out. I will say this, that the cleanser is a bit drying, leaving a dry fleeing on the skin. But I don&#x27;t mind since I always moisturize right after anyways.</li>
            <li> Something that my grandmother used and now I use.  I do not see that I have less dark spots but at least my skin is not dry anymore.</li>
            <li> It makes your face better better within two weeks but you have to keep using it.Plus you have to apply it carefully and proper way.Ibelieve bleach is better.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try based on the good reviews but I do not see a lot of improvement or noticeably lighter complexion.  I will however say that I like it as a basic cleanser it has a nice foaming action with exfoliating granules and it will last forever as you on only need a tiny bit.&lt;br /&gt;I will try meladerm next.</li>
            <li> It has a nice strong perfume smell, which is nice when I want to smell good and fresh.  It makes a very thick foam so I use it to scrub my face with and even with a sore face from exfoliation, the foam is so thick it doesn&#x27;t hurt. It has vitamin b3, which helps with hyperpigmentation.  I bought it for that reason and between the exfoliation and wearing hats, sunscreen, using agents, and avoiding the sun, I achieved clarity on my face.</li>
            <li> Okay So this product worked on me...I&#x27;m African American and needed to fix some darker marks on my neck and so on. This product did more than just that...Beware. Pay close attention to where you put it just in case..you make an area lighter that you didn&#x27;t intend to. I&#x27;ve had this product for about a month and it&#x27;s done great!i Recommend putting it on at night..i have super sensitive skin and i didn&#x27;t break out from it. I left it on for about 7 minutes exactly and washed it off with warm water. I used this and sunscreen and a lotion to hydrate my skin. But this product is great for it&#x27;s price and amazon delivered it a day ahead of time so i was very happy.</li>
            <li> I would like to say that I&#x27;m a faithful user of this product it works like it says it will. I&#x27;m truly happy with my results.I highly recommend it you gotta try it.</li>
            <li> Great product and on time delivery</li>
            <li> Im so pleased with the products that I bought . I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little while now and am very happy with the results. I only use a small amount (a little goes a long way) and this leaves my skin so much softer and smoother than the expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Facial foam was dried and did not foam well.  Would not purchase again.  I was very surprised with the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels after using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 4 years, and I love this stuff. The only downfall is that they dont make it in the U.S. I even wrote ponds trying to get them to do something about that and they replied that what they do overseas is on their own. So when I go to India I just get a lot of if and bring it back. It lasts a long time because you dont need too much, it foams really good. I will state, this is not a miracle whitening cleanser, because one of the reviews they stated that they were waiting for miracles well this wont be it and well good luck finding it. What this does and its really good at it, is it cleanses really well. Your pores and other factors play a big part on how dark your skin can get just from being dirty when you may think its clean. This knocks that out of the park. It gets really down in their and cleanses the skin and gets rid of all that dirt and gets rid of pores and white heads and blemishes so with that alone you will see some lightning just from getting rid of build up. But great product, highly recommend, and awesome that I found it here on amazon, till I go back home...</li>
            <li> This is one of my very few facial foam that really works great on my face. Every time I use this I can always get the dead skin cells and get white heads on my nose by just rubbing it. This stuff is really good.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few weeks and will say that it does help to clear the skin tone, but also dries it out a bit.  It works very well when you follow up with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and washes out all the dirt on my face.</li>
            <li> When I ordered it, I waited a bit longer then what it said it was supposed to be shipped. But When I used it, it didn&#x27;t really work. All it did was cleane my skin. My acne had stopped but my skin started to dry up. I would recommend this if you have a lighter skin</li>
            <li> No significant results but it seems to work. I would better like it if it mentioned how long it needs to change anything and if it was priced a little lower since I&#x27;m not seeing anything significant.</li>
            <li> It just been a few days since I use this product and it seemed to be working so far. My face is started clearing up. Unfortunately, after few weeks, i started getting a break out and pimples.. the sad part is that i order a lot right away again to stock up only to find out after awhile that it doesnt work on me and now i have a lot of unuse bottle and doesnt know what to do with them since i order them for a while now.. dont know if it still can be return.. dont know if the seller will still accept them... wish they do still accept returns and refund my money back.</li>
            <li> i am still using it but it did not work for me at all :(....what a big disappointment!! dont bother save ur money!</li>
            <li> I reserve my best experiences with a product (any, from vacuum cleaners to beauty products) to share with my sister. This will be one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use a light cleanser for my face since I don&#x27;t like the abrasive ones, the smelly ones, or the kind that makes my face feel greasy. My cleanser of choice used to be Cetaphil, but after I&#x27;ve used this for a week, I know what my new go-to-cleanser will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way. I dab a tiny streak onto my palm, and lo! it bubbles into a rich and frothy lather. There are these tiny pink speckles in them that don&#x27;t feel at all like the scrubs I use once in a while. My face is squeaky clean afterwards but not overly dry, although I follow up with a light moisturizer in the morning and evening. I&#x27;ve noticed that my face hasn&#x27;t broken out yet, but time will be the judge of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very pretty, light, and effective cleanser. The directions are in all sorts of languages (with English not being a priority) and is very basic. Well, I can&#x27;t even call them directions since it says to the effect to store away from sunlight and heat and to wash it out if it gets in your eyes. Besides that and a little blurb about how hard Ponds worked to get this cool formula, there isn&#x27;t much information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this so far, and would definitely recommend. I&#x27;m using it during the winter months, and I will update it if it dries out my face too much or if I start breaking out.</li>
            <li> I used to use this Pond when I was in Asia. My skin would look completely different before and after using it. Clean, whiten, smell good.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for that in every store nearby but found none, so I decided to purchase it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this product after reading the reviews and  I must say I am so glad I did.  I have seen a significant change on my dark spots.  After using it for two weeks, I started seeing my dark spots whitening and my face looks and feels so much better. This product has tiny beads in it and a little goes a long way.  It leaves your face very clean and feeling better after using.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Got this for my hyper pigmentation and saw results in a month. Very good product.</li>
            <li> I love this. I really love the smell. The smell is kind of sweet creamy/milky. My skin is naturally very light, and i stay out of the sun, but i did have some dark spots and freckles. They&#x27;ve faded a lot since using this product. I will definitely buy this product from now on.</li>
            <li> Works great. Improved skin tone. Using it along with ponds day cream and night cream from more than a year.</li>
            <li> I had been seeing the commercials for this product on Thai TV and didn&#x27;t believe it, but I finally decided it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  This stuff definitely works.  My skin is 100 times better than it was before I started using this line of products.  Best money I&#x27;ve ever spent!</li>
            <li> this is cool but it wasn&#x27;t what I thought it was. but it work great.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is whitening at this point, but it does clean, exfoliate, therefore giving me nice clean bright skin. A litlle goes along way, so very good deal.</li>
            <li> Okay two things, first of all I really do not agree with the whitening obsession in Asia and India. I think it&#x27;s really sad that woman feel like they need to lighten their skin to look more white. But i digress...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now when I was using this every day I was excited because I was noticing a difference in my acne scars but soon I was getting weird questions from people like &amp;#34;why do you look a shade lighter?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;why does it look like your skin tone is lighter than it used to be?&amp;#34; Mind you I am a black woman so that startled me and i deduced it must be because of this face wash. Then i started spot washing my face just on the acne scars and noticed that there was still a difference so, please beware that if you use this all over your face it will lighten your skintone significantly, at least for me anyway.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft :) I use it every night before I go to sleep</li>
            <li> I dobt really see it making any dark spots whiter but ut really does smell great and i feel my face is cleaner</li>
            <li> After using this product, your face is super clean! Better than origins or other facial products I have been using. Not sure about the whitening effect though.</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff. A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s has improve my skin in just 1 week. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> i used this product and i think it actually works. i mean i see results slowly but it surely works. i would definetly use it again</li>
            <li> Great product . Works really well. A little goes a long way. A great price too.</li>
            <li> Good I like it but I just use it 2 day ago so need more time</li>
            <li> I saw immident results! It got rid of acne scars and definitely made my skin glow, although if your looking for a bleaching product this is not it many beauty products are not aloud to have bleach chemicals in them so its only a brightening product ^-^</li>
            <li> Been using this for a week and a half. Nothing negative to say, had no breakouts. A little goes a long way so this tube will last you months. Oh, and it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me, It makes your skin feel really dry afterwards</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser my skin does look brighter.  When you get to your late 40&#x27;s you need something to start brightening your skin.</li>
            <li> Best face wash for oily skin. face looks fair after washing, might not be suitable for very dry skin during winters</li>
            <li> The soap looks and feels luxurious but it absolutely never lightened my skin whatsoever. It doesn&#x27;t work at all. If you just need a regular face wash soap I&#x27;d recommend this product but don&#x27;t buy it if u want to lighten ur skin</li>
            <li> Whatever lanquage the instructions came on the pacakaging. I pretty much used common sense...applied it with water and rinsed it off. I certainly hope I&#x27;m using it correctly as there were no enlish instructions on this pacakaging.</li>
            <li> The earlier version of this soap left your skin squeaky clean and atleast 2 shades lighter. Unfortunately this one fails to do so. However you don&#x27;t need much to lather, and thats the only plus i can think of.</li>
            <li> After just using this facial foam for a few days my skin looks smoother and more even. I have a medium complexion. Just make sure you use a good moisturizer after.</li>
