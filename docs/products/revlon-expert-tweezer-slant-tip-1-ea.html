            <li>My favorite tweezers!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>I love this tweezer!</li>
            <li>Glad I did because these are the best ones I purchased since my original ones.</li>
            <li>They grip every hair on the first try and have a wonderful tip to grab even the smallest ones.  </li>
            <li>I love it this Revlon Expert Tweezers!</li>
            <li>Great dexterity and strong grab.</li>
            <li>Being an esthetician having a good tweezers is very important.</li>
            <li>Fine tip works great.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are amazing.</li>
            <li>Who cares about the print (yes, I got the blue/white design), the mechanics of this tweezer is amazing.  </li>
            <li>and the seller is just amazing.</li>
            <li>Great tweezers for fantastic price,</li>
            <li>My wife asked for these cause her pair got lost, hers have never broken and work perfectly..</li>
            <li>I always do my own eyebrows at home, have been for 10 years and get a lot of compliments</li>
            <li>a nice weekend</li>
            <li>Anyhow, it pinches nicely.</li>
            <li>Edges have nice texture for grippage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They seem like they are made of long-lasting materials, which I&#x27;m hoping will lead to them being effective at hair removal for quite some time to come.  </li>
            <li>I lose tweezers within five minutes of using them, so it&#x27;s nice to have one in every bathroom, and in my travel toiletry case.</li>
            <li>They pluck with aplomb and have a nice grip and tip.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and he gets a Maharg that you own reachable</li>
            <li>Works great, and also quick shipping.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sturdy, the blades on the end line up perfectly causing a person to be successful in grabbing a single hair (if that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re being used for) and removing without slippage.  </li>
            <li>The tips of these are really good (fine and pointed) for removing splinters.  </li>
            <li>Best tweezers so far, they&#x27;re inexpensive and you can find it almost anywhere</li>
            <li>and I find it to grip the hairs much more effectively.</li>
            <li>By far the best that I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>And these are by far the best ones I have ever purchased!  </li>
            <li>Easy to hold, great grip, fine edges to grab the stubborn eyebrow strays.  </li>
            <li>My favorite kind of tweezers (Revlon slant tip).</li>
            <li>My eyebrow hairs are very fine, but these tweezers decrease my rate of unsuccessful pulls.  </li>
            <li>, they dont pinch, they have a tight grip and work great best</li>
            <li>This seems like a product that varies greatly person to person as my wife was able to use it pretty effectively.</li>
            <li>They are good lucking, stylish, inexpensive, precise and they hold onto hairs in you</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really very accurate when you&#x27;re paying attention</li>
            <li>Very precise, nice easy grip.</li>
            <li>What more can one say about a pair of tweezers?</li>
            <li>These are, simply, the best tweezers ever.</li>
            <li>The slant is at the perfect angle to grab short hairs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one that works perfectly.</li>
            <li>This used to be my favorite tweezer until I found Revlon Platinum Tweezer, Slant Tip.  </li>
            <li>Favorite tweezer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different tweezers, but this one works the best, and at this price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d say it has been one of the best tweezers I&#x27;ve owned since the age of 18 (now in mid 30s).</li>
            <li>I lost my favorite and most reliable tweezers so I ordered these because I needed them .</li>
            <li>and she said they work so much better than the off brand ones she had been using.</li>
            <li>Glad I gave Revlon another try.</li>
            <li>and they love it</li>
            <li>The7y&#x27;re okay.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would love it.</li>
            <li>After tweezing for many years now, I&#x27;ve probably owned every brand there is.</li>
            <li>Like the top says...</li>
            <li>I love tweezers in every room.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite tweezer style.</li>
            <li>give me more control when tweezing my brows</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re OK.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Great tweezers that work really well.</li>
            <li>It is OK</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best tweezers I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>They would often pluck more than one eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li>I love Tweezerman, these are cheaper but work well.  </li>
            <li>nice and precise.</li>
            <li>Better to invest in the tweezerman equivalent which costs more</li>
            <li>i believe but better as a permanent solution</li>
            <li>i like most is the GRIP.</li>
            <li>It gets more than one at a time</li>
            <li>I love the slanted jaw</li>
            <li>These were ok..</li>
            <li>I feel like they need a grip at the end to grab the hairs better, but I use this product often.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t believe how much better my eyebrows look after using these.&lt;br /&gt;Great item for any beauty bag.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>textured grip makes sure you don&#x27;t slip</li>
            <li>I had purchased Avon tweezers and wasn&#x27;t too pleased .</li>
            <li>They work 100 times better than what I was using.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I got them.</li>
            <li>these are my favorite tweezers</li>
            <li>It is precise, has a pretty good grip, good size, and easy to work</li>
            <li>I had seen reviews that said Revlon slant tip were a good buy, but they dont grab the hair right.</li>
            <li>Very precise and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I loved these at first.</li>
            <li>And I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other brands and this is the best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not the most accurate thing</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of using them, I find that I can much more precisely tweeze with these</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have bought it, precise and works the way I thought it would.</li>
            <li>These do have a better grip on the &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34;, but the finish on the exposed tips is not as smooth as Tweezerman.  </li>
            <li>These are really good tweezers and they do the job they were bought for very well</li>
            <li>work very well good price</li>
            <li>Most importantly, its controllable: it gets the hairs I want, easy.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend...heavy duty, good tip grip, and cute pattern on the handles!</li>
            <li>Slant tip with sharp edges is perfect for sliver removal.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are easy to grasp and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold onto and the slanted tip makes it easy to grab one hair at a time.</li>
            <li>and they have a strong grip.</li>
            <li>The perfect pair of tweezers with a sharp, precise edge.</li>
            <li>I found this slant tip pair to be sharp and provide excellent grip with a light</li>
            <li>BEST TWEEZERS HANDS DOWN</li>
            <li>An easy fit in your hand and easy to use that you will appreciate again and again.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty nice tweezer that has an accurate tip.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought these before and they were fine</li>
            <li>just how micro fine it is in my images here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>FINE HAIRS</li>
            <li>These tweezers work just fine.</li>
            <li>Great tweezers...  tweezers can get a little pricey for nice ones and these are well priced considering how well</li>
            <li>Comfortable grip.</li>
            <li>The grip also helps me from dropping it like the cheap ones my mom uses.</li>
            <li>They are a light blue/white swirly bubbly design thing?</li>
            <li>Fortunately my wife loves the design so I am keeping them (</li>
            <li>These are cheap and don&#x27;t grip anything well.</li>
            <li>Unlike a lot of cheap tweezers, the ends meet flush and don&#x27;t get misaligned after repeated use.</li>
            <li>Still, aesthetics aside, these are fabulous tweezers.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; tweezers, but these are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Plus, return them for free sharpening/adjusting or replacing (at their option) with just a $1.00 S/H charge.  </li>
            <li>not as precise as I&#x27;d like it to be....</li>
            <li>The tip is great and it holds well and all, but the Platinum has such a finer tip</li>
            <li>These tweezers are great, but the problem is the one I got is blue and has flowers designs on it.</li>
            <li>I stopped using Tweezerman  tweezers which are fabulous initially;but</li>
            <li>The slant allows for precise use.</li>
            <li>They work very well and are nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li>These are great at getting those short stubby hair follicles.</li>
            <li>Enjoy if you purchase them if not then enjoy which ever ones you did find contentment in.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap and they pull out splinters or eyebrow hair like champs.</li>
            <li>tweezers wear out and if you drop them and the tip hits tile, it will mash any tweezers point and make it so they don&#x27;t exactly fit anymore</li>
            <li>Since so many people gave this model good reviews, I can only guess that there are discrepancies in the manufacturing process of this model.</li>
            <li>but it seemed that whatever Revlon ones I purchased in a store weren&#x27;t near as good as my original ones.</li>
            <li>The slant tip makes it quick and easy to pluck my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to accidentally grab your skin, though...</li>
            <li>so I am pretty confident with my abilities, but these tweezers were not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I think this tweezer is usually the best, but this time around, it just wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>You will never buy a different kind after you use them!</li>
            <li>Why not purchase this more affordable pair which lasts quite awhile as this is not my first pai of Revlon;s Expert Tweezer with slant.</li>
            <li>well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how to describe why these are the best tweezers ever</li>
            <li>If a beginner like me can figure it out, you seasoned pros should be able to, too.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just what they look like, nice normal tweezers.  </li>
            <li>and I have styled my brows and am loving everything about my new sleek style.</li>
            <li>It is quick and accurate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an expert, but I have several pairs of tweezers, and for yanking out unwanted ear hair, these are by far the best.  </li>
            <li>So I love mine, him not so much.</li>
            <li>They have a nice professional look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really should buy a couple more...</li>
            <li>but hopefully will be good as back up</li>
            <li>Just mass produced tweezers here folks, good enough.</li>
            <li>Good basic beauty tweezer.  </li>
            <li>just a simple, good product</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite tweezers.  </li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re not bad.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product.</li>
            <li>So they were exactly what I expected, sturdy and strong, great pluckers.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re ok, I guess, but maybe the tweezers I originally wanted would have been better, but I received something different.</li>
            <li>seriously the best tweezers ever to buy.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and is still holding on.</li>
            <li>They also allow for adequate space between each point for pulling groups of follicles.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, doesn&#x27;t hold well.</li>
            <li>Idk why, but these tweezers hurt a little more than my old ones, but it doesn&#x27;t matter because for the price they are, they are really nice tweezers and they get the job done! :)</li>
            <li>After combing through all of the highly rated versions, I chose these guys and I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I think you are better off spending just a few more bucks for better quality.</li>
            <li>This is OK and has a nice grip but was not right for me.</li>
            <li>I lost my favorite pair of beauty tweezers while travelling and had to choose a new pair after 13 years.</li>
            <li>they work great but will keep hidden in shave bag on trips.</li>
            <li>and I love them so far!</li>
            <li>The gripping is perfect and it is small enough to satisfy any perfectionista.</li>
            <li>and these came first!</li>
            <li>Works great but breaks within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Sturdy, easy to hold, won&#x27;t slip through fingers and a decent price</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a pair of tweezers that i have completely fallen in love with.</li>
            <li>For the price, I was expecting something a bit more professional.</li>
            <li>This tweezer is more masculine than the packaging lets on, yet has a feminine touch.</li>
            <li>Nice solid and sturdy tweezers I use for plucking.</li>
            <li>razor bumps much better than some pair of old tweezers, get them now...</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>I had someone else do one when the unibrow came back and decided that I could just pluck my own &#x27;brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for, work great, and are black</li>
            <li>These little tweezer are ideal for those people hitting 40 something or older who are discovering hairs in places they never had them before.</li>
            <li>I have only purchased two other tweezers and this one works best for me.</li>
            <li>Even though I have used a different slant tip model for years with good results, this particular model is defective and incapable of tweezing hairs.</li>
            <li>However, this cleans right off without difficulty.</li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>And, the price is right.</li>
            <li>VERY precise tips, grind is very well aligned, as opposed to those cheap ones with molded tips that don&#x27;t quite line up properly.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp, and they fit in your hand nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is however, easy to cut the hair while plucking, and it is not as precise as with finer tip tweezers, to target individual hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These tweezers are suitable for plucking individual hairs.</li>
            <li>I would definitely spend more and get better ones, thankfully i found my old pair.</li>
            <li>great tweezers, good sharp points to help get in to hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li>My biggest issue with tweezers in the past is how easy they are to lose (kind of like socks in the dryer)</li>
            <li>very very fast shipping with no problems.</li>
            <li>FIRST TRY EFFORTLESSLY</li>
            <li>They work really well and get the smallest eyebrow hair worth it would buy it again.</li>
            <li>Never any problems since she purchased the first pair she lost...</li>
            <li>So these work really well!  </li>
            <li>But other than that they work much better than any 1 or 2 dollar tweezers we have ever had!</li>
            <li>I purchased and used these today for the first time</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like it does in the picture.</li>
            <li>and of course Amazon is always my first choice of shopping.</li>
            <li>These are better than the last pair of tweezers I bought at the drug store.  </li>
            <li>I can grab 1 hair from a group and know that I can pluck the exact one I am aiming for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this to put into my first aid kit.  </li>
            <li>, I first came across it at a blog called House Unseen Life Unscripted or something like that.</li>
            <li>Ignore the negative comments as these tweezers are great.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used a better tweezer before or since, I&#x27;ve even had people ask to borrow this specific tweezer.</li>
            <li>Tweezers that are good are not cheap.  </li>
            <li>Great coach we have ever tried is so funny last very long time</li>
            <li>that had ridges on the flat surface of the tip which was awesome for grasping small hairs.</li>
            <li>Product didn&#x27;t work that great for me, the fine tip made it difficult to grasp hair will.  </li>
            <li>I got these for my husband after he had bought about 6 other tweezers and kept throwing them out because they didn&#x27;t tweeze effectively.  </li>
            <li>These are okay tweezers but they dulled up pretty fast with basic use.</li>
            <li>so believe me they really work if you want a little more grip then get the ones with the diamond dust their more grip worthy but the diamond dust does wear off but worth it while you have it in the mean time i&#x27;m loving these ones SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>and it did not do a good job grabbing small hair on the face</li>
            <li>These are good quality tweezers and the tips are fine enough to get the short hair just starting to regrow.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re larger and nice and sharp with fantastic grip.</li>
            <li>It fits well in the hand and the tip is precise enough to grab on the first try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These were packaged relatively well and easy to remove from their packaging.  </li>
            <li>I would easily buy these again in the future.   </li>
            <li>As long as the tips are clean, they will grab VERY fine or coarse hair.</li>
            <li>It has a nice point (not too sharp, not too dull) and it is very easy to select the hair you want and then easily grabs it and pulls it out smoothly without breaking it off or slipping.</li>
            <li>Nothing fancy, can&#x27;t grab super short hairs and sometimes it breaks the hair, but overall it gets most hair out the way you want.</li>
            <li>They grip strongly with a flat contact surface.</li>
            <li>It is razor accurate, very well made, and will last quite awhile.  </li>
            <li>haha),</li>
            <li>The thin tip in the tweezers gives you a better view while plucking your eyebrows, and it also gives you a more precise plucking experience that prevents you from plucking several hairs at a time.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem to work very well.</li>
            <li>These won&#x27;t grab much..</li>
            <li>The Platinum really is much finer and easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>They work really well and are well made.</li>
            <li>They pull the hair out by the root without much effort</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and work very well.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise.  </li>
            <li>I feel the slant tip is preventing me from really grasping the hairs so they can be pulled out at the root.  </li>
            <li>I really like these tweezers.</li>
            <li>they have way to much spring to  them and</li>
            <li>so it grabs really well.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>I have had better and do, Not as I expected.</li>
            <li>So much easier than trying to use my hands or a pair of pliers.  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much slippage when trying to grip a hair or two.</li>
            <li>I have never paid this much for tweezers but never had any work this well.</li>
            <li>I got a facial in October and the beautician gave me a free eyebrow wax.  </li>
            <li>The tips/edges are very well balanced (</li>
            <li>some ones I&#x27;ve used didn&#x27;t line up straight).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- very well machined tip that will grab absolutely the smallest hairs</li>
            <li>/&gt;they don&#x27;t really have any cons...</li>
            <li>Worked real well for that.</li>
            <li>I absolutely would purchase them again if needed.</li>
            <li>Not much to say here, does a good job for tweezers and was relatively affordable.</li>
            <li>the materiel they are made of Is super cheap and they  got black ALL Over my hand?</li>
            <li>Other tweezers will lose their grip after many times of usage.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>I have purchased other tweezers at two or even three times the price and they were not two or three times better.</li>
            <li>But as I continue to use them more, They seem as if they&#x27;re not as sharp and have that grip I need to pull stubborn hairs</li>
            <li>Lost my other tweezers and glad to get them.  </li>
            <li>They are lightweight, unlike my other Revlon tweezers, which were substantially heavier and better.</li>
            <li>I had hoped the slant tip would make these tweezers better than your average pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found myself a new product I&#x27;ll be repeatedly buying because I always seem to lose them!</li>
            <li>I have always been a fan of the Cover girl slanted tweezers, but these give me way more leverage with a lot less effort.</li>
            <li>Was purchased as a gift and this present recipient was happy and I haven&#x27;t heard anything negative.</li>
            <li>I wanted a decent tweezer to ensure I could pull out a splinter or what not.  </li>
            <li>They are not $30, that&#x27;s the main thing.</li>
            <li>Tip is aligned well and grips decently.  </li>
            <li>They work better than most tweezers I have tried, even expensive ones.</li>
            <li>This tweezer gets every hair no matter how little, and it&#x27;s very comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but i highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them</li>
            <li>Revlon Expert Tweezers  Slant tip 100% please and would highly recommend these Tweezers to anyone who thinking about buying them</li>
            <li>Heavy duty and has very precise ends.  </li>
            <li>High quality all around - from the size, the grip, the surface texture to the quality of the steel...wish all products have this type of quality specification.</li>
            <li>Well this tweezer is good enough as it passed the single hair pull on multiple occasions.  </li>
            <li>I use them for many things - like a little tool.  </li>
            <li>so you just have to plan a little better.  </li>
            <li>My mom has this old tweezer much like http://www.thisnext.com/item/18EF450A/Sephora-Sephora-Brand-Eyebrow</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be shocked if you don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re tge best too!</li>
            <li>i used these for normal plucking and for getting those ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>They feel heavy and durable, but are able to grab hair without hesitation.</li>
            <li>This product only proves again to stay with a name brand.</li>
            <li>He made me buy a new pair in a normal color.</li>
            <li>Could be better and not so stiff.</li>
            <li>I purchased these as an add on item and was very surprised at the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>They grip solidly and do their job better than any other tweezers I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I am on my second of this tweezer now, I lost the first.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know anything about grabbing the same strand 10 times because my strands come out on the first try every time.</li>
            <li>The edges didn&#x27;t match up everywhere, only on one part of the tweezer, so if I wanted to pull a thin hair, I&#x27;d be very precise and make sure I used that tiny part of the tweezer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to pull out little hairs</li>
            <li>... very very fine metal splinters... or whatever you are having to pull&lt;br /&gt;- thickly painted finish that doesn&#x27;t chip or corrode ever...</li>
            <li>Excellent....product as expected, works well, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I thought they were super cute, but if you&#x27;re looking for a plain black set, you mightn&#x27;t get one.</li>
            <li>The finger areas are not slick, like my old ones, making them easier to use.</li>
            <li>They came in this blue flower design, my husband said they are embarassing to use, I like them better than the black.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- wide tip for such fine tweezers means you can grab a lot at one time&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t experienced cutting hairs like some of the reviews mentioned.</li>
            <li>Package was VERY worn too - looked to be several years old and tattered.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I no longer have an excuse for not maintaining shaped eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I gave one of my adult daughter since the ones she had</li>
            <li>I work with wood, and frequently get splinters.  </li>
            <li>My old tweezers were too clunky.</li>
            <li>I imagine my old ones are discontinued, so I tried this one.</li>
            <li>At this rate I might as well use a shaver - at least with a shaver you cover more ground.</li>
            <li>I still prefer my old tweezers</li>
            <li>When shopping for tweezers I was surprised by the prices.</li>
            <li>after 3 months, it won&#x27;t pick up anything except near one end of the tip</li>
            <li>I love these my second pair only because I lost the other pair</li>
            <li>Now I know to buy tweezers in person only, to ensure sharp enough with more precision.</li>
            <li>Also, if you find the grip slipping, a quick clean with alcohol usually fixes that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice sharp tip easy to control and pull out those little gray suckers</li>
            <li>The tweezers that I received had a flower pattern on them, not black as shown.</li>
            <li>I only gave them 2 stars because they are of a decent quality material.</li>
            <li>I actually purchased this as a second set for my First aid kit.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty, but it&#x27;s definitely a shock to open something expecting one thing and receiving something else!</li>
            <li>Some tweezers are really tough to pinch together with just two fingers, but these are quite easy and very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using these tweezers since i was in high school, and ordered some last week</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had dozens of other pairs that after a few months use the blades seem to become misaligned, dull, and no longer nearly as effective at pulling anything - let alone something as fine as hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tweezers are cheaply soldered together (not any kind of spring) and in both cases the tweezers failed within a few weeks.</li>
            <li>If you need basic tweezers for normal uses these are a go.</li>
            <li>the become completely dull pretty fast!</li>
            <li>They are a little sharp at the ends, but I think that makes them easier and better.</li>
            <li>I have lost these tweezers several times and I always go back and buy the exact same ones.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like these and found them sharp and irritating to my skin compared to my more rounded tip revlon tweezers.</li>
            <li>The size of the tip on these make it easy to grab larger things (like full hairs), but harder to grab a small object (partial hair or splinter).</li>
            <li>maybe I expected too much.</li>
            <li>My old tweezers ended up breaking after several years.</li>
            <li>This can barely hold on to hairs.</li>
            <li>They perform as expected and seem very durable.</li>
            <li>Not amazing because it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li>use it almost everyday because I have full eyebrows that need to be groomed quite regularly.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s nothing more frustrating than trying to use tweezers that just won&#x27;t grab.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve broken many hairs trying to use these tweezers.</li>
            <li>i was tired of trying so many of those and relied on the reviews to order this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quick note: the tweezers I got were not black as pictured, but white with a teal flower pattern on them.</li>
            <li>Please be very careful with handling them and make sure not sure to drop them</li>
            <li>Did not consistently meet for a tight tweeze, but it was relatively cheap</li>
            <li>The color was not black, a white background with blue floral pattern.</li>
            <li>What can you really say about it other than it works, A goods but and cheaper here than at the local stores,</li>
            <li>Love Revlon&#x27;s slant tip tweezer, as it&#x27;s not too thick and not too sharp.</li>
            <li>While the picture is black, my tweezers are primarily white with light and dark teal circles on them.</li>
            <li>The tips are very sharp, but very precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only use the tweezers a couple of times a week, but the first one broke within a few months.  </li>
            <li>The sharpness of the tweezing edge and tip easily nicked &amp; tore the delicate skin around my eye brow, no matter how careful I was.</li>
            <li>The pair I had before lasted for 7 years, and were better at pulling hairs in the first place, so I was very disappointed when I first tried these out.  </li>

            <li> My favorite tweezers!</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> I love this tweezer!</li>
            <li> Glad I did because these are the best ones I purchased since my original ones.</li>
            <li> They grip every hair on the first try and have a wonderful tip to grab even the smallest ones.  </li>
            <li> I love it this Revlon Expert Tweezers!</li>
            <li> Great dexterity and strong grab.</li>
            <li> Being an esthetician having a good tweezers is very important.</li>
            <li> Fine tip works great.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are amazing.</li>
            <li> Who cares about the print (yes, I got the blue/white design), the mechanics of this tweezer is amazing.  </li>
            <li> and the seller is just amazing.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers for fantastic price,</li>
            <li> My wife asked for these cause her pair got lost, hers have never broken and work perfectly..</li>
            <li> I always do my own eyebrows at home, have been for 10 years and get a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> a nice weekend</li>
            <li> Anyhow, it pinches nicely.</li>
            <li> Edges have nice texture for grippage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They seem like they are made of long-lasting materials, which I&#x27;m hoping will lead to them being effective at hair removal for quite some time to come.  </li>
            <li> I lose tweezers within five minutes of using them, so it&#x27;s nice to have one in every bathroom, and in my travel toiletry case.</li>
            <li> They pluck with aplomb and have a nice grip and tip.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and he gets a Maharg that you own reachable</li>
            <li> Works great, and also quick shipping.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sturdy, the blades on the end line up perfectly causing a person to be successful in grabbing a single hair (if that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re being used for) and removing without slippage.  </li>
            <li> The tips of these are really good (fine and pointed) for removing splinters.  </li>
            <li> Best tweezers so far, they&#x27;re inexpensive and you can find it almost anywhere</li>
            <li> and I find it to grip the hairs much more effectively.</li>
            <li> By far the best that I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> And these are by far the best ones I have ever purchased!  </li>
            <li> Easy to hold, great grip, fine edges to grab the stubborn eyebrow strays.  </li>
            <li> My favorite kind of tweezers (Revlon slant tip).</li>
            <li> My eyebrow hairs are very fine, but these tweezers decrease my rate of unsuccessful pulls.  </li>
            <li> , they dont pinch, they have a tight grip and work great best</li>
            <li> This seems like a product that varies greatly person to person as my wife was able to use it pretty effectively.</li>
            <li> They are good lucking, stylish, inexpensive, precise and they hold onto hairs in you</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really very accurate when you&#x27;re paying attention</li>
            <li> Very precise, nice easy grip.</li>
            <li> What more can one say about a pair of tweezers?</li>
            <li> These are, simply, the best tweezers ever.</li>
            <li> The slant is at the perfect angle to grab short hairs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one that works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This used to be my favorite tweezer until I found Revlon Platinum Tweezer, Slant Tip.  </li>
            <li> Favorite tweezer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different tweezers, but this one works the best, and at this price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d say it has been one of the best tweezers I&#x27;ve owned since the age of 18 (now in mid 30s).</li>
            <li> I lost my favorite and most reliable tweezers so I ordered these because I needed them .</li>
            <li> and she said they work so much better than the off brand ones she had been using.</li>
            <li> Glad I gave Revlon another try.</li>
            <li> and they love it</li>
            <li> The7y&#x27;re okay.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would love it.</li>
            <li> After tweezing for many years now, I&#x27;ve probably owned every brand there is.</li>
            <li> Like the top says...</li>
            <li> I love tweezers in every room.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite tweezer style.</li>
            <li> give me more control when tweezing my brows</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re OK.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Great tweezers that work really well.</li>
            <li> It is OK</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best tweezers I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> They would often pluck more than one eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li> I love Tweezerman, these are cheaper but work well.  </li>
            <li> nice and precise.</li>
            <li> Better to invest in the tweezerman equivalent which costs more</li>
            <li> i believe but better as a permanent solution</li>
            <li> i like most is the GRIP.</li>
            <li> It gets more than one at a time</li>
            <li> I love the slanted jaw</li>
            <li> These were ok..</li>
            <li> I feel like they need a grip at the end to grab the hairs better, but I use this product often.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t believe how much better my eyebrows look after using these.&lt;br /&gt;Great item for any beauty bag.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> textured grip makes sure you don&#x27;t slip</li>
            <li> I had purchased Avon tweezers and wasn&#x27;t too pleased .</li>
            <li> They work 100 times better than what I was using.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I got them.</li>
            <li> these are my favorite tweezers</li>
            <li> It is precise, has a pretty good grip, good size, and easy to work</li>
            <li> I had seen reviews that said Revlon slant tip were a good buy, but they dont grab the hair right.</li>
            <li> Very precise and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I loved these at first.</li>
            <li> And I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other brands and this is the best.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not the most accurate thing</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of using them, I find that I can much more precisely tweeze with these</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have bought it, precise and works the way I thought it would.</li>
            <li> These do have a better grip on the &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34;, but the finish on the exposed tips is not as smooth as Tweezerman.  </li>
            <li> These are really good tweezers and they do the job they were bought for very well</li>
            <li> work very well good price</li>
            <li> Most importantly, its controllable: it gets the hairs I want, easy.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend...heavy duty, good tip grip, and cute pattern on the handles!</li>
            <li> Slant tip with sharp edges is perfect for sliver removal.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are easy to grasp and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold onto and the slanted tip makes it easy to grab one hair at a time.</li>
            <li> and they have a strong grip.</li>
            <li> The perfect pair of tweezers with a sharp, precise edge.</li>
            <li> I found this slant tip pair to be sharp and provide excellent grip with a light</li>
            <li> BEST TWEEZERS HANDS DOWN</li>
            <li> An easy fit in your hand and easy to use that you will appreciate again and again.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty nice tweezer that has an accurate tip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these before and they were fine</li>
            <li> just how micro fine it is in my images here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> FINE HAIRS</li>
            <li> These tweezers work just fine.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers...  tweezers can get a little pricey for nice ones and these are well priced considering how well</li>
            <li> Comfortable grip.</li>
            <li> The grip also helps me from dropping it like the cheap ones my mom uses.</li>
            <li> They are a light blue/white swirly bubbly design thing?</li>
            <li> Fortunately my wife loves the design so I am keeping them (</li>
            <li> These are cheap and don&#x27;t grip anything well.</li>
            <li> Unlike a lot of cheap tweezers, the ends meet flush and don&#x27;t get misaligned after repeated use.</li>
            <li> Still, aesthetics aside, these are fabulous tweezers.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; tweezers, but these are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Plus, return them for free sharpening/adjusting or replacing (at their option) with just a $1.00 S/H charge.  </li>
            <li> not as precise as I&#x27;d like it to be....</li>
            <li> The tip is great and it holds well and all, but the Platinum has such a finer tip</li>
            <li> These tweezers are great, but the problem is the one I got is blue and has flowers designs on it.</li>
            <li> I stopped using Tweezerman  tweezers which are fabulous initially;but</li>
            <li> The slant allows for precise use.</li>
            <li> They work very well and are nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> These are great at getting those short stubby hair follicles.</li>
            <li> Enjoy if you purchase them if not then enjoy which ever ones you did find contentment in.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap and they pull out splinters or eyebrow hair like champs.</li>
            <li> tweezers wear out and if you drop them and the tip hits tile, it will mash any tweezers point and make it so they don&#x27;t exactly fit anymore</li>
            <li> Since so many people gave this model good reviews, I can only guess that there are discrepancies in the manufacturing process of this model.</li>
            <li> but it seemed that whatever Revlon ones I purchased in a store weren&#x27;t near as good as my original ones.</li>
            <li> The slant tip makes it quick and easy to pluck my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to accidentally grab your skin, though...</li>
            <li> so I am pretty confident with my abilities, but these tweezers were not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I think this tweezer is usually the best, but this time around, it just wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> You will never buy a different kind after you use them!</li>
            <li> Why not purchase this more affordable pair which lasts quite awhile as this is not my first pai of Revlon;s Expert Tweezer with slant.</li>
            <li> well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to describe why these are the best tweezers ever</li>
            <li> If a beginner like me can figure it out, you seasoned pros should be able to, too.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just what they look like, nice normal tweezers.  </li>
            <li> and I have styled my brows and am loving everything about my new sleek style.</li>
            <li> It is quick and accurate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert, but I have several pairs of tweezers, and for yanking out unwanted ear hair, these are by far the best.  </li>
            <li> So I love mine, him not so much.</li>
            <li> They have a nice professional look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really should buy a couple more...</li>
            <li> but hopefully will be good as back up</li>
            <li> Just mass produced tweezers here folks, good enough.</li>
            <li> Good basic beauty tweezer.  </li>
            <li> just a simple, good product</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite tweezers.  </li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re not bad.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product.</li>
            <li> So they were exactly what I expected, sturdy and strong, great pluckers.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok, I guess, but maybe the tweezers I originally wanted would have been better, but I received something different.</li>
            <li> seriously the best tweezers ever to buy.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and is still holding on.</li>
            <li> They also allow for adequate space between each point for pulling groups of follicles.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, doesn&#x27;t hold well.</li>
            <li> Idk why, but these tweezers hurt a little more than my old ones, but it doesn&#x27;t matter because for the price they are, they are really nice tweezers and they get the job done! :)</li>
            <li> After combing through all of the highly rated versions, I chose these guys and I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I think you are better off spending just a few more bucks for better quality.</li>
            <li> This is OK and has a nice grip but was not right for me.</li>
            <li> I lost my favorite pair of beauty tweezers while travelling and had to choose a new pair after 13 years.</li>
            <li> they work great but will keep hidden in shave bag on trips.</li>
            <li> and I love them so far!</li>
            <li> The gripping is perfect and it is small enough to satisfy any perfectionista.</li>
            <li> and these came first!</li>
            <li> Works great but breaks within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Sturdy, easy to hold, won&#x27;t slip through fingers and a decent price</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a pair of tweezers that i have completely fallen in love with.</li>
            <li> For the price, I was expecting something a bit more professional.</li>
            <li> This tweezer is more masculine than the packaging lets on, yet has a feminine touch.</li>
            <li> Nice solid and sturdy tweezers I use for plucking.</li>
            <li> razor bumps much better than some pair of old tweezers, get them now...</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> I had someone else do one when the unibrow came back and decided that I could just pluck my own &#x27;brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, work great, and are black</li>
            <li> These little tweezer are ideal for those people hitting 40 something or older who are discovering hairs in places they never had them before.</li>
            <li> I have only purchased two other tweezers and this one works best for me.</li>
            <li> Even though I have used a different slant tip model for years with good results, this particular model is defective and incapable of tweezing hairs.</li>
            <li> However, this cleans right off without difficulty.</li>
            <li> Price is right.</li>
            <li> And, the price is right.</li>
            <li> VERY precise tips, grind is very well aligned, as opposed to those cheap ones with molded tips that don&#x27;t quite line up properly.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp, and they fit in your hand nicely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is however, easy to cut the hair while plucking, and it is not as precise as with finer tip tweezers, to target individual hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These tweezers are suitable for plucking individual hairs.</li>
            <li> I would definitely spend more and get better ones, thankfully i found my old pair.</li>
            <li> great tweezers, good sharp points to help get in to hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> My biggest issue with tweezers in the past is how easy they are to lose (kind of like socks in the dryer)</li>
            <li> very very fast shipping with no problems.</li>
            <li> FIRST TRY EFFORTLESSLY</li>
            <li> They work really well and get the smallest eyebrow hair worth it would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Never any problems since she purchased the first pair she lost...</li>
            <li> So these work really well!  </li>
            <li> But other than that they work much better than any 1 or 2 dollar tweezers we have ever had!</li>
            <li> I purchased and used these today for the first time</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like it does in the picture.</li>
            <li> and of course Amazon is always my first choice of shopping.</li>
            <li> These are better than the last pair of tweezers I bought at the drug store.  </li>
            <li> I can grab 1 hair from a group and know that I can pluck the exact one I am aiming for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this to put into my first aid kit.  </li>
            <li> , I first came across it at a blog called House Unseen Life Unscripted or something like that.</li>
            <li> Ignore the negative comments as these tweezers are great.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a better tweezer before or since, I&#x27;ve even had people ask to borrow this specific tweezer.</li>
            <li> Tweezers that are good are not cheap.  </li>
            <li> Great coach we have ever tried is so funny last very long time</li>
            <li> that had ridges on the flat surface of the tip which was awesome for grasping small hairs.</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t work that great for me, the fine tip made it difficult to grasp hair will.  </li>
            <li> I got these for my husband after he had bought about 6 other tweezers and kept throwing them out because they didn&#x27;t tweeze effectively.  </li>
            <li> These are okay tweezers but they dulled up pretty fast with basic use.</li>
            <li> so believe me they really work if you want a little more grip then get the ones with the diamond dust their more grip worthy but the diamond dust does wear off but worth it while you have it in the mean time i&#x27;m loving these ones SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> and it did not do a good job grabbing small hair on the face</li>
            <li> These are good quality tweezers and the tips are fine enough to get the short hair just starting to regrow.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re larger and nice and sharp with fantastic grip.</li>
            <li> It fits well in the hand and the tip is precise enough to grab on the first try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These were packaged relatively well and easy to remove from their packaging.  </li>
            <li> I would easily buy these again in the future.   </li>
            <li> As long as the tips are clean, they will grab VERY fine or coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It has a nice point (not too sharp, not too dull) and it is very easy to select the hair you want and then easily grabs it and pulls it out smoothly without breaking it off or slipping.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, can&#x27;t grab super short hairs and sometimes it breaks the hair, but overall it gets most hair out the way you want.</li>
            <li> They grip strongly with a flat contact surface.</li>
            <li> It is razor accurate, very well made, and will last quite awhile.  </li>
            <li> haha),</li>
            <li> The thin tip in the tweezers gives you a better view while plucking your eyebrows, and it also gives you a more precise plucking experience that prevents you from plucking several hairs at a time.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem to work very well.</li>
            <li> These won&#x27;t grab much..</li>
            <li> The Platinum really is much finer and easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like these.</li>
            <li> They work really well and are well made.</li>
            <li> They pull the hair out by the root without much effort</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and work very well.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise.  </li>
            <li> I feel the slant tip is preventing me from really grasping the hairs so they can be pulled out at the root.  </li>
            <li> I really like these tweezers.</li>
            <li> they have way to much spring to  them and</li>
            <li> so it grabs really well.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> I have had better and do, Not as I expected.</li>
            <li> So much easier than trying to use my hands or a pair of pliers.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much slippage when trying to grip a hair or two.</li>
            <li> I have never paid this much for tweezers but never had any work this well.</li>
            <li> I got a facial in October and the beautician gave me a free eyebrow wax.  </li>
            <li> The tips/edges are very well balanced (</li>
            <li> some ones I&#x27;ve used didn&#x27;t line up straight).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- very well machined tip that will grab absolutely the smallest hairs</li>
            <li> /&gt;they don&#x27;t really have any cons...</li>
            <li> Worked real well for that.</li>
            <li> I absolutely would purchase them again if needed.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here, does a good job for tweezers and was relatively affordable.</li>
            <li> the materiel they are made of Is super cheap and they  got black ALL Over my hand?</li>
            <li> Other tweezers will lose their grip after many times of usage.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I have purchased other tweezers at two or even three times the price and they were not two or three times better.</li>
            <li> But as I continue to use them more, They seem as if they&#x27;re not as sharp and have that grip I need to pull stubborn hairs</li>
            <li> Lost my other tweezers and glad to get them.  </li>
            <li> They are lightweight, unlike my other Revlon tweezers, which were substantially heavier and better.</li>
            <li> I had hoped the slant tip would make these tweezers better than your average pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found myself a new product I&#x27;ll be repeatedly buying because I always seem to lose them!</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of the Cover girl slanted tweezers, but these give me way more leverage with a lot less effort.</li>
            <li> Was purchased as a gift and this present recipient was happy and I haven&#x27;t heard anything negative.</li>
            <li> I wanted a decent tweezer to ensure I could pull out a splinter or what not.  </li>
            <li> They are not $30, that&#x27;s the main thing.</li>
            <li> Tip is aligned well and grips decently.  </li>
            <li> They work better than most tweezers I have tried, even expensive ones.</li>
            <li> This tweezer gets every hair no matter how little, and it&#x27;s very comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them</li>
            <li> Revlon Expert Tweezers  Slant tip 100% please and would highly recommend these Tweezers to anyone who thinking about buying them</li>
            <li> Heavy duty and has very precise ends.  </li>
            <li> High quality all around - from the size, the grip, the surface texture to the quality of the steel...wish all products have this type of quality specification.</li>
            <li> Well this tweezer is good enough as it passed the single hair pull on multiple occasions.  </li>
            <li> I use them for many things - like a little tool.  </li>
            <li> so you just have to plan a little better.  </li>
            <li> My mom has this old tweezer much like http://www.thisnext.com/item/18EF450A/Sephora-Sephora-Brand-Eyebrow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be shocked if you don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re tge best too!</li>
            <li> i used these for normal plucking and for getting those ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> They feel heavy and durable, but are able to grab hair without hesitation.</li>
            <li> This product only proves again to stay with a name brand.</li>
            <li> He made me buy a new pair in a normal color.</li>
            <li> Could be better and not so stiff.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as an add on item and was very surprised at the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> They grip solidly and do their job better than any other tweezers I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I am on my second of this tweezer now, I lost the first.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know anything about grabbing the same strand 10 times because my strands come out on the first try every time.</li>
            <li> The edges didn&#x27;t match up everywhere, only on one part of the tweezer, so if I wanted to pull a thin hair, I&#x27;d be very precise and make sure I used that tiny part of the tweezer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to pull out little hairs</li>
            <li> ... very very fine metal splinters... or whatever you are having to pull&lt;br /&gt;- thickly painted finish that doesn&#x27;t chip or corrode ever...</li>
            <li> Excellent....product as expected, works well, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I thought they were super cute, but if you&#x27;re looking for a plain black set, you mightn&#x27;t get one.</li>
            <li> The finger areas are not slick, like my old ones, making them easier to use.</li>
            <li> They came in this blue flower design, my husband said they are embarassing to use, I like them better than the black.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- wide tip for such fine tweezers means you can grab a lot at one time&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t experienced cutting hairs like some of the reviews mentioned.</li>
            <li> Package was VERY worn too - looked to be several years old and tattered.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I no longer have an excuse for not maintaining shaped eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I gave one of my adult daughter since the ones she had</li>
            <li> I work with wood, and frequently get splinters.  </li>
            <li> My old tweezers were too clunky.</li>
            <li> I imagine my old ones are discontinued, so I tried this one.</li>
            <li> At this rate I might as well use a shaver - at least with a shaver you cover more ground.</li>
            <li> I still prefer my old tweezers</li>
            <li> When shopping for tweezers I was surprised by the prices.</li>
            <li> after 3 months, it won&#x27;t pick up anything except near one end of the tip</li>
            <li> I love these my second pair only because I lost the other pair</li>
            <li> Now I know to buy tweezers in person only, to ensure sharp enough with more precision.</li>
            <li> Also, if you find the grip slipping, a quick clean with alcohol usually fixes that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice sharp tip easy to control and pull out those little gray suckers</li>
            <li> The tweezers that I received had a flower pattern on them, not black as shown.</li>
            <li> I only gave them 2 stars because they are of a decent quality material.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this as a second set for my First aid kit.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty, but it&#x27;s definitely a shock to open something expecting one thing and receiving something else!</li>
            <li> Some tweezers are really tough to pinch together with just two fingers, but these are quite easy and very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using these tweezers since i was in high school, and ordered some last week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dozens of other pairs that after a few months use the blades seem to become misaligned, dull, and no longer nearly as effective at pulling anything - let alone something as fine as hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tweezers are cheaply soldered together (not any kind of spring) and in both cases the tweezers failed within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> If you need basic tweezers for normal uses these are a go.</li>
            <li> the become completely dull pretty fast!</li>
            <li> They are a little sharp at the ends, but I think that makes them easier and better.</li>
            <li> I have lost these tweezers several times and I always go back and buy the exact same ones.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like these and found them sharp and irritating to my skin compared to my more rounded tip revlon tweezers.</li>
            <li> The size of the tip on these make it easy to grab larger things (like full hairs), but harder to grab a small object (partial hair or splinter).</li>
            <li> maybe I expected too much.</li>
            <li> My old tweezers ended up breaking after several years.</li>
            <li> This can barely hold on to hairs.</li>
            <li> They perform as expected and seem very durable.</li>
            <li> Not amazing because it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li> use it almost everyday because I have full eyebrows that need to be groomed quite regularly.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s nothing more frustrating than trying to use tweezers that just won&#x27;t grab.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve broken many hairs trying to use these tweezers.</li>
            <li> i was tired of trying so many of those and relied on the reviews to order this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quick note: the tweezers I got were not black as pictured, but white with a teal flower pattern on them.</li>
            <li> Please be very careful with handling them and make sure not sure to drop them</li>
            <li> Did not consistently meet for a tight tweeze, but it was relatively cheap</li>
            <li> The color was not black, a white background with blue floral pattern.</li>
            <li> What can you really say about it other than it works, A goods but and cheaper here than at the local stores,</li>
            <li> Love Revlon&#x27;s slant tip tweezer, as it&#x27;s not too thick and not too sharp.</li>
            <li> While the picture is black, my tweezers are primarily white with light and dark teal circles on them.</li>
            <li> The tips are very sharp, but very precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only use the tweezers a couple of times a week, but the first one broke within a few months.  </li>
            <li> The sharpness of the tweezing edge and tip easily nicked &amp; tore the delicate skin around my eye brow, no matter how careful I was.</li>
            <li> The pair I had before lasted for 7 years, and were better at pulling hairs in the first place, so I was very disappointed when I first tried these out.  </li>
            <li> ethic renders these pretty useless much of the time.  </li>
            <li> but they were some sort of strange blue and white feminine looking pattern.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really warn you that the slanted tips are pretty sharp and thin.</li>
            <li> I use these daily, and they have turned out to be very long lasting.</li>
            <li> So you are left trying to pull the same single hair out 10 times.</li>
            <li> Yes, you can ship them to the company to sharpen, but it takes a long time to get them back, shipping plus ship insurance adds up.</li>
            <li> Invest in a good pair instead of the 99c store type - you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I recommended this product to all my family members and friends, because I tried a few different brands (Sally Hansen tweezers with new diamond cut sucks!), and this one never failed me!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sharp on the edges as you would normally expect of a slant tip, and the tips are too both too dull and too thick to properly grab onto fine hair or even a small splinter.</li>
            <li> I have 2 of these, one is very sharp and breaks off the hairs sometimes, and the other is sort of sharp, but really gets those pesky hairs!</li>
            <li> ...not sharp edged enough, crooked when pinch/close together.</li>
            <li> They are sharp, so you will likely accidentally catch your skin and it will leave a red mark or puncture it (and hurt).</li>
            <li> If I am not careful, I can scratch my skin with them and make myself bleed, so I just use a little extra care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m comparing these to Tweezerman, which are fantastic but expensive.  </li>
            <li> these will look like the day you got them long after you wear them out</li>
            <li> The edge is far too sharp and  the gasp too stiff to make any tweezing possible.</li>
            <li> The point is sharp enough to get ingrown hairs without damaging skin.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny bit sharp</li>
            <li> what the other girls do to look professional&amp;#34; thing last semester, I&#x27;ve decided that it&#x27;s probably something I should do.  </li>
            <li> This was no where as sharp nor gripped as well as my last one.</li>
            <li> will grab every single tiny little hair possible.  </li>
            <li> Not worth a dollar, these went in the garbage after the second try.</li>
            <li> That aside, they only lasted for two months before they broke in half.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other, more expensive brands, but the tweezers were too sharp and cut my eyebrows in half when I attempted to pull them out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking I was going to get a solid black tweezer set</li>
            <li> but Ive never had tweezers that allowed me to get every single little tiny hair on my ears.</li>
            <li> It gets every single hair even peach fuzz!</li>
            <li> 2015 Jan - Have had few tweezers in the past, not sure why this one was highly rated, maybe is my hair ((:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad one, but definitely not a good one.</li>
            <li> These are sharp enough to grab small hairs, but it&#x27;s not as stiff as my old pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are bad to okay which is reflected in the price.  </li>
            <li> Total waste.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about your run of the mill eyebrow plucker.</li>
            <li> Item was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Just be careful they grab the hair but can also grab the skin too if you don&#x27;t pay attention just like any tweezers.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> The tips of the tweezers (where you are grabbing the item to remove) is rough</li>
            <li> If you only have needle nose tweezer, your missing out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worked well with wet fingers</li>
            <li> My experience with this item was very negative and I would not recommend this particular style of tweezer.</li>
            <li> Not sharp at all hard to use</li>
            <li> I have bought all manner of different ones in the past and none work like these.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy any other tweezers ever.</li>
            <li> Look at other reviews.</li>
            <li> The slant tip edge was so overly sharp that any hair it touched was sliced through like a razor.</li>
            <li> These things can grab things other things cannot.</li>
            <li> my other tweezers can&#x27;t hope to grasp.</li>
            <li> The tips are even and sharp.</li>
            <li> I can count on one hand the number of times I&#x27;ve failed to pull a hair on the first try with these tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It says \\&quot;made in Pakistan\\&quot; inside and the metal is so sharp that I cut my skin while trying to use the tweezer.</li>
            <li> i ordered these 2 days after about 20 other things.</li>
            <li> It only looks small and cuddly.&lt;br /&gt;According</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll recommend to other users.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that the uncoated tip of the tweezers can rust if left wet.</li>
            <li> it does get all the tiny hard to catch hair.</li>
            <li> This tweezer is sturdy and will last you quite awhile, however it&#x27;s hardly an &amp;#34;expert&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I had a Revlon tweezer that I had been using for years but it finally went dull</li>
            <li> Just an average</li>
            <li> They are merely average.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to locate one like that, but at least this one has a wider flat tip.</li>
            <li> Both of my pairs were just black as for color.</li>
            <li> So I ordered the tweezers thinking they&#x27;d be black</li>
            <li> after about 2 months they just become mediocre tweezers that become increasingly more difficult to grab hairs with.</li>
            <li> Removes hair that is slightly showing up.</li>
            <li> One of the reasons I chose these tweezers is because they are black in the photo and without designs on it.</li>
            <li> mine came in black.</li>
            <li> They make eyebrow tweeting less of a pain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad but I can&#x27;t expect that a third one will be any different.</li>
            <li> After buying several flimsy, useless tweezers from the store I finally found these ones on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Found these for $3 less than in the store.</li>
            <li> Tight where it matters.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a lot that can be said about a pair of tweezers, but what little can be said, these Revlon Expert Tweezers do well.  </li>
            <li> i thought the tip of the tweezer would be a little longer.</li>
            <li> They fell off the counter and got tip bent just a little to point to where they could no longer be used.</li>
            <li> They pull the little hairs out seemlessly.</li>
            <li> They also get the little ones that I used to pick at for minutes at a time, without a problem.</li>
            <li> They grasp the hairs with little to no effort.</li>
            <li> that I barely had the stregnth to push the 2 sides into contact with one another.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - This Revlon Expert Slant Tip Tweezer is useless due to manufacturing defects or design flaws.</li>
            <li> IT S NOT PRECISE</li>
            <li> THE TIPS CANT HOLD FIRM HAIR, JUST TOUCH IT.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this style of Revlon tweezer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t slip and holds firmly.</li>
            <li> Too Heavy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even waste my time trying to return them</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t even get a grip of my eyebrows, don&#x27;t even waste your money on this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> What a waste and can&#x27;t even return it.</li>
            <li> I would spend the extra dollar and change to get a decent tweezer than be left with a useless piece of metal that looks like a tweezer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!!!</li>
            <li> Thought we were getting BLACK!  </li>
            <li> super disappointed.</li>
            <li> me, if a tweezer cannot grip a single hair, then it&#x27;s no good.  </li>
            <li> They stay tight and sturdy!</li>
            <li> I usually twitz a few hair from my eyebrow before I do my make up.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to handle.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get the small hairs....</li>
            <li> Now it is just ordinary.  </li>
            <li> but instead they trim the hairs :/</li>
            <li> I use these to work with small ribbon cables.  </li>
            <li> they get the small stubborn hairs that bug the krap out of you.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it happened, but at some point in our relationship my wife got me to do her eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The EZ Grip handle was so stiff that I had to press the handle as hard</li>
            <li> I hate ones that wont clamp right</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to do tweezers well</li>
            <li> My cafeful attemps to tweeze resulted in a couple of nicks in my skin, the cutting off of several unintended brow hairs and a sore fingers from trying to force the misaligned tips together.</li>
            <li> Used to get the all silver Revlon slanted tweezers, but they have slowly disappeared.</li>
            <li> not much more to it!</li>
            <li> These were so poorly made and dull</li>
            <li> Very hard to use.</li>
            <li> the have to be squeezed very hard  </li>
            <li> It was broken when I received it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i was a little disappointed with that</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with these old-fashioned tweezers</li>
            <li> Sounds silly</li>
            <li> Something was wrong with the paint they applied to the metal....</li>
            <li> Bit expensive though.</li>
            <li> but if they literally had something that could only pick up one hair at a time all of you would go insane.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Came with wrong color - we got a very crazy design on ours.  </li>
            <li> I tried SO hard to give these tweezers a chance, but they are absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> Into the trash it went :-(</li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like they used to.  :(  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was disappointed, however.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought these, hoping they&#x27;d do well as replacements, and I have not been disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The worst feeling is when you go to clamp onto a hair or splinter</li>
            <li> these tweezers are awful</li>
            <li> Worst tweezers.  </li>

            <li> BEST TWEEZERS HANDS DOWN I PREFER THEM OVER TWEEZERMAN, SO DONT HESITATE ON THESE, NO JOKE WILL GET ANY HAIR FIRST TRY EFFORTLESSLY</li>
            <li> Just as described...They work really well and get the smallest eyebrow hair worth it would buy it again. Great product</li>
            <li> great tweezers. i used these for normal plucking and for getting those ingrown hairs. usually grabs the hair on the first try. no complaints here. just need to hide them from the wife.</li>
            <li> Awesome, these are the best tweezers, buy no other!</li>
            <li> I had a pair of these for two months.  The pair I had before lasted for 7 years, and were better at pulling hairs in the first place, so I was very disappointed when I first tried these out.  The edges didn&#x27;t match up everywhere, only on one part of the tweezer, so if I wanted to pull a thin hair, I&#x27;d be very precise and make sure I used that tiny part of the tweezer so it would actually work.  That aside, they only lasted for two months before they broke in half.  I went to pull a hair, and snap.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great for use at the hair salon</li>
            <li> My wife asked for these cause her pair got lost, hers have never broken and work perfectly.. Never any problems since she purchased the first pair she lost... Great product.. Would recommend</li>
            <li> Great product. Comfortable grip. The tip is cut at an angle that makes it perfect for fine-tuned plucking.</li>
            <li> I got these for my husband after he had bought about 6 other tweezers and kept throwing them out because they didn&#x27;t tweeze effectively.  These, according to him, are great and will catch even the finest and shortest of hairs.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty nice tweezer that has an accurate tip. The grip also helps me from dropping it like the cheap ones my mom uses. It&#x27;s easy to pull out little hairs and I haven&#x27;t experienced cutting hairs like some of the reviews mentioned.</li>
            <li> So these work really well!  The only problem I had with them is that as another reviewer said...they don&#x27;t look like the picture!  They are a light blue/white swirly bubbly design thing? I will try to upload a picture.  Fortunately my wife loves the design so I am keeping them (and I would even if she didn&#x27;t because they&#x27;re tweezers...haha), but I am only going to give four stars instead of five for them because the picture is misleading.  But other than that they work much better than any 1 or 2 dollar tweezers we have ever had!</li>
            <li> Idk why, but these tweezers hurt a little more than my old ones, but it doesn&#x27;t matter because for the price they are, they are really nice tweezers and they get the job done! :)</li>
            <li> I bought two, one for me and one to send to my husband who is deployed. They came in this blue flower design, my husband said they are embarassing to use, I like them better than the black. He made me buy a new pair in a normal color. The product works great though, I rate it up there with tweezerman which are much more expensive, they don&#x27;t have the edge that tweezerman does but thats helpful for me because i don&#x27;t accidently pinch my skin or break off hairs instead of plucking them. So I love mine, him not so much.</li>
            <li> worth the money.  Ends ( tips) meet.  Makes a pain in the tail job easier.  Tweezers that are good are not cheap.  These tweezers deliver bang for your buck.  you want a pair to actually work..these do and well!</li>
            <li> I never thought there would be a big difference in tweezers until I tried this. It was a lot easier to remove hairs than the standard tweezers you can find at a drug store. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone not looking to spend a lot on tweezers.</li>
            <li> I exclusively buy these tweezers.  I have bought all manner of different ones in the past and none work like these.</li>
            <li> I pluck errant hairs around my beard and mustache as well as from my nose. These tweezers are amazing. They grip strongly with a flat contact surface. I won&#x27;t buy any other tweezers ever.</li>
            <li> PLEASE DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT S NOT PRECISE AT ALL. I CANT PICK UP ANY SHORT HAIR ON MY CHIN.  THE TIPS CANT HOLD FIRM HAIR, JUST TOUCH IT.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> really excellent tweezers, even better than I was expecting!&lt;br /&gt;would recommend!</li>
            <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I use these daily, and they have turned out to be very long lasting. Other tweezers will lose their grip after many times of usage.&lt;br /&gt;2) The thin tip in the tweezers gives you a better view while plucking your eyebrows, and it also gives you a more precise plucking experience that prevents you from plucking several hairs at a time.&lt;br /&gt;3) They have a nice professional look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None that I know of. Look at other reviews.</li>
            <li> Have bought these for years.  Have tried others, but these are the best.  Hold the shape/tension.  Tight where it matters.  Precision. Well-made.  You will lose them before you wear them out.</li>
            <li> great tweezers, good sharp points to help get in to hard to reach areas.  i use these for cleaning my fish tank.  no rust.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are easy to grasp and easy to use.  I knew buy the name &amp;#34;Revlon&amp;#34;they would be a good buy.  And I was not disappointed!  These are really good tweezers and they do the job they were bought for very well</li>
            <li> I seem to always lose tweezers and prefer ones with a wider slant tip. I had one once that had ridges on the flat surface of the tip which was awesome for grasping small hairs. I can&#x27;t seem to locate one like that, but at least this one has a wider flat tip.</li>
            <li> These are cheap and don&#x27;t grip anything well. Total waste.</li>
            <li> These last and do the job. Unlike a lot of cheap tweezers, the ends meet flush and don&#x27;t get misaligned after repeated use.</li>
            <li> The perfect pair of tweezers with a sharp, precise edge. Gets the job done. Easy to use. What more can one say about a pair of tweezers?</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. They&#x27;re not tweezerman but they&#x27;re not bad. Sturdy, easy to hold, won&#x27;t slip through fingers and a decent price</li>
            <li> These are, simply, the best tweezers ever. They grip solidly and do their job better than any other tweezers I have ever used. I highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick note: the tweezers I got were not black as pictured, but white with a teal flower pattern on them. I thought they were super cute, but if you&#x27;re looking for a plain black set, you mightn&#x27;t get one. Still, aesthetics aside, these are fabulous tweezers.</li>
            <li> I always do my own eyebrows at home, have been for 10 years and get a lot of compliments so I am pretty confident with my abilities, but these tweezers were not what I was expecting. I had seen reviews that said Revlon slant tip were a good buy, but they dont grab the hair right. I don&#x27;t think the edges properly line up. So you are left trying to pull the same single hair out 10 times. Not worth a dollar, these went in the garbage after the second try. I&#x27;ll stick with tweezerman.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tweezer. It works well as a tweezer. Not much to say about your run of the mill eyebrow plucker. It arrived quickly and is still holding on.</li>
            <li> The tips were supose to be even but there not. I&#x27;ve bought these before and they were fine I guess I was just unlucky. In proper condition I would give this product 4 out of 5 stars but since these were messed up I&#x27;m giving them 2.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers of this style I&#x27;ve purchased. VERY precise tips, grind is very well aligned, as opposed to those cheap ones with molded tips that don&#x27;t quite line up properly. These are now the only ones I buy.</li>
            <li> I have 2 of these, one is very sharp and breaks off the hairs sometimes, and the other is sort of sharp, but really gets those pesky hairs! I got this one, a third, and it was so slippery and didn&#x27;t grab the hairs at all. I think this tweezer is usually the best, but this time around, it just wasn&#x27;t. Into the trash it went :-(</li>
            <li> Meth commercial, here I come!</li>
            <li> Works great but breaks within a few weeks.  I&#x27;ve purchased this twice now.  The tweezers are cheaply soldered together (not any kind of spring) and in both cases the tweezers failed within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used Revlon&#x27;s Expert Slant Tip Tweezers for years with good results for the price. When I saw the newer model with the EZ Grip handle I thought it would improve on the earlier model. In fact, I ordered 2 pair so I would not have to reorder for a while. When I went to use the tweezer, I noticed it was heavier than what I had been using. The slant tip edge was so overly sharp that any hair it touched was sliced through like a razor. The sharpness of the tweezing edge and tip easily nicked &amp; tore the delicate skin around my eye brow, no matter how careful I was. The EZ Grip handle was so stiff that I had to press the handle as hard that I barely had the stregnth to push the 2 sides into contact with one another.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - This Revlon Expert Slant Tip Tweezer is useless due to manufacturing defects or design flaws. The edge is far too sharp and  the gasp too stiff to make any tweezing possible. Even though I have used a different slant tip model for years with good results, this particular model is defective and incapable of tweezing hairs.My cafeful attemps to tweeze resulted in a couple of nicks in my skin, the cutting off of several unintended brow hairs and a sore fingers from trying to force the misaligned tips together. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this style of Revlon tweezer. Since so many people gave this model good reviews, I can only guess that there are discrepancies in the manufacturing process of this model. The 2 pair I purchased were both equally defective and could not be used.  My experience with this item was very negative and I would not recommend this particular style of tweezer. Revlon needs to look at what happened that their quality assurance people allowed this nonfunctional &amp; potentially harmful product to be distributed for sale.</li>
            <li> Being an esthetician having a good tweezers is very important. The slant is at the perfect angle to grab short hairs. The point is sharp enough to get ingrown hairs without damaging skin. I have been using these tweezers since i was in high school, and ordered some last week and they are as well made as always. The color was not black, a white background with blue floral pattern. i was a little disappointed with that but i highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I purchased and used these today for the first time and I love them so far! The slant tip makes it quick and easy to pluck my eyebrows. It doesn&#x27;t slip and holds firmly. Best tweezers so far, they&#x27;re inexpensive and you can find it almost anywhere (I bought mine at Target).</li>
            <li> My favorite tweezers! I was hesitant to buy &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; tweezers, but these are fantastic. Unfortunately, I no longer have an excuse for not maintaining shaped eyebrows.</li>
            <li> These are terrific tweezers that get the job done.</li>
            <li> I recommended this product to all my family members and friends, because I tried a few different brands (Sally Hansen tweezers with new diamond cut sucks!), and this one never failed me! The gripping is perfect and it is small enough to satisfy any perfectionista.</li>
            <li> My mom has this old tweezer much like http://www.thisnext.com/item/18EF450A/Sephora-Sephora-Brand-Eyebrow and I find it to grip the hairs much more effectively.</li>
            <li> Love Revlon&#x27;s slant tip tweezer, as it&#x27;s not too thick and not too sharp. I&#x27;ve tried other, more expensive brands, but the tweezers were too sharp and cut my eyebrows in half when I attempted to pull them out. This set of tweezers does the job perfectly!</li>
            <li> Received a substitute tweezers not as shown.  The tweezers that I received had a flower pattern on them, not black as shown.</li>
            <li> The tweezer set I received doesn&#x27;t look like what is shown on the listing when I ordered it. They&#x27;re ok, I guess, but maybe the tweezers I originally wanted would have been better, but I received something different.</li>
            <li> Who cares about the print (yes, I got the blue/white design), the mechanics of this tweezer is amazing.  It grabs onto the finest or thickest hair to be tweezed without losing it&#x27;s grip.  Excellent.</li>
            <li> I bought the Revlon Slant tip Tweezer. I have been using the Slant tip since I could remember. Anyway I was on a trip when I lost my pair. I&#x27;m in Afghanistan now so I thought \\&quot;darn it&#x27;s going to take forever to ship.\\&quot; I was so happy when the product arrive just 5 days after I bought it. I am one happy customer!</li>
            <li> Works great, and also quick shipping. Perfect to keep in your purse. Gets the hair real good, doesn&#x27;t hurt. Looks exactly like it does in the picture.</li>
            <li> This tweezer is the only one I use. It&#x27;s the only one that works perfectly. It hasn&#x27;t rust and had maintained it&#x27;s shape. It can withstand the pressure I put on it from my fingers. Most importantly, its controllable: it gets the hairs I want, easy. Only flaw is that I can&#x27;t seem to find them in stores.</li>
            <li> The title says it all. Plus, return them for free sharpening/adjusting or replacing (at their option) with just a $1.00 S/H charge.  I have purchased other tweezers at two or even three times the price and they were not two or three times better.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, can&#x27;t grab super short hairs and sometimes it breaks the hair, but overall it gets most hair out the way you want. I have yet to find a pair of tweezers that i have completely fallen in love with.</li>
            <li> Used to get the all silver Revlon slanted tweezers, but they have slowly disappeared. I bought these, hoping they&#x27;d do well as replacements, and I have not been disappointed! They&#x27;re larger and nice and sharp with fantastic grip. As long as the tips are clean, they will grab VERY fine or coarse hair. Both of my pairs were just black as for color.</li>
            <li> So I ordered the tweezers thinking they&#x27;d be black but they were some sort of strange blue and white feminine looking pattern. End of the day they work great but will keep hidden in shave bag on trips.</li>
            <li> They feel heavy and durable, but are able to grab hair without hesitation.</li>
            <li> after about 2 months they just become mediocre tweezers that become increasingly more difficult to grab hairs with. think of them as disposable or order something else.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get the small hairs....not as precise as I&#x27;d like it to be....only somewhat satisfactory - would never purchase it again</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used. I highly recommend them</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem to work very well. I had the same pair for about a year. These won&#x27;t grab much..Very hard to use. Maybe they&#x27;re not alined..I&#x27;m not sure..Not happy</li>
            <li> This used to be my favorite tweezer until I found Revlon Platinum Tweezer, Slant Tip.  Now it is just ordinary.  The tip is great and it holds well and all, but the Platinum has such a finer tip and I have uploaded just how micro fine it is in my images here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/customer-gallery/AXQNEMI9N0Z2D/ref&#x3D;cm_aya_bb_lists&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I haven&#x27;t uploaded a picture of the Revlon Expert Tweezer here, it is similar to the Tweezerman tip in width.  The Platinum really is much finer and easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> These things can grab things other things cannot.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are suitable for plucking individual hairs. I tried several inexpensive pairs before purchasing these. My one complaint is that the uncoated tip of the tweezers can rust if left wet. However, this cleans right off without difficulty. I recently bought a second pair for my gym bag.</li>
            <li> What can you really say about it other than it works, A goods but and cheaper here than at the local stores,</li>
            <li> It was broken when I received it.&lt;br /&gt;So I guess it&#x27;s quality is not that good! Not amazing because it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li> Excellent for my eyebrows</li>
            <li> Favorite tweezer.  It works so good!</li>
            <li> I really like these. They are sleek and hairs don&#x27;t slip through them. They are everything you would expect from Tweezers. By far the best that I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> work very well good price</li>
            <li> Love these! It&#x27;s super easy to accidentally grab your skin, though... so beware! Once I got used to them, they pull hairs my other tweezers can&#x27;t hope to grasp.</li>
            <li> I love this tweezer! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different tweezers, but this one works the best, and at this price, you can&#x27;t beat it! It has a nice point (not too sharp, not too dull) and it is very easy to select the hair you want and then easily grabs it and pulls it out smoothly without breaking it off or slipping.</li>
            <li> It is precise, has a pretty good grip, good size, and easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it almost everyday because I have full eyebrows that need to be groomed quite regularly. No complaints whatsoever and I&#x27;d say it has been one of the best tweezers I&#x27;ve owned since the age of 18 (now in mid 30s).</li>
            <li> The slant tip provides terrific &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; power - best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned -- good price, good quality -- can&#x27;t go wrong with these old-fashioned tweezers</li>
            <li> I love these my second pair only because I lost the other pair</li>
            <li> Too Heavy. Sounds silly but it is</li>
            <li> Thank you , wonderful product arrived quickly and just as described&lt;br /&gt;Have a nice weekend</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers out there. You will never buy a different kind after you use them!</li>
            <li> I lost my favorite and most reliable tweezers so I ordered these because I needed them . But as I continue to use them more, They seem as if they&#x27;re not as sharp and have that grip I need to pull stubborn hairs but instead they trim the hairs :/</li>
            <li> These are good quality tweezers and the tips are fine enough to get the short hair just starting to regrow.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are bad to okay which is reflected in the price.  They cut hairs instead of grasping them ethic renders these pretty useless much of the time.  I would definitely spend more and get better ones, thankfully i found my old pair.</li>
            <li> I had Revlon tweezers years ago but it seemed that whatever Revlon ones I purchased in a store weren&#x27;t near as good as my original ones. I finally thought I would try some online and of course Amazon is always my first choice of shopping. Well,just for the heck of it because they were on $6 something I decided to buy two pairs. Glad I did because these are the best ones I purchased since my original ones. I gave one of my adult daughter since the ones she had were useless(they weren&#x27;t Revlon brand) and she said they work so much better than the off brand ones she had been using. Glad I gave Revlon another try.</li>
            <li> These are great tweezers at a great price! I&#x27;d definitely recommend these tweezers. They work really well and are well made.</li>
            <li> I had a pair of Revlon tweezers from almost 20 years ago and they finally stopped grabbing the hairs. I just purchased these as a replacement and they work perfect - grabbing every hair I can find. They pull the hair out by the root without much effort and I hope to have these for the next 20 yrs. I have bought more expensive tweezers and cannot find anything that works as well as these.</li>
            <li> Must have for a medical bag</li>
            <li> Really good pair of tweezers. Just a tiny bit sharp but it does it job perfectly. Removes hair that is slightly showing up. Do recommend it</li>
            <li> Item was everything I expected. Was purchased as a gift and this present recipient was happy and I haven&#x27;t heard anything negative.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Arrived on time and work very well.</li>
            <li> really really really good. it does get all the tiny hard to catch hair. i even tweeze hair off my brothers  and they love it</li>
            <li> This may be an efficient tool but, Revlon tests on animals. If you care please do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like they used to.  :(  Everything these days being produced to be disposable - grrrrr!</li>
            <li> seriously the best tweezers ever to buy. they&#x27;re great. grab is perfect and never misses.</li>
            <li> The best tweezers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I needed and an extre set of tweezers and these are great! Fair cost and almost as good as my tweezer man brand ones. I&#x27;d recommend!</li>
            <li> These are better than the last pair of tweezers I bought at the drug store.  Easy to hold onto and the slanted tip makes it easy to grab one hair at a time.</li>
            <li> I lost my favorite pair of beauty tweezers while travelling and had to choose a new pair after 13 years. After combing through all of the highly rated versions, I chose these guys and I am glad that I did. They work so well-better than the pair that I lost.</li>
            <li> This product works great. It fits well in the hand and the tip is precise enough to grab on the first try.</li>
            <li> These were so poorly made and dull I had to throw them out. I didn&#x27;t even waste my time trying to return them I was so upset. I will only and continue to use tweezerman.</li>
            <li> They work great. I usually twitz a few hair from my eyebrow before I do my make up. It is quick and accurate.</li>
            <li> The7y&#x27;re okay.  Nothing to write home about!!!!!</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise.  I bought two of these thinking they would be very good; are NOT, imo.  Another throw away.</li>
            <li> This tweezer is sturdy and will last you quite awhile, however it&#x27;s hardly an &amp;#34;expert&amp;#34; tweezer. It&#x27;s not sharp on the edges as you would normally expect of a slant tip, and the tips are too both too dull and too thick to properly grab onto fine hair or even a small splinter. For the price, I was expecting something a bit more professional.</li>
            <li> I have went thru a lot of tweezers.  And these are by far the best ones I have ever purchased!  They stay tight and sturdy!</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering regular tip tweezers. I knew it said slanted but it doesn&#x27;t really warn you that the slanted tips are pretty sharp and thin. I don&#x27;t like them at all. I only gave them 2 stars because they are of a decent quality material.</li>
            <li> Slant tip is good, grip is good, everything you could need in a pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li> I thought I would love it. After tweezing for many years now, I&#x27;ve probably owned every brand there is. I will keep using it but it&#x27;s not the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Like the top says...Does the job,Carefull on the non name one,they don&#x27;t work like this one does..&lt;br /&gt;No I can pluck away</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like these and found them sharp and irritating to my skin compared to my more rounded tip revlon tweezers. Now that I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of using them, I find that I can much more precisely tweeze with these and they have a strong grip. If I am not careful, I can scratch my skin with them and make myself bleed, so I just use a little extra care.</li>
            <li> This tweezer is more masculine than the packaging lets on, yet has a feminine touch. I guess you could say it&#x27;s gender-neutral. Anyhow, it pinches nicely. The tips are even and sharp. Edges have nice texture for grippage. I recommend it for your pruning needs.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a lot that can be said about a pair of tweezers, but what little can be said, these Revlon Expert Tweezers do well.  They&#x27;re sturdy, the blades on the end line up perfectly causing a person to be successful in grabbing a single hair (if that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re being used for) and removing without slippage.  I can count on one hand the number of times I&#x27;ve failed to pull a hair on the first try with these tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They seem like they are made of long-lasting materials, which I&#x27;m hoping will lead to them being effective at hair removal for quite some time to come.  I&#x27;ve had dozens of other pairs that after a few months use the blades seem to become misaligned, dull, and no longer nearly as effective at pulling anything - let alone something as fine as hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were packaged relatively well and easy to remove from their packaging.  The box they were shipped in was a bit oversized when a simple manilla envelope would have sufficed, but all in all...they were shipped well.</li>
            <li> Redline makes has a history of making quality products and this pair of tweezers is no exception. An easy fit in your hand and easy to use that you will appreciate again and again.</li>
            <li> I lose tweezers within five minutes of using them, so it&#x27;s nice to have one in every bathroom, and in my travel toiletry case. Price is right.</li>
            <li> Good tweezers.  Just be careful they grab the hair but can also grab the skin too if you don&#x27;t pay attention just like any tweezers.</li>
            <li> great tweezers. I hate ones that wont clamp right</li>
            <li> I love tweezers in every room.  I use them for many things - like a little tool.  This is my favorite tweezer style.</li>
            <li> I really should buy a couple more...there&#x27;s nothing more frustrating than trying to use tweezers that just won&#x27;t grab.  I keep this pair in my purse, and find that I&#x27;ll leave the one in the bathroom alone while I search for my purse to get to these.  Great item!</li>
            <li> These little tweezer are ideal for those people hitting 40 something or older who are discovering hairs in places they never had them before. They pluck with aplomb and have a nice grip and tip.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars simply because I could not bring myself to rater ANY tweezer 5 stars.</li>
            <li> ...not sharp edged enough, crooked when pinch/close together. Now I know to buy tweezers in person only, to ensure sharp enough with more precision.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  Nice sharp tip easy to control and pull out those little gray suckers</li>
            <li> I am not feeling this slant tip.  It curves inward and I don&#x27;t understand how this is helpful to tweezing.  I feel the slant tip is preventing me from really grasping the hairs so they can be pulled out at the root.  I&#x27;ve broken many hairs trying to use these tweezers.</li>
            <li> Very good! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really like these tweezers. I have always been a fan of the Cover girl slanted tweezers, but these give me way more leverage with a lot less effort. Some tweezers are really tough to pinch together with just two fingers, but these are quite easy and very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The precision is great. I can grab 1 hair from a group and know that I can pluck the exact one I am aiming for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They give me more control when tweezing my brows and I wouldn&#x27;t change them for another brand. I found myself a new product I&#x27;ll be repeatedly buying because I always seem to lose them!</li>
            <li> super disappointed. it doesn&#x27;t even get a grip of my eyebrows, don&#x27;t even waste your money on this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I got this to put into my first aid kit.  I wanted a decent tweezer to ensure I could pull out a splinter or what not.  The worst feeling is when you go to clamp onto a hair or splinter and it cannot grip it correctly to tug and pull, then we got issues....&lt;br /&gt;To me, if a tweezer cannot grip a single hair, then it&#x27;s no good.  Well this tweezer is good enough as it passed the single hair pull on multiple occasions.  I would spend the extra dollar and change to get a decent tweezer than be left with a useless piece of metal that looks like a tweezer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!!!</li>
            <li> Great dexterity and strong grab. I actually purchased this as a second set for my First aid kit. great for pulling splinters</li>
            <li> I have only purchased two other tweezers and this one works best for me. It holds and works like it should</li>
            <li> Good quality tweezer.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as an add on item and was very surprised at the quality of this product. Would definitely recommend...heavy duty, good tip grip, and cute pattern on the handles!</li>
            <li> Slant tip with sharp edges is perfect for sliver removal. Good grip. Basically what you would expect in order this product.</li>
            <li> Came with wrong color - we got a very crazy design on ours.  Thought we were getting BLACK!  Package was VERY worn too - looked to be several years old and tattered.  Tweezers worked though...</li>
            <li> The tweezer I received was not from Revlon.  It says \\&quot;made in Pakistan\\&quot; inside and the metal is so sharp that I cut my skin while trying to use the tweezer.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are great, but the problem is the one I got is blue and has flowers designs on it. I&#x27;m a male and don&#x27;t like flower designs. One of the reasons I chose these tweezers is because they are black in the photo and without designs on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking I was going to get a solid black tweezer set and instead get a amoeba designed pair that&#x27;s blue and white.  What is that?!  Oh manliness, now they are not allowed to be left out.</li>
            <li> This is a good pair of tweezers. The ends are a bit bulky and seem like they could lead to the product not maintaining it&#x27;s sharpness and accuracy.   I would easily buy these again in the future.   Also, they send you whatever they have in this style. While the picture is black, my tweezers are primarily white with light and dark teal circles on them. They&#x27;re pretty, but it&#x27;s definitely a shock to open something expecting one thing and receiving something else!</li>
            <li> Nice solid and sturdy tweezers I use for plucking. No complaints.</li>
            <li> FINE HAIRS YOU NEED A POINTED TWEEZER. CHIN HAIRS? IT IS GREAT.</li>
            <li> these tweezers are awful they have way to much spring to  them and the have to be squeezed very hard  the materiel they are made of Is super cheap and they  got black ALL Over my hand? Something was wrong with the paint they applied to the metal.... I have another pair Of Revlon Tweezers and I will pay to have them sharpened . These went in the trash..Made in China Junk. Shame on you Revlon!</li>
            <li> I thought all tweezers were created equal till I got my hands on these. If you grab something with them it&#x27;s coming out. The tips of the tweezers (where you are grabbing the item to remove) is rough so it grabs really well. The finger areas are not slick, like my old ones, making them easier to use. An all around awesome product that I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good quality, serves the purpose. Bit expensive though.</li>
            <li> The tips are very sharp, but very precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for grooming my dogs&#x27; ears.</li>
            <li> I loved these at first. However, they broke this morning. The part where the two tweezer edges connect fell apart. I have only had them for about 6 months. The pair of tweezers they replaced lasted me 11 years so maybe I expected too much.</li>
            <li> HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY...... THANK YOU SO MUCH. GREAT PRODUCT, Y&#x27;ALL</li>
            <li> I was hoping these would be good and they are. They have a great strength to them that allows for a good grip and accurate use. They also allow for adequate space between each point for pulling groups of follicles. Very nice tweezers and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> will grab every single tiny little hair possible.  great buy!</li>
            <li> Great value and works amazingly!</li>
            <li> i thought the tip of the tweezer would be a little longer. but the tweezers work great! they took the hairs all the way out and didn&#x27;t break them off. and the seller is just amazing. i ordered these 2 days after about 20 other things. and these came first! very very fast shipping with no problems. mine came in black. i wish they were blue tho LOL</li>
            <li> I have had better and do, Not as I expected. but hopefully will be good as back up</li>
            <li> This is the best tweezer ever. My teenage daughter stole mine so I had to buy another one! Truly I never had a tweezer this good, I first came across it at a blog called House Unseen Life Unscripted or something like that.</li>
            <li> How can you give tweezers a 5 star review? They&#x27;re OK. Some people say they cut the hairs instead of plucking them, I didn&#x27;t have that problem. They are not $30, that&#x27;s the main thing. The tips lined up well. If you look closely, they are not a work of art. Just mass produced tweezers here folks, good enough.</li>
            <li> great quality tweezers. they grab even the finest of hairs!</li>
            <li> These are great tweezers. They are good lucking, stylish, inexpensive, precise and they hold onto hairs in you ingrown razor bumps much better than some pair of old tweezers, get them now...</li>
            <li> Great tweezers for fantastic price, and I didn&#x27;t have to leave my home! I stopped using Tweezerman  tweezers which are fabulous initially;but the become completely dull pretty fast! Yes, you can ship them to the company to sharpen, but it takes a long time to get them back, shipping plus ship insurance adds up. Why not purchase this more affordable pair which lasts quite awhile as this is not my first pai of Revlon;s Expert Tweezer with slant.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers for a great price</li>
            <li> I use these to work with small ribbon cables.  So much easier than trying to use my hands or a pair of pliers.  Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Of all the tweezers we&#x27;ve ever owned (a lot), this one is far-and-away the finest.  Don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to do tweezers well (seems simple enough), but it&#x27;s taken several attempts at various drug store purchases to finally force us to try one of these online purchases.  These are the best!</li>
            <li> Ignore the negative comments as these tweezers are great.  They grip every hair on the first try and have a wonderful tip to grab even the smallest ones.  Great product and well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Lost my other tweezers and glad to get them.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Good basic beauty tweezer.  Tip is aligned well and grips decently.  The size of the tip on these make it easy to grab larger things (like full hairs), but harder to grab a small object (partial hair or splinter).</li>
            <li> Great tweezers that work really well. They are a little sharp at the ends, but I think that makes them easier and better.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are excellent. They are very sharp, and they fit in your hand nicely. The slant allows for precise use.</li>
            <li> I work with wood, and frequently get splinters.  The tips of these are really good (fine and pointed) for removing splinters.  I bought several pairs after trying them.</li>
            <li> This is OK and has a nice grip but was not right for me. It is OK so I recommend, I would not buy again, and I hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> Great coach we have ever tried is so funny last very long time and he gets a Maharg that you own reachable this is a really big help for me to do</li>
            <li> I am on my second of this tweezer now, I lost the first. I haven&#x27;t used a better tweezer before or since, I&#x27;ve even had people ask to borrow this specific tweezer. This seller sells it cheaper than Revlon or CVS/Target, for which I&#x27;m grateful.</li>
            <li> Best twizzer I ever had.  they get the small stubborn hairs that bug the krap out of you.  I love them.</li>
            <li> I got 4 of these and returned all of them back.&lt;br /&gt;The tip is to big and it did not do a good job grabbing small hair on the face</li>
            <li> My family stole my tweezers from me, and the local pharmacy didn&#x27;t stock these anymore.  So I tuned to Amazon.  My eyebrow hairs are very fine, but these tweezers decrease my rate of unsuccessful pulls.  They make eyebrow tweeting less of a pain.</li>
            <li> It only looks small and cuddly.&lt;br /&gt;According to my girls, it would dig out any stub.&lt;br /&gt;Boyz beware.</li>
            <li> This is a tweezer that gets the job done, well. There isn&#x27;t much slippage when trying to grip a hair or two. Definitely the best tweezers I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> My old tweezers were too clunky. They would often pluck more than one eyebrow hair. I like this tweezer because I can detail my eyebrows with it.</li>
            <li> This is the best tweezer I have ever used. The slant helps to pluck those eyebrow hairs to the root.I have tried many other brands and this is the best.</li>
            <li> This tweezer gets every hair no matter how little, and it&#x27;s very comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t work that great for me, the fine tip made it difficult to grasp hair will.  This seems like a product that varies greatly person to person as my wife was able to use it pretty effectively.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this twice. I only use the tweezers a couple of times a week, but the first one broke within a few months.  My second one just broke after four months. The two pieces of metal join at the end, but it doesn&#x27;t hold together.  It&#x27;s sad but I can&#x27;t expect that a third one will be any different.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers for a great price. No need for those boutique tweezers out there, these work just as good. Thank you Revlon.</li>
            <li> After buying several flimsy, useless tweezers from the store I finally found these ones on Amazon. They work very well and are nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I had these for a week and they worked great! They fell off the counter and got tip bent just a little to point to where they could no longer be used. Please be very careful with handling them and make sure not sure to drop them</li>
            <li> Not much to say here, does a good job for tweezers and was relatively affordable. I have never paid this much for tweezers but never had any work this well.</li>
            <li> these tweezers work wonders I actually had bought the same style and brand seven years ago...that pair was slighty rusted but that is after a seven year course. They work great, they dont pinch, they have a tight grip and work great best i have ever used</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert, but I have several pairs of tweezers, and for yanking out unwanted ear hair, these are by far the best.  They are durable, and well made.</li>
            <li> i was tired of trying so many of those and relied on the reviews to order this one. it is AMAZING!! i totally recommend</li>
            <li> Works well. I&#x27;m glad to have bought it, precise and works the way I thought it would. Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> Revlon Expert Tweezers  Slant tip 100% please and would highly recommend these Tweezers to anyone who thinking about buying them</li>
            <li> Work well!  Heavy duty and has very precise ends.  No issues here.</li>
            <li> I love it this Revlon Expert Tweezers! Great price for a great product. Very precise, nice easy grip. I&#x27;ll recommend to other users.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to describe why these are the best tweezers ever but Ive never had tweezers that allowed me to get every single little tiny hair on my ears. I&#x27;ll be shocked if you don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re tge best too!</li>
            <li> Awesome product ,does the job perfectly</li>
            <li> Would be 5 stars if finish was, well, smoother?  I&#x27;m comparing these to Tweezerman, which are fantastic but expensive.  I love Tweezerman, these are cheaper but work well.  Almost just as well.  These do have a better grip on the &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34;, but the finish on the exposed tips is not as smooth as Tweezerman.  Still, I&#x27;d put them a close second.  Not a bad product.</li>
            <li> nice and precise. Bought this same pair of tweezers several times. Been using since highschool.</li>
            <li> 2015 Jan - Have had few tweezers in the past, not sure why this one was highly rated, maybe is my hair ((:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad one, but definitely not a good one. Just an average</li>
            <li> I had hoped the slant tip would make these tweezers better than your average pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed, however. They are merely average.</li>
            <li> Found these for $3 less than in the store. So they were exactly what I expected, sturdy and strong, great pluckers.</li>
            <li> Bought this and found it didnt grab so good. Better to invest in the tweezerman equivalent which costs more i believe but better as a permanent solution</li>
            <li> My old tweezers ended up breaking after several years. These are sharp enough to grab small hairs, but it&#x27;s not as stiff as my old pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li> Got it for my wife! She likes it. She says its &amp;#34;Perfect for regular use! Works great and has perfect shape and grip!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> There are a lot of options in the tweezer world. I found this slant tip pair to be sharp and provide excellent grip with a light squeeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is however, easy to cut the hair while plucking, and it is not as precise as with finer tip tweezers, to target individual hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What i like most is the GRIP. These are great at getting those short stubby hair follicles. Also, if you find the grip slipping, a quick clean with alcohol usually fixes that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that&#x27;s helpful!</li>
            <li> Easy to hold, great grip, fine edges to grab the stubborn eyebrow strays.  I have no complaints, very pleased .</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t work. They wouldn&#x27;t pluck my brows at all because they couldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; onto the hair. Waste of money, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I never used to pluck my eyebrows but since I&#x27;ve been trying the &amp;#34;do what the other girls do to look professional&amp;#34; thing last semester, I&#x27;ve decided that it&#x27;s probably something I should do.  I got a facial in October and the beautician gave me a free eyebrow wax.  I had someone else do one when the unibrow came back and decided that I could just pluck my own &#x27;brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the most accurate thing but if they literally had something that could only pick up one hair at a time all of you would go insane.  It gets more than one at a time so you just have to plan a little better.  They&#x27;re really very accurate when you&#x27;re paying attention and they do hold on to the hairs.  If a beginner like me can figure it out, you seasoned pros should be able to, too.</li>
            <li> YES, gets even the smallest hair. But I will stress the EXPERT because if you do not know what you are doing it will hurt.</li>
            <li> These are okay tweezers but they dulled up pretty fast with basic use. I think you are better off spending just a few more bucks for better quality.</li>
            <li> Have been using for about a year with no problems.  Sturdy material.</li>
            <li> I tried SO hard to give these tweezers a chance, but they are absolutely horrible. They are sharp, so you will likely accidentally catch your skin and it will leave a red mark or puncture it (and hurt). The tweezers cut or slide off of thicker eyebrow hairs, and are par, at best, at plucking thinner hair. They are lightweight, unlike my other Revlon tweezers, which were substantially heavier and better. I imagine my old ones are discontinued, so I tried this one. What a waste and can&#x27;t even return it.</li>
            <li> Just as the title says, these tweezers do what it claims to do. not much more to it! just a simple, good product</li>
            <li> This can barely hold on to hairs. I love the slanted jaw but if I&#x27;m pulling a solitary hair, 9/10 time it always slips off. I can pull the REALLY coarse hairs. Overall, not my fave pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li> I I love these things they are great to use and I don&#x27;t know anything about grabbing the same strand 10 times because my strands come out on the first try every time. The tweezers feel great in my hands and I love them and I have styled my brows and am loving everything about my new sleek style. Let me not get a big head but these tweezers are awesome so believe me they really work if you want a little more grip then get the ones with the diamond dust their more grip worthy but the diamond dust does wear off but worth it while you have it in the mean time i&#x27;m loving these ones SO MUCH. Enjoy if you purchase them if not then enjoy which ever ones you did find contentment in. lol</li>
            <li> This is a quality product. It works great! I&#x27;d buy another one if I needed it. Delivered on time at a good price.</li>
            <li> It lost its sharpness after only a couple of uses. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Wife loves them, and says these are the best tweezers she has ever used.  For the price would differently recommend this to someone.</li>
            <li> High quality all around - from the size, the grip, the surface texture to the quality of the steel...wish all products have this type of quality specification.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it happened, but at some point in our relationship my wife got me to do her eyebrows. It&#x27;d be a savings, she said. She thought I&#x27;d do them best, she said. And I guess I do - especially with these tweezers. The tips/edges are very well balanced (some ones I&#x27;ve used didn&#x27;t line up straight). They pull the little hairs out seemlessly. They also get the little ones that I used to pick at for minutes at a time, without a problem. Invest in a good pair instead of the 99c store type - you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> These were ok.. I feel like they need a grip at the end to grab the hairs better, but I use this product often.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just what they look like, nice normal tweezers.  They&#x27;re cheap and they pull out splinters or eyebrow hair like champs.</li>
            <li> I had a Revlon tweezer that I had been using for years but it finally went dull so I decided to get a replacement. This was no where as sharp nor gripped as well as my last one. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you only have needle nose tweezer, your missing out.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better my eyebrows look after using these.&lt;br /&gt;Great item for any beauty bag. And, the price is right.</li>
            <li> very nice tweezers, perfect for plucking my eyebrows with ease. They grasp the hairs with little to no effort. Love them.</li>
            <li> These work great, they are a perfect size, do the job they are supposed to, and now my eyebrows always look great!</li>
            <li> This was the third pair of tweezers I purchased through Amazon and third time is a charm! These are the perfect pair of tweezers for getting those really fine hairs, which I have a ton of. If you have super-thin hairs that need plucking these tweezers will work for you.</li>
            <li> Someone I know has  potential for uni-brow. This someone is very handsome and feels uni-brows are not &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; at the moment. These worked perfectly for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I have perfectly groomed eye brows.</li>
            <li> great tool quality item</li>
            <li> Worst tweezers.  Get it if you don&#x27;t mind breaking the hair as opposed to plucking it.  At this rate I might as well use a shaver - at least with a shaver you cover more ground.</li>
            <li> Looking for precision? This expert tweezer makes me feel like the expert. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Not sharp at all hard to use</li>
            <li> Great tweezers...  tweezers can get a little pricey for nice ones and these are well priced considering how well they work:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- very well machined tip that will grab absolutely the smallest hairs... very very fine metal splinters... or whatever you are having to pull&lt;br /&gt;- thickly painted finish that doesn&#x27;t chip or corrode ever... these will look like the day you got them long after you wear them out&lt;br /&gt;- textured grip makes sure you don&#x27;t slip and it&#x27;s worked well with wet fingers&lt;br /&gt;- wide tip for such fine tweezers means you can grab a lot at one time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they don&#x27;t really have any cons... some people complain that they lose their point but all tweezers do that... tweezers wear out and if you drop them and the tip hits tile, it will mash any tweezers point and make it so they don&#x27;t exactly fit anymore and they are ruined...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with these you are getting the performance of tweezers double the price</li>
            <li> Excellent....product as expected, works well, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Lightweight tweezers, seem to work if I put on glasses to see those errant whiskers I so abhor. Used these to grab a splinter, too.  Worked real well for that.</li>
            <li> Fine tip works great. My favorite kind of tweezers (Revlon slant tip).</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, work great, and are black so work well aesthetically for a guy.</li>
            <li> I had purchased Avon tweezers and wasn&#x27;t too pleased . This product only proves again to stay with a name brand. They work 100 times better than what I was using. I absolutely would purchase them again if needed.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to handle.  Could be better and not so stiff. I still prefer my old tweezers</li>
            <li> When shopping for tweezers I was surprised by the prices. After looking through various options I decided on these Revion Tweezers based on the combination of price and customer reviews. They perform as expected and seem very durable. My biggest issue with tweezers in the past is how easy they are to lose (kind of like socks in the dryer) so hopefully I do not have that problem with these.</li>
            <li> great item.  I have had a while and I like the tweezer.</li>
            <li> These tweezers work just fine. No problems at all. If you need basic tweezers for normal uses these are a go.</li>
            <li> Awesome and Great Price</li>
            <li> I purchased  these tweezers over a year ago, and they still work well. (Some tweezers lose their grip over time.) They work better than most tweezers I have tried, even expensive ones.</li>
            <li> They work great, I use them for tweezing my eyebrows and I&#x27;m glad I got them. I recommend these, they are great!</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, with no pain. I use it constantly, and I have several, because I keep them close to where I&#x27;ll need them</li>
            <li> these are my favorite tweezers</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite tweezers.  Very precise and easy to use.  I have lost these tweezers several times and I always go back and buy the exact same ones. I&#x27;ve recommended them to some friends, and all have loved them.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers, great quality!!</li>
            <li> Not as great as I had hoped based on reviews.  Did not consistently meet for a tight tweeze, but it was relatively cheap so you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> after 3 months, it won&#x27;t pick up anything except near one end of the tip</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, doesn&#x27;t hold well.</li>
            <li> Very good tweezers! It gets every single hair even peach fuzz!</li>
            <li> It is razor accurate, very well made, and will last quite awhile.  This is the only one I use.  I replace it every so often. It gets the tiniest hair.</li>
