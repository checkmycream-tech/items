            <li>I buy these all the time to create a 3/4 wig or create the perfect wig I want.</li>
            <li>I make my own wigs and glue the weft on sewing hasn&#x27;t been the best for me, not for the caps sake just a preference.</li>
            <li>But its a great price.</li>
            <li>Love this product!!</li>
            <li>I was not overly impressed with this weaving cap, the quality of it is fine</li>
            <li>Deluxe weaving Cap Adjustable, one size fits all, that is correct, this is a wonderful cap and its worth it.</li>
            <li>The most versatile cap on the market !</li>
            <li>Do not buy if you are looking to make your own wigs using a crochet hook.  </li>
            <li>The picture shows the deluxe weaving cap, but that was not what I received.</li>
            <li>Fit your head incredibly well , more than most .</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Great product, better then my local beauty store wig caps</li>
            <li>While these will work for what I need them for and they fit fine</li>
            <li>so it was still huge on me even after tightening the straps all the way.</li>
            <li>They have the adjustable straps on the sides so that you can make the cap fit to size.</li>
            <li>Only great thing shipping was fast .</li>
            <li>I received the product fast and the adjustable weaving cap fits fine.</li>
            <li>but the sizing is rather large.</li>
            <li>The purchase came  really fast</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really help</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>, I would recommend that you braid your natural hair down  before applying the cap on your head , so that it lay&#x27;s flat for a better fit.</li>
            <li>Fits large and I have a big head , it is sturdy though.</li>
            <li>This cap is huge , it doesn&#x27;t not fit my head or my mannequin head .</li>
            <li>BUT IT CAN&#x27;T BE FOR AN ADULT.</li>
            <li>If you feel that the cap is still to small for adults you can buy the caps that are completely elastic and they stretch to fit your size.in addition</li>
            <li>The wig cap was not really tight enough for my head.</li>
            <li>Worst weaving wig cap every....doesn&#x27;t fit right!!!!</li>

            <li> I THINK NOT WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> This will work as just a head wrap if you are looking to keep your hair down while under a protective style or wig.  </li>
            <li> ITS JUST TO SMALL.</li>
            <li> This cap is small and doesn&#x27;t have any stretch.</li>
            <li> I have a relatively small head</li>
            <li> I was disappointed but kept and used it anyway hoping it would serve the same purpose.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I made my wig with it.</li>

            <li> I DON&#x27;T KNOW WHAT SIZE HEAD THIS IS MADE FOR BUT IT CAN&#x27;T BE FOR AN ADULT. ITS JUST TO SMALL. I THINK NOT WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> Fits large and I have a big head , it is sturdy though.</li>
            <li> Do not buy if you are looking to make your own wigs using a crochet hook.  The netting is NOT mesh, so you struggle to get the crochet hook through.  It snags, splits.  In other words, had to toss.  This will work as just a head wrap if you are looking to keep your hair down while under a protective style or wig.  Otherwise, skip it.</li>
            <li> The picture of the cap and what I received is nit the same . This cap is huge , it doesn&#x27;t not fit my head or my mannequin head . In order for me to create a 3/4 wig (u-part wig) I like to cut the middle and sides (ear tabs on up ) for leave out . I cut do this with the way the cap is created there is no stitching or barrier there as a guide. Only great thing shipping was fast .</li>
            <li> Deluxe weaving Cap Adjustable, one size fits all, that is correct, this is a wonderful cap and its worth it.</li>
            <li> These are weaving caps, it say&#x27;s it on the front of the bag. I buy these all the time to create a 3/4 wig or create the perfect wig I want. They have the adjustable straps on the sides so that you can make the cap fit to size. If you feel that the cap is still to small for adults you can buy the caps that are completely elastic and they stretch to fit your size.in addition, I would recommend that you braid your natural hair down  before applying the cap on your head , so that it lay&#x27;s flat for a better fit. I hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> The most versatile cap on the market ! Fit your head incredibly well , more than most . I make my own wigs and glue the weft on sewing hasn&#x27;t been the best for me, not for the caps sake just a preference. I will buy nothing else !</li>
            <li> Worst weaving wig cap every....doesn&#x27;t fit right!!!!</li>
            <li> The item in the picture is not the same item that I received.  I was disappointed but kept and used it anyway hoping it would serve the same purpose.  I was disappointed when I made my wig with it.</li>
            <li> Will order again&lt;br /&gt;Shipped to me fast&lt;br /&gt;And it looks just like the picture does&lt;br /&gt;And after going to three beauty stores n nit findind it i think I hit the jack pot with them</li>
            <li> Great product, better then my local beauty store wig caps</li>
            <li> The picture shows the deluxe weaving cap, but that was not what I received. The purchase came  really fast but it was not what I ordered. This cap is small and doesn&#x27;t have any stretch.</li>
            <li> The wig cap was not really tight enough for my head. I have to put the tighteners to their limit it doesn&#x27;t really help so I have to sew it on my head. But its a great price. Thanks</li>
            <li> Love this product!! I use for all my custom made wigs!! Product is adjustable and goes ear to ear with no pulling.</li>
            <li> I have a relatively small head so it was still huge on me even after tightening the straps all the way.</li>
            <li> I was not overly impressed with this weaving cap, the quality of it is fine but the sizing is rather large.</li>
            <li> I received the product fast and the adjustable weaving cap fits fine. Its okay but i think i prefer using the dome cap.</li>
            <li> While these will work for what I need them for and they fit fine, I read there was suppose to be 2 caps per pack so I order thinking I would receive 2 caps per pack but when the arrived there was only 1 cap per pack...disappointed that I now have to order more.....</li>
            <li> I CHOOSE THESE WEAVING CAPS BECAUSE YOU CAN WEAR THE ALSO AS AN STOCKING CAP WHEN YOU WEAR AN WIG. YOU SCALP CAN BREATHE WITH THE WEAVING CAPS WHEN WEARING AN WIG.</li>
