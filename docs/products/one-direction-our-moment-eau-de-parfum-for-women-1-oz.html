            <li>I LOVE IT BUTT</li>
            <li>Honestly wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the sent.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my Grand Daughter</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve smelled better perfumes but its pretty good.</li>
            <li>and it smells pretty good on her</li>
            <li>This does smell pretty good, don&#x27;t let the packaging sway you one way or another.  </li>
            <li>This perfume was what she wanted, it smells good and came in pretty bottle</li>
            <li>Hello Good Afternoon perfume has a sweet, rich flavor, I recommend the teenager.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Got it for her ( happy as can be) and was surprised I like it as well.</li>
            <li>I loved our moment, floral, fruity, for directioners , I really liked their predominant intense and juicy and heavenly combination of fresh fruits.</li>
            <li>everything was fine with it</li>
            <li>A little pricey for pre-teen perfume, but smelled great!</li>
            <li>ON I&#x27;M A HUGE ONE DIRECTION FAN &amp;</li>
            <li>It is worth mentioning that it is better to wear it in winter.</li>
            <li>MY 10 YR OLD DAUGHTER LOVED</li>
            <li>but when it arrived it won me over not to sweet not to strong.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and the packaging was great, It was a present for my niece</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that the fragrance was lovely!</li>
            <li>She likes the smell and the cool box and bottle.</li>
            <li>If your GF/wife likes 1D  just buy it anyways because you will fore sure get laid by a decent smelling GF.</li>
            <li>The bottle is also very pretty.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It needs to be used sparingly as it is pretty powerfu.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, she is beyond happy, and waltzed around the house pushing her wrist in our faces to smell the fab scent she now possesses!</li>
            <li>It is actually quite lovely.</li>
            <li>She was the first in her class to have it.</li>
            <li>Soft and sweet.</li>
            <li>the package is really nice...arrived on time too...</li>
            <li>This product was for my daughter, she really like it.</li>
            <li>Of course now she wants the newest 1D perfume.</li>
            <li>but she loved it due to the teen band promoting the product.</li>
            <li>Not too &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; for a young lady to wear.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this for any young girls, that like One Direction.....</li>
            <li>The 11yr old girl I help take care of loves 1D and couldn&#x27;t wait for this.</li>

            <li> Christmas gift for my Niece. She was Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I love one direction, so naturally I had to get this wonderful perfume. The bottle is beautiful, it smells wonderful, and  it&#x27;s just a really great buy!</li>
            <li> Hello Good Afternoon perfume has a sweet, rich flavor, I recommend the teenager.</li>
            <li> who cares how it smells, it&#x27;s 1D, and that&#x27;s all my daughter cares about! I haven&#x27;t smelled it yet but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine. She&#x27;s getting it for Christmas tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Huge Directioner so I had to get this! The smell is amazing! I keep on getting compliments! Thanks to the boys for making this wonderful perfume! ;)</li>
            <li> My GF loves 1D but I cant stand girl bands. I sucked it up and purchased it anyway and it smells pretty good on her, I&#x27;ve smelled better perfumes but its pretty good. The moral of the review is... If your GF/wife likes 1D  just buy it anyways because you will fore sure get laid by a decent smelling GF.</li>
            <li> This is what my grand daughter wanted for her birthday.  It needs to be used sparingly as it is pretty powerfu.  That&#x27;s a good thing.  You do not have to use very much to smell good!</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a friends daughter for her birthday and she loved it.&lt;br /&gt;My own daughter also has it and loves it too. Brilliant!!!</li>

            <li> If you have teenage daughters like mine, you probably know what it is 1D mania. I got it for my girls as a gift. The quality could have been better, especially it is relatively expensive. It is worth mentioning that it is better to wear it in winter.</li>
            <li> It smells good and I love it. U should get it cuz it&#x27;s awesome! Thank you :) bye :p hehe</li>

Needless to say, she is beyond happy, and waltzed around the house pushing her wrist in our faces to smell the fab scent she now possesses! It is actually quite lovely. Not too &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; for a young lady to wear.</li>

            <li> Honestly wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the sent. Little stronger then I was expecting.  Cute bottle, and she was just thrilled it was one direction.</li>
            <li> TEEN  LOVES ONE DIRECTION SO GOT THIS FOR HER.  SHE LOVES IT .  JUST TOOK LONGER THAN WHAT I EXPECTED FOR IT TO ARRIVE.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves 1 direction so anything that has to do with them I get for her. I was a little skeptical at the beginning with their perfume but when it arrived it won me over not to sweet not to strong. The bottle is also very pretty.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Grand Daughter she loves one directions. So I thought I would just get this, and see how she liked the smell. She loves the smell. She was so happy to get this.</li>
            <li> This perfume was what she wanted, it smells good and came in pretty bottle and she liked the box.  Recommend</li>
            <li> I have to say I myself who is in her late 20&#x27;s really like the smell of this. The 11yr old girl I help take care of loves 1D and couldn&#x27;t wait for this. Got it for her ( happy as can be) and was surprised I like it as well. Thinking I&#x27;ll have to order two from now on. She also likes the body lotion that you can get too.  Of course now she wants the newest 1D perfume.</li>
