            <li>For brushes this price and the quality to be amazing is mind blowing.</li>
            <li>and it holds up amazing if you take care of it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re amazing.  </li>
            <li>I bought this brush expecting it to be amazing, because a friend had suggested it.</li>
            <li>--Amazing brushes for the price.</li>
            <li>omg RT brushes are sooooo amazing.</li>
            <li>Almost itchy to be honest.</li>
            <li>The brushes are cruelty-free and have nice metal handles.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to have a variety.  </li>
            <li>nice blending brush for the price</li>
            <li>Real Techniques are done of the best brushes out there.</li>
            <li>They are made so nice</li>
            <li>but this brush is absolutely the best!!!!!</li>
            <li>and I think the color goes on nicely and looks blended.</li>
            <li>Real techniques are the best affordable brushes.  </li>
            <li>Its domed shape fits nicely in the hollows of my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Grabs product effectively and distributes evenly.</li>
            <li>Gets the job done, nice looking, washes well ...</li>
            <li>Real Techniques are the best brushes I have used all year.</li>
            <li>brush fits perfectly on the cheek area, it gives a great finish to my powder blushes, but for cream brushes I prefer a smaller brush.</li>
            <li>and it works nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of Real Technique brushes for a while now, and this is the best Blush brush I have purchased.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t see it as effective for blush application, I knew this beforehand from the reviews.</li>
            <li>The brush feels nice held and the extended aluminium ferrule is a nice touch design-wise.  </li>
            <li>I used it for blush and it gave a nice flush of color.</li>
            <li>It diffuses the product nicely.</li>
            <li>love the volume of this brush for a good powder finishing touch</li>
            <li>But, it will give you a nice blend on the perimeter of your face or on your cheeks.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect size, it picks up color very well, and doesn&#x27;t puff blush all over my face.</li>
            <li>I have been nothing but impressed with all of the Real Techniques brushes I have purchased.</li>
            <li>I have been loving this brush, I use it every day now.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have the space to do that in my bathroom, at the moment, but it may be nice to do in the future.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice for applying powder all over.</li>
            <li>fantastic price for a very nice brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, great brush, well worth the price!</li>

            <li>Very soft, perfect blending...</li>
            <li>Very easy to blend with</li>
            <li>I like it more than my MAC brushes but still love my sigma brushes!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quite versatile, you can literally just use the tip top of the brush and the application is lovely and blended!</li>
            <li>I use this for blush and its perfect, so so soft!</li>
            <li>Great brush, I love it, great for blush, very soft.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve used it on powder and cream blush, and both times I was impressed.</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing blush brush</li>
            <li>I also own some drugstore brand brushes, but have to say, for the most part, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>If you already have a great collection, you may be like me, and find that you rarely reach for</li>
            <li>The brush is so soft and applies my blush on perfectly.</li>
            <li>it is brilliant and fast.</li>
            <li>So soft and the shape is perfect to apply any power blush!</li>

            <li>Perfect quality, ridiculously soft, and they get the job done.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion this is the best blush brush i have had so far.</li>
            <li>The bright is lightweight and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>This is the best blush brush in my collection so far...</li>
            <li>Best brush ever, so soft, no shedding.</li>
            <li>Incredibly soft and feels wonderful along one&#x27;s cheekbones.  </li>
            <li>I am a makeup addict and own a ton of MAC and Sigma brushes - this brand is the most bang for your buck</li>
            <li>But i still use it, and i washed it and it was still amazingly perfect and soft after.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and it makes me happy to see this in the morning!</li>
            <li>Is soft and works great!</li>
            <li>Nice brush, seen at ULTA for more.</li>
            <li>nice for contouring more than blush</li>
            <li>but honestly I couldn&#x27;t give it more than 2 stars.</li>
            <li>The size is perfect and the slight pointedness is great for contouring.</li>
            <li>Great arrival, right on time.</li>
            <li>Love love love this brush!</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>

            <li>The best blush and contour brush I&#x27;ve used so far, Love it.</li>
            <li>Another great brush from Real Techniques!</li>
            <li>other wise great!</li>
            <li>And believe me I&#x27;m very precise with my make up even on rush.</li>
            <li>I have used it to apply one of my tarte blushes and it applies it very smooth to my cheeks.</li>
            <li>This brush I think is a good find and for the price a pretty good deal because it&#x27;s light on the pocket book..</li>
            <li>Soft, easy to use and great product application!</li>
            <li>that I thought I liked and worked just fine...</li>

            <li>This brush is incredible; the bristles are soft and don&#x27;t come off on my face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best--and such a great price!</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>This is more like a powder brush for all over face than a blush brush</li>
            <li>done much better.  </li>
            <li>reviews!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for more than 2 years and it feels, and works, just like it did when I bought it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;OH, one more thing</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just getting spoiled because I have picked up some nicer brushes on sale and now expect more bang for my buck.</li>
            <li>Real Techiques is a great Brand.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a great shape, slightly more rounded than a tulip head brush, but still very multi-purpose.  </li>
            <li>have owned this brush for nine months, have used it many times, but not every day.</li>
            <li>I actually use this for my powder because it is the perfect size for me.  </li>
            <li>Definitely better for a lighter/natural look and with blush vs bronzer.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t know if it sheds more after wash.</li>
            <li>recommended 👍 top quality</li>
            <li>I just received this brush as a gift, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>soft bristles and ideal size for blusher.</li>
            <li>but because it&#x27;s tapered at the top</li>
            <li>They are the perfect length and weight for daily use.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>Am sure this will work on some faces.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a \\&quot;dome\\&quot; brush</li>
            <li>If you find it somewhere for more than that, keep looking because there are better prices elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love them both.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  glad</li>
            <li>I think this brush is better than MAC..</li>

            <li>Love this brush....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been hearing and reading a lot of great things about Real Techniques brushes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for anyone who has a tendancy to overdo their blush because it really allows you to build up to the amount of color you want.  </li>
            <li>I also love the length and shape of the handle.  </li>
            <li>Love Real Techniques brushes for such great quality, value and perfect application!</li>
            <li>It gives great coverage because of it&#x27;s size and it picks product up very well.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>It applies product very softly and blends it beautifully.</li>
            <li>It makes applying blush feel very light and easy, but I do find myself dipping into the blush compact more.  </li>
            <li>All of these brushes clean up nicely with any sort of makeup brush cleaner or even face wash for that matter.</li>
            <li>I freaking love this brush, it&#x27;s the most perfect to apply blush, and i love the pink color</li>
            <li>It is super soft and the best thing it doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>When i first opened the box, i noticed that the packaging itself was good.</li>
            <li>Pretty good brush for the price.</li>
            <li>This brush is excellent quality, though I think it&#x27;s better for applying loose powder than it is for blush.</li>
            <li>They are quality, easy-to-use, and economically friendly; my type of brush line!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I bought it, but I have loved all of the real techniques brushes that I have bought.</li>
            <li>Good quality, LOVE real techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>It is a good brush - soft and nice quality.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and attractive.</li>
            <li>The application is very light, too light.</li>
            <li>yes there are better brushes out there, but these are absolutely fine.</li>
            <li>Very cool product and purchased Recommend</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Samantha Chapman and these brushes are definitely my favorite brushes to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for blush, and it gives a natural effect.</li>
            <li>and I prefer to place it it more precisely.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to use them a lot yet, but so far I am so happy</li>
            <li>So soft and great.</li>
            <li>so soft and helps blend the brush great on your face...</li>
            <li>Brilliant for contouring, especially for powder products.</li>
            <li>I also love how it is tapered so that I can just lightly brush the blush on my cheek bones, and then I blend it out with the sides of the brush.  </li>
            <li>Okay, so honestly I was nervous when I first purchased this product.</li>
            <li>Another good Real Techniques brush.  </li>
            <li>I like the real techniques brushes because they are good for the price.</li>
            <li>The bristles never fall out, and they are so easy to clean!</li>
            <li>it applies product well, very smooth and clean finish.</li>
            <li>So soft I love RT brushes!!</li>
            <li>I own many high end brushes: mostly MAC and Nars, but also Hourglass, Shu Uemura,and Chanel.</li>
            <li>Also, I want to mention that the quality of this brush, especially considering how affordable it is, is REALLY good!</li>
            <li>So quick and easy!</li>
            <li>It retains its shape perfectly after washing, and dries quicker than my other brushes.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to blend the blush where you want it.</li>
            <li>Has never shed and is REALLY easy to wash.</li>
            <li>Order came very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Even though she could go longer between cleanings, she chooses to clean them more often than recommended without any degradation to the brushes.  </li>
            <li>I think I now officially own all of the real techniques brushes and I feel that they are a worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li>Excellent buy - I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate in recommending this brush to others and the complete Real Techniques range.</li>
            <li>Its soft,pick up product easily &amp; evenly.....</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to get the apples of your cheeks if that&#x27;s where you like to apply.</li>
            <li>Easily cleaned and held its shape well.</li>
            <li>The tapered end makes it easy to define the contour of the cheekbone as well as apply blush to the apples of the cheeks.</li>
            <li>It is affordable, attractive, amazingly soft and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>Great brush, worth every penny, thanks</li>
            <li>It is nice and soft so your make up goes on nicely and does not make your face look flakey.</li>
            <li>My Real Techniques brushes are my favorite brushes I own.</li>
            <li>i strongly recommend this product and the brand</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I ordered this, good thing that The shipping was fast</li>
            <li>I expected a better brush because of all the good reviews!</li>
            <li>I love love love real techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>This blusher brush is the best out of the other brushes!</li>
            <li>Soft (probably best for pigmented high end</li>
            <li>I like it better than any of the high end brand blush/powder brushes that I own</li>
            <li>shape, I must say, is very unique and cool looking.  </li>
            <li>and then they are good as new.</li>
            <li>I had mine for over two years as good as new, and ordered again for my family</li>
            <li>And she uses it more that her other brushes so it must be good!</li>
            <li>size and weight of the brush are just fine.</li>
            <li>I ordered the powder brush and its bristles were so soft, full and a great quality</li>
            <li>love at first sight :)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s Beautiful and very practical, I like it so much</li>
            <li>It felt fantastic on my skin and picked up product easily.</li>
            <li>As all the other reviews has stated, this brush is very high quality, nicely packaged, and SOOOO CUTE!!!</li>
            <li>I like it, its super soft and the handle gives great control.</li>
            <li>As with all Real Technique brushes the ferrule is nice and sturdy and easy to grip.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super soft and the quality is great</li>
            <li>I like it just fine for blush, but I can see this being fantastic for bronzer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft :) I also got the powder brush which I love as well :)  </li>
            <li>This brush is perfect for highlighting, and has even worked for bronzing, although it looked a little stripey.</li>
            <li>i feel in love :))) tender, soft, very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I have a couple nars ones and its excellent with those (not so much with the 100% pure blush, that one falls apart and get way too much on the brush)</li>
            <li>not super impressed, but not disappointed either.</li>
            <li>I was sure their make-up brushes would be fine, but it turned out to be amazing, super- soft!!</li>
            <li>When applying blush on my face, I end up having two huge blobs.</li>
            <li>Using it as a blush brush I get two huge swathes of color on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>It does not disturb the makeup on my face when I use it and it holds it&#x27;s shape after washing which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>To be honest though, I was expecting this brush to be way more soft.</li>
            <li>This is a very big blush brush but the quality is great.</li>
            <li>This brush is great for applying power, and dusting off eyeshadow the falls onto my upper cheeks after I apply it.</li>
            <li>Not as precise, but with blush I always start light and build</li>
            <li>Great brush for bronzing up my face, I would say to big for blush.</li>
            <li>but I believe its made for blush primarily.</li>
            <li>Also, the bulky bottom is not practical since all of my brushes are stuck in a glass jar filled with rice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The blush goes on so smooth and effortlessly.</li>
            <li>As professional makeup artists, we know great artistry is only as good as your techniques and tools.</li>
            <li>Really enjoy this blush brush.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>however i have a feeling that i will really enjoy it</li>
            <li>I used it for blush and then for just light powdering.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the quality, as is always the case with the real techniques brushes, is astounding which is why it still gets 4 stars.</li>
            <li>I learned not to go cheap with brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great brush, picks up enough to build up to desired blush color intensity.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I use it to gently smooth out my contour</li>
            <li>I loved this blush brush, it is just fabulous to use and blends very well, worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This brush is fabulous.</li>
            <li>The handle is so comfortable.</li>
            <li>Seeing how fabulous this brush worked, I can&#x27;t wait to receive the others.</li>
            <li>I think you could use this for mineral foundation too, if you like a light airbrushed look</li>
            <li>Its really fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Bigger than I thought but its great for applying a sheerer blush.</li>
            <li>Could use this for a luminizer too with a light hand</li>
            <li>foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hairs on this brush are really secure.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for great quality brushes that are inexpensive, than these are definitely the brushes to get.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean--</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by several friends and it really is great.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>But that could be a pro since it is capable of standing on its own, so</li>
            <li>use this as my primary powder brush for setting my foundation or finishing powder and even bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is fantastic.</li>
            <li>it does everything I want it to do and easy clean up.</li>
            <li>I also am not 100% sold that this is a blush brush although it&#x27;s a really good quality brush so far that I will give it four stars</li>
            <li>Loved it, soft and light in weight, have not tried yet</li>
            <li>Really good for a natural blended look.</li>
            <li>All of the real Techniques brushed worked wonderful.</li>
            <li>The above questions don&#x27;t really apply to a makeup brush, but I can say that this brush is wonderful</li>
            <li>Soft bristles, good shape and comfortable handle.</li>
            <li>Brushes are nice and light and pick up make up very well..</li>
            <li>and she loved it its so soft and i like to play with it to</li>
            <li>The bottom line is that I love this brush and plan on purchasing more brushes from Real Techniques soon.</li>
            <li>This brush is incredible soft making applying makeup a real treat.</li>
            <li>This brush is super soft and amazing!</li>
            <li>If I want a touch more color, I repeat, so it is easy to build the color to get exactly the intensity that you want.  </li>
            <li>Great brush, better than any other brush i have owned.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for very effective brushes without animal hair, this is definitely the route to go.</li>
            <li>very useful.  </li>
            <li>highly suggest it, real techniques is a great brand.</li>
            <li>Both apply product well, blend super easily, and keep the products pigmentation.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and dries quickly because of the synthetic bristles.</li>
            <li>Very soft &amp; love the quality of all rt brushes!</li>
            <li>The single powder brush is also amazing and the duo fiber sets are amazing.</li>
            <li>I must say that I just love love love my brushed from Teal Techniques.</li>
            <li>I originally got this brush for its purpose--to apply blush--</li>
            <li>I love all of real techniques products!</li>
            <li>Also, the kabuki brush looks really fun too!  </li>
            <li>Probably my favorite from Real Techniques!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE REAL TECHNIQUES!</li>
            <li>w/ brushes that came with original kit.  </li>

            <li>Love real techniques brushes!</li>
            <li>Love real techniques!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid literally ten times more for a brush like this with similar results, but this one is truly the best.</li>
            <li>I love this brush so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with the Real Techniques brand!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a long time to fine this kind of quality!</li>
            <li>If it were more tapered it would be great but after washing it is too round.</li>
            <li>The price was perfect, the bristles are soft and it was shipped the next day!</li>
            <li>clean-</li>
            <li>i recommend this for everyone who wants good and reasonably priced brush.</li>
            <li>Very soft to the touch, feels nice on your skin.</li>
            <li>very soft, and it blends the blush nicely on my cheeks, i got the NYX peach blush with it as well.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing quality and is so soft!</li>
            <li>Great brush for setting makeup with loose powder.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to try this blush brush after hearing so many positive reviews about it.</li>
            <li>Fits right into my starter kit too!</li>
            <li>I have heard so many people rave over this particular blush brush, but I just did not find it to be as fabulous as others did.</li>
            <li>More than decent for its price!</li>
            <li>It is fantastic, high quality, and comparable to brushes I have paid much, much more for.</li>
            <li>This blush brush blends amazingly well and is soooo soft.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of real techniques</li>
            <li>I picked the Real Technicques Blush Brush up at Ulta a couple of months ago, and I&#x27;m glad I did because I haven&#x27;t seen them since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do love some of the Real Techniques brushes...</li>
            <li>The brush is really soft and feels nice on the face.</li>
            <li>Extremely soft and applies product nicely.</li>
            <li>I really like this blush brush to apply darker more pigmented blushes.  </li>
            <li>This appears to be an authentic REAL TECHNIQUES BRUSH.</li>
            <li>Love all real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>Anyone who has used real techniques brushes knows how fabulous these are!</li>
            <li>I love these brushes so much.</li>
            <li>I got it for a really reasonable price and will buy more from this vendor.</li>
            <li>but overall it is a good quality brush</li>
            <li>the brush is too tall , I love it so much for blush</li>
            <li>I love all of the real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>I love real techniques brushes...</li>
            <li>The are supper soft but still effective.  </li>
            <li>They are worth it and far more affordable then most make up brushes on the market.  </li>
            <li>I love Real Technique brushes</li>
            <li>I love all the Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>Overall, its a good brush for the value.</li>
            <li>I love real techniques.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t much of a blush brush but more of a all over powder brush.</li>
            <li>I love Real Techniques brushes and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>I love ALL my real technique brushes.</li>
            <li>I love Real Techniques Blush Brush...</li>
            <li>It would be better to use the stippling brush to concentrate color in an area, this splays out too much to do contouring on areas like your nose.</li>
            <li>I love real technique brushes.</li>
            <li>Love all my real techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>Love it so much, that I&#x27;m going to buy another.</li>
            <li>the brush is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>They are so reasonable and work better than some of my sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Real Techniques brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice and fluffy and the synthetic bristles are soft, which makes it an ideal brush for blending.</li>
            <li>With darker, more pigmented blushes, a dense brush tends to apply too much blush, so I need another brush (the EcoTools blush brush) to blend it out.  </li>
            <li>I love it so so much.</li>
            <li>It is able to blend the product very well.</li>
            <li>However that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the difference between my old brush... which I thought was pretty good... and this one.</li>
            <li>it is soft and easy to use :)</li>
            <li>Soft on the skin, easy to wash, love</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so super soft and applies my blush so nicely.</li>
            <li>This brush is a little large for blush, but I find does an excellent job with bronzer or powder for me.</li>
            <li>Strong solid not falling excellent size with a comfortable handle hand in Maintained a smooth and take the powder form that you really need neither plus nor minus</li>
            <li>.) Dries quickly after a wash&lt;br /&gt;4.)</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, fast drying, do not shade at all.</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve had good results with all the Real Techniques line</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for foundation, but this brush is also lovely for blush.</li>
            <li>Super prompt.</li>
            <li>But overall it doesn&#x27;t shed and it&#x27;s an ok but not the most idealistic blush brush that you would want to have.</li>
            <li>really well, I don&#x27;t use to powder my face or anything else, I prefer smaller ones, but does a great job blending both powder and cream products.</li>
            <li>This brush dries quickly too -</li>
            <li>This feels great and is a good weight in my hand, but I just find it a little big for the area of my cheeks</li>
            <li>very big very nice very dense&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li>Very soft pile ,very comfortable handle</li>
            <li>The brush hair is easy to clean and has held its shape even after many spot and deep cleanings.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are really soft, I got this one in the mail today and was not disappointed in anyway when I put on my blush, makes it look so smooth and blended!</li>
            <li>I thought the shape of the brush was interesting, since most blush brushes I&#x27;ve seen are either flat or rounded.  </li>
            <li>Super Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>No loose hairs with just a nice, even look to the skin.</li>
            <li>My new favorite blush brush.</li>
            <li>My new favorite for applying blush.</li>
            <li>This is my first real technique brush and I plan to purchase more.  </li>
            <li>Wonderfully soft, easy to clean, and I love how steady it stands.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty!</li>
            <li>but it is exactly what I need for highlighting my cheeks!</li>
            <li>I love this brush, it is the perfect size, not too big and not too small.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>If you bought the trio starter set or the purple starter set and you weren&#x27;t impressed; the single brushes are next level!</li>
            <li>At first a few not so good reviews dissuaded me but don&#x27;t let them!</li>
            <li>I used to use this a lot for powdered blush and it&#x27;s awesome for that, especially if it&#x27;s not too crumbly or loose.</li>
            <li>and then I was able to lightly blend in a little powder highlighter on top of my cheekbones.</li>
            <li>Real Techniques brushes are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I like to try all and any intriguing makeup products, brushes included.</li>
            <li>I am a huge real techniques can, and have the majority of their brushes.</li>
            <li>Great fluffy brush for blush or even powdering the face or bronzing.</li>
            <li>I was a huge Mac and sigma fan until I tried real technique.</li>
            <li>I am a huge real Techniques fan and use them in almost all my youtube makeup tutorials.</li>
            <li>This one is great for a sheer wash of color on the cheeks and can also be used to lightly dust various setting powders.</li>
            <li>Such a soft and great shaped blush brush.</li>
            <li>love this brand its so soft for the skin</li>
            <li>This brush is sooo soft, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a fantastic blush brush!  </li>
            <li>But is it worth it to sacrifice looks over functionality?</li>
            <li>this brush.you may be like me, and find that you rarely reach for this brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s synthetic, of course, and well worth</li>
            <li>This brush is really soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I rarely need this brush to stand up, and would prefer a slimmer handle.</li>
            <li>I am buying more because I love it so much I use it for different powder products so why not have a couple</li>
            <li>I love how soft it is.  </li>
            <li>She has made and entire brush collection that is affordable, well made, great colors, and soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>I love the natural look it gives when I use it to aply my blush.  </li>
            <li>The cheek brush however is kind of big...</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are brushes whose shape is far better suited to being a blush brush or a bronzer brush or an all-over powder brush.</li>
            <li>The brush is quite big, so it&#x27;s great for a natural look</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and so easy to clean - make up doesn&#x27;t stick to the brushes at all.</li>
            <li>love how soft this brush is.</li>
            <li>For a soft makeup is ok</li>
            <li>This brush is awesome but was delivered to me with the handle completely broken off.</li>
            <li>Soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Love this brush is so soft.</li>
            <li>It is not as soft as I would like, but I think it will provide some interesting uses.  </li>
            <li>Well I cannot argue with the radiant smile on her face after each usage.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t outperform my Mac brushes (which I consider mid-level), but I love how soft this is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far too big for applying blush, unless you pinch it, but I&#x27;ve found it works great for applying setting powder.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have a number of these brushes and so far I am pleased with the brand.</li>
            <li>So I definitely recommend this brush not only to my drag sisters, but to women that want a great line of brushes for great prices.</li>
            <li>Worth your money.</li>
            <li>This brush in particular is sooo nice and soft!</li>
            <li>They feel so nice on the skin and not scratchy at all, like some other cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and I used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>Super soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Super soft an easy to use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super soft and easy to hold</li>
            <li>I am a drag queen, so the main part of our art is great brushes.</li>
            <li>It has a flat bottom so it can stand up on its own and washes up well.</li>
            <li>The high end brushes, in my experience, outperform their cheaper counterparts (although EcoTools does make some good, low cost brushes).</li>
            <li>As far as brushes go I also own high end MAC brushes, Sephora brushes, Bobbi Brown brushes and even Costco brushes.</li>
            <li>when I spray 99% isopropyl alcohol for spot cleaning, I can see right away if the brush is clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It picks up just the right amount of product.</li>
            <li>Well made, priced just right.</li>
            <li>This blush brush works just the right amount of color on the apples of the cheeks.  </li>
            <li>Applies just the right amount without overdoing it.</li>
            <li>just right with this brush.  </li>
            <li>It just feels right in my hand.  </li>
            <li>Some superglue fixed this, but I will probably go and buy any more real techniques brushes at Ulta!</li>
            <li>Yet I am in love with this brush and it is still pretty soft.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very soft.</li>
            <li>These are the most amazing soft as brushes I&#x27;ve ever had definitely will purchase the whole line</li>
            <li>Amazing brush all together, very soft, applies my blush in a natural way.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, love that it&#x27;s totally cruelty free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This, along with the other R.T. brushes are very easy to clean and maintain.  </li>
            <li>This is such a great brush for applying blush.the brush is very soft and really nice on my skin.i will be ordering the other Real Techniques Brushes.</li>
            <li>Super affordable and much softer than my Sigma brush.</li>
            <li>This is soft, easy to use, durable.</li>
            <li>As expected one of the good quality real technique blush brush.</li>
            <li>So soft and easy to handle to use.</li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it because it barely seemed to put any product on my face.  </li>
            <li>This brush is so soft and easy to use..</li>
            <li>Very soft and precise for applying blush to the cheek bones.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and the product goes on smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>This is very soft brush but huge for a blush on brush.</li>
            <li>SUPER soft!!!</li>
            <li>I like the brush very much.</li>
            <li>Ilove it very much.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>It has a oval top and not a flat, amd</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice little brush; it&#x27;s soft, has a nice shape and density and can be a nice little multitasking brush.</li>
            <li>Very soft bristles!!!</li>
            <li>They were amazingly with all kinds of high end and low end make-up.</li>
            <li>I think I will eventually purchase a second because I like have duplicates of favorite brushes.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s soft and light</li>
            <li>First off, what is with no one having these brushes in stock??  </li>
            <li>but I still prefer a smaller more dense brush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good, affordable brush for someone starting a brush collection, but buy it with the caveat, that unless you have a huge face, this is really not a blush brush.  </li>
            <li>I like this brush, goes on soft and smoothly.</li>
            <li>Really like this style, size and shape of this brush!</li>
            <li>I only use the top tapered part when I apply my powder blush</li>
            <li>It picks up just as much color as you need to build intensity without smearing so much color that you end up spending 5 minutes blending and fading to make the color look more natural.</li>
            <li>When I first received the brush I thought I did not need another blush brush,  </li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>now.at first I didnt know how to use it</li>
            <li>I really like this brush!</li>
            <li>Wow, when using this brush your blush looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>Fantastic Brush with soft bristles that do not shed.</li>
            <li>My favorite one I is currently!</li>
            <li>Really makes a difference!</li>
            <li>Feel so soft and non-irritating to my skin, plus they do a FANTASTIC job of applying the make up.  </li>
            <li>, it totally changed the look of my makeup, it looks more polished airbrushed and blended well</li>
            <li>but then I must build color up which sucked at first until I got used to it.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s so soft and light</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how soft and fluffy it is, and the shape makes it perfect for placing product exactly where I want.  </li>
            <li>**)</li>
            <li>I love how, depending on how you angle the brush, whether it&#x27;s using the tip of the brush, or the side of the brush, you can get a different application, yet</li>
            <li>This is my first impressions review.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, do not let that deter you from buying it, most makeup brushes can be used multiple ways, not just what the label says.</li>
            <li>But I still like it overall and use it mostly to blend my blush with my cheek contouring.</li>
            <li>The size of the brush head is big enough for it to double as a powder/finishing brush as well which is perfect when you&#x27;re travelling.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I did when I got</li>
            <li>Looks exactly as it said on the description.</li>
            <li>To complete the set purchased this brush as a Christmas gift for my daughter and overall she was very pleased with all the brushes.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush!</li>
            <li>The Real technique brushes are genius!</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t deposit to o much on the cheeks...and is  breeze to use!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s suppost to do.</li>
            <li>Pretty upset.</li>
            <li>This is the first time to use this brush.</li>
            <li>I wear full-on makeup everyday, so I need a stable of good brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Swipe it a few times across your cheeks and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>The brush is VERY easy to wash and dry.</li>
            <li>I like this for powdering my face with dr hauschka&#x27;s  body silk, perfect for down the center of the face.</li>
            <li>I am new to real techniques and I bought this with a couple of the starter kits, I really enjoy them.</li>
            <li>This feels whisper soft on your face and easily applies product to your face and allows you to blend it without much effort.</li>
            <li>Yes, you can maneuver the brush and color pickup and placement to get the right application -- but it&#x27;s too much work.</li>
            <li>The size of this brush (handle and bristles) is really just right, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Another real techniques brush done right.</li>
            <li>The bristles are tapered which is unlike any other blush brush I own.</li>
            <li>I have several Real Techniques brushes and love them all.</li>
            <li>My wife love it and say it&#x27;s as good as the expensive brands</li>
            <li>I use this for setting powder as it is pretty large for blush.</li>
            <li>Super soft and does not shed!</li>
            <li>I use it for bronzer and blush, and while I was skeptical at first, its shape is really perfect for these, because it really helps get the makeup right where you want it, while also blending it into your face so it is very natural looking.</li>
            <li>These were my first purchase of Real Techniques.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it five stars anyway because I&#x27;m so happily surprised that such an economical beauty item is more than just a bargain</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewers this brush is too big to be a blush brush, but it works great as a bronzing brush or setting brush.</li>
            <li>I also have a Mac 168 (the large angled brush), but the Real Techniques blush brush gives a more natural application and is just as soft.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you have a pretty big place to keep this thing - even my makeup organizer didn&#x27;t have a slot big enough for it to fit comfortably.</li>
            <li>And for a more natural to dewy foundation look, precision powdering down the T-zone and under eyes is easy with this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to wash (I use shampoo or facial wash to wash my brushes).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a heavier hand than using a stippling brush but light enough to avoid packing on too much color!</li>
            <li>The pointy shape of it also makes it easy to get onto specific areas of your cheeks</li>
            <li>It is super soft and does not shed at all.  </li>
            <li>Super soft fiber</li>
            <li>Super soft.</li>
            <li>I have a rather large face</li>
            <li>It is too large for my face but does work with baked foundation.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this to all who loves make up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too large to be a blush brush</li>
            <li>I find it too large for blush</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the large size fool you.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good buy and is exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>finally got it, very soft, couldnt ask for a better brush to apply blush.</li>
            <li>Very high quality brushes and</li>
            <li>Easy to clean with a little baby shampoo.</li>
            <li>Only problem is that the handle is HUGE.</li>
            <li>You only need to put product on the very tip and it applies so smoothly.</li>
            <li>Picks up and distributes color VERY WELL.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be better in my opinion, and being a fan of pink</li>
            <li>really quality brushes</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>So, when my dog ate my powder brush (really, my dog ate it)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but this real techniques brush puts the E.L.F to shame.</li>
            <li>Just what you expect from Real Techniques.</li>
            <li>I really like Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>It smelled of cheap perfume and visibly had blush on it, which is really gross.  </li>
            <li>This brush picks up blusher really well</li>
            <li>Ready to blend.</li>
            <li>They wash well and are so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I like this brush, but what I really wanted was the powder brush.  </li>
            <li>That one was not in stock, so I bought this one and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>most- like others say, harder to store this way.  </li>
            <li>instead I use real Techniques stippling brush to apply.  </li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t know why I just ordered once you charge me seven times please stop charge thanks</li>
            <li>figure out a reasonable way to use this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>To hell with all those high end lines that scratch up your face!</li>
            <li>It is very versatile , as a matter of fact</li>
            <li>it also works really well for bronzing the face/forehead.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s very diffuse and blended.</li>
            <li>Will be adding additional Real Techniques to my brush collection.</li>
            <li>and I must hand it to real Techniques</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Fast shipment!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that much about make up brushes, but I really like this one</li>
            <li>I guess you can read reviews to picture the real use out of this brush.</li>
            <li>and it blends very well</li>
            <li>I really, really like this brush.  </li>
            <li>Highly suggest this brush along with any brush from the line!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight and well made.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.  </li>
            <li>It blends the color really well, so you won&#x27;t have any streaking.  </li>
            <li>I really like how it applies the blush and bronzer.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need to keep reapplying much.</li>
            <li>I like all real techniques brushes</li>
            <li>and it does all three very well,</li>
            <li>Have almost all of the real techniques brushes now.  </li>
            <li>It is MUCH cheaper here online</li>
            <li>I never really understood how people could LOVE brushes</li>
            <li>I have some brushes that cost 3 times as much and have inferior quality.</li>
            <li>it looks wider than it really is.</li>
            <li>I have almost the whole set</li>
            <li>and they work really well with powder or cream.</li>
            <li>You dont need to use too much product either.</li>
            <li>Very helpful.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>It picks up color really well</li>
            <li>/&gt;It hold the product very will&lt;br</li>
            <li>i orderd 2 of real Techniques Blush Brush&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>i got 1 real Techniques Blush Brush and 1 real Techniques stapiling Brush</li>
            <li>Lovely soft, big brush.</li>
            <li>the bristles are soft but firm and it feels really good on my face.</li>
            <li>This brush is super soft, high quality and as a plus it stands up by itself.</li>
            <li>The shape of the domed blush looked smaller when it was in the package, but when I took it out to use it, it got more fluffier, thus, less easy to apply blush to certain areas of my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Both arrived pretty quickly so thumbs up for the seller, I use these brushes on a daily basis &amp; I&#x27;d recommend this to my friends..</li>
            <li>have a smaller, denser blush brush (Smashbox Brand) that I like to use as well, but that one really is better suited to lighter, less pigmented brushes that don&#x27;t show up easily on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I own most of their brushes (obsessed with them) and use this particular one for contour my cheeks, forehead and neck.</li>
            <li>It helps me achieve a natural flush looking whereas other brushes I own make me look like a clown.</li>
            <li>I ordered this blush brush, because I have enjoyed other Real Techniques brushes.  </li>
            <li>The brush itself was very soft and was exactly as pictured on amazon.</li>
            <li>tapered shape is not different from the shape of many higher end powder brushes, and it fits really well on different areas of the face.</li>
            <li>They clean up very well with regular dish soap and do not stain (from my experience).</li>
            <li>One I use for all over blush coverage and the other to highlight the top of the cheekbones with a mineral powder for a bit of shimmer.</li>
            <li>I often contour on top of my foundation with a bronzer or contour powder, then I use setting powder or foundation powder to set the other areas of my face and to blend my contour out.</li>
            <li>so i had to deep clean the brush.</li>
            <li>When you deep clean a brush, you see if the brush bristles fall out and see if the shape of the brush stay intact.</li>
            <li>Modern looking blush must be natural looking, like a flush after running around the block in hot weather.  </li>
            <li>It was very easy to wash and dried in no time.</li>
            <li>If you have never used a Real Techniques brush before I highly recommend you do .</li>
            <li>This is a nice, well-made brush, just like all of the real techniques brushes are (at least that i have tried) but it is way too big to apply blush precisely.</li>
            <li>Just make sure they dry completely or else</li>
            <li>bristles are so soft and it applies my powder even and when I do put my powder on with this brush, the bristles are super soft on my skin</li>
            <li>I have had Mac brushes for more than 6 years and always found them shedding, these have not shed a single hair and they are so so soft and my skin goes all uhmmm</li>
            <li>Like many others have said, it may be a little bit large to be used for blush, although I&#x27;ve used it that way in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Despite its size, I have no problem using this for blush as long as I&#x27;m light handed.</li>
            <li>So far I havent found something to use it for, so it&#x27;s just standing upright looking pretty on my vanity.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush and other Real Techniques brushes as I&#x27;m a big fan of Sam Chapman, and believe she would only bring to market a great quality product.</li>
            <li>That said, it is NOT worth MORE than about $10.</li>
            <li>I know I did receive a true item, because I also felt this brush at an Ulta after I&#x27;d ordered it, and it felt the same as the one I received.  </li>
            <li>When you take this brush out of the package, the first thing that will strike you is how SOFT the brush is.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the real Techniques brushes - I have yet to find one loose bristle.</li>
            <li>Then, I learned that I need to push the brush down more as I&#x27;m applying.  </li>
            <li>Really full and soft, makes putting on blush really easy and blends and sheers it out nicely due to the soft fullness of the brush.</li>
            <li>I wanted a new blush brush and after reading reviews and watching tutorials on youtube, I decided to give real Techniques a try.</li>
            <li>i also use it for contouring because of it&#x27;s slightly pointed top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bigger than I expected and a really nice quality.</li>
            <li>It would have been better if the brush was smaller for applying blush, but I wished it was bigger to apply powder.</li>
            <li>When Real Techniques came out a few years ago, I bought many of the brushes and brush sets.</li>
            <li>It applies your blush softly and evenly, so you can really control how intense you would like it to be.</li>
            <li>but this makes it look like I have a decent hand.</li>
            <li>As with all real Techniques brushes, the brush hair feels very plush and soft against skin.  </li>
            <li>Handles are shorter than my regular brushes but nothing I can&#x27;t get use to, it actually may allow me to have more control of the application.</li>
            <li>It is more soft than i expected.</li>
            <li>I use this brush mainly for putting on my powder to set my foundation.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft but get the product very well</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft, and it blended my blush very well.</li>
            <li>Also it is very soft and does not pick up too much makeup at a time.  </li>
            <li>The other brush is maybe a little softer, But this one is great as well.</li>
            <li>This brush is very soft!</li>
            <li>Very soft and dense for the price!</li>
            <li>This brush is super soft but large and dense enough to do</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for blending, smoothing, etc.</li>
            <li>The quality of this product was high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for those who can&#x27;t shell out $75 for a powder/blush brush.</li>
            <li>They are really high quality for the price of the brush.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li>The price can&#x27;t be beat for a high quality brush.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand for brushes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting this in addition to the sets they sell.  </li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this blush brush.  </li>
            <li>The hairs on this blush brush are a bit coarse in comparison, though compared maybe to a really crappy brush, these would be considered soft--there are many very course animal hair brushes, such as some of the ones from the Bare Minerals line, which would make this Real Techniques Blush Brush very soft by comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is pretty good product, not as soft as their smaller brushes that it sometimes cause irritation if i rub too much or too hard.</li>
            <li>This is such a soft brush, it makes applying makeup fun again!  </li>
            <li>Be sure to shake off the excess as this brush has a tendency to spread it too far, other than that I have no complaints.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a little too big for &amp;#34;blush&amp;#34;, but I use it fine for light blush application &amp; powder</li>
            <li>Love it when am in rush and need to apply all in one very quickly, so first I apply powder then with one side of the brush contour, then with the other one blush and lastly with the tip of the brush highlighter !</li>
            <li>I wish the brush is a little bit more dense</li>
            <li>da un acabado muy natural con el rubor!!</li>
            <li>This is a large fluffy brush with extremely soft bristles, I love it, but for my bronzer rather than blush.</li>
            <li>I really loved the bristles, however, the black part of the handle is quiete loose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean and maintains it&#x27;s shape which has been a real problem for me with other brushes purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>Not as soft as I had hoped, but NOT scratchy and definitely better than some of my more expensive brushes.  </li>
            <li>and it is soooo soft, but the shape really confuses me.</li>
            <li>Soft and gentle brush .</li>
            <li>I love how fluffy it is</li>
            <li>Some brushes that are the same price as this brush sheds a lot and its not even worth getting.</li>
            <li>I have a few high-end blush brushes that cost a lot more and this one gets the job</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth buying especially with this price!</li>
            <li>but as I got the hang how to omg the final results is worth it.</li>
            <li>I just wish it was a bit more firm.</li>
            <li>My main issue is covering up melasma and mild adult acne, and I had decided to revamp my entire makeup routine because what worked when I was 20, just ain&#x27;t cuttin&#x27; it at 40ish.</li>
            <li>This brush is pretty soft, not as soft as the powder brush</li>
            <li>I do have a narrow face, so maybe if you had a rounder face this would work better.  </li>
            <li>all the product stays, for lack of a better word, trapped in the brush.</li>
            <li>Invest just a few Dollars more and get a couple quality brushes.</li>
            <li>Quality is good but its performance is poor.</li>
            <li>the way it&#x27;s designed allows you to use just the tip to put color down precisely where you want it and then blend with the whole brush.</li>
            <li>The soft &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; are silky and don&#x27;t fall out, as so many other brands of brushers do!</li>
            <li>Super soft bristles and very solid construction.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too big, but just the right size and picks up sufficient product.</li>
            <li>Right off I&#x27;ll say that this isn&#x27;t a standard, \\&quot;flat\\&quot; blush/powder brush.</li>
            <li>brush also delivers the right amount of product, is just dense enough to blend into an airbrushed finish (but I wish it was denser), and the taper can place product with precision.</li>
            <li>I had seen a lot of mixed reviews and didn&#x27;t know if I had made the right choice.</li>
            <li>I actually have a few blush brushes, but I really wanted to try this one because I&#x27;ve enjoyed all of the real techniques brushes I have bought.  </li>
            <li>I have done a few reviews on RT brushes in the past and my opinion remains the same that these are some of the best brushes i have ever used.</li>
            <li>I am not aggressive when I clean my brushes and didn&#x27;t run the water straight into (held it pointing down under running water like you&#x27;re supposed to.)</li>
            <li>I decided to look into new foundation, powder, and blush brushes and I found these.</li>
            <li>Thought it time for some new ones</li>
            <li>I am new to these brushes and using them for blush.  </li>
            <li>OR if you just need a new blush brush.  </li>
            <li>Brand new.</li>
            <li>Immediately I cleaned my brush, like you should every time you get a new brush, and then went to town with my make up.</li>
            <li>I really like the entire line of real Technique brushes, and the blush brush serves its purpose well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice big fluffy blush brush.</li>
            <li>Very soft and provides even distribution.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>The shape of the bristles doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, and they are very soft.  </li>
            <li>The blush is very soft</li>
            <li>I like this blush brush, it gives a very natural look when I apply blush.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and holds its shape well.</li>
            <li>The brush is ultra plush and very soft..</li>
            <li>Its a very very soft brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bristles are very soft and I&#x27;ll be buying mor Tecknique brushes.</li>
            <li>Very soft brush</li>
            <li>It is very, very soft . . . .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved other brushes by Real Techniques, but, like other reviewers, I find this brush too big for blush application.  </li>
            <li>Had my eye on this brush for a little while now (people seem to love the Real Techniques brushes), so I finally bought it.</li>
            <li>I enjoy them as much if not more than some of my high end brushes.</li>
            <li>This one is so luxurious and soft!</li>
            <li>I went back and forth on whether or not to buy the sets but decided to try out this one first.</li>
            <li>and I replaced all of my bare essentials brushes with real techniques.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sooooo soft, I know people say that all the time about brushes but my goodness!</li>
            <li>but I will most likely use for other applications.</li>
            <li>It is so amazingly soft and gets the job done!</li>
            <li>I have others that i have purchased from retailers, and they look feel and perform exactly the same.</li>
            <li>the brush is really soft!</li>
            <li>both angles are somewhat fluffy--this is unique in comparison to other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its so soft!</li>
            <li>And it is so soft!</li>
            <li>They are so soft and versatile!</li>
            <li>and I usually spend ALOT more on Mac brushes and this one</li>
            <li>I have been wanting this particular real Techniques brush since I saw it in my local &amp;#34;big box&amp;#34; store.</li>
            <li>Brush is soft, full and does not shed like some other high end brushes in my beauty box.  </li>
            <li>However, I especially like the Real Techniques Brush for highly pigmented blushes (e.g., my Lancome Blush Subtil blushes, my Tarte Amazonian Clay blushes) because it helps you control the amount of color you apply to your cheeks.  </li>
            <li>Not impressed by the way it works, nothing special, better to buy elf brushes.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and do no irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m a little older, my blush/highlighter placement is more precise, contoured, and subtle.</li>
            <li>This particular brush works well with my Bare Minerals face powder.</li>
            <li>I personally think it&#x27;s too large to be a blush brush</li>
            <li>I am very particular about my makeup brushes and was a little skeptical when this brush was greatly recommended because of the reasonable price.</li>
            <li>They are soft and have the proper shape to do the job, plus they are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I recommend anyone that wants a durable, soft and quality brush to purchase the entire collection.  </li>
            <li>So soft, color blends well off of it</li>
            <li>aspect I find very helpful is that the tips are white, so</li>
            <li>the brushes are so soft and it doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>Not as soft as I imagined...</li>
            <li>them as much as my sigma brushes.ive got back ups!!!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;extra soft</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bristles are soft -- perhaps too soft for powder blush application.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and</li>
            <li>It is so soft, and applies blush like a dream.</li>
            <li>felt it was way to soft which makes it kinda flimsy.</li>
            <li>this coming from a girl who is a religious user of real techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>If you are still uncertain about its appearance after my inadequate description, I think Ulta sells the entire Real Techniques line.</li>
            <li>soft on my&lt;br /&gt;face.</li>
            <li>This brush is so soft.  </li>
            <li>Soft , but not for me ,,, I prefer ecotools powder brush</li>
            <li>Soooo soft and picks/applies powder products beautifully.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and when I washed it after arrival, the water came out</li>
            <li>I used it for mineral powder foundation and it did NOT apply my powder like my old tried-and-true MAC Kabuki brush does.</li>
            <li>the bristles are really soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and non-irritating.</li>
            <li>think the problem with this brush is that it is way too soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft to the touch and doesn&#x27;t damage my skin.</li>
            <li>This is the second blush brush I have bought from real Techniques.  </li>
            <li>Soft brush</li>
            <li>So soft and provides even distribution of the blush.</li>
            <li>This brush i felt was too big for me to apply the blush, i decided to buy the RT Stippling brush, and i am much happier with the results</li>
            <li>Bristles are so soft and tapered.</li>
            <li>It applies blush with the slightest hint of color and it blends it seamlessly.  </li>
            <li>I feels soft on your face.  </li>
            <li>The fur is so soft.</li>
            <li>It applies my blush effortlessly whilst leaving your face with a soft glow.</li>
            <li>it cause leaves no harsh lines on my cheeks and even looks natural.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s soft as heck...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft and makes my blushed cheeks look so natural.</li>
            <li>Soft and no shedding.</li>
            <li>This does not shed and makes my blush application look natural.</li>
            <li>The hair are soft on the face also even after 10 washes and counting....</li>
            <li>However, I use this big and soft, fluffy brush for application of my MAC Skinfinish face powder on top of</li>
            <li>So soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 8.99 and for what you get and the quality, it&#x27;s a complete steal.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase a lot of real technique brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve just added it to my professional kit...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and doesn&#x27;t have any fall outs.</li>
            <li>, now this is the only thing she wants from now on.</li>
            <li>Soft and plush.</li>
            <li>Extremely soft</li>
            <li>they are soft and do not shed.</li>
            <li>so soft.</li>
            <li>Love this big fluffy quality brush.</li>
            <li>It does not pick up too little or too much product but just the right amount.</li>
            <li>, delivery was fast &amp; price is also reasonable compare to other brands...</li>
            <li>Have to be careful not to get too large of an area!</li>
            <li>Ok just to let you know that for blush application I&#x27;ve used the MAC 187, 109, the Sigma small duo fibre (don&#x27;t remember the #) and a generic Revlon one</li>
            <li>The smaller size keeps the blush high and on the apple of my cheek.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m talking about high end proudcts like benefit and urban decay and Cargo!</li>
            <li>i think the blush brush bristles themselves are too long for my tastes, so i don&#x27;t really use the tip of the bristles but will apply blush/bronzer by using the side of the brush.</li>
            <li>Bristles holding on together fine after at least 10 times used so far.</li>
            <li>Soft and subtle but colors are easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Its definitely worth trying and typically these brushes are cheaper here on Amazon than they are in stores.</li>
            <li>The blush brushes are fluffy, hold product really well, and wash/dry really well, holding their shape.  </li>
            <li>Ive used brushes from every major makeup brand out there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy other real techniques brushes for me and my mom!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and fluffy and just the right size.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i use it to apply a blush and to set my soundation with loose powder sometime worked very nicly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and fluffy!</li>
            <li>It is soft and doesn&#x27;t waste too much product but really needs different shape.</li>
            <li>You just don&#x27;t get that luxurious, velvety soft feeling on your fingertips like you do with other Real Techniques brushes.  </li>
            <li>and I could also purchase other brushes to complete my real Techniques collection.</li>
            <li>Before I used MAC and bare escentuals, but even with the high price tag I had issues with the foundation brush especially leaving bristles all over my face- constantly.</li>
            <li>The bristles are pretty stiff, but they are pretty loosely packed.</li>
            <li>It also keeps it shape really well for such a big brush, I&#x27;ve heard people complain about it being too big</li>
            <li>I dont use it anymore, my mac blush barely applies to my face.</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>This brush is seriously so soft, but also dense at the same time</li>
            <li>I have had a few brushes from Everyday Minerals for almost 5 years which are still softer, fuller, smoother and overall better than these real techniques brushes were the first day I opened them, and that is after using these everyday mineral brushes every day for over four years.</li>
            <li>It is very, very soft and has minimal shedding, which I cant say the same for some of my high end brushes.</li>
            <li>Most other brushes are much more expensive and more disappointing.  </li>
            <li>brush head is very fluffy, and it is true what I had read from another reviewer:</li>
            <li>because after using it twice and being dissatisfied with the lack of control it gives, due to it&#x27;s large size, I tucked it away.  </li>
            <li>The tapering all round really helps with diffusing and blending color to achieve a very natural blush finish.  </li>
            <li>It is quite soft and so far has not shed a single bristle.</li>
            <li>I am not a big fan on big brushes, but I got this one because it seemed soo soft... and it is!</li>
            <li>Pretty ridiculous really,</li>
            <li>think I would try the other brushes in Sam&#x27;s Real Technique line.</li>
            <li>if ur in the market for a well priced buffing brush also check out the other real techniques brushes .</li>
            <li>not a single bristle has fallen out.</li>
            <li>It picks up a small amount of product and can apply a sheer coverage to a full coverage depending on your desire.  </li>
            <li>When I first got it, I was a little intimated by the size of the brush.</li>
            <li>Initially I thought I would use it for bronzer due to the large size.  </li>
            <li>It is a little bigger than I expected, BUT because of it&#x27;s shape it allows for precise application.</li>
            <li>but no, the bristles feel greasy, are hard to clean and do not go back into the shape they should be.</li>
            <li>Its a little large for some looks, but works well.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a little too large for applying blush</li>
            <li>It is too round and large for my liking when applying blush or even powder.  </li>
            <li>This may be &amp;#34;soft,&amp;#34; but the brush is not nearly as soft as other Real Techniques brushes, such as the Expert Face Brush.  </li>
            <li>We belive its not original Real Techniques</li>
            <li>I am a Sigma girl, so I was a little reluctant in trying this one because it&#x27;s so much cheaper</li>
            <li>either left way too much product, or so little you couldn&#x27;t even see</li>
    </ol>

            <li> --Amazing brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> omg RT brushes are sooooo amazing.</li>
            <li> Almost itchy to be honest.</li>
            <li> The brushes are cruelty-free and have nice metal handles.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to have a variety.  </li>
            <li> nice blending brush for the price</li>
            <li> Real Techniques are done of the best brushes out there.</li>
            <li> They are made so nice</li>
            <li> but this brush is absolutely the best!!!!!</li>
            <li> and I think the color goes on nicely and looks blended.</li>
            <li> Real techniques are the best affordable brushes.  </li>
            <li> Its domed shape fits nicely in the hollows of my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Grabs product effectively and distributes evenly.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, nice looking, washes well ...</li>
            <li> Real Techniques are the best brushes I have used all year.</li>
            <li> brush fits perfectly on the cheek area, it gives a great finish to my powder blushes, but for cream brushes I prefer a smaller brush.</li>
            <li> and it works nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Real Technique brushes for a while now, and this is the best Blush brush I have purchased.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t see it as effective for blush application, I knew this beforehand from the reviews.</li>
            <li> The brush feels nice held and the extended aluminium ferrule is a nice touch design-wise.  </li>
            <li> I used it for blush and it gave a nice flush of color.</li>
            <li> It diffuses the product nicely.</li>
            <li> love the volume of this brush for a good powder finishing touch</li>
            <li> But, it will give you a nice blend on the perimeter of your face or on your cheeks.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect size, it picks up color very well, and doesn&#x27;t puff blush all over my face.</li>
            <li> I have been nothing but impressed with all of the Real Techniques brushes I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I have been loving this brush, I use it every day now.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have the space to do that in my bathroom, at the moment, but it may be nice to do in the future.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice for applying powder all over.</li>
            <li> fantastic price for a very nice brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, great brush, well worth the price!</li>
            <li> They are pretty, sturdy, good quality and great price.</li>
            <li> looks flawless, brush is not prickly but soft.definitely will look into buying more real techniques brushes!</li>

            <li> Very easy to blend with</li>
            <li> I like it more than my MAC brushes but still love my sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quite versatile, you can literally just use the tip top of the brush and the application is lovely and blended!</li>
            <li> I use this for blush and its perfect, so so soft!</li>
            <li> Great brush, I love it, great for blush, very soft.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used it on powder and cream blush, and both times I was impressed.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing blush brush</li>
            <li> I also own some drugstore brand brushes, but have to say, for the most part, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> If you already have a great collection, you may be like me, and find that you rarely reach for</li>
            <li> The brush is so soft and applies my blush on perfectly.</li>
            <li> it is brilliant and fast.</li>
            <li> So soft and the shape is perfect to apply any power blush!</li>
            <li> So soft and perfectly tapered.</li>
            <li> Perfect quality, ridiculously soft, and they get the job done.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion this is the best blush brush i have had so far.</li>
            <li> The bright is lightweight and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> This is the best blush brush in my collection so far...</li>
            <li> Best brush ever, so soft, no shedding.</li>
            <li> Incredibly soft and feels wonderful along one&#x27;s cheekbones.  </li>
            <li> I am a makeup addict and own a ton of MAC and Sigma brushes - this brand is the most bang for your buck</li>
            <li> But i still use it, and i washed it and it was still amazingly perfect and soft after.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and it makes me happy to see this in the morning!</li>
            <li> Is soft and works great!</li>
            <li> Nice brush, seen at ULTA for more.</li>
            <li> nice for contouring more than blush</li>
            <li> but honestly I couldn&#x27;t give it more than 2 stars.</li>
            <li> The size is perfect and the slight pointedness is great for contouring.</li>
            <li> Great arrival, right on time.</li>
            <li> Love love love this brush!</li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pick up too much product and is good for blending!</li>
            <li> Gives me the most natural and perfect flush everytime!</li>
            <li> The best blush and contour brush I&#x27;ve used so far, Love it.</li>
            <li> Another great brush from Real Techniques!</li>
            <li> other wise great!</li>
            <li> And believe me I&#x27;m very precise with my make up even on rush.</li>
            <li> I have used it to apply one of my tarte blushes and it applies it very smooth to my cheeks.</li>
            <li> This brush I think is a good find and for the price a pretty good deal because it&#x27;s light on the pocket book..</li>
            <li> Soft, easy to use and great product application!</li>
            <li> that I thought I liked and worked just fine...</li>
            <li> This brush is beautifully designed, high quality soft and smooth bristles allow perfect application of powder products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i love the packaging of this item.</li>
            <li> i am so in love  </li>
            <li> This brush is incredible; the bristles are soft and don&#x27;t come off on my face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best--and such a great price!</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> This is more like a powder brush for all over face than a blush brush</li>
            <li> done much better.  </li>
            <li> reviews!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for more than 2 years and it feels, and works, just like it did when I bought it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;OH, one more thing</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just getting spoiled because I have picked up some nicer brushes on sale and now expect more bang for my buck.</li>
            <li> Real Techiques is a great Brand.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a great shape, slightly more rounded than a tulip head brush, but still very multi-purpose.  </li>
            <li> have owned this brush for nine months, have used it many times, but not every day.</li>
            <li> I actually use this for my powder because it is the perfect size for me.  </li>
            <li> Definitely better for a lighter/natural look and with blush vs bronzer.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t know if it sheds more after wash.</li>
            <li> recommended 👍 top quality</li>
            <li> I just received this brush as a gift, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> soft bristles and ideal size for blusher.</li>
            <li> but because it&#x27;s tapered at the top</li>
            <li> They are the perfect length and weight for daily use.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.</li>
            <li> Am sure this will work on some faces.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a \\&quot;dome\\&quot; brush</li>
            <li> If you find it somewhere for more than that, keep looking because there are better prices elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love them both.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  glad</li>
            <li> I think this brush is better than MAC..</li>

            <li> I love this brush the quality and price are outstanding.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a blush brush, but find myself using it more as a powder brush.  </li>

            <li> Love this I already have one</li>
            <li> For me, the brush is better to be use as a powder brush</li>

            <li> My daughter love this item and the rest that was purchase</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple to apply blush flawless to your face!</li>
            <li> I read a lot of rewiews of many brushes before buy this one.</li>
            <li> Love it and thinking to buy another one</li>
            <li> Love it for my translucent powder.</li>
            <li> Another great brush from Real Techniques.</li>
            <li> It makes it more fool-proof.</li>
            <li> I really really love this brush.</li>
            <li> LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I love it&#x27;s shape for doing powder application.  </li>
            <li> Washes very well and has a great handle.  </li>
            <li> This gives you such a flawless look.</li>
            <li> It would be better if it would come with a case or if I could order a case for it as well...</li>
            <li> I give 5 start cause it works for me.. definitely better than the elf brushes I was using..</li>
            <li> I use this for bronzer instead of blush, and I love it.</li>
            <li> This is more a powder brush I think the blush brush should be more sturdy</li>
            <li> For many blushes, one swipe is all it takes.  </li>
            <li> The Mac 168 is better for contouring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love this brush.</li>
            <li> I will buy more for sure</li>
            <li> Love this brush....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hearing and reading a lot of great things about Real Techniques brushes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for anyone who has a tendancy to overdo their blush because it really allows you to build up to the amount of color you want.  </li>
            <li> I also love the length and shape of the handle.  </li>
            <li> Love Real Techniques brushes for such great quality, value and perfect application!</li>
            <li> It gives great coverage because of it&#x27;s size and it picks product up very well.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> It applies product very softly and blends it beautifully.</li>
            <li> It makes applying blush feel very light and easy, but I do find myself dipping into the blush compact more.  </li>
            <li> All of these brushes clean up nicely with any sort of makeup brush cleaner or even face wash for that matter.</li>
            <li> I freaking love this brush, it&#x27;s the most perfect to apply blush, and i love the pink color</li>
            <li> It is super soft and the best thing it doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> When i first opened the box, i noticed that the packaging itself was good.</li>
            <li> Pretty good brush for the price.</li>
            <li> This brush is excellent quality, though I think it&#x27;s better for applying loose powder than it is for blush.</li>
            <li> They are quality, easy-to-use, and economically friendly; my type of brush line!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I bought it, but I have loved all of the real techniques brushes that I have bought.</li>
            <li> Good quality, LOVE real techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> It is a good brush - soft and nice quality.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and attractive.</li>
            <li> The application is very light, too light.</li>
            <li> yes there are better brushes out there, but these are absolutely fine.</li>
            <li> Very cool product and purchased Recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Samantha Chapman and these brushes are definitely my favorite brushes to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for blush, and it gives a natural effect.</li>
            <li> and I prefer to place it it more precisely.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to use them a lot yet, but so far I am so happy</li>
            <li> So soft and great.</li>
            <li> so soft and helps blend the brush great on your face...</li>
            <li> Brilliant for contouring, especially for powder products.</li>
            <li> I also love how it is tapered so that I can just lightly brush the blush on my cheek bones, and then I blend it out with the sides of the brush.  </li>
            <li> Okay, so honestly I was nervous when I first purchased this product.</li>
            <li> Another good Real Techniques brush.  </li>
            <li> I like the real techniques brushes because they are good for the price.</li>
            <li> The bristles never fall out, and they are so easy to clean!</li>
            <li> it applies product well, very smooth and clean finish.</li>
            <li> So soft I love RT brushes!!</li>
            <li> I own many high end brushes: mostly MAC and Nars, but also Hourglass, Shu Uemura,and Chanel.</li>
            <li> Also, I want to mention that the quality of this brush, especially considering how affordable it is, is REALLY good!</li>
            <li> So quick and easy!</li>
            <li> It retains its shape perfectly after washing, and dries quicker than my other brushes.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to blend the blush where you want it.</li>
            <li> Has never shed and is REALLY easy to wash.</li>
            <li> Order came very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Even though she could go longer between cleanings, she chooses to clean them more often than recommended without any degradation to the brushes.  </li>
            <li> I think I now officially own all of the real techniques brushes and I feel that they are a worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy - I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate in recommending this brush to others and the complete Real Techniques range.</li>
            <li> Its soft,pick up product easily &amp; evenly.....</li>

            <li> Easily cleaned and held its shape well.</li>
            <li> The tapered end makes it easy to define the contour of the cheekbone as well as apply blush to the apples of the cheeks.</li>
            <li> It is affordable, attractive, amazingly soft and cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Great brush, worth every penny, thanks</li>
            <li> It is nice and soft so your make up goes on nicely and does not make your face look flakey.</li>
            <li> My Real Techniques brushes are my favorite brushes I own.</li>
            <li> i strongly recommend this product and the brand</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I ordered this, good thing that The shipping was fast</li>
            <li> I expected a better brush because of all the good reviews!</li>
            <li> I love love love real techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> This blusher brush is the best out of the other brushes!</li>
            <li> Soft (probably best for pigmented high end</li>
            <li> I like it better than any of the high end brand blush/powder brushes that I own</li>
            <li> shape, I must say, is very unique and cool looking.  </li>
            <li> and then they are good as new.</li>
            <li> I had mine for over two years as good as new, and ordered again for my family</li>
            <li> And she uses it more that her other brushes so it must be good!</li>
            <li> size and weight of the brush are just fine.</li>
            <li> I ordered the powder brush and its bristles were so soft, full and a great quality</li>
            <li> love at first sight :)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s Beautiful and very practical, I like it so much</li>
            <li> It felt fantastic on my skin and picked up product easily.</li>
            <li> As all the other reviews has stated, this brush is very high quality, nicely packaged, and SOOOO CUTE!!!</li>
            <li> I like it, its super soft and the handle gives great control.</li>
            <li> As with all Real Technique brushes the ferrule is nice and sturdy and easy to grip.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super soft and the quality is great</li>
            <li> I like it just fine for blush, but I can see this being fantastic for bronzer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft :) I also got the powder brush which I love as well :)  </li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for highlighting, and has even worked for bronzing, although it looked a little stripey.</li>
            <li> i feel in love :))) tender, soft, very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have a couple nars ones and its excellent with those (not so much with the 100% pure blush, that one falls apart and get way too much on the brush)</li>
            <li> not super impressed, but not disappointed either.</li>
            <li> I was sure their make-up brushes would be fine, but it turned out to be amazing, super- soft!!</li>
            <li> When applying blush on my face, I end up having two huge blobs.</li>
            <li> Using it as a blush brush I get two huge swathes of color on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> It does not disturb the makeup on my face when I use it and it holds it&#x27;s shape after washing which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> To be honest though, I was expecting this brush to be way more soft.</li>
            <li> This is a very big blush brush but the quality is great.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for applying power, and dusting off eyeshadow the falls onto my upper cheeks after I apply it.</li>
            <li> Not as precise, but with blush I always start light and build</li>
            <li> Great brush for bronzing up my face, I would say to big for blush.</li>
            <li> but I believe its made for blush primarily.</li>
            <li> Also, the bulky bottom is not practical since all of my brushes are stuck in a glass jar filled with rice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The blush goes on so smooth and effortlessly.</li>
            <li> As professional makeup artists, we know great artistry is only as good as your techniques and tools.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this blush brush.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> however i have a feeling that i will really enjoy it</li>
            <li> I used it for blush and then for just light powdering.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the quality, as is always the case with the real techniques brushes, is astounding which is why it still gets 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I learned not to go cheap with brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great brush, picks up enough to build up to desired blush color intensity.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I use it to gently smooth out my contour</li>
            <li> I loved this blush brush, it is just fabulous to use and blends very well, worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This brush is fabulous.</li>
            <li> The handle is so comfortable.</li>
            <li> Seeing how fabulous this brush worked, I can&#x27;t wait to receive the others.</li>
            <li> I think you could use this for mineral foundation too, if you like a light airbrushed look</li>
            <li> Its really fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Bigger than I thought but its great for applying a sheerer blush.</li>
            <li> Could use this for a luminizer too with a light hand</li>
            <li> foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hairs on this brush are really secure.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great value.</li>

            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> But that could be a pro since it is capable of standing on its own, so</li>

            <li> I love this brush so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the Real Techniques brand!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a long time to fine this kind of quality!</li>
            <li> If it were more tapered it would be great but after washing it is too round.</li>
            <li> The price was perfect, the bristles are soft and it was shipped the next day!</li>
            <li> clean-</li>
            <li> i recommend this for everyone who wants good and reasonably priced brush.</li>
            <li> Very soft to the touch, feels nice on your skin.</li>
            <li> very soft, and it blends the blush nicely on my cheeks, i got the NYX peach blush with it as well.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing quality and is so soft!</li>
            <li> Great brush for setting makeup with loose powder.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this blush brush after hearing so many positive reviews about it.</li>
            <li> Fits right into my starter kit too!</li>
            <li> I have heard so many people rave over this particular blush brush, but I just did not find it to be as fabulous as others did.</li>
            <li> More than decent for its price!</li>
            <li> It is fantastic, high quality, and comparable to brushes I have paid much, much more for.</li>
            <li> This blush brush blends amazingly well and is soooo soft.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of real techniques</li>
            <li> I picked the Real Technicques Blush Brush up at Ulta a couple of months ago, and I&#x27;m glad I did because I haven&#x27;t seen them since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do love some of the Real Techniques brushes...</li>
            <li> The brush is really soft and feels nice on the face.</li>
            <li> Extremely soft and applies product nicely.</li>
            <li> I really like this blush brush to apply darker more pigmented blushes.  </li>
            <li> This appears to be an authentic REAL TECHNIQUES BRUSH.</li>
            <li> Love all real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has used real techniques brushes knows how fabulous these are!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes so much.</li>
            <li> I got it for a really reasonable price and will buy more from this vendor.</li>
            <li> but overall it is a good quality brush</li>
            <li> the brush is too tall , I love it so much for blush</li>
            <li> I love all of the real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> I love real techniques brushes...</li>
            <li> The are supper soft but still effective.  </li>
            <li> They are worth it and far more affordable then most make up brushes on the market.  </li>
            <li> I love Real Technique brushes</li>
            <li> I love all the Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> Overall, its a good brush for the value.</li>
            <li> I love real techniques.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t much of a blush brush but more of a all over powder brush.</li>
            <li> I love Real Techniques brushes and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> I love ALL my real technique brushes.</li>
            <li> I love Real Techniques Blush Brush...</li>
            <li> It would be better to use the stippling brush to concentrate color in an area, this splays out too much to do contouring on areas like your nose.</li>
            <li> I love real technique brushes.</li>
            <li> Love all my real techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> Love it so much, that I&#x27;m going to buy another.</li>
            <li> the brush is nice and soft.</li>
            <li> They are so reasonable and work better than some of my sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Real Techniques brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice and fluffy and the synthetic bristles are soft, which makes it an ideal brush for blending.</li>
            <li> With darker, more pigmented blushes, a dense brush tends to apply too much blush, so I need another brush (the EcoTools blush brush) to blend it out.  </li>
            <li> I love it so so much.</li>
            <li> It is able to blend the product very well.</li>
            <li> However that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the difference between my old brush... which I thought was pretty good... and this one.</li>
            <li> it is soft and easy to use :)</li>
            <li> Soft on the skin, easy to wash, love</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so super soft and applies my blush so nicely.</li>
            <li> This brush is a little large for blush, but I find does an excellent job with bronzer or powder for me.</li>
            <li> Strong solid not falling excellent size with a comfortable handle hand in Maintained a smooth and take the powder form that you really need neither plus nor minus</li>
            <li> .) Dries quickly after a wash&lt;br /&gt;4.)</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, fast drying, do not shade at all.</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve had good results with all the Real Techniques line</li>
            <li> I use it mainly for foundation, but this brush is also lovely for blush.</li>
            <li> Super prompt.</li>
            <li> But overall it doesn&#x27;t shed and it&#x27;s an ok but not the most idealistic blush brush that you would want to have.</li>
            <li> really well, I don&#x27;t use to powder my face or anything else, I prefer smaller ones, but does a great job blending both powder and cream products.</li>
            <li> This brush dries quickly too -</li>
            <li> This feels great and is a good weight in my hand, but I just find it a little big for the area of my cheeks</li>
            <li> very big very nice very dense&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li> Very soft pile ,very comfortable handle</li>
            <li> The brush hair is easy to clean and has held its shape even after many spot and deep cleanings.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are really soft, I got this one in the mail today and was not disappointed in anyway when I put on my blush, makes it look so smooth and blended!</li>
            <li> I thought the shape of the brush was interesting, since most blush brushes I&#x27;ve seen are either flat or rounded.  </li>
            <li> Super Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> No loose hairs with just a nice, even look to the skin.</li>
            <li> My new favorite blush brush.</li>
            <li> My new favorite for applying blush.</li>
            <li> This is my first real technique brush and I plan to purchase more.  </li>
            <li> Wonderfully soft, easy to clean, and I love how steady it stands.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty!</li>
            <li> but it is exactly what I need for highlighting my cheeks!</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it is the perfect size, not too big and not too small.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> If you bought the trio starter set or the purple starter set and you weren&#x27;t impressed; the single brushes are next level!</li>
            <li> At first a few not so good reviews dissuaded me but don&#x27;t let them!</li>
            <li> I used to use this a lot for powdered blush and it&#x27;s awesome for that, especially if it&#x27;s not too crumbly or loose.</li>
            <li> and then I was able to lightly blend in a little powder highlighter on top of my cheekbones.</li>
            <li> Real Techniques brushes are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I like to try all and any intriguing makeup products, brushes included.</li>
            <li> I am a huge real techniques can, and have the majority of their brushes.</li>
            <li> Great fluffy brush for blush or even powdering the face or bronzing.</li>
            <li> I was a huge Mac and sigma fan until I tried real technique.</li>
            <li> I am a huge real Techniques fan and use them in almost all my youtube makeup tutorials.</li>
            <li> This one is great for a sheer wash of color on the cheeks and can also be used to lightly dust various setting powders.</li>
            <li> Such a soft and great shaped blush brush.</li>
            <li> love this brand its so soft for the skin</li>
            <li> This brush is sooo soft, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a fantastic blush brush!  </li>
            <li> But is it worth it to sacrifice looks over functionality?</li>
            <li> this brush.you may be like me, and find that you rarely reach for this brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s synthetic, of course, and well worth</li>
            <li> This brush is really soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I rarely need this brush to stand up, and would prefer a slimmer handle.</li>
            <li> I am buying more because I love it so much I use it for different powder products so why not have a couple</li>
            <li> I love how soft it is.  </li>
            <li> She has made and entire brush collection that is affordable, well made, great colors, and soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> I love the natural look it gives when I use it to aply my blush.  </li>
            <li> The cheek brush however is kind of big...</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are brushes whose shape is far better suited to being a blush brush or a bronzer brush or an all-over powder brush.</li>
            <li> The brush is quite big, so it&#x27;s great for a natural look</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and so easy to clean - make up doesn&#x27;t stick to the brushes at all.</li>
            <li> love how soft this brush is.</li>
            <li> For a soft makeup is ok</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome but was delivered to me with the handle completely broken off.</li>
            <li> Soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Love this brush is so soft.</li>
            <li> It is not as soft as I would like, but I think it will provide some interesting uses.  </li>
            <li> Well I cannot argue with the radiant smile on her face after each usage.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t outperform my Mac brushes (which I consider mid-level), but I love how soft this is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far too big for applying blush, unless you pinch it, but I&#x27;ve found it works great for applying setting powder.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have a number of these brushes and so far I am pleased with the brand.</li>
            <li> So I definitely recommend this brush not only to my drag sisters, but to women that want a great line of brushes for great prices.</li>
            <li> Worth your money.</li>
            <li> This brush in particular is sooo nice and soft!</li>
            <li> They feel so nice on the skin and not scratchy at all, like some other cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and I used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> Super soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Super soft an easy to use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super soft and easy to hold</li>
            <li> I am a drag queen, so the main part of our art is great brushes.</li>
            <li> It has a flat bottom so it can stand up on its own and washes up well.</li>
            <li> The high end brushes, in my experience, outperform their cheaper counterparts (although EcoTools does make some good, low cost brushes).</li>
            <li> As far as brushes go I also own high end MAC brushes, Sephora brushes, Bobbi Brown brushes and even Costco brushes.</li>
            <li> when I spray 99% isopropyl alcohol for spot cleaning, I can see right away if the brush is clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It picks up just the right amount of product.</li>
            <li> Well made, priced just right.</li>
            <li> This blush brush works just the right amount of color on the apples of the cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Applies just the right amount without overdoing it.</li>
            <li> just right with this brush.  </li>
            <li> It just feels right in my hand.  </li>
            <li> Some superglue fixed this, but I will probably go and buy any more real techniques brushes at Ulta!</li>
            <li> Yet I am in love with this brush and it is still pretty soft.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very soft.</li>
            <li> These are the most amazing soft as brushes I&#x27;ve ever had definitely will purchase the whole line</li>
            <li> Amazing brush all together, very soft, applies my blush in a natural way.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, love that it&#x27;s totally cruelty free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This, along with the other R.T. brushes are very easy to clean and maintain.  </li>
            <li> This is such a great brush for applying blush.the brush is very soft and really nice on my skin.i will be ordering the other Real Techniques Brushes.</li>
            <li> Super affordable and much softer than my Sigma brush.</li>
            <li> This is soft, easy to use, durable.</li>
            <li> As expected one of the good quality real technique blush brush.</li>
            <li> So soft and easy to handle to use.</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it because it barely seemed to put any product on my face.  </li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and easy to use..</li>
            <li> Very soft and precise for applying blush to the cheek bones.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and the product goes on smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> This is very soft brush but huge for a blush on brush.</li>
            <li> SUPER soft!!!</li>
            <li> I like the brush very much.</li>
            <li> Ilove it very much.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> It has a oval top and not a flat, amd</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little brush; it&#x27;s soft, has a nice shape and density and can be a nice little multitasking brush.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles!!!</li>
            <li> They were amazingly with all kinds of high end and low end make-up.</li>
            <li> I think I will eventually purchase a second because I like have duplicates of favorite brushes.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s soft and light</li>
            <li> First off, what is with no one having these brushes in stock??  </li>
            <li> but I still prefer a smaller more dense brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good, affordable brush for someone starting a brush collection, but buy it with the caveat, that unless you have a huge face, this is really not a blush brush.  </li>
            <li> I like this brush, goes on soft and smoothly.</li>
            <li> Really like this style, size and shape of this brush!</li>
            <li> I only use the top tapered part when I apply my powder blush</li>
            <li> It picks up just as much color as you need to build intensity without smearing so much color that you end up spending 5 minutes blending and fading to make the color look more natural.</li>
            <li> When I first received the brush I thought I did not need another blush brush,  </li>
            <li> Thanks!  </li>
            <li> now.at first I didnt know how to use it</li>
            <li> I really like this brush!</li>
            <li> Wow, when using this brush your blush looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Brush with soft bristles that do not shed.</li>
            <li> My favorite one I is currently!</li>
            <li> Really makes a difference!</li>
            <li> Feel so soft and non-irritating to my skin, plus they do a FANTASTIC job of applying the make up.  </li>
            <li> , it totally changed the look of my makeup, it looks more polished airbrushed and blended well</li>
            <li> but then I must build color up which sucked at first until I got used to it.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s so soft and light</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how soft and fluffy it is, and the shape makes it perfect for placing product exactly where I want.  </li>
            <li> **)</li>
            <li> I love how, depending on how you angle the brush, whether it&#x27;s using the tip of the brush, or the side of the brush, you can get a different application, yet</li>
            <li> This is my first impressions review.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, do not let that deter you from buying it, most makeup brushes can be used multiple ways, not just what the label says.</li>
            <li> But I still like it overall and use it mostly to blend my blush with my cheek contouring.</li>
            <li> The size of the brush head is big enough for it to double as a powder/finishing brush as well which is perfect when you&#x27;re travelling.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I did when I got</li>
            <li> Looks exactly as it said on the description.</li>
            <li> To complete the set purchased this brush as a Christmas gift for my daughter and overall she was very pleased with all the brushes.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush!</li>
            <li> The Real technique brushes are genius!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t deposit to o much on the cheeks...and is  breeze to use!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s suppost to do.</li>
            <li> Pretty upset.</li>
            <li> This is the first time to use this brush.</li>
            <li> I wear full-on makeup everyday, so I need a stable of good brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Swipe it a few times across your cheeks and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> The brush is VERY easy to wash and dry.</li>
            <li> I like this for powdering my face with dr hauschka&#x27;s  body silk, perfect for down the center of the face.</li>
            <li> I am new to real techniques and I bought this with a couple of the starter kits, I really enjoy them.</li>
            <li> This feels whisper soft on your face and easily applies product to your face and allows you to blend it without much effort.</li>
            <li> Yes, you can maneuver the brush and color pickup and placement to get the right application -- but it&#x27;s too much work.</li>
            <li> The size of this brush (handle and bristles) is really just right, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Another real techniques brush done right.</li>
            <li> The bristles are tapered which is unlike any other blush brush I own.</li>
            <li> I have several Real Techniques brushes and love them all.</li>
            <li> My wife love it and say it&#x27;s as good as the expensive brands</li>
            <li> I use this for setting powder as it is pretty large for blush.</li>
            <li> Super soft and does not shed!</li>
            <li> I use it for bronzer and blush, and while I was skeptical at first, its shape is really perfect for these, because it really helps get the makeup right where you want it, while also blending it into your face so it is very natural looking.</li>
            <li> These were my first purchase of Real Techniques.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it five stars anyway because I&#x27;m so happily surprised that such an economical beauty item is more than just a bargain</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers this brush is too big to be a blush brush, but it works great as a bronzing brush or setting brush.</li>
            <li> I also have a Mac 168 (the large angled brush), but the Real Techniques blush brush gives a more natural application and is just as soft.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you have a pretty big place to keep this thing - even my makeup organizer didn&#x27;t have a slot big enough for it to fit comfortably.</li>
            <li> And for a more natural to dewy foundation look, precision powdering down the T-zone and under eyes is easy with this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to wash (I use shampoo or facial wash to wash my brushes).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heavier hand than using a stippling brush but light enough to avoid packing on too much color!</li>
            <li> The pointy shape of it also makes it easy to get onto specific areas of your cheeks</li>
            <li> It is super soft and does not shed at all.  </li>
            <li> Super soft fiber</li>
            <li> Super soft.</li>
            <li> I have a rather large face</li>
            <li> It is too large for my face but does work with baked foundation.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this to all who loves make up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too large to be a blush brush</li>
            <li> I find it too large for blush</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the large size fool you.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good buy and is exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> finally got it, very soft, couldnt ask for a better brush to apply blush.</li>
            <li> Very high quality brushes and</li>
            <li> Easy to clean with a little baby shampoo.</li>
            <li> Only problem is that the handle is HUGE.</li>
            <li> You only need to put product on the very tip and it applies so smoothly.</li>
            <li> Picks up and distributes color VERY WELL.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be better in my opinion, and being a fan of pink</li>
            <li> really quality brushes</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> So, when my dog ate my powder brush (really, my dog ate it)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but this real techniques brush puts the E.L.F to shame.</li>
            <li> Just what you expect from Real Techniques.</li>
            <li> I really like Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> It smelled of cheap perfume and visibly had blush on it, which is really gross.  </li>
            <li> This brush picks up blusher really well</li>
            <li> Ready to blend.</li>
            <li> They wash well and are so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I like this brush, but what I really wanted was the powder brush.  </li>
            <li> That one was not in stock, so I bought this one and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> most- like others say, harder to store this way.  </li>
            <li> instead I use real Techniques stippling brush to apply.  </li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t know why I just ordered once you charge me seven times please stop charge thanks</li>
            <li> figure out a reasonable way to use this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> To hell with all those high end lines that scratch up your face!</li>
            <li> It is very versatile , as a matter of fact</li>
            <li> it also works really well for bronzing the face/forehead.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very diffuse and blended.</li>
            <li> Will be adding additional Real Techniques to my brush collection.</li>
            <li> and I must hand it to real Techniques</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Fast shipment!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that much about make up brushes, but I really like this one</li>
            <li> I guess you can read reviews to picture the real use out of this brush.</li>
            <li> and it blends very well</li>
            <li> I really, really like this brush.  </li>
            <li> Highly suggest this brush along with any brush from the line!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight and well made.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.  </li>
            <li> It blends the color really well, so you won&#x27;t have any streaking.  </li>
            <li> I really like how it applies the blush and bronzer.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need to keep reapplying much.</li>
            <li> I like all real techniques brushes</li>
            <li> and it does all three very well,</li>
            <li> Have almost all of the real techniques brushes now.  </li>
            <li> It is MUCH cheaper here online</li>
            <li> I never really understood how people could LOVE brushes</li>
            <li> I have some brushes that cost 3 times as much and have inferior quality.</li>
            <li> it looks wider than it really is.</li>
            <li> I have almost the whole set</li>
            <li> and they work really well with powder or cream.</li>
            <li> You dont need to use too much product either.</li>
            <li> Very helpful.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> It picks up color really well</li>
            <li> /&gt;It hold the product very will&lt;br</li>
            <li> i orderd 2 of real Techniques Blush Brush&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> i got 1 real Techniques Blush Brush and 1 real Techniques stapiling Brush</li>
            <li> Lovely soft, big brush.</li>
            <li> the bristles are soft but firm and it feels really good on my face.</li>
            <li> This brush is super soft, high quality and as a plus it stands up by itself.</li>
            <li> The shape of the domed blush looked smaller when it was in the package, but when I took it out to use it, it got more fluffier, thus, less easy to apply blush to certain areas of my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Both arrived pretty quickly so thumbs up for the seller, I use these brushes on a daily basis &amp; I&#x27;d recommend this to my friends..</li>
            <li> have a smaller, denser blush brush (Smashbox Brand) that I like to use as well, but that one really is better suited to lighter, less pigmented brushes that don&#x27;t show up easily on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I own most of their brushes (obsessed with them) and use this particular one for contour my cheeks, forehead and neck.</li>
            <li> It helps me achieve a natural flush looking whereas other brushes I own make me look like a clown.</li>
            <li> I ordered this blush brush, because I have enjoyed other Real Techniques brushes.  </li>
            <li> The brush itself was very soft and was exactly as pictured on amazon.</li>
            <li> tapered shape is not different from the shape of many higher end powder brushes, and it fits really well on different areas of the face.</li>
            <li> They clean up very well with regular dish soap and do not stain (from my experience).</li>
            <li> One I use for all over blush coverage and the other to highlight the top of the cheekbones with a mineral powder for a bit of shimmer.</li>
            <li> I often contour on top of my foundation with a bronzer or contour powder, then I use setting powder or foundation powder to set the other areas of my face and to blend my contour out.</li>
            <li> so i had to deep clean the brush.</li>
            <li> When you deep clean a brush, you see if the brush bristles fall out and see if the shape of the brush stay intact.</li>
            <li> Modern looking blush must be natural looking, like a flush after running around the block in hot weather.  </li>
            <li> It was very easy to wash and dried in no time.</li>
            <li> If you have never used a Real Techniques brush before I highly recommend you do .</li>
            <li> This is a nice, well-made brush, just like all of the real techniques brushes are (at least that i have tried) but it is way too big to apply blush precisely.</li>
            <li> Just make sure they dry completely or else</li>
            <li> bristles are so soft and it applies my powder even and when I do put my powder on with this brush, the bristles are super soft on my skin</li>
            <li> I have had Mac brushes for more than 6 years and always found them shedding, these have not shed a single hair and they are so so soft and my skin goes all uhmmm</li>
            <li> Like many others have said, it may be a little bit large to be used for blush, although I&#x27;ve used it that way in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Despite its size, I have no problem using this for blush as long as I&#x27;m light handed.</li>
            <li> So far I havent found something to use it for, so it&#x27;s just standing upright looking pretty on my vanity.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush and other Real Techniques brushes as I&#x27;m a big fan of Sam Chapman, and believe she would only bring to market a great quality product.</li>
            <li> That said, it is NOT worth MORE than about $10.</li>
            <li> I know I did receive a true item, because I also felt this brush at an Ulta after I&#x27;d ordered it, and it felt the same as the one I received.  </li>
            <li> When you take this brush out of the package, the first thing that will strike you is how SOFT the brush is.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the real Techniques brushes - I have yet to find one loose bristle.</li>
            <li> Then, I learned that I need to push the brush down more as I&#x27;m applying.  </li>
            <li> Really full and soft, makes putting on blush really easy and blends and sheers it out nicely due to the soft fullness of the brush.</li>
            <li> I wanted a new blush brush and after reading reviews and watching tutorials on youtube, I decided to give real Techniques a try.</li>
            <li> i also use it for contouring because of it&#x27;s slightly pointed top.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bigger than I expected and a really nice quality.</li>
            <li> It would have been better if the brush was smaller for applying blush, but I wished it was bigger to apply powder.</li>
            <li> When Real Techniques came out a few years ago, I bought many of the brushes and brush sets.</li>
            <li> It applies your blush softly and evenly, so you can really control how intense you would like it to be.</li>
            <li> but this makes it look like I have a decent hand.</li>
            <li> As with all real Techniques brushes, the brush hair feels very plush and soft against skin.  </li>
            <li> Handles are shorter than my regular brushes but nothing I can&#x27;t get use to, it actually may allow me to have more control of the application.</li>
            <li> It is more soft than i expected.</li>
            <li> I use this brush mainly for putting on my powder to set my foundation.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft but get the product very well</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft, and it blended my blush very well.</li>
            <li> Also it is very soft and does not pick up too much makeup at a time.  </li>
            <li> The other brush is maybe a little softer, But this one is great as well.</li>
            <li> This brush is very soft!</li>
            <li> Very soft and dense for the price!</li>
            <li> This brush is super soft but large and dense enough to do</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for blending, smoothing, etc.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product was high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for those who can&#x27;t shell out $75 for a powder/blush brush.</li>
            <li> They are really high quality for the price of the brush.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> The price can&#x27;t be beat for a high quality brush.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brand for brushes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting this in addition to the sets they sell.  </li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this blush brush.  </li>
            <li> The hairs on this blush brush are a bit coarse in comparison, though compared maybe to a really crappy brush, these would be considered soft--there are many very course animal hair brushes, such as some of the ones from the Bare Minerals line, which would make this Real Techniques Blush Brush very soft by comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is pretty good product, not as soft as their smaller brushes that it sometimes cause irritation if i rub too much or too hard.</li>
            <li> This is such a soft brush, it makes applying makeup fun again!  </li>
            <li> Be sure to shake off the excess as this brush has a tendency to spread it too far, other than that I have no complaints.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little too big for &amp;#34;blush&amp;#34;, but I use it fine for light blush application &amp; powder</li>
            <li> Love it when am in rush and need to apply all in one very quickly, so first I apply powder then with one side of the brush contour, then with the other one blush and lastly with the tip of the brush highlighter !</li>
            <li> I wish the brush is a little bit more dense</li>
            <li> da un acabado muy natural con el rubor!!</li>
            <li> This is a large fluffy brush with extremely soft bristles, I love it, but for my bronzer rather than blush.</li>
            <li> I really loved the bristles, however, the black part of the handle is quiete loose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to clean and maintains it&#x27;s shape which has been a real problem for me with other brushes purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Not as soft as I had hoped, but NOT scratchy and definitely better than some of my more expensive brushes.  </li>
            <li> and it is soooo soft, but the shape really confuses me.</li>
            <li> Soft and gentle brush .</li>
            <li> I love how fluffy it is</li>
            <li> Some brushes that are the same price as this brush sheds a lot and its not even worth getting.</li>
            <li> I have a few high-end blush brushes that cost a lot more and this one gets the job</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth buying especially with this price!</li>
            <li> but as I got the hang how to omg the final results is worth it.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a bit more firm.</li>
            <li> My main issue is covering up melasma and mild adult acne, and I had decided to revamp my entire makeup routine because what worked when I was 20, just ain&#x27;t cuttin&#x27; it at 40ish.</li>
            <li> This brush is pretty soft, not as soft as the powder brush</li>
            <li> I do have a narrow face, so maybe if you had a rounder face this would work better.  </li>
            <li> all the product stays, for lack of a better word, trapped in the brush.</li>
            <li> Invest just a few Dollars more and get a couple quality brushes.</li>
            <li> Quality is good but its performance is poor.</li>
            <li> the way it&#x27;s designed allows you to use just the tip to put color down precisely where you want it and then blend with the whole brush.</li>
            <li> The soft &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; are silky and don&#x27;t fall out, as so many other brands of brushers do!</li>
            <li> Super soft bristles and very solid construction.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too big, but just the right size and picks up sufficient product.</li>
            <li> Right off I&#x27;ll say that this isn&#x27;t a standard, \\&quot;flat\\&quot; blush/powder brush.</li>
            <li> brush also delivers the right amount of product, is just dense enough to blend into an airbrushed finish (but I wish it was denser), and the taper can place product with precision.</li>
            <li> I had seen a lot of mixed reviews and didn&#x27;t know if I had made the right choice.</li>
            <li> I actually have a few blush brushes, but I really wanted to try this one because I&#x27;ve enjoyed all of the real techniques brushes I have bought.  </li>
            <li> I have done a few reviews on RT brushes in the past and my opinion remains the same that these are some of the best brushes i have ever used.</li>
            <li> I am not aggressive when I clean my brushes and didn&#x27;t run the water straight into (held it pointing down under running water like you&#x27;re supposed to.)</li>
            <li> I decided to look into new foundation, powder, and blush brushes and I found these.</li>
            <li> Thought it time for some new ones</li>
            <li> I am new to these brushes and using them for blush.  </li>
            <li> OR if you just need a new blush brush.  </li>
            <li> Brand new.</li>
            <li> Immediately I cleaned my brush, like you should every time you get a new brush, and then went to town with my make up.</li>
            <li> I really like the entire line of real Technique brushes, and the blush brush serves its purpose well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice big fluffy blush brush.</li>
            <li> Very soft and provides even distribution.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> The shape of the bristles doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, and they are very soft.  </li>
            <li> The blush is very soft</li>
            <li> I like this blush brush, it gives a very natural look when I apply blush.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and holds its shape well.</li>
            <li> The brush is ultra plush and very soft..</li>
            <li> Its a very very soft brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bristles are very soft and I&#x27;ll be buying mor Tecknique brushes.</li>
            <li> Very soft brush</li>
            <li> It is very, very soft . . . .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved other brushes by Real Techniques, but, like other reviewers, I find this brush too big for blush application.  </li>
            <li> Had my eye on this brush for a little while now (people seem to love the Real Techniques brushes), so I finally bought it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy them as much if not more than some of my high end brushes.</li>
            <li> This one is so luxurious and soft!</li>
            <li> I went back and forth on whether or not to buy the sets but decided to try out this one first.</li>
            <li> and I replaced all of my bare essentials brushes with real techniques.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sooooo soft, I know people say that all the time about brushes but my goodness!</li>
            <li> but I will most likely use for other applications.</li>
            <li> It is so amazingly soft and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I have others that i have purchased from retailers, and they look feel and perform exactly the same.</li>
            <li> the brush is really soft!</li>
            <li> both angles are somewhat fluffy--this is unique in comparison to other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its so soft!</li>
            <li> And it is so soft!</li>
            <li> They are so soft and versatile!</li>
            <li> and I usually spend ALOT more on Mac brushes and this one</li>
            <li> I have been wanting this particular real Techniques brush since I saw it in my local &amp;#34;big box&amp;#34; store.</li>
            <li> Brush is soft, full and does not shed like some other high end brushes in my beauty box.  </li>
            <li> However, I especially like the Real Techniques Brush for highly pigmented blushes (e.g., my Lancome Blush Subtil blushes, my Tarte Amazonian Clay blushes) because it helps you control the amount of color you apply to your cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed by the way it works, nothing special, better to buy elf brushes.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and do no irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m a little older, my blush/highlighter placement is more precise, contoured, and subtle.</li>
            <li> This particular brush works well with my Bare Minerals face powder.</li>
            <li> I personally think it&#x27;s too large to be a blush brush</li>
            <li> I am very particular about my makeup brushes and was a little skeptical when this brush was greatly recommended because of the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> They are soft and have the proper shape to do the job, plus they are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I recommend anyone that wants a durable, soft and quality brush to purchase the entire collection.  </li>
            <li> So soft, color blends well off of it</li>
            <li> aspect I find very helpful is that the tips are white, so</li>
            <li> the brushes are so soft and it doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> Not as soft as I imagined...</li>
            <li> them as much as my sigma brushes.ive got back ups!!!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;extra soft</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bristles are soft -- perhaps too soft for powder blush application.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and</li>
            <li> It is so soft, and applies blush like a dream.</li>
            <li> felt it was way to soft which makes it kinda flimsy.</li>
            <li> this coming from a girl who is a religious user of real techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> If you are still uncertain about its appearance after my inadequate description, I think Ulta sells the entire Real Techniques line.</li>
            <li> soft on my&lt;br /&gt;face.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft.  </li>
            <li> Soft , but not for me ,,, I prefer ecotools powder brush</li>
            <li> Soooo soft and picks/applies powder products beautifully.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and when I washed it after arrival, the water came out</li>
            <li> I used it for mineral powder foundation and it did NOT apply my powder like my old tried-and-true MAC Kabuki brush does.</li>
            <li> the bristles are really soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> think the problem with this brush is that it is way too soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft to the touch and doesn&#x27;t damage my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the second blush brush I have bought from real Techniques.  </li>
            <li> Soft brush</li>
            <li> So soft and provides even distribution of the blush.</li>
            <li> This brush i felt was too big for me to apply the blush, i decided to buy the RT Stippling brush, and i am much happier with the results</li>
            <li> Bristles are so soft and tapered.</li>
            <li> It applies blush with the slightest hint of color and it blends it seamlessly.  </li>
            <li> I feels soft on your face.  </li>
            <li> The fur is so soft.</li>
            <li> It applies my blush effortlessly whilst leaving your face with a soft glow.</li>
            <li> it cause leaves no harsh lines on my cheeks and even looks natural.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s soft as heck...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soft and makes my blushed cheeks look so natural.</li>
            <li> Soft and no shedding.</li>
            <li> This does not shed and makes my blush application look natural.</li>
            <li> The hair are soft on the face also even after 10 washes and counting....</li>
            <li> However, I use this big and soft, fluffy brush for application of my MAC Skinfinish face powder on top of</li>
            <li> So soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 8.99 and for what you get and the quality, it&#x27;s a complete steal.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase a lot of real technique brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve just added it to my professional kit...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and doesn&#x27;t have any fall outs.</li>
            <li> , now this is the only thing she wants from now on.</li>
            <li> Soft and plush.</li>
            <li> Extremely soft</li>
            <li> they are soft and do not shed.</li>
            <li> so soft.</li>
            <li> Love this big fluffy quality brush.</li>
            <li> It does not pick up too little or too much product but just the right amount.</li>
            <li> , delivery was fast &amp; price is also reasonable compare to other brands...</li>
            <li> Have to be careful not to get too large of an area!</li>
            <li> Ok just to let you know that for blush application I&#x27;ve used the MAC 187, 109, the Sigma small duo fibre (don&#x27;t remember the #) and a generic Revlon one</li>
            <li> The smaller size keeps the blush high and on the apple of my cheek.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m talking about high end proudcts like benefit and urban decay and Cargo!</li>
            <li> i think the blush brush bristles themselves are too long for my tastes, so i don&#x27;t really use the tip of the bristles but will apply blush/bronzer by using the side of the brush.</li>
            <li> Bristles holding on together fine after at least 10 times used so far.</li>
            <li> Soft and subtle but colors are easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Its definitely worth trying and typically these brushes are cheaper here on Amazon than they are in stores.</li>
            <li> The blush brushes are fluffy, hold product really well, and wash/dry really well, holding their shape.  </li>
            <li> Ive used brushes from every major makeup brand out there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy other real techniques brushes for me and my mom!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and fluffy and just the right size.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i use it to apply a blush and to set my soundation with loose powder sometime worked very nicly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and fluffy!</li>
            <li> It is soft and doesn&#x27;t waste too much product but really needs different shape.</li>
            <li> You just don&#x27;t get that luxurious, velvety soft feeling on your fingertips like you do with other Real Techniques brushes.  </li>
            <li> and I could also purchase other brushes to complete my real Techniques collection.</li>
            <li> Before I used MAC and bare escentuals, but even with the high price tag I had issues with the foundation brush especially leaving bristles all over my face- constantly.</li>
            <li> The bristles are pretty stiff, but they are pretty loosely packed.</li>
            <li> It also keeps it shape really well for such a big brush, I&#x27;ve heard people complain about it being too big</li>
            <li> I dont use it anymore, my mac blush barely applies to my face.</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> This brush is seriously so soft, but also dense at the same time</li>
            <li> I have had a few brushes from Everyday Minerals for almost 5 years which are still softer, fuller, smoother and overall better than these real techniques brushes were the first day I opened them, and that is after using these everyday mineral brushes every day for over four years.</li>
            <li> It is very, very soft and has minimal shedding, which I cant say the same for some of my high end brushes.</li>
            <li> Most other brushes are much more expensive and more disappointing.  </li>
            <li> brush head is very fluffy, and it is true what I had read from another reviewer:</li>
            <li> because after using it twice and being dissatisfied with the lack of control it gives, due to it&#x27;s large size, I tucked it away.  </li>
            <li> The tapering all round really helps with diffusing and blending color to achieve a very natural blush finish.  </li>
            <li> It is quite soft and so far has not shed a single bristle.</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan on big brushes, but I got this one because it seemed soo soft... and it is!</li>
            <li> Pretty ridiculous really,</li>
            <li> think I would try the other brushes in Sam&#x27;s Real Technique line.</li>
            <li> if ur in the market for a well priced buffing brush also check out the other real techniques brushes .</li>
            <li> not a single bristle has fallen out.</li>
            <li> It picks up a small amount of product and can apply a sheer coverage to a full coverage depending on your desire.  </li>
            <li> When I first got it, I was a little intimated by the size of the brush.</li>
            <li> Initially I thought I would use it for bronzer due to the large size.  </li>
            <li> It is a little bigger than I expected, BUT because of it&#x27;s shape it allows for precise application.</li>
            <li> but no, the bristles feel greasy, are hard to clean and do not go back into the shape they should be.</li>
            <li> Its a little large for some looks, but works well.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a little too large for applying blush</li>
            <li> It is too round and large for my liking when applying blush or even powder.  </li>
            <li> This may be &amp;#34;soft,&amp;#34; but the brush is not nearly as soft as other Real Techniques brushes, such as the Expert Face Brush.  </li>
            <li> We belive its not original Real Techniques</li>
            <li> I am a Sigma girl, so I was a little reluctant in trying this one because it&#x27;s so much cheaper</li>
            <li> either left way too much product, or so little you couldn&#x27;t even see</li>
            <li> I think it rivals other brushes that are far more expensive.</li>
            <li> This brush is seriously 100x better than the ones that you get in the little starter sets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty positive this brush is a fake.</li>
            <li> This particular blush brush is a little scratchy.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and it&#x27;s pink!</li>
            <li> My only negative comment and its not even negative is that they should have more verity of brushes.</li>
            <li> You excuse my English.</li>
            <li> but Ive had a hard time finding good and affordable brushes, that wont make me feel guilty when I buy them.</li>
            <li> It shed a few hairs when it was brand new, but not anymore.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s very soft and fluffy.  </li>
            <li> I love the color-coded handle (pink is for finishing) and especially the flat base that can stand up straight on the shelf.  </li>
            <li> So soft and fluffy.  </li>
            <li> Certainly not soft.  </li>
            <li> Its so fluffy and soft.</li>
            <li> I feel the bristles might be too long</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly adding the real Techniques brushes and I have been blown away by the quality for price for each of them.</li>
            <li> it is quite large but the tip is very thin and really isnt that wide.  </li>
            <li> OBSESSED with Real Techniques brushes!!!</li>
            <li> However I find this point to be a plus because I&#x27;ve been using it to apply my Urban Decay Naked Flush blush, and this blush is so pigmented that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I got it earlier than the shipping due date.</li>
            <li> , I have other brushes that are actually too dense</li>
            <li> and it goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I do agree when some of the other posters, it is a *bit* big for applying blush.</li>
            <li> I have other brushes such as Shany brushes that are softer than this.</li>
            <li> I leave this to air dry</li>
            <li> I let them dry overnight</li>
            <li> I always apply blush worse, this brush provide light application via fluffy hair.</li>
            <li> handle has a flat bottom, so this brush will actually stand up on its end with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazingly soft and has had very little shedding at all.</li>
            <li> And the unique shape allows for blush application as well as bronzing and subtle contour!!</li>
            <li> This brush is very large which makes it difficult to apply blush only where you want it.  </li>
            <li> For an inexpensive brush, it works as well or better than the very, very expensive goat hair brushes I have.  </li>
            <li> The flat base allows the brush to stand on its own on table tops in the event</li>
            <li> But the long bristles are too soft to pick up a hard cake blush</li>
            <li> It can be used with wet and dry blush, or powder.</li>
            <li> It was more of a nuisance to return it so after thorougly disinfecting it, it seems like an ok brush, I was just really disappointed that a dirty item was sent to me.</li>
            <li> i use it for loose powder little big for blush</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t have to tap off any excess powder anymore, since this brush only picks up a little with one stroke.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little big for my face</li>
            <li> For my face, it was a little big to use for blush</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t pick up enough blush for it to even show up a little bit on my face.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is a blush brush, but to me it&#x27;s just a little too big to get the looks that I go for.</li>
            <li> Wow, these seem to be hard to find, and I understand why.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too big for my personal liking but at least it holds the blush</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s also really big and fluffy.</li>
            <li> the bristles are too flemsey which makes it&#x27;s harder to apply</li>
            <li> But its not a blush brush at all its too big and fluffy for that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big and fluffy, with a lightweight aluminum handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for several months and it hasn&#x27;t begun to shed at all- even despite quite a few washes.</li>
            <li> and it makes it harder to apply the blush.</li>
            <li> it there was ABSOLUTELY NO SHEDDING.</li>
            <li> It is too big and fluffy.</li>
            <li> they stay firm and no bristles left on my face!  </li>
            <li> A few of them even had some mysterious liquid on the bristles causing them to be clumped when I received them...</li>
            <li> The only problem I can see having with this brush is not being able to store it well in a brush holder since the base is so wide...</li>
            <li> I also like the rosy pink color.  </li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with a real techniques brush!</li>
            <li> I also use it for other powder for setting my makeup all over.</li>
            <li> regrets on this purchase!</li>
            <li> Also the bristles don&#x27;t come off like other brushes I have use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see buying any other brand.</li>
            <li> But other than that seems well maid.</li>
            <li> It will probably replace my other powder brushes.</li>
            <li> Also, it dries super quickly after washing which was shocking because it&#x27;s so fluffy and dense.</li>
            <li> A little too soft (probably hard to apply less pigmented blush)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aesthetically, the brush is not my cup of tea (ugly metal ferrules and cheap looking plastic handle), but for the price point, it is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> OBSESSED with the real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> You can not go wrong with real techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> They could have made it average size to be of use like the buffing brush.</li>
            <li> Sorry haha just saying.</li>
            <li> The bristles are unevenly cut and the writing is off center.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m down for anything that saves me a step</li>
            <li> I use it to bronze my forehead, cheeks and down my neck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a slightly pointed tip</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s slightly pointed at the tip rather than rounded.</li>
            <li> The black matte plastic handle is prone to pick-up fingerprints and get messy.</li>
            <li> ; Even he could tell a difference, and you know men don&#x27;t always pay attention to the little details...</li>
            <li> although, the afore mentioned softness does make for a lighter application of powders than I would otherwise use, meaning it takes a little longer to build up your color.</li>
            <li> Just put a little product on the brush and buff it in.</li>
            <li> Because I must have tried at least 15 different make-up brushes (inexpensive to very expensive), I didn&#x27;t have much expectations for this one.</li>
            <li> The blush brush was just a little nicer than the core collection brushes</li>
            <li> This brush is big and fluffy!!!</li>
            <li> I use this brush everyday</li>
            <li> So fluffy.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still one of my favorites and I reach for it everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it has kept its shape.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my blush from ending up too heavy on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and use it for powder or bronzer.</li>
            <li> It shed a few strands but not a lot.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;s say buying this is waste of money.</li>
            <li> which I thought would resolve when washed a few times</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too fluffy or too dense</li>
            <li> I think my concerns are just that it isn&#x27;t as firm as I&#x27;m used to in a blush brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed it a few times and no shedding as of yet.</li>
            <li> The brush is so fluffy and stays like that after a wash.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s just not easy to use for me.</li>
            <li> And, It just went on WAY too dark and it would not blend out the blush no matter how hard I tried.</li>
            <li> I have paid at least $2 less on each brush or brush set that I have ordered on Amazon then the prices on RT&#x27;s website or even walmart..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it for powder -- it&#x27;s too small for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These brushes are definitely comparable to the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s purpose is.  </li>
            <li> The reason im not giving it a 5 star review is because my face is kinda small, so I tend to use it for pressed foundation instead.</li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t come out (which has happened for years with past make up brushes).  </li>
            <li> I am not really sure where i put the product</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m not sure about this brush..</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used and washed it a lot and have not experienced shedding or any other problems.</li>
            <li> , it has too much give and the bristles don&#x27;t distribute the color evenly :(</li>
            <li> The bristles are weak and takes little blush powder.</li>
            <li> I am always still so shocked when I take these DRUGSTORE brushes out of the packaging and they are as soft and fluffy as my high-end brushes!</li>
            <li> It is next to impossible to mess up blush with this brush!</li>
            <li> Thick handle makes it hard to put it on</li>
            <li> know a lot of brushes claim to never shed, but this one honestly never does.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I actually have a backup when one one of them gets dirty.</li>
            <li> Shipment was slow though</li>
            <li> I purchased a few brushes from &#x27;Paris Presents Incorporated&#x27; and they are all poorly made.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that because the base of the brush is wide enough for it to stand up, it can be a bit annoying to put in a cup with other brushes.</li>
            <li> the flat handle, does make it awkward to store if you use a stand-up jar.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money !!</li>
            <li> WOW - I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Seriously I have to reapply the blush over and over to get what I want</li>
            <li> Seriously, don&#x27;t waist your time here..</li>
            <li> I read a bunch of reviews saying that this brush is not good for blush</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just confusing!</li>
            <li> Im afraid it will totally come off after a few wash/uses :(</li>
            <li> I use them everyday!!!</li>
            <li> The brush feels tough not soft&#x27; disappointed--..--</li>
            <li> the packaging is broken, looks like a second-hand</li>
            <li> poor quality，handle position have many&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a flat base, so you can stand it up on end</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I&#x27;ve not been disappointed by their other products.</li>
            <li> not sure why this brush even has bad</li>
            <li> I randomly found them when browsing for MAC brushes.</li>
            <li> The usefulness is seriously questionable, though.</li>
            <li> Buy w/ confidence; you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product doesn&#x27;t work as well after you wash it.</li>
            <li> I thought it would have poor quality, but it doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> For around $10 you can&#x27;t go wrong trying this brush!</li>
            <li> This brush was dirty when I recieved it!  </li>
            <li> but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;scratch，the printed character of logo on the handle is overlap，feel disappointed</li>
            <li> I was shocked it just popped out!</li>
            <li> I own!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried blush brushes from ELF to MAC and I hated them.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am quite horrible at doing my makeup</li>

            <li> Very soft to the touch, feels nice on your skin. Picks up and distributes color VERY WELL. Good for application but not for blending.</li>
            <li> Got this for my Fiance. She loves it. She has another style of brush of the same brand that she uses but this one was a lot cheaper on Amazon so she had to have it. And she uses it more that her other brushes so it must be good!</li>
            <li> The brush feels tough not soft&#x27; disappointed--..--</li>
            <li> Such a soft and great shaped blush brush. Couldn&#x27;t be better in my opinion, and being a fan of pink I love the color of the handle on this as well!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this brush! So soft, color blends well off of it and it&#x27;s pretty!</li>
            <li> For my blush application, I had been using a QUO blush brush, a Stila #8 powder brush, and a scratchy Avon ergonomic handle blush brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is very fluffy, and it is true what I had read from another reviewer: you have to work the brush a bit to get product on it. However I find this point to be a plus because I&#x27;ve been using it to apply my Urban Decay Naked Flush blush, and this blush is so pigmented that a little goes a long way. So I don&#x27;t have to tap off any excess powder anymore, since this brush only picks up a little with one stroke. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One aspect I find very helpful is that the tips are white, so when I spray 99% isopropyl alcohol for spot cleaning, I can see right away if the brush is clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Shading Brush, the Blush Brush, and the Setting Brush, and have just finalized an order for the Travel Brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> i love the packaging of this item. it was well organized and well wrapped. the brush was as displayed in the picture on the website.  i recommend it for all make up lovers. the brushes are so soft and it doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> i am so in love  With this brush It&#x27;s very soft but get the product very well&lt;br /&gt;and i recommend to try it ............</li>
            <li> This brush is super soft and amazing!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I ordered this, good thing that The shipping was fast and I got it earlier than the shipping due date. I love how fluffy it is and it doesn&#x27;t shed! Some brushes that are the same price as this brush sheds a lot and its not even worth getting. I am definitely recommending this product!</li>
            <li> Another great brush from Real Techniques!</li>
            <li> I have been on the eternal search for the perfect make-up brushes at the right price.  This brush is incredible; the bristles are soft and don&#x27;t come off on my face.  It&#x27;s also easy to wash (I use shampoo or facial wash to wash my brushes).</li>
            <li> This is a very big blush brush but the quality is great. Super soft and easy to use. Good value for money</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing! Gives me the most natural and perfect flush everytime! Love it! Great quality! It has a flat bottom so it can stand up on its own and washes up well. No shedding either.  Love this thing!!</li>
            <li> I personally think it&#x27;s too large to be a blush brush but the quality is great however.</li>
            <li> Great brush, better than any other brush i have owned.</li>
            <li> Not the best of brushes</li>
            <li> I love this brush!!! You can use it for anything not just blush but powder, bronzer and etc. I like it more than my MAC brushes but still love my sigma brushes! I will be buying more of real techniques</li>
            <li> perfect blush application!</li>
            <li> Very soft and provides even distribution.</li>
            <li> So soft and fluffy.  I use this for bronzer, blush, or highlighting powder.  It&#x27;s the best--and such a great price!</li>
            <li> love this brand its so soft for the skin</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order this product !! I think someone send me this brush by mistake and take mony from my account !!!</li>
            <li> Love this brush for my blush!</li>
            <li> This is a great blush brush. I think it rivals other brushes that are far more expensive. I think I will eventually purchase a second because I like have duplicates of favorite brushes.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for applying power, and dusting off eyeshadow the falls onto my upper cheeks after I apply it.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush!Good for applying blush. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing for applying blush! It&#x27;s a heavier hand than using a stippling brush but light enough to avoid packing on too much color! Love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stuck between this one and my tarte blush brush. Both apply product well, blend super easily, and keep the products pigmentation. The other brush is maybe a little softer, But this one is great as well.</li>
            <li> This is such a soft brush, it makes applying makeup fun again!  I have quite a few Real Techniques brushes and I find them to be well made, and really quality brushes</li>
            <li> I love this brush. Really full and soft, makes putting on blush really easy and blends and sheers it out nicely due to the soft fullness of the brush. I am new to real techniques and I bought this with a couple of the starter kits, I really enjoy them. Very high quality brushes and I enjoy them as much if not more than some of my high end brushes.</li>
            <li> Not as soft as I imagined... Almost itchy to be honest. But it does the job, and well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderfull tool for makeup</li>
            <li> This is more like a powder brush for all over face than a blush brush</li>
            <li> More than decent for its price!</li>
            <li> This brush is sooo soft, I absolutely love it. Great for blush as it says so. The pointy shape of it also makes it easy to get onto specific areas of your cheeks so it won&#x27;t get all over your face and end up looking like a clown.</li>
            <li> one of the best brushes ive used .lov them as much as my sigma brushes.ive got back ups!!!</li>
            <li> Real Techniques brushes are fantastic. The brushes are cruelty-free and have nice metal handles. The blush brush in particular is really great, the head of the brush is a perfect size for applying color to the apples of your cheeks.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice blush brush. It&#x27;s a little big for my face but it&#x27;s soft and light so it doesn&#x27;t pack on too my product. It&#x27;d be a great powder brush as well.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a fantastic blush brush!  I have a few high-end blush brushes that cost a lot more and this one gets the job done much better.  So far, I&#x27;ve used it on powder and cream blush, and both times I was impressed.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing blush brush I own!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried blush brushes from ELF to MAC and I hated them.&lt;br /&gt;They either left way too much product, or so little you couldn&#x27;t even see it.&lt;br /&gt;This one leaves the perfect amount on your cheeks, and it blends so smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why this brush even has bad reviews!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for more than 2 years and it feels, and works, just like it did when I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;OH, one more thing, it doesn&#x27;t shed!&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of brushes claim to never shed, but this one honestly never does.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> very big very nice very dense&lt;br /&gt;great quality&lt;br /&gt;i use it to apply a blush and to set my soundation with loose powder sometime worked very nicly&lt;br /&gt;no shedding&lt;br /&gt;extra soft</li>
            <li> SUPER soft!!! Great application of blush. Not as precise, but with blush I always start light and build so it ends up working perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> Great brush for bronzing up my face, I would say to big for blush.</li>
            <li> I have 2 of the purple technique kits and love them,so I thought that all the technique brushes would be great.  Not so.  This particular blush brush is a little scratchy. Certainly not soft.  Maybe I&#x27;m just getting spoiled because I have picked up some nicer brushes on sale and now expect more bang for my buck.</li>
            <li> Real Techiques is a great Brand. Super soft an easy to use.</li>
            <li> I really like the entire line of real Technique brushes, and the blush brush serves its purpose well. It&#x27;s not too big, but just the right size and picks up sufficient product.</li>
            <li> This brush is seriously 100x better than the ones that you get in the little starter sets. This one is so luxurious and soft! The single powder brush is also amazing and the duo fiber sets are amazing. If you bought the trio starter set or the purple starter set and you weren&#x27;t impressed; the single brushes are next level!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It&#x27;s bigger than I expected and a really nice quality.</li>
            <li> The bristles are weak and takes little blush powder.</li>
            <li> A gift for my sister and she loves it. It applies the blush well and evenly. The bristles are very soft and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! I have done a few reviews on RT brushes in the past and my opinion remains the same that these are some of the best brushes i have ever used. They clean up very well with regular dish soap and do not stain (from my experience). If you are looking for very effective brushes without animal hair, this is definitely the route to go. I love this brushes shape because it applies blush and highlighter very nicely. Doesn&#x27;t work as well for contouring because its not dense enough but I believe its made for blush primarily. Its definitely worth trying and typically these brushes are cheaper here on Amazon than they are in stores. I have paid at least $2 less on each brush or brush set that I have ordered on Amazon then the prices on RT&#x27;s website or even walmart..Good deal and great product!</li>
            <li> Really like it. It&#x27;s great for blush, and it gives a natural effect.</li>
            <li> Nice ferule and great bristles.  Just a bit big for my cheeks.  Will have to play with it more to see the best products to pair it with.</li>
            <li> First off, what is with no one having these brushes in stock??  I picked the Real Technicques Blush Brush up at Ulta a couple of months ago, and I&#x27;m glad I did because I haven&#x27;t seen them since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a quality brush.  It is super soft and does not shed at all.  It&#x27;s got a great shape, slightly more rounded than a tulip head brush, but still very multi-purpose.  It&#x27;s got a slightly pointed tip so you can definitely use it for blush, but also for contour and/or highlighting.  It is a sizeable brush though, so if you wanted to use it for all over powder, it would be great for that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle has a flat bottom, so this brush will actually stand up on its end with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great brush, well worth the price!</li>
            <li> The shape of the domed blush looked smaller when it was in the package, but when I took it out to use it, it got more fluffier, thus, less easy to apply blush to certain areas of my cheeks. As all the other reviews has stated, this brush is very high quality, nicely packaged, and SOOOO CUTE!!! But is it worth it to sacrifice looks over functionality? Well that&#x27;s up to you.  But based on functionality, it deserves only 2 stars. When applying blush on my face, I end up having two huge blobs. It would have been better if the brush was smaller for applying blush, but I wished it was bigger to apply powder. So far I havent found something to use it for, so it&#x27;s just standing upright looking pretty on my vanity. Also, the bulky bottom is not practical since all of my brushes are stuck in a glass jar filled with rice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend buying the Ecotools blush brush. That one applies blush wonderfully and places the blush where you want it to be.</li>
            <li> I do love some of the Real Techniques brushes...this is just not one of them.  It is too round and large for my liking when applying blush or even powder.  I have a rather large face but I still prefer a smaller more dense brush.  I use the RT contour brush for cream blush and it works perfectly.  The smaller size keeps the blush high and on the apple of my cheek.  You can then buff it in by using a circular motion and blend it perfectly.  I have used the blush brush for powder as well but find the same problem.  It puts product all over and I prefer to place it it more precisely.  If it were more tapered it would be great but after washing it is too round.</li>
            <li> I really love this! You just swurl it on your cheeks, and it looks amazing! It has a oval top and not a flat, amd thats really good!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say this brush is the bomb. I use it on my cheeks to apply my blush. The blush goes on so smooth and effortlessly.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush and other Real Techniques brushes as I&#x27;m a big fan of Sam Chapman, and believe she would only bring to market a great quality product. I own many high end brushes: mostly MAC and Nars, but also Hourglass, Shu Uemura,and Chanel. I also own some drugstore brand brushes, but have to say, for the most part, you get what you pay for. The high end brushes, in my experience, outperform their cheaper counterparts (although EcoTools does make some good, low cost brushes). I wear full-on makeup everyday, so I need a stable of good brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So back to Sam Chapman&#x27;s Blush Brush....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned this brush for nine months, have used it many times, but not every day. It is marketed as a blush brush, but in my opinion, it is way too big to be a blush brush. Using it as a blush brush I get two huge swathes of color on my cheeks. Yes, you can maneuver the brush and color pickup and placement to get the right application -- but it&#x27;s too much work. A brush should fulflll its intended purpose effortlessly. This brush does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I use this brush for is blending and highlighter application. I don&#x27;t use it for powder -- it&#x27;s too small for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are soft -- perhaps too soft for powder blush application.  The brush  does not shed and washes well -- I wash my brushes after every use, and this brush holds up -- but like I said, I don&#x27;t use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size and weight of the brush are just fine. the flat handle, does make it awkward to store if you use a stand-up jar. The black matte plastic handle is prone to pick-up fingerprints and get messy. Aesthetically, the brush is not my cup of tea (ugly metal ferrules and cheap looking plastic handle), but for the price point, it is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good, affordable brush for someone starting a brush collection, but buy it with the caveat, that unless you have a huge face, this is really not a blush brush.  If you already have a great collection, you may be like me, and find that you rarely reach for this brush.you may be like me, and find that you rarely reach for this brush.</li>
            <li> I went back and forth on whether or not to buy the sets but decided to try out this one first. I like it, its super soft and the handle gives great control.</li>
            <li> I actually use this for my powder because it is the perfect size for me.  It is so soft and it&#x27;s pink!</li>
            <li> This brush is the best! It is next to impossible to mess up blush with this brush!</li>
            <li> I like to try all and any intriguing makeup products, brushes included. As far as brushes go I also own high end MAC brushes, Sephora brushes, Bobbi Brown brushes and even Costco brushes. These fall sort of mid range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of the Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Attractive dome shape&lt;br /&gt;2.) Soft (probably best for pigmented high end blushes)&lt;br /&gt;3.) Dries quickly after a wash&lt;br /&gt;4.) Doesn&#x27;t shed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:-&lt;br /&gt;1.) A little too soft (probably hard to apply less pigmented blush)&lt;br /&gt;2.) Thick handle makes it hard to put it on the a holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I would try the other brushes in Sam&#x27;s Real Technique line.</li>
            <li> OBSESSED with the real Techniques brushes. I randomly found them when browsing for MAC brushes. Before I used MAC and bare escentuals, but even with the high price tag I had issues with the foundation brush especially leaving bristles all over my face- constantly. So, when my dog ate my powder brush (really, my dog ate it) I decided to look into new foundation, powder, and blush brushes and I found these. I ordered the powder brush and its bristles were so soft, full and a great quality so I ordered this one and the foundation as well. I haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to use them a lot yet, but so far I am so happy and they are a great price! I will update if anything changes, but what a great product at a great price!!!</li>
            <li> Great blush brush, was expecting it to be more dense though.  However that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, I have other brushes that are actually too dense so it&#x27;s nice to have a variety.  But from the size/picture I thought it would be bigger/fluffier.  It makes applying blush feel very light and easy, but I do find myself dipping into the blush compact more.  For the price I think it&#x27;s a good brush to have.  Definitely better for a lighter/natural look and with blush vs bronzer.</li>
            <li> This brush is big and fluffy!!! I think its best for finishing powder instead of blush since its very light. I still love it however!! You can never go wrong with a real techniques brush!</li>
            <li> Amazing brush all together, very soft, applies my blush in a natural way. I use this brush everyday</li>
            <li> I like this brush, goes on soft and smoothly. No loose hairs with just a nice, even look to the skin. Highly recommend for blending, smoothing, etc.</li>
            <li> nice blending brush for the price</li>
            <li> The best brush for blush and bronzer. It&#x27;s so soft and not a single bristle has fallen out.</li>
            <li> When Real Techniques came out a few years ago, I bought many of the brushes and brush sets. The blush brush was one of my favorites. I thought the price point was a great, as was the quality. I wash my brushes regularly with baby shampoo. The brush came unattached from the handle. Had to throw away.</li>
            <li> This is my first real technique brush and I plan to purchase more.  The brush is so soft and applies my blush on perfectly.</li>
            <li> i recommend this for everyone who wants good and reasonably priced brush. it is soft and easy to use :)</li>
            <li> good product.  Had no issues.  very useful.  What i thought I was getting.  The quality of this product was high.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE BRUSHES!!! I use them everyday!!!</li>
            <li> The brush is really soft and feels nice on the face. It doesn&#x27;t shed when applying products.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t washed it yet so don&#x27;t know if it sheds more after wash. Overall a good buy and is exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> recommended 👍 top quality</li>
            <li> I love this blush brush! The price was perfect, the bristles are soft and it was shipped the next day! It helps me achieve a natural flush looking whereas other brushes I own make me look like a clown. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This brush is well built. But the long bristles are too soft to pick up a hard cake blush well.</li>
            <li> I just received this brush as a gift, and I LOVE it. It is so soft, and applies blush like a dream. It picks up just the right amount of product. Swipe it a few times across your cheeks and you&#x27;re good to go. It applies the product evenly and you don&#x27;t have to sit and blend out the color forever. I had been using an E.L.F blush brush before this, that I thought I liked and worked just fine...but this real techniques brush puts the E.L.F to shame. I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Just what you expect from Real Techniques. Super soft and does not shed! Its a little large for some looks, but works well. I love it!</li>
            <li> Its a perfect brush to set yur makeup thats why i got it .</li>
            <li> Real Techniques are done of the best brushes out there. I use this to apply my mineral and HD powder. Love this big fluffy quality brush.</li>
            <li> I must say that I just love love love my brushed from Teal Techniques. I have had Mac brushes for more than 6 years and always found them shedding, these have not shed a single hair and they are so so soft and my skin goes all uhmmm and aaahhh when I use them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the Blush brunch: it is just beautiful and perfect!!! it takes up the blush well and blends it well. I also use it for other powder for setting my makeup all over. For this purpose it is also great!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, fast drying, do not shade at all. Versatile, u can use in multiple ways as a powder brush if you have smaller face, for cheeks even to apply highlighter. Love it when am in rush and need to apply all in one very quickly, so first I apply powder then with one side of the brush contour, then with the other one blush and lastly with the tip of the brush highlighter ! it is brilliant and fast. And believe me I&#x27;m very precise with my make up even on rush.</li>
            <li> My new favorite blush brush. Makes it easy to blend the blush where you want it.</li>
            <li> I really like Real Techniques brushes. They are pretty, sturdy, good quality and great price. I got this one for using with my highlighting powder. It is perfect for that. I personally wouldn&#x27;t use it for blush because for me it&#x27;s too big for that but it is exactly what I need for highlighting my cheeks!</li>
            <li> I originally got this brush for its purpose--to apply blush-- but i use it for my overall powder. Its a great multipurpose brush forsure. Love it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I&#x27;ve not been disappointed by their other products.</li>
            <li> soft bristles and ideal size for blusher. Bristles holding on together fine after at least 10 times used so far.</li>
            <li> I love all of real techniques products! They are made so nice and I replaced all of my bare essentials brushes with real techniques. For the quality of these brushes you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Really like this style, size and shape of this brush! Extremely soft and applies product nicely. Great price, too!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are definitely comparable to the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Ok just to let you know that for blush application I&#x27;ve used the MAC 187, 109, the Sigma small duo fibre (don&#x27;t remember the #) and a generic Revlon one but this brush is absolutely the best!!!!! It&#x27;s sooooo soft, I know people say that all the time about brushes but my goodness! It&#x27;s super soft and fluffy! It also keeps it shape really well for such a big brush, I&#x27;ve heard people complain about it being too big but because it&#x27;s tapered at the top it&#x27;s quite versatile, you can literally just use the tip top of the brush and the application is lovely and blended! I was so happy when this became available on Amazon, so if you&#x27;re like me and you&#x27;ve been drooling over this brush since Sam demoed it on Youtube, make sure and get it! It is everything you think it is and more!</li>
            <li> I really like this blush brush to apply darker more pigmented blushes.  Brush is soft, full and does not shed like some other high end brushes in my beauty box.  I only use the top tapered part when I apply my powder blush and I think the color goes on nicely and looks blended. I reach for this brush every time I apply powder blush but for cream blush I find the Sigmax F82 works the best.  This brush I think is a good find and for the price a pretty good deal because it&#x27;s light on the pocket book..</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. They don&#x27;t lose fibers when being used. They are the perfect length and weight for daily use.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. I ordered it as one of my daughter&#x27;s Christmas presents after she picked it out. Good price too!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t totally happy with this brush felt it was way to soft which makes it kinda flimsy. this coming from a girl who is a religious user of real techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> This feels great and is a good weight in my hand, but I just find it a little big for the area of my cheeks that I want the blush on. Have to be careful not to get too large of an area!</li>
            <li> I also am not 100% sold that this is a blush brush although it&#x27;s a really good quality brush so far that I will give it four stars but I will most likely use for other applications.</li>
            <li> Am sure this will work on some faces.  It is too large for my face but does work with baked foundation.</li>
            <li> It is nice and soft so your make up goes on nicely and does not make your face look flakey.</li>
            <li> Right off I&#x27;ll say that this isn&#x27;t a standard, \\&quot;flat\\&quot; blush/powder brush. It&#x27;s more of a \\&quot;dome\\&quot; brush but it&#x27;s slightly pointed at the tip rather than rounded. It picks up just as much color as you need to build intensity without smearing so much color that you end up spending 5 minutes blending and fading to make the color look more natural. It also works well as a kabuki powder/bronzer brush. It&#x27;s synthetic, of course, and well worth it&#x27;s $7 - $10 price. That said, it is NOT worth MORE than about $10. If you find it somewhere for more than that, keep looking because there are better prices elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve had good results with all the Real Techniques line and this is no different. Highly recommend for those who can&#x27;t shell out $75 for a powder/blush brush. If you are still uncertain about its appearance after my inadequate description, I think Ulta sells the entire Real Techniques line.</li>
            <li> This brush was dirty when I recieved it!  It smelled of cheap perfume and visibly had blush on it, which is really gross.  It was more of a nuisance to return it so after thorougly disinfecting it, it seems like an ok brush, I was just really disappointed that a dirty item was sent to me.</li>
            <li> Love love love this brush! It is so amazingly soft and gets the job done! I would recommend this to everyone who is looking for a great, inexpensive face brush!!</li>
            <li> I have this and the Expert Face Brush and I love them both. The quality is just wonderful. This brush in particular is sooo nice and soft! But it&#x27;s also really big and fluffy. I&#x27;m not a makeup expert by any means so it&#x27;s taking some figuring out, especially with the size and softness of the brush, to apply my blush the way I want.</li>
            <li> When I first received the brush I thought I did not need another blush brush,  so i was going to send it back but decided to try it&lt;br /&gt;and I&#x27;m  glad I did I think this brush is better than MAC.. but you didn&#x27;t hear that from me.  Love this brush it&#x27;s soooooo. soft on my&lt;br /&gt;face.</li>
            <li> This item is excellent as well and very good value for the price. She doesn&#x27;t dislike anything about this item.</li>
            <li> Just a advertised. Works amazingly and would definately order these for gifts soon. Perfect for beginners. Shipment was slow though</li>
            <li> I love the quality of this blush brush!</li>
            <li> I use it mainly for foundation, but this brush is also lovely for blush.</li>
            <li> This brush picks up blusher really well and all you need is a tiny bit and it goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Real techniques are the best affordable brushes.  Big blush brush</li>
            <li> im so glad i bought this brush is amazing i cant wait to use it soon thanks again great service</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft.  It blends blush on the face beautifully.  I&#x27;m so glad that I bought it, but I have loved all of the real techniques brushes that I have bought.</li>
            <li> the bristles are too flemsey which makes it&#x27;s harder to apply</li>
            <li> This brush is a little large for blush, but I find does an excellent job with bronzer or powder for me.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth buying especially with this price! The best blush brush. So soft and the shape is perfect to apply any power blush!</li>
            <li> its sooooooooooo good for highlight and blush!!</li>
            <li> Soft , but not for me ,,, I prefer ecotools powder brush</li>
            <li> I like a lot it brush! Thanks!  As professional makeup artists, we know great artistry is only as good as your techniques and tools.</li>
            <li> To Big for applying blush</li>
            <li> Great for bronzer or powder application.</li>
            <li> GREAT BRUSHES IN LOVE WITH HOW THEY WORK OMG BUY THEM !!! MUST HAVE FOR COLLECTIONS WORKS GREAT . love!!!</li>
            <li> very soft, and it blends the blush nicely on my cheeks, i got the NYX peach blush with it as well.</li>
            <li> This appears to be an authentic REAL TECHNIQUES BRUSH. I have others that i have purchased from retailers, and they look feel and perform exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this blush brush. Good quality.  Perfect for applying blush.  Great price.  Wal-Mart has it for almost double the price.</li>
            <li> not super impressed, but not disappointed either. i think the blush brush bristles themselves are too long for my tastes, so i don&#x27;t really use the tip of the bristles but will apply blush/bronzer by using the side of the brush. the brush head itself is big. so i have a tendency to just hold the bristle together when using.</li>
            <li> I thought that this brush was going to be a good one but I was disappointed. The application is very light, too light. I may try it with a different blush to see if I get the same outcome.</li>
            <li> My favorites blush brush. So fluffy. Easy to clean. Ready to blend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best brush special for bronsers and blushes, very good quality and very cheap price! Very soft pile ,very comfortable handle</li>
            <li> This brush is really soft and easy to clean. I use it for blush, but it&#x27;s also great for bronzer. Its domed shape fits nicely in the hollows of my cheeks. It doesn&#x27;t pick up too much product and is good for blending! I use this brush every day. My only complaint is that because the base of the brush is wide enough for it to stand up, it can be a bit annoying to put in a cup with other brushes. I rarely need this brush to stand up, and would prefer a slimmer handle.</li>
            <li> It distributes my blush evenly and the brush itself is sturdy. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Are you kidding me with this brush? It is simply Ah-mazing!!!! If your looking at this and thinking should I buy it? Yes yes yes you should def buy it. Don&#x27;t think just buy. I am buying more because I love it so much I use it for different powder products so why not have a couple so I don&#x27;t mix powders! I love this brush and you will too</li>
            <li> I use this to contour and for blush and I am really pleased. Has never shed and is REALLY easy to wash. It does not stain either. Works great with powders, creams and liquids.</li>
            <li> Order came very quickly.  I like the brush very much. Doesn&#x27;t have Brussels that fall out on your face. Good item</li>
            <li> Recommended from YouTube. Love all real Techniques brushes. They wash well and are so reasonably priced. This particular brush works well with my Bare Minerals face powder.</li>
            <li> So soft and perfectly tapered. I love this brush. My new favorite for applying blush. No need to spend hundreds of dollars on brushes to get a quality product. You&#x27;ve found it.</li>
            <li> Another good Real Techniques brush.  It picks up a small amount of product and can apply a sheer coverage to a full coverage depending on your desire.  Blends well.  I am really enjoying this brush</li>
            <li> My daughter has a severe allergy to most makeups &amp; brushes.  We were told to try these &amp; we both are amazed at how much better her skin is.  These brushes are finer silk &amp; therefore don&#x27;t clog up with tons of makeup &amp; facial oils.  Even though she could go longer between cleanings, she chooses to clean them more often than recommended without any degradation to the brushes.  Very impressed.</li>
            <li> Great for applying blush. Soft and subtle but colors are easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Best makeup brush I have ever used.  Bought it well over a year ago-maybe even two, and it&#x27;s still in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite blush brushes. When I first got it, I was a little intimated by the size of the brush. But it does a great job of placing the blush and blending it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No regrets on this purchase!</li>
            <li> I love how soft it is.  It seems to be a great quality. I love all their brushes I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> The soft &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; are silky and don&#x27;t fall out, as so many other brands of brushers do! I&#x27;ve been searching for a long time to fine this kind of quality! Super prompt. Happy customer! A+++++ seller!</li>
            <li> my hg blush brush as of now.at first I didnt know how to use it but as I got the hang how to omg the final results is worth it. looks flawless, brush is not prickly but soft.definitely will look into buying more real techniques brushes!</li>
            <li> I am very particular about my makeup brushes and was a little skeptical when this brush was greatly recommended because of the reasonable price. I love the brush and am building a collection as I need them. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> great! i use it for blush and powder also work</li>
            <li> Loved it, soft and light in weight, have not tried yet however i have a feeling that i will really enjoy it</li>
            <li> Samantha Chapman is a makeup genus. She has made and entire brush collection that is affordable, well made, great colors, and soft bristles.  These are multi functional brushes and can be used on any facial feature and with any type of make up!  I can not get enough of these brushes.</li>
            <li> Just bought this at Ulta.  Wow, these seem to be hard to find, and I understand why.  They are really high quality for the price of the brush.  Most other brushes are much more expensive and more disappointing.  I like this brush, but what I really wanted was the powder brush.  That one was not in stock, so I bought this one and it works really well.  The shape of the bristles doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, and they are very soft.  However, the bottom of the brush is wider than most- like others say, harder to store this way.  I love the brush, but still have my eye on the powder brush.  Also, the kabuki brush looks really fun too!  It was a toss up and I chose this one for the longer handle.</li>
            <li> I love this blush brush one of the best brushes out there ^-^</li>
            <li> Amazing brush!  Probably my favorite from Real Techniques!  I love the natural look it gives when I use it to aply my blush.  I use it for bronzer sometimes as well and love it for that!</li>
            <li> These were my first purchase of Real Techniques.  Delighted with them.  Soft on the skin, easy to wash, love the long&lt;br /&gt;handles.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles!!! And the unique shape allows for blush application as well as bronzing and subtle contour!! Definitely would rebuy!!!</li>
            <li> I love this brand.  A lot.  Perfect quality, ridiculously soft, and they get the job done.  The cheek brush however is kind of big...I don&#x27;t think it properly applies the blush that I use, so instead I use real Techniques stippling brush to apply.  It is, however, an awesome blending brush/bronzer brush.  I&#x27;ll use it to apply some bronzer, then apply my blush, and then I&#x27;ll use it again to blend the blush and the bronzer.  Works like a charm!</li>
            <li> The blush is very soft but i don&#x27;t know why I just ordered once you charge me seven times please stop charge thanks</li>
            <li> I used it for blush and then for just light powdering. Wonderfully soft, easy to clean, and I love how steady it stands. Grabs product effectively and distributes evenly. Will probably get a second one soon!</li>
            <li> I cannot for the life of me figure out a reasonable way to use this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are brushes whose shape is far better suited to being a blush brush or a bronzer brush or an all-over powder brush. The shape of this one is not intuitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the quality, as is always the case with the real techniques brushes, is astounding which is why it still gets 4 stars. The usefulness is seriously questionable, though.</li>
            <li> Very soft and precise for applying blush to the cheek bones.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush! But its not a blush brush at all its too big and fluffy for that. Its not a dense brush but i like to use it to blend out my face and sometimes apply my face powder. Ive had it for over a year and its still in really good shape i deffinatly recomend for begginers</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very soft.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great brush . I just wouldn&#x27;t use it for blush . but for powder foundation it&#x27;s great .</li>
            <li> worked great. would buy again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, love that it&#x27;s totally cruelty free. Works great!</li>
            <li> Anyone who has used real techniques brushes knows how fabulous these are! I am a beauty youtuber and I need brushes that are going to do the job I need done. These brushes work perfectly and are very popular on YouTube! I love this blush brush because it allows you to have precise movements along with blending in the blush as you go! I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is one of the softest brushes I&#x27;ve ever felt and the size makes it perfect for applying powder quickly but not cakey. One of my favs. love it!</li>
            <li> Soooo soft and picks/applies powder products beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little too big for &amp;#34;blush&amp;#34;, but I use it fine for light blush application &amp; powder</li>
            <li> These brushes are The Best! To hell with all those high end lines that scratch up your face! This makeup artist knew what she was doing when she made them! They are quality, easy-to-use, and economically friendly; my type of brush line! I will be purchasing an extra set just in case they stop making them-lol!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still one of my favorites and I reach for it everyday. It&#x27;s soft and when I washed it after arrival, the water came out clean- no dyes! Woo hoo! It picks up color and deposits it flawlessly-- i use it with Nars orgasm or Mac peachtwist. Also, it dries super quickly after washing which was shocking because it&#x27;s so fluffy and dense. I think I now officially own all of the real techniques brushes and I feel that they are a worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is the best blush brush i have had so far. It is very versatile , as a matter of fact i also use it for contouring because of it&#x27;s slightly pointed top. it&#x27;s a really good brush!</li>
            <li> Its the best blush brush I&#x27;ve ever had. I will continue to buy this brand for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Bloggers love it for a reason- you don&#x27;t need a lot of product with this one- nice purchase and great quality for the price. plus, love the color and it stand up.</li>
            <li> Ships in no time at all. Super soft fiber and I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding. Although I prefer angled brushes for blush this is really good. I just wish it was a bit more firm.</li>
            <li> I have heard so many people rave over this particular blush brush, but I just did not find it to be as fabulous as others did. I used it for mineral powder foundation and it did NOT apply my powder like my old tried-and-true MAC Kabuki brush does. It was inexpensive so that might be the best for this brush.</li>
            <li> this is the perfect shape for putting blush along the cheekbones. the way it&#x27;s designed allows you to use just the tip to put color down precisely where you want it and then blend with the whole brush. it also works really well for bronzing the face/forehead. the bristles are really soft. i love it. i&#x27;ve used and washed it a lot and have not experienced shedding or any other problems.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It&#x27;s very soft :) I also got the powder brush which I love as well :)  Both arrived pretty quickly so thumbs up for the seller, I use these brushes on a daily basis &amp; I&#x27;d recommend this to my friends.. It&#x27;s great &amp; affordable</li>
            <li> I LOVE this blush brush! The bright is lightweight and comfortable to hold. The bristles are soft and non-irritating. It applies your blush softly and evenly, so you can really control how intense you would like it to be. You could also probably use this as a bronzer brush, although I have not tried it yet. Also, I want to mention that the quality of this brush, especially considering how affordable it is, is REALLY good! The size of this brush (handle and bristles) is really just right, in my opinion. I love the price points of these brushes, too. My Real Techniques brushes are my favorite brushes I own. I hope to eventually own every brush they make!</li>
            <li> If you have never used a Real Techniques brush before I highly recommend you do . This brush works great and works better then my 40 Doller Saphora brush. It does not shed at all . I have washed this brush tons of times with no problems at all . Great makeup brush .</li>
            <li> Lovely soft, big brush. I use it every day for powder blush and it applies like a dream. I prefer it to some of my more expensive brushes. The brush is quite big, so it&#x27;s great for a natural look that&#x27;s very diffuse and blended. It has stood up well to weekly deep cleans, as I can&#x27;t remember any bristles shedding.</li>
            <li> Very cool product and purchased Recommend</li>
            <li> Love this brush! It&#x27;s so super soft and applies my blush so nicely. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months now and have not had any bristles fall out during use or when washing it. Will be adding additional Real Techniques to my brush collection.</li>
            <li> I expected a better brush because of all the good reviews! I dont use it anymore, my mac blush barely applies to my face. You can see the color on the ends of the brush, but it doesnt apply well. My 16month son plays with this brish now. I wish I just bought another mac brush instead. This brush doesnt come close to a mac blush brush. I learned not to go cheap with brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I think the problem with this brush is that it is way too soft.</li>
            <li> Best. Brushes. Ever. Seriously. I love these brushes so much. The bristles never fall out, and they are so easy to clean! Just make sure they dry completely or else the where the bristles meet the brush might rust.</li>
            <li> This review is for my wife but she likes it. Proper cleaning and maintenance makes them last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I really love this brush. The bristles are soft to the touch and doesn&#x27;t damage my skin. Also the bristles don&#x27;t come off like other brushes I have use.</li>
            <li> This is the best blush brush in my collection so far... Thanks Samatha for great products.  I got it for a really reasonable price and will buy more from this vendor.</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of reviews I decided that I wasn&#x27;t going to use it as a blush brush but more for finishing blending the lines from my jaw to my neck and into my hairline. It&#x27;s still my favorite and softest brush in my collection. I love it cx</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do the job! Seriously I have to reapply the blush over and over to get what I want and I&#x27;m talking about high end proudcts like benefit and urban decay and Cargo! But it just doesn&#x27;t work I gave up on it!! Don&#x27;t waste your money !! Add those bucks to another and buy better brand or brush!</li>
            <li> I cannot compliment enough this brush, is just perfect, i used it for everything, foundation, bronzer and  contour and of course what its meant for. A MUST</li>
            <li> Ive used brushes from every major makeup brand out there and I must hand it to real Techniques... they have amazing quality at an unbeatable price.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, nice looking, washes well ... I recommend ....if ur in the market for a well priced buffing brush also check out the other real techniques brushes .</li>
            <li> Nothing is perfect, but this brush handles its job quite well and at a fabulous price.  Very soft and attractive.</li>
            <li> Great brush, picks up enough to build up to desired blush color intensity. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> the packaging is broken, looks like a second-hand</li>
            <li> This is the second blush brush I have bought from real Techniques.  The blush brushes are fluffy, hold product really well, and wash/dry really well, holding their shape.  The price for these brushes is really good too!</li>
            <li> I love love love real techniques brushes. I got the blush brush and the powder brush and love them. A couple months back i also got the core collection and i love those too. Now all i need is the setting brush and the eye collection.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I use it to gently smooth out my contour</li>
            <li> This is a large fluffy brush with extremely soft bristles, I love it, but for my bronzer rather than blush. I think it&#x27;s a little too large for applying blush but it&#x27;s perfect for bronzer. I have several Real Techniques brushes and love them all.</li>
            <li> I like this blush brush, it gives a very natural look when I apply blush. I wish the brush is a little bit more dense but overall it is a good quality brush and I will recommend to others.</li>
            <li> it is pretty good product, not as soft as their smaller brushes that it sometimes cause irritation if i rub too much or too hard.</li>
            <li> This brush is super soft, high quality and as a plus it stands up by itself. For my face, it was a little big to use for blush so I use it for powder. As with all Real Technique brushes the ferrule is nice and sturdy and easy to grip.</li>
            <li> Wow, when using this brush your blush looks fantastic. The dense quality of the brush is great. So soft and great. I&#x27;m a fan! Not made of animal hair, nevertheless of good quality.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Brush with soft bristles that do not shed. Great brush for setting makeup with loose powder.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the real Techniques brushes - I have yet to find one loose bristle. They&#x27;re soft and so easy to clean - make up doesn&#x27;t stick to the brushes at all. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush! My favorite one I is currently!</li>
            <li> Soft brush but won&#x27;t hold any product so I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s purpose is.  Have tried w/lose and pressed powder both as well as blush and it will not hold the product.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I loved this blush brush, it is just fabulous to use and blends very well, worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It shed a few hairs when it was brand new, but not anymore. It&#x27;s big and fluffy, with a lightweight aluminum handle. I like it.</li>
            <li> So quick and easy! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this brush.  I use it for blush and works just as I want it to work!</li>
            <li> Very good for the money</li>
            <li> perfect! the brush is really soft!</li>
            <li> Love love love it! So soft and provides even distribution of the blush. Looks airbrushed after!!! Fits right into my starter kit too!</li>
            <li> These Real Techniques brushes are great. They are soft and have the proper shape to do the job, plus they are reasonably priced. I can&#x27;t see buying any other brand.</li>
            <li> I do like this brush. Its so fluffy and soft. I actually have a backup when one one of them gets dirty.</li>
            <li> This is an alright brush but I could not get it to work for blush application. It is too big for this. And, It just went on WAY too dark and it would not blend out the blush no matter how hard I tried. I can see it working well for highlighter, powder foundation, or setting powder, though. It is very soft and holds its shape well. These are good quality brushes.</li>
            <li> This brush i felt was too big for me to apply the blush, i decided to buy the RT Stippling brush, and i am much happier with the results</li>
            <li> I use this for blush and its perfect, so so soft!</li>
            <li> Fast shipment!&lt;br /&gt;I love how soft this brush is. I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it but I&#x27;ve heard great things about it.</li>
            <li> Really makes a difference! Love</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that much about make up brushes, but I really like this one and I think it works great.</li>
            <li> best blusher brush  ever</li>
            <li> Really good for a natural blended look. I am quite horrible at doing my makeup but this makes it look like I have a decent hand.</li>
            <li> All of the real Techniques brushed worked wonderful. Be sure to watch the instruction video from the link on the box (they are helpful)!</li>
            <li> Real Techniques are the best brushes I have used all year. You can&#x27;t beat them. I prefer them over MAC and any department store brushes.They have a great price and great quality. I LOVE REAL TECHNIQUES!</li>
            <li> Have used mineral make up for years w/ brushes that came with original kit.  Thought it time for some new ones and SO glad I chose this brand.  Feel so soft and non-irritating to my skin, plus they do a FANTASTIC job of applying the make up.  Buy w/ confidence; you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> The brush is the softest one I have ever used and I&#x27;m totally in love with it! I am probably gonna buy another one too so I can use them for blush and for powder!</li>
            <li> This is a perfect all rounder brush.. U can use it not just for blush but as a powder brush as well.. The brush is ultra plush and very soft.. Love it...</li>
            <li> the brush is too tall , I love it so much for blush</li>
            <li> Best brush ever, so soft, no shedding.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed. Maybe because I am not big fan of highlights. For a soft makeup is ok</li>
            <li> This brush is fabulous. Bristles are so soft and tapered. I love the handle. I&#x27;m throwing out all my blush brushes and only using this one. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome but was delivered to me with the handle completely broken off. Some superglue fixed this, but I will probably go and buy any more real techniques brushes at Ulta!</li>
            <li> I love it! For brushes this price and the quality to be amazing is mind blowing. It blends so well, it totally changed the look of my makeup, it looks more polished airbrushed and blended well (that&#x27;s the key bblending) I got 3 sets apart from this and all there brushes are amazing, soft, not to firm or to flimsy its just perfect. My only negative comment and its not even negative is that they should have more verity of brushes.</li>
            <li> The above questions don&#x27;t really apply to a makeup brush, but I can say that this brush is wonderful and I love it.  It&#x27;s very soft and diffuses product perfectly.  I like it better than any of the high end brand blush/powder brushes that I own and it&#x27;s a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this blush brush after hearing so many positive reviews about it. When i first opened the box, i noticed that the packaging itself was good. The brush itself was very soft and was exactly as pictured on amazon. I have used it to apply one of my tarte blushes and it applies it very smooth to my cheeks. It does not pick up too little or too much product but just the right amount. I have been using it awhile now so i had to deep clean the brush. This is the moment of truth. When you deep clean a brush, you see if the brush bristles fall out and see if the shape of the brush stay intact. It was very easy to wash and dried in no time. None of the bristles came out and the shape is still intact. I recommend this brand to everybody!</li>
            <li> Very good brush for blush!</li>
            <li> This line of brushes is affordable, and great quality too. I must have to say im impressed with the quality, being a fan of makeup but Ive had a hard time finding good and affordable brushes, that wont make me feel guilty when I buy them. This lines is just what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush fits perfectly on the cheek area, it gives a great finish to my powder blushes, but for cream brushes I prefer a smaller brush. The reason im not giving it a 5 star review is because my face is kinda small, so I tend to use it for pressed foundation instead. Great quality still. Soft and easy to clean. You wont regret this.</li>
            <li> I think this brush is great for face powder more than blush. I do like this for blush too however I prefer it for the face. Its a very very soft brush. The shape is idealistic and I do like the fact that it is tapered and has a point and the tip if you want to concentrate your blush or contour in a specific place. The downside of this is that I have used this with MAC blushes and it picks up color in the beginning but then I must build color up which sucked at first until I got used to it. If it was denser I would definitely use it for blush. Its dense but will be flimsy a bit when you apply the product to your face. I guess you can read reviews to picture the real use out of this brush. But overall it doesn&#x27;t shed and it&#x27;s an ok but not the most idealistic blush brush that you would want to have.</li>
            <li> I saw this brush with my sister and i tried it .. then I ordered it instantly :D&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s so soft and light and it blends very well so you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting too blush on your cheeks ..&lt;br /&gt;its shape is perfect for the cheek bones ..</li>
            <li> This is my perfect powder brush. It is too big for blush, in my opinion but it applies my Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powder like a dream! This brush is super soft but large and dense enough to do it&#x27;s job beautifully and it is so affordable. If you are thinking about buying this brush, jump on it. It&#x27;s terrific.</li>
            <li> if you over wash them the bristles will fall out...  other wise great!</li>
            <li> I really, really like this brush.  It applies blush with the slightest hint of color and it blends it seamlessly.  Modern looking blush must be natural looking, like a flush after running around the block in hot weather.  This brush picks up the color in perfect proportion and applies it to the apples of the cheek like a dream.  For an inexpensive brush, it works as well or better than the very, very expensive goat hair brushes I have.  What a pleasant surprise!  Be sure to shake off the excess as this brush has a tendency to spread it too far, other than that I have no complaints.  I&#x27;m giving it five stars anyway because I&#x27;m so happily surprised that such an economical beauty item is more than just a bargain, it&#x27;s an essential beauty tool.  I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I like the real techniques brushes because they are good for the price. If you can afford more- yes there are better brushes out there, but these are absolutely fine.</li>
            <li> this brush i  absolutely amazing they feel so soft on my skin and applies the perfect amount of blush on! i strongly recommend this product and the brand it self!!</li>
            <li> Soft bristles, good shape and comfortable handle.</li>
            <li> These are the most amazing soft as brushes I&#x27;ve ever had definitely will purchase the whole line</li>
            <li> I so love this brush I advise everyone to try it.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are so soft and it applies my powder even and when I do put my powder on with this brush, the bristles are super soft on my skin I use it for cream blush but you can use it for powder too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great quality brush for a great price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this for blush . I use this to blend my blush and contour and highlight together and it works nicely. Unfortunately this product doesn&#x27;t work as well after you wash it.</li>
            <li> This is such a great brush for applying blush.the brush is very soft and really nice on my skin.i will be ordering the other Real Techniques Brushes.</li>
            <li> I am always still so shocked when I take these DRUGSTORE brushes out of the packaging and they are as soft and fluffy as my high-end brushes! I am a huge real techniques can, and have the majority of their brushes. They feel so nice on the skin and not scratchy at all, like some other cheap brushes. I love this for a sweep of bronzer all over, for those days I want more of a glow than a contoured look. Highly suggest this brush along with any brush from the line!</li>
            <li> I bought two of these brushes for applying blush.  One I use for all over blush coverage and the other to highlight the top of the cheekbones with a mineral powder for a bit of shimmer.</li>
            <li> This brush is great when using powder on your face.  I feels soft on your face.  I love it  a lot.</li>
            <li> love this brush for bronzer and it works well with blush. some said doesn&#x27;t seem dense enough for blush but it works for me well.I use Nars Orgasm blush.</li>
            <li> The best blush and contour brush I&#x27;ve used so far, Love it.</li>
            <li> My wife love it and say it&#x27;s as good as the expensive brands</li>
            <li> Great brush, good quality for the price and it holds up amazing if you take care of it.</li>
            <li> Very soft, perfect blending... My favorite blush brush ever! Creates the perfect \\&quot;sun kiss\\&quot; effect that I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I already both a second one! No regrets.</li>
            <li> The fur is so soft.Ilove it very much. The handle is so comfortable. It is a very good blush brush.</li>
            <li> One of the most softs brushes i try. Love it</li>
            <li> Incredibly soft and feels wonderful along one&#x27;s cheekbones.  Highly recommend this brand. I am a makeup addict and own a ton of MAC and Sigma brushes - this brand is the most bang for your buck</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan on big brushes, but I got this one because it seemed soo soft... and it is! Blends blush really well, I don&#x27;t use to powder my face or anything else, I prefer smaller ones, but does a great job blending both powder and cream products.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for blush, bronzer or highlighting. The price can&#x27;t be beat for a high quality brush.  This has been a great addition to my brush collection.  I use it everyday and it has kept its shape.  Easy to clean with a little baby shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love all of the real Techniques brushes. They are very soft and do no irritate my sensitive skin. They apply make-up perfectly! I highly recommend this brand for brushes.</li>
            <li> so soft and helps blend the brush great on your face...I love real techniques brushes...they are all so awesome...a must have</li>
            <li> Not impressed by the way it works, nothing special, better to buy elf brushes. Quality is good but its performance is poor. It would be better to buy eco tools I guess.</li>
            <li> I really loved the bristles, however, the black part of the handle is quiete loose. Im afraid it will totally come off after a few wash/uses :(</li>
            <li> I ordered this blush brush, because I have enjoyed other Real Techniques brushes.  This is the best one yet!  I was surprised at how soft and fluffy it is, and the shape makes it perfect for placing product exactly where I want.  I love the color-coded handle (pink is for finishing) and especially the flat base that can stand up straight on the shelf.  This brush is a great value and is easy to care for as well.  We have a winner!</li>
            <li> I wanted a new blush brush and after reading reviews and watching tutorials on youtube, I decided to give real Techniques a try. I&#x27;m so glad I did! It arrived quickly and I used it for the first time today. I can&#x27;t believe the difference between my old brush... which I thought was pretty good... and this one. Big difference! It is a little bigger than I expected, BUT because of it&#x27;s shape it allows for precise application. The wonderful thing about this is its ability to be dual purpose. I applied my blush (which BTW, it didn&#x27;t pull off my foundation or concealer over my melasma on my cheekbones **dancing jig**) and then I was able to lightly blend in a little powder highlighter on top of my cheekbones. It was perfect! I walked downstairs and my husband looked up from the couch and said &amp;#34;Hey Gorgeous!&amp;#34; Even he could tell a difference, and you know men don&#x27;t always pay attention to the little details...lol. I also ordered two of the rT sets... the core collection, and the starter set... oh, and the face brush. Seeing how fabulous this brush worked, I can&#x27;t wait to receive the others. My main issue is covering up melasma and mild adult acne, and I had decided to revamp my entire makeup routine because what worked when I was 20, just ain&#x27;t cuttin&#x27; it at 40ish. I would definitely recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They were amazingly with all kinds of high end and low end make-up. They are well made and hold up to a lot of usage. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I used to use this a lot for powdered blush and it&#x27;s awesome for that, especially if it&#x27;s not too crumbly or loose. I have a couple nars ones and its excellent with those (not so much with the 100% pure blush, that one falls apart and get way too much on the brush) I like this for powdering my face with dr hauschka&#x27;s  body silk, perfect for down the center of the face. I think you could use this for mineral foundation too, if you like a light airbrushed look</li>
            <li> Brilliant for contouring, especially for powder products.</li>
            <li> I truly love this blush brush. Definitely my fav! Super affordable and much softer than my Sigma brush. I would certainly recommend this to all who loves make up. A keeper for sure!</li>
            <li> Love this brush is so soft.</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes I have ever owned and I have over a 100. The are supper soft but still effective.  If you can only get one type of brush set, buy these.  They are worth it and far more affordable then most make up brushes on the market.  Check out there YouTube channel as well for ideas and was to use them.</li>
            <li> This brush is very soft! It&#x27;s tapered and can be used for MANY things besides blush. I actually prefer to use this for bronzer, contouring, and highlighting than for blush. The brush is VERY easy to wash and dry. The handle is nice and a good texture. Also, it&#x27;s VERY cute :). For around $10 you can&#x27;t go wrong trying this brush!</li>
            <li> This brush is pretty soft, not as soft as the powder brush but I like it. I don&#x27;t think it is a good brush for blush though, it has too much give and the bristles don&#x27;t distribute the color evenly :(</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft, and it blended my blush very well. Only problem is that the handle is HUGE. Make sure you have a pretty big place to keep this thing - even my makeup organizer didn&#x27;t have a slot big enough for it to fit comfortably.</li>
            <li> this brushes is very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I love it. That make flawless finish.&lt;br /&gt;I like it. I love Real Technique brushes</li>
            <li> hi there bought this to apply blush works like a charm like it</li>
            <li> This may be &amp;#34;soft,&amp;#34; but the brush is not nearly as soft as other Real Techniques brushes, such as the Expert Face Brush.  I know I did receive a true item, because I also felt this brush at an Ulta after I&#x27;d ordered it, and it felt the same as the one I received.  You just don&#x27;t get that luxurious, velvety soft feeling on your fingertips like you do with other Real Techniques brushes.  The hairs on this blush brush are a bit coarse in comparison, though compared maybe to a really crappy brush, these would be considered soft--there are many very course animal hair brushes, such as some of the ones from the Bare Minerals line, which would make this Real Techniques Blush Brush very soft by comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape, I must say, is very unique and cool looking.  I love how, depending on how you angle the brush, whether it&#x27;s using the tip of the brush, or the side of the brush, you can get a different application, yet both angles are somewhat fluffy--this is unique in comparison to other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to have this brush in my collection.  It is not as soft as I would like, but I think it will provide some interesting uses.  This is my first impressions review.  I will update when I have tried out the brush, as well.</li>
            <li> Love real techniques brushes!</li>
            <li> FOR BLUSHER THE BEST!!! Love real techniques!</li>
            <li> Perfect for blush and blending out contour.</li>
            <li> Personally using this with powder contour.  Perfect and totally effortless application.  Luv it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Real Technique brushes for a while now, and this is the best Blush brush I have purchased. WOW - I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. This brush is amazing quality and is so soft! It applies my blush effortlessly whilst leaving your face with a soft glow. It&#x27;s very easy to clean and maintains it&#x27;s shape which has been a real problem for me with other brushes purchased in the past. This brush dries quickly too - I leave this to air dry and it&#x27;s good to use again within 2-3 hours. Excellent buy - I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate in recommending this brush to others and the complete Real Techniques range.</li>
            <li> finally got it, very soft, couldnt ask for a better brush to apply blush. highly suggest it, real techniques is a great brand.</li>
            <li> Perfect for blush or just buffering out the entire face!  Very soft &amp; love the quality of all rt brushes!</li>
            <li> I read a bunch of reviews saying that this brush is not good for blush but it is I love apply blush with it cause leaves no harsh lines on my cheeks and even looks natural.</li>
            <li> Too big. Geesh, how big does a blush brush need to be? Pretty ridiculous really, but it&#x27;s soft as heck...so there is that.</li>
            <li> I use oil to cleanse my face and so the brush started sticking together when using it in my powder foundation ... But other than that seems well maid.</li>
            <li> My wife, who&#x27;s the family expert on these matters, says that this product is value for money as it performs at par with the more expensive brushes out in the marker.  Well I cannot argue with the radiant smile on her face after each usage.  Well made, priced just right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soft and makes my blushed cheeks look so natural.</li>
            <li> I just adore this blush brush! It&#x27;s very lightweight and well made. It keeps my blush from ending up too heavy on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are very soft and I&#x27;ll be buying mor Tecknique brushes.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.  The bristles don&#x27;t come out (which has happened for years with past make up brushes).  Also, it&#x27;s very soft and fluffy.  Great price, too.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It is very, very soft and has minimal shedding, which I cant say the same for some of my high end brushes. I use this everyday and use it for powder or bronzer. It works best at depositing color all over. I would NOT use for this blush, haven&#x27;t even tried. It is way too big. Anyway, do not let that deter you from buying it, most makeup brushes can be used multiple ways, not just what the label says. It is fantastic, high quality, and comparable to brushes I have paid much, much more for.</li>
            <li> I love all the Real Techniques brushes. They&#x27;re amazing.  This blush brush works just the right amount of color on the apples of the cheeks.  Its really fantastic.  It blends the color really well, so you won&#x27;t have any streaking.  All of these brushes clean up nicely with any sort of makeup brush cleaner or even face wash for that matter.</li>
            <li> This brush is excellent quality, though I think it&#x27;s better for applying loose powder than it is for blush. It applies product very softly and blends it beautifully. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Soft and no shedding. It gets the job done and i use it for my blush and contouring.</li>
            <li> This does not shed and makes my blush application look natural. You will not regret buying this. The hair are soft on the face also even after 10 washes and counting....</li>
            <li> Bigger than I thought but its great for applying a sheerer blush. Could use this for a luminizer too with a light hand</li>
            <li> I bought this brush expecting it to be amazing, because a friend had suggested it. However, it doesn&#x27;t pick up enough blush for it to even show up a little bit on my face. The bristles are pretty stiff, but they are pretty loosely packed. This brush is perfect for highlighting, and has even worked for bronzing, although it looked a little stripey.</li>
            <li> This brush is seriously so soft, but also dense at the same time so you actually get product where it needs to go.  I also love how it is tapered so that I can just lightly brush the blush on my cheek bones, and then I blend it out with the sides of the brush.  This brush is now a staple in my morning makeup routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Sam&amp;Nick and their Pixiwoo youtube channel. I was sure their make-up brushes would be fine, but it turned out to be amazing, super- soft!! I&#x27;m going to buy other real techniques brushes for me and my mom!</li>
            <li> This blusher brush is the best out of the other brushes! Its soft,pick up product easily &amp; evenly....., delivery was fast &amp; price is also reasonable compare to other brands...</li>
            <li> Super soft. Very nice brush for contouring and blush! Nice quality!</li>
            <li> Loove this brush. I really like how it applies the blush and bronzer. It&#x27;s a great brush for contour.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t outperform my Mac brushes (which I consider mid-level), but I love how soft this is. It&#x27;s far too big for applying blush, unless you pinch it, but I&#x27;ve found it works great for applying setting powder. I&#x27;ve had this for several months and it hasn&#x27;t begun to shed at all- even despite quite a few washes. Overall, its a good brush for the value.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this makeup brush. While I don&#x27;t see it as effective for blush application, I knew this beforehand from the reviews. The blush brush is way too big to apply any pigmented blush. However, I use this big and soft, fluffy brush for application of my MAC Skinfinish face powder on top of foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hairs on this brush are really secure. Recommended!</li>
            <li> excellent blush brush</li>
            <li> Not as soft as I had hoped, but NOT scratchy and definitely better than some of my more expensive brushes.  Overall, it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> I freaking love this brush, it&#x27;s the most perfect to apply blush, and i love the pink color so here you go.</li>
            <li> This blush brush blends amazingly well and is soooo soft. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s so cheap! It&#x27;s my favorite go-to blush brush!</li>
            <li> I am new to these brushes and using them for blush.  This one is perfect and helps me place my blush in the perfect spot.  Also it is very soft and does not pick up too much makeup at a time.  This is great for anyone but, especially someone who is not a make up expert.</li>
            <li> muy buena!! da un acabado muy natural con el rubor!!</li>
            <li> I kinda like it. It&#x27;s a bit too big for my personal liking but at least it holds the blush well and you don&#x27;t need to keep reapplying much.</li>
            <li> Good quality, but I feel the bristles might be too long and it makes it harder to apply the blush.</li>
            <li> Great blush brush...You can not go wrong with real techniques brushes. All of them are good and cant beat the prices.</li>
            <li> I like all real techniques brushes</li>
            <li> I rub it on face all the time. So soft. Applies just the right amount without overdoing it.</li>
            <li> We belive its not original Real Techniques</li>
            <li> Despite its size, I have no problem using this for blush as long as I&#x27;m light handed. Makes it easy to get the apples of your cheeks if that&#x27;s where you like to apply. I&#x27;ve also used this to blend contouring bronzer. Easily cleaned and held its shape well.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS BRUSH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is meant for blush but can be used for buffing in foundation.&lt;br /&gt;the synthetic bristles allow you to use this o a variety of different products.&lt;br /&gt;washing it there was ABSOLUTELY NO SHEDDING.</li>
            <li> I found this to be an excellent and versatile brush for the face. It is quite soft and so far has not shed a single bristle. I have used it as an &amp;#34;all in one&amp;#34; brush (powder, blush, bronzer) for my makeup bag and it does all three very well, although, the afore mentioned softness does make for a lighter application of powders than I would otherwise use, meaning it takes a little longer to build up your color. All in all, I like it and will probably repurchase.</li>
            <li> Awesome . wife is happy, life is good</li>
            <li> Great add on to the Real Techniques sets.  I highly recommend getting this in addition to the sets they sell.  OR if you just need a new blush brush.  I think it picks up blush quite well and applies perfectly.</li>
            <li> Good quality inexpensive brushes, strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> What i wrote about the setting brush was what I meant to write here. BUt yeah, i absolutely loved this brush. It might be my most favorite.</li>
            <li> Strong solid not falling excellent size with a comfortable handle hand in Maintained a smooth and take the powder form that you really need neither plus nor minus</li>
            <li> The product was received within the week, excellent quality of brush, my wife loves the brand and is wanting to get the entire collection</li>
            <li> I do agree when some of the other posters, it is a *bit* big for applying blush. But I still like it overall and use it mostly to blend my blush with my cheek contouring.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice big fluffy blush brush. I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> Love the blush brush.  Have almost all of the real techniques brushes now.  Love the price!</li>
            <li> I love real techniques. This brush is so soft and fluffy. It picks up product very well and is fluffy enough I don&#x27;t have to use my blending brush. Just put a little product on the brush and buff it in. I&#x27;m down for anything that saves me a step&lt;br /&gt;Even if it is just one step in makeup application.</li>
            <li> Great Brush for the price!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of make up brushes but I&#x27;ve never had a blush brush that was shaped like this.  As with all real Techniques brushes, the brush hair feels very plush and soft against skin.  The brush picks up color quite well and applies product beautifully.  The tapering all round really helps with diffusing and blending color to achieve a very natural blush finish.  The size of the brush head is big enough for it to double as a powder/finishing brush as well which is perfect when you&#x27;re travelling.  The flat base allows the brush to stand on its own on table tops in the event that you don&#x27;t have a brush holder to store brushes.  The brush feels nice held and the extended aluminium ferrule is a nice touch design-wise.  The brush hair is easy to clean and has held its shape even after many spot and deep cleanings.  I&#x27;ve had the brush for over a year now and I&#x27;ve never experience any shedding or bleeding at all.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. It will probably replace my other powder brushes. It&#x27;s 8.99 and for what you get and the quality, it&#x27;s a complete steal. This isn&#x27;t much of a blush brush but more of a all over powder brush. I used it for blush and it gave a nice flush of color. I would probably only use this for my harsher blushes where I need a lighter touch. The shape  is pointed so it gives a lot of control if you wanted to use as a blush brush. Personally I wouldn&#x27;t use it for blush unless I was in a rush but it would get the job done. It&#x27;s an awesome powder brush though: the bristles are soft but firm and it feels really good on my face. It does not disturb the makeup on my face when I use it and it holds it&#x27;s shape after washing which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> The first thing I did when I got it was wash it. It shed a few strands but not a lot. The brush picks up blush/bronzer well. You only need to put product on the very tip and it applies so smoothly. I love this brush the quality and price are outstanding. I have washed several times and do not have an issue with shedding. If you want a quality brush at a great price then go for this.</li>
            <li> fantastic price for a very nice brush. Super soft bristles and very solid construction. Recommended to me by makeup artist. A must for everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved other brushes by Real Techniques, but, like other reviewers, I find this brush too big for blush application.  It takes a lot of work to get the blush placement just right with this brush.  I do have a narrow face, so maybe if you had a rounder face this would work better.  But it&#x27;s just not easy to use for me.</li>
            <li> Great fluffy brush for blush or even powdering the face or bronzing. It diffuses the product nicely. Love RT brushes!!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for great quality brushes that are inexpensive, than these are definitely the brushes to get. I&#x27;m a huge fan of Samantha Chapman and these brushes are definitely my favorite brushes to use. Highly, highly recommend. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting this particular real Techniques brush since I saw it in my local &amp;#34;big box&amp;#34; store. It is MUCH cheaper here online and I could also purchase other brushes to complete my real Techniques collection. This feels whisper soft on your face and easily applies product to your face and allows you to blend it without much effort. I would repurchase this. Great deal.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly as it said on the description. A good price. Brand new. It came on time. Really love it!</li>
            <li> Great brush.  So happy about this brush because of the price and the quality is so good.  I will definitely purchase a lot of real technique brushes.</li>
            <li> To complete the set purchased this brush as a Christmas gift for my daughter and overall she was very pleased with all the brushes.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product and it is soooo soft, but the shape really confuses me. I am not really sure where i put the product and it&#x27;s just confusing! It may be only me. But i still use it, and i washed it and it was still amazingly perfect and soft after.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price.  This is an upgrade to the brushes I was using.  This is soft, easy to use, durable.</li>
            <li> I have given this product that is liked her a lot of to my wife, she says that it is of great quality even if the price is contained, You consignment has been in the norm it approves the distance received in Italy in perfect way. You excuse my English.</li>
            <li> I purchased this entire brush line because I adore the Pixiwoo sisters and wanted to try Sam&#x27;s signature brush line. I really like this brush! The tapered end makes it easy to define the contour of the cheekbone as well as apply blush to the apples of the cheeks. It is very soft and the product goes on smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> love at first sight :)</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a blush brush, but find myself using it more as a powder brush.  Good quality, LOVE real techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> I was a huge Mac and sigma fan until I tried real technique. The brushes themselves are so cute and playful but use is great as well</li>
            <li> The Real technique brushes are genius! I am very satisfied! Soft, easy to use and great product application! Handles are shorter than my regular brushes but nothing I can&#x27;t get use to, it actually may allow me to have more control of the application.</li>
            <li> This brush is beautifully designed, high quality soft and smooth bristles allow perfect application of powder products.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just added it to my professional kit... I love it!</li>
            <li> I love Real Techniques brushes and this one is no exception. However, I don&#x27;t use this brush for blush. It is too big and fluffy. I use it as an all over powder brush. I absolutely love it. It is affordable, attractive, amazingly soft and cruelty free. Great product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s Beautiful and very practical, I like it so much, I would recommend to all buy this stuff, you Will not regret.</li>
            <li> Just got the brush! Great arrival, right on time. To be honest though, I was expecting this brush to be way more soft. I have other brushes such as Shany brushes that are softer than this. Yet I am in love with this brush and it is still pretty soft. For the quality and the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Love this I already have one and I use it at for my highlighter now I have one for my blush and might get another for bronzer 😍</li>
            <li> This is very soft brush but huge for a blush on brush. For me, the brush is better to be use as a powder brush but i&#x27;s say buying this is waste of money. They could have made it average size to be of use like the buffing brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it is the perfect size, not too big and not too small.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, multitasker, use it every day.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really soft, I got this one in the mail today and was not disappointed in anyway when I put on my blush, makes it look so smooth and blended!</li>
            <li> I love ALL my real technique brushes. They pick up the product and transfer it well to the applied area. My biggest pet peeve with brushes are the ones that either don&#x27;t pick up the product or the ones that pick it up, but you go to apply it to your face all the product stays, for lack of a better word, trapped in the brush. Great for blending-soft and gentle on the skin. Easy to clean-- I use E.L.F&#x27;s daily brush cleaner ($3 on their website or at walmart or target), and then about once a week I will use Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo or Johnson&#x27;s head-to-toe wash (also for babies) to give my brushes a deeper cleaner. I let them dry overnight and then they are good as new. &#x3D;) very happy with my purchase --Amazing brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> Super Fast shipping!! Very soft and dense for the price! Great for blush application. I am  Very Happy with this brush</li>
            <li> It is a good brush - soft and nice quality.  However, I do not recommend it for applying blush.  It is way to big for that!!!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing! I&#x27;ve never had one pick up product so effortlessly and evenly! I like it just fine for blush, but I can see this being fantastic for bronzer. It&#x27;s so soft and it makes me happy to see this in the morning! I&#x27;m slowly adding the real Techniques brushes and I have been blown away by the quality for price for each of them.</li>
            <li> I first purchased a powder brush and a small brush when it was on sale at a local beauty shop. Because I must have tried at least 15 different make-up brushes (inexpensive to very expensive), I didn&#x27;t have much expectations for this one. In all honesty, this is the best make-up brush I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve paid literally ten times more for a brush like this with similar results, but this one is truly the best. Of course, the affordable price is definitely a plus. It&#x27;s soft and doesn&#x27;t have any fall outs.</li>
            <li> I always apply blush worse, this brush provide light application via fluffy hair. But it can&#x27;t contain its shape.. So, I&#x27;m not sure about this brush.. But it&#x27;s required for everyone..</li>
            <li> These are my favorite brushes!  I never really understood how people could LOVE brushes but now I do - they stay firm and no bristles left on my face!  LOVE</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by several friends and it really is great. Brushes are nice and light and pick up make up very well..Price is great too!</li>
            <li> I adore this brush. It is beautifully made, with very soft, perfectly trimmed synthetic bristles. It can be used with wet and dry blush, or powder. The shape is great. It retains its shape perfectly after washing, and dries quicker than my other brushes. The price is very reasonable. I have some brushes that cost 3 times as much and have inferior quality.</li>
            <li> My daughter love this item and the rest that was purchase, now this is the only thing she wants from now on.</li>
            <li> Perfect blush brush I&#x27;ve ever seen.. It&#x27;s simple to apply blush flawless to your face! I love Real Techniques Blush Brush...</li>
            <li> As expected one of the good quality real technique blush brush. I alreasy have powder brush, should have gotten setting brush as well.</li>
            <li> its really good my sister bought it and she loved it its so soft and i like to play with it to</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers this brush is too big to be a blush brush, but it works great as a bronzing brush or setting brush.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of rewiews of many brushes before buy this one. I am very happy with my choice. Is soft and works great! Love it and thinking to buy another one</li>
            <li> Love it for my translucent powder. Soft and plush.</li>
            <li> definitely would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very soft brush i use it for loose powder little big for blush</li>
            <li> Some reviewers on here say this is too big to be a blush brush...it is quite large but the tip is very thin and really isnt that wide.  it looks wider than it really is.</li>
            <li> Vey good products, easy to use</li>
            <li> great brush altogether!  it applies product well, very smooth and clean finish. this brush also cleans well when washed doesn&#x27;t break up or anything!</li>
            <li> Another great brush from Real Techniques. I use this for setting powder as it is pretty large for blush. Good quality with no shedding. Easy to clean and dries quickly because of the synthetic bristles.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Its so soft! Best brush I own!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing and great price! I have almost the whole set and they work really well with powder or cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and fluffy and just the right size. At first a few not so good reviews dissuaded me but don&#x27;t let them! The fluffiness is perfect. You don&#x27;t want a dense brush for blush. This allows for light application but you can build it up which is perfect. It makes it more fool-proof. The size is perfect and the slight pointedness is great for contouring. I think the people who don&#x27;t like it just don&#x27;t know how to apply makeup. Sorry haha just saying. I think most people will be very happy with this brush. It&#x27;s very nice. :)</li>
            <li> love the volume of this brush for a good powder finishing touch</li>
            <li> The brush (already purchased others) are the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m on a budget and as they say, you get what you pay for.  However, this collection you receive so much more!  I recommend anyone that wants a durable, soft and quality brush to purchase the entire collection.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Thanx again. mmdz28</li>
            <li> When you take this brush out of the package, the first thing that will strike you is how SOFT the brush is. It is very, very soft . . . . especially considering it&#x27;s a synthetic brush. It would be better to use the stippling brush to concentrate color in an area, this splays out too much to do contouring on areas like your nose. But, it will give you a nice blend on the perimeter of your face or on your cheeks.</li>
            <li> OBSESSED with Real Techniques brushes!!! AMAZING! I love the way they feel on my face! Fav of all time for sure!</li>
            <li> I really really love this brush. its performance over my expectation</li>
            <li> I love this brush!! doesn&#x27;t deposit to o much on the cheeks...and is  breeze to use!</li>
            <li> Nice brush, seen at ULTA for more.</li>
            <li> Soft and gentle brush .</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much! It is perfect. It is the perfect size, it picks up color very well, and doesn&#x27;t puff blush all over my face. And it is so soft! I have been nothing but impressed with all of the Real Techniques brushes I have purchased.</li>
            <li> i feel in love :))) tender, soft, very comfortable. I will be using it for powder.</li>
            <li> Pretty good brush for the price. Extremely soft but I wished the bristles were denser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best thing about this brush is the versatility. I use this for powdering, blushing, and highlighting applications. The bristles are tapered which is unlike any other blush brush I own. Now that I&#x27;m a little older, my blush/highlighter placement is more precise, contoured, and subtle. And for a more natural to dewy foundation look, precision powdering down the T-zone and under eyes is easy with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush also delivers the right amount of product, is just dense enough to blend into an airbrushed finish (but I wish it was denser), and the taper can place product with precision.</li>
            <li> I love real technique brushes. This is just another gem in my collection.</li>
            <li> Love all my real techniques brushes. They are so soft and versatile! This one is a great blush brush!</li>
            <li> It is more soft than i expected. LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Best one ever. The only blush brush I use now. I can even contour with it. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Does exactly what it&#x27;s suppost to do.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite brushes ! Very easy to blend with so I never look like I have clown cheeks</li>
            <li> I use this brush mainly for putting on my powder to set my foundation.  I love it&#x27;s shape for doing powder application.  It is a blush brush but... ya know.  Washes very well and has a great handle.  Highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good for using it with blush and powder ,I recommend it.</li>
            <li> So soft I love RT brushes!!</li>
            <li> I have a number of these brushes and so far I am pleased with the brand. However, the 2nd time I washed this brush the entire bulb slid out of the holder and started shedding! I am not aggressive when I clean my brushes and didn&#x27;t run the water straight into (held it pointing down under running water like you&#x27;re supposed to.) I was shocked it just popped out! I dont even use it that often.</li>
            <li> This gives you such a flawless look. You dont need to use too much product either. Love it so much, that I&#x27;m going to buy another.</li>
            <li> the brush is nice and soft. It would be better if it would come with a case or if I could order a case for it as well...</li>
            <li> I give 5 start cause it works for me.. definitely better than the elf brushes I was using.. I rather save the bucks and put it toward this brushes.I will definitely be buying another pack of this soon for extra brushes.</li>
            <li> poor quality，handle position have many&lt;br /&gt;scratch，the printed character of logo on the handle is overlap，feel disappointed</li>
            <li> I love every one of these brushes and I have almost all of them! They clean up great and are so easy to use!</li>
            <li> These brushes are always my fave. They are so reasonable and work better than some of my sigma brushes. You wont regret buying any of these brushes.</li>
            <li> Loved it!! I literally use it for everything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty positive this brush is a fake. I purchased a few brushes from &#x27;Paris Presents Incorporated&#x27; and they are all poorly made. The bristles are unevenly cut and the writing is off center. A few of them even had some mysterious liquid on the bristles causing them to be clumped when I received them...which I thought would resolve when washed a few times (maybe it was a protective coating?) but no, the bristles feel greasy, are hard to clean and do not go back into the shape they should be. Pretty upset.</li>
            <li> This blush brush is great. They even have a link to a how to video. Very helpful. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I use this for bronzer instead of blush, and I love it. I am a Sigma girl, so I was a little reluctant in trying this one because it&#x27;s so much cheaper I thought it would have poor quality, but it doesn&#x27;t! It&#x27;s amazing, even after washing it, it doesn&#x27;t lose quality!</li>
            <li> My favorite blush brush!</li>
            <li> Apear de macio, achei grande para blush, penso que acabarei usando para p&amp;oacute; mesmo. O cabo tamb&amp;eacute;m &amp;eacute; muito espaçoso.</li>
            <li> I am used to a bigger blush brush and I usually spend ALOT more on Mac brushes and this one is just as good!</li>
            <li> Great brush, I love it, great for blush, very soft.</li>
            <li> This brush is very large which makes it difficult to apply blush only where you want it.  I ordered it because reviews said it did not shed, also it is called a &amp;#34;blush brush&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s too large to be a blush brush and I wouldn&#x27;t know about the shedding, because after using it twice and being dissatisfied with the lack of control it gives, due to it&#x27;s large size, I tucked it away.  Maybe I will find a use for it someday, but for now, I&#x27;m not using it at all and cannot recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Had my eye on this brush for a little while now (people seem to love the Real Techniques brushes), so I finally bought it. It&#x27;s a nice little brush; it&#x27;s soft, has a nice shape and density and can be a nice little multitasking brush. I&#x27;ve used it for blush, contour, highlight, etc. and it applies and blends beautifully. The only problem I can see having with this brush is not being able to store it well in a brush holder since the base is so wide... But that could be a pro since it is capable of standing on its own, so I suppose that&#x27;s just personal preference. The bottom line is that I love this brush and plan on purchasing more brushes from Real Techniques soon.</li>
            <li> This is the softest brush! I find it too large for blush but it is excellent for bronzing. I use it to bronze my forehead, cheeks and down my neck. It washes great and does not shed. I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> Good blush brush. The tapered design helps apply blush where you want it. Wish it was a bit softer though, mine feels a bit scratchy on the skin.</li>
            <li> Too fluffy and really dont&#x27; like the shape. It is soft and doesn&#x27;t waste too much product but really needs different shape.</li>
            <li> This is more a powder brush I think the blush brush should be more sturdy</li>
            <li> Thank you , its graet</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Real Techniques brush. Like many others have said, it may be a little bit large to be used for blush, although I&#x27;ve used it that way in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as my primary powder brush for setting my foundation or finishing powder and even bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tapered shape is not different from the shape of many higher end powder brushes, and it fits really well on different areas of the face. The side of the brush is quite functional as well if you want to sweep powder over a larger area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice and fluffy and the synthetic bristles are soft, which makes it an ideal brush for blending. I often contour on top of my foundation with a bronzer or contour powder, then I use setting powder or foundation powder to set the other areas of my face and to blend my contour out. It&#x27;s not too fluffy or too dense</li>
            <li> I have been loving this brush, I use it every day now.  It&#x27;s a good shape and texture so I can use it for powder, blush and bronzer.</li>
            <li> I bought this blush brush at Ulta.  I actually have a few blush brushes, but I really wanted to try this one because I&#x27;ve enjoyed all of the real techniques brushes I have bought.  Initially I thought I would use it for bronzer due to the large size.  However, I especially like the Real Techniques Brush for highly pigmented blushes (e.g., my Lancome Blush Subtil blushes, my Tarte Amazonian Clay blushes) because it helps you control the amount of color you apply to your cheeks.  It picks up color really well so it goes on evenly.  For many blushes, one swipe is all it takes.  I swipe one side of this brush on the blusher, then I swipe it along my cheekbone.  If I want a touch more color, I repeat, so it is easy to build the color to get exactly the intensity that you want.  Then I use the end to blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a smaller, denser blush brush (Smashbox Brand) that I like to use as well, but that one really is better suited to lighter, less pigmented brushes that don&#x27;t show up easily on my cheeks.  With darker, more pigmented blushes, a dense brush tends to apply too much blush, so I need another brush (the EcoTools blush brush) to blend it out.  I also have a Mac 168 (the large angled brush), but the Real Techniques blush brush gives a more natural application and is just as soft.  The Mac 168 is better for contouring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this blush brush.  Don&#x27;t let the large size fool you.  This brush is used differently than a denser brush.  As I stated, you swipe the SIDE on the blusher then swipe the SIDE across your cheekbones.</li>
            <li> This brush was the softest of all the ones I purchased (i bought all three sets, plus this extra). It felt fantastic on my skin and picked up product easily. I think my concerns are just that it isn&#x27;t as firm as I&#x27;m used to in a blush brush. It takes some building up to get a darker blush look, but in all honesty, that&#x27;s probably a good thing.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. I&#x27;ve washed it a few times and no shedding as of yet.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful brush. I would buy it over and over again.</li>

            <li> Perfect blush brush! I am a huge real Techniques fan and use them in almost all my youtube makeup tutorials. You can&#x27;t beat the texture, quality and durability of these brushes for the price.  A++ brushes.</li>
            <li> This is a really good brush to do double-duty. I&#x27;ve used it for my blush and setting/finishing powder.  It is super soft and the best thing it doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> So soft and easy to handle to use.</li>

            <li> Great brush, worth every penny, thanks</li>
            <li> Works great. would buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hearing and reading a lot of great things about Real Techniques brushes.  I&#x27;ve tried the Eye brush set and the Angled Foundation brush, so I decided to try this one next.  I thought the shape of the brush was interesting, since most blush brushes I&#x27;ve seen are either flat or rounded.  At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it because it barely seemed to put any product on my face.  Then, I learned that I need to push the brush down more as I&#x27;m applying.  Its shape is actually perfect for applying product to the apple of the cheek.  It&#x27;s also great for anyone who has a tendancy to overdo their blush because it really allows you to build up to the amount of color you want.  I also love the length and shape of the handle.  It&#x27;s the longest blush brush I&#x27;ve ever had and it has a very solid weight to it. It just feels right in my hand.  I also like the rosy pink color.  It has a flat base, so you can stand it up on end but I don&#x27;t have the space to do that in my bathroom, at the moment, but it may be nice to do in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, along with the other R.T. brushes are very easy to clean and maintain.  I&#x27;m very pleased and look forward to trying more of their brushes.</li>
            <li> i orderd 2 of real Techniques Blush Brush&lt;br /&gt;but i got 1 real Techniques Blush Brush and 1 real Techniques stapiling Brush</li>
            <li> Love Real Techniques brushes for such great quality, value and perfect application! I own most of their brushes (obsessed with them) and use this particular one for contour my cheeks, forehead and neck.</li>
            <li> Okay, so honestly I was nervous when I first purchased this product. I had seen a lot of mixed reviews and didn&#x27;t know if I had made the right choice. That was until I got the brush in. Immediately I cleaned my brush, like you should every time you get a new brush, and then went to town with my make up. I am a drag queen, so the main part of our art is great brushes. Yes, this is a blush brush, but to me it&#x27;s just a little too big to get the looks that I go for. SO, I use this brush for my setting powders and translucent powders as well. It gives great coverage because of it&#x27;s size and it picks product up very well. It&#x27;s amazingly soft and has had very little shedding at all. So I definitely recommend this brush not only to my drag sisters, but to women that want a great line of brushes for great prices.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, well-made brush, just like all of the real techniques brushes are (at least that i have tried) but it is way too big to apply blush precisely. It&#x27;s nice for applying powder all over.</li>
            <li> The brush is so fluffy and stays like that after a wash. It is able to blend the product very well. I use this with my finishing powder not my blush.</li>
            <li> Love it. Good quality. Worth your money. I am happy woth the decision I made. I recommend the product for all cosmetic lovers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to spend more money than needed and am always looking for a great deal. These brushes sounded like a great deal so I went for it. I also bought the core collection. The blush brush was just a little nicer than the core collection brushes but honestly I couldn&#x27;t give it more than 2 stars. I have had a few brushes from Everyday Minerals for almost 5 years which are still softer, fuller, smoother and overall better than these real techniques brushes were the first day I opened them, and that is after using these everyday mineral brushes every day for over four years. Invest just a few Dollars more and get a couple quality brushes. Seriously, don&#x27;t waist your time here..</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I use it for bronzer and blush, and while I was skeptical at first, its shape is really perfect for these, because it really helps get the makeup right where you want it, while also blending it into your face so it is very natural looking.</li>
            <li> This blush brush is just amazing! I&#x27;m in love with the Real Techniques brand! All of their brushes work great! No complaints here!</li>
            <li> Another real techniques brush done right. This one is great for a sheer wash of color on the cheeks and can also be used to lightly dust various setting powders.</li>
            <li> The quality of the bristels is great. This brush is so soft and easy to use..&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely amazing !!!</li>
            <li> I love it! it does everything I want it to do and easy clean up. Even great for cream blushes</li>
