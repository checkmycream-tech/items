    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Makes my skin so happy!</li>
            <li>I use this because it was recommended as one of the best toners.</li>
            <li>this is a great staple.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>Great product for helping to control redness.</li>
            <li>This is amazing on my ruddy complexion!</li>
            <li>Wonderful moisturizer, my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>good over product but not as hydrating as i thought it&#x27;d be when i ordered it.</li>
            <li>I still need something to clean my capillaries from the surface, but this is GREAT stuff for the rest of my face!</li>
            <li>I have usually liked bioelements</li>
            <li>I love this toner.  </li>
            <li>The spray is more like a spritz sprayer</li>
            <li>I will keep buying until I find something better.</li>
            <li>love this stuff</li>
            <li>I will probably repurchase this product since it does not irritate my skin like most products do.</li>
            <li>The short ingredient list didn&#x27;t seem at all impressive</li>
            <li>I have notice my skin looking a lot more even</li>
            <li>Great product, gentle on skin</li>
            <li>I thought this sounded great for calming my irritated, sensitive face...</li>
            <li>I just wish this wasn&#x27;t so pricey since I go through toners quickly.  </li>
            <li>One bonus is that it dries quickly and you can immediately put on moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but this one was a great addition to my everyday routine.</li>
            <li>Recommended to me by a professional cosmetician who does facials for a top salon.</li>
            <li>but they have added enough of the anti-irritants to be effective.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that when I just use the cleanser and moisturizer, my face doesn&#x27;t feel as fresh.  </li>
            <li>Great toner, I have very sensitive skin and use certain acne products that will dry and irratate my skin from time to time.</li>
            <li>but everytime I used it the same result and my face started getting more and more irritated and red.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t use more than necessary to get the product on your face.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>when I run out.doing something, I just have no idea if that something is actually cleaning my face more.</li>
            <li>It certainly had a calming effect on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It is intended to calm sensitive or reactive skin (which I have).</li>
            <li>Thanks to my facialist</li>
            <li>I really noticed a reduction in the redness in my face.</li>
            <li>I use with bio elements stress solution and absolute moisture.</li>
            <li>This toner is very calming and hydrating to the skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought this based on reviews by Paulas choice and used it all winter in chicago, where we spent most of the time In a snowstorm or in subzero temps.</li>
            <li>but really didn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li>Wash with clean and clear sensitive skin cleanser,</li>
            <li>My esthecian says less is more in terms of beauty routines and after taking her up on the advice I have to agree.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relatively inexpensive and I can feel it doing something, I just have no idea if that something is actually cleaning my face more.</li>
            <li>I gave it a few more days</li>
            <li>this spray does reduce the redness in my face, however it is not a miracle product that removes all of the redness and it does take a few minutes to remove some to most of the redness.</li>
            <li>and before I put on the other products I use to reduce fine lines and moisturize.</li>
            <li>fast service - product hasn&#x27;t knocked my socks off - feels like spritzing water, can&#x27;t tell if it is a benefit or not since I have recently changed my whole skincare routine</li>
            <li>I do have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I see the red go away FAST!</li>
            <li>If you, like me, have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It also works well for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and there is a natural glow.</li>
            <li>I also like how I can just spray it directly onto my face.</li>
            <li>Spritz it on and instantly clear the red out!</li>
            <li>Bioelements Calmitude is supposed to induce a natural barrier for your skin from every day exposure and it definitely does the trick!</li>
            <li>But it does leave my skin much calmer and less sensitized.</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not consistent enough to actually rate this product as far as if it does anything but can give you impressions of it when I do use it.  </li>
            <li> I Search the maturity for a long.</li>
            <li> so I kinda stopped caring about my face during that time period and never really picked back</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a clear liquid as you might be used to with some other toners.</li>
            <li> I have also had a big reduction in little zits from irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this along with several other products, so it&#x27;s hard to say specifically how this has or has not improved my skin; however, I can say that it has not irritated my skin, doesn&#x27;t sting, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry after application.</li>
            <li> After using this my face felt tight and dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see myself trying any other toners for some time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect this to work if you continue to use other products with known irritants (fragrance, fragrant &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; plant oils, menthol, alcohol, etc).</li>
            <li> the lazy, Ross recommends to do the following twice a day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t burn, turn my skin red, or have any other negative side effects that I can tell.  </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not sure if that alone justifies another purchase when I run out (this stuff lasts a long time, I use 4 sprays each time, and have yet to make a noticeable change to the level of the product in the bottle).  </li>
            <li> (although I&#x27;d have preferred a less heavy plastic bottle) but one needs to be careful to avoid spraying into eyes.  </li>
            <li> It does what toner should do, it calms down your skin and helps it prepare for the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry and extremely sensitive reactive skin and find it very very difficult to find products that my skin doesn&#x27;t react adversely to.</li>
            <li> Usually, I stay away from toners because I feel like they&#x27;re an unnecessary step in a daily skin care regimen</li>
            <li> My prior girlfriend linked me to &amp;#34;MensSkinCareWithRoss&amp;#34; on youtube and basically constantly complained about how poorly I treat my skin.</li>
            <li> Those using this for a moisture boost (clearly not what the product was intended for) will be disappointed but those with sensitive oily skin will rejoice as this does not leave any shine or add to excess oil.</li>
            <li> I usually wake up, wash my face and then spritz this on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to keep my eye on Bioelements to see if they get rid of some of their poor products and replace them with superstars like this!</li>
            <li> But again, I am a lazy, lazy man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I order it on amazon.com because it&#x27;s less expensive than other web stores</li>
            <li> This will not make my skin worse nor will it burn if I&#x27;m having a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This has a thin milky appearance, which I suppose helps with moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Product arrived broken, and I was unable to try it.</li>
            <li> It can get uncomfortable if I don&#x27;t use a moisturizer afterward.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasingly shocked that this worked as stated.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have ordered this product twice in the last eight months. I initially found out about the product through Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s \\&quot;go to woman\\&quot; for skin care products (you will find her reviews on oprah.com). It is intended to calm sensitive or reactive skin (which I have). I use this product in the evening after I cleanse my face and before I put on the other products I use to reduce fine lines and moisturize. I order it on amazon.com because it&#x27;s less expensive than other web stores and I cannot locate the product in our local drug or department stores.</li>
            <li> fast service - product hasn&#x27;t knocked my socks off - feels like spritzing water, can&#x27;t tell if it is a benefit or not since I have recently changed my whole skincare routine</li>
            <li> If you, like me, have sensitive skin this is a great staple. My esthecian says less is more in terms of beauty routines and after taking her up on the advice I have to agree. It does what toner should do, it calms down your skin and helps it prepare for the moisturizer. I use it with bioelements &amp;#34;stress solution&amp;#34; serum and &amp;#34;beyond hydration&amp;#34; moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so happy!</li>
            <li> Spritz it on and instantly clear the red out! I usually wake up, wash my face and then spritz this on. I see the red go away FAST! Then I use the lotion of the same brand to keep it away! This is amazing on my ruddy complexion! I still need something to clean my capillaries from the surface, but this is GREAT stuff for the rest of my face!</li>
            <li> I do have very sensitive skin. I thought this sounded great for calming my irritated, sensitive face...but it did none of this. After using this my face felt tight and dry. I gave it a few more days but everytime I used it the same result and my face started getting more and more irritated and red. It also left a residue on the skin. Personally for my skin, this was def a no go.</li>
            <li> good over product but not as hydrating as i thought it&#x27;d be when i ordered it. its works well under sunscreen</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizer, my skin has never looked better.  Recommended to me by a professional cosmetician who does facials for a top salon.</li>
            <li> please tell me the maturity,maybe I will change my evaluation.I Search the maturity for a long.I had no choice to give one star.</li>
            <li> I love this toner.  The spray is more like a spritz sprayer so it doesn&#x27;t use more than necessary to get the product on your face.  It also works well for my sensitive skin.  I just wish this wasn&#x27;t so pricey since I go through toners quickly.  I will keep buying until I find something better.</li>
            <li> Calms skin after cleansing face.</li>
            <li> Great toner, I have very sensitive skin and use certain acne products that will dry and irratate my skin from time to time. This will not make my skin worse nor will it burn if I&#x27;m having a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; skin day so it&#x27;s great knowing I can use this all the time. Thanks to my facialist I don&#x27;t see myself trying any other toners for some time.</li>
            <li> love this stuff and it came in the mail quickly.will buy it again. cant find it in the stores so i have to find it online</li>
            <li> I really noticed a reduction in the redness in my face. I have extremely dry and extremely sensitive reactive skin and find it very very difficult to find products that my skin doesn&#x27;t react adversely to. I have a very red face that turns tomato red this spray does reduce the redness in my face, however it is not a miracle product that removes all of the redness and it does take a few minutes to remove some to most of the redness. But it does leave my skin much calmer and less sensitized. I had to deduct a star from my rating because it is not a hydrating as I thought it would be. I just decided that I will supplement a serum to my skin care routine to make up the moisture difference that I need. I will probably repurchase this product since it does not irritate my skin like most products do.</li>
            <li> I was pleasingly shocked that this worked as stated.  It certainly had a calming effect on my skin.  The short ingredient list didn&#x27;t seem at all impressive but they have added enough of the anti-irritants to be effective.  But please keep in mind there is no one product or ingredient that will &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; skin redness (especially if it&#x27;s moderate to severe rosacea).  Those using this for a moisture boost (clearly not what the product was intended for) will be disappointed but those with sensitive oily skin will rejoice as this does not leave any shine or add to excess oil. I like the spray bottle packaging (although I&#x27;d have preferred a less heavy plastic bottle) but one needs to be careful to avoid spraying into eyes.  I&#x27;m definitely going to keep my eye on Bioelements to see if they get rid of some of their poor products and replace them with superstars like this! Side Note: Don&#x27;t expect this to work if you continue to use other products with known irritants (fragrance, fragrant &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; plant oils, menthol, alcohol, etc).</li>
            <li> Great product for helping to control redness. I use with bio elements stress solution and absolute moisture. Helps control my roscesea</li>
            <li> Usually, I stay away from toners because I feel like they&#x27;re an unnecessary step in a daily skin care regimen but this one was a great addition to my everyday routine. I have notice my skin looking a lot more even and there is a natural glow. One bonus is that it dries quickly and you can immediately put on moisturizer. I have also had a big reduction in little zits from irritation. Bioelements Calmitude is supposed to induce a natural barrier for your skin from every day exposure and it definitely does the trick!</li>
            <li> This toner is very calming and hydrating to the skin.  I also like how I can just spray it directly onto my face.</li>
            <li> Great product, gentle on skin</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews by Paulas choice and used it all winter in chicago, where we spent most of the time In a snowstorm or in subzero temps. It didn&#x27;t seem to have any effect on my skin and stung my eyes. I have usually liked bioelements but this product I just didn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Product arrived broken, and I was unable to try it. This is not available in my area, and I was really looking forward to trying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this along with several other products, so it&#x27;s hard to say specifically how this has or has not improved my skin; however, I can say that it has not irritated my skin, doesn&#x27;t sting, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry after application. I use this because it was recommended as one of the best toners. Is it hydrating? I would not say that after using just this I would skip a separate moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the application...I don&#x27;t care for the spray cap, which is why I gave this 4 stars. I suppose spraying your face with this in the morning after washing is beneficial, but if you are using this as a toner after washing makeup off your face, you&#x27;re going to want to use a cotton ball or cloth to ensure all of your makeup is off. Spraying this onto a cotton ball or onto your face winds up wasting a lot of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A trivial note about the liquid...it&#x27;s not a clear liquid as you might be used to with some other toners. This has a thin milky appearance, which I suppose helps with moisturizing.</li>
            <li> So I just started taking care of my face.  My prior girlfriend linked me to &amp;#34;MensSkinCareWithRoss&amp;#34; on youtube and basically constantly complained about how poorly I treat my skin. I used to box so I kinda stopped caring about my face during that time period and never really picked back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the lazy, Ross recommends to do the following twice a day.  Wash with clean and clear sensitive skin cleanser, use the product I am reviewing, then a moisturizer.  One with sunscreen during the day and one without at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do the sunscreen every day (lost of skin cancer in my family) but really didn&#x27;t do much else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not consistent enough to actually rate this product as far as if it does anything but can give you impressions of it when I do use it.  I haven&#x27;t noticed my pores getting smaller or anything, but I do feel my face &amp;#34;tighten&amp;#34; when I use this.  It can get uncomfortable if I don&#x27;t use a moisturizer afterward.  I assume that the &amp;#34;tightness&amp;#34; is do to it removing oil, and I have noticed that the occasional pimple I used to get on my face is a thing of the past (when I&#x27;m consistent).  So I guess it works as far as I expected it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t burn, turn my skin red, or have any other negative side effects that I can tell.  I noticed that when I just use the cleanser and moisturizer, my face doesn&#x27;t feel as fresh.  Although I&#x27;m not sure if that alone justifies another purchase when I run out (this stuff lasts a long time, I use 4 sprays each time, and have yet to make a noticeable change to the level of the product in the bottle).  And yes, I know you&#x27;re supposed to put it on a cotton ball and apply in circular or &amp;#34;up&amp;#34; motions.  But again, I am a lazy, lazy man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the big question, does it do anything noticeable?  I have no idea, and the girl and I broke up a while ago so it shall forever remain a mystery.  Do I regret my purchase? No.  It&#x27;s relatively inexpensive and I can feel it doing something, I just have no idea if that something is actually cleaning my face more. That being said: I&#x27;ll probably purchase this again when I run out.doing something, I just have no idea if that something is actually cleaning my face more. That being said: I&#x27;ll probably purchase this again when I run out.</li>
