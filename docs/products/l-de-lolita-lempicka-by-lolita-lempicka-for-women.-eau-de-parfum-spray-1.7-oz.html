            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>This is absolutely my favorite perfume!</li>
            <li>I must admit I didn&#x27;t really love the comment, but then I saw he said it in a good way</li>
            <li>This is a beautifully bottled perfume and I liked the fragrance when I first sprayed it on me, but as time went on wearing it, the chemistry in my skin changed to the point that it became too strong for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My favorite and my boyfriends too (on me that is):} Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>The bottle is a stunning piece of art that compliments my fragrance collection.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores, and I love the scent.</li>
            <li>Once I finally ran out of this WONDERFUL scent, I searched it out and found it here on Amazon...</li>
            <li>I love the bottle, which reminds me of the sea, but what is inside, is what my Grand Daughters LOVE..</li>
            <li>Cannot wait for my Hubby to smell this  again, as I know he will LOVE it..</li>
            <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll love this scent</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t describe it much more than that</li>
            <li>Love this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;People</li>
            <li>I own the original Lolita Lampicka fragrance as well as this one, both in spray bottles.  </li>
            <li>There are so many layers in this perfume, but the notes compliment each other beautifully!  </li>
            <li>I just know it is one that I would probably repurchase because it smells good and is reasonably priced</li>
            <li>one of my favorite fragrances, when I first saw it I fell in love with the bottle, but when I first used I felt so good.</li>
            <li>I love how they smell on me, but I must say the original fragrance has longer staying power than this scent.  </li>
            <li>Longevity is really good so far.. sprayed on mid-day yesterday and can still smell it on me today.</li>
            <li>This one is light and smells ever so powdery on me at first, but then calms down into a delightful more flowery scent.  </li>
            <li>Any of you Vanilla , Licorice lovers out there, this is worth a try..and the bottle size, is so worth the price as it is a pretty good size...</li>
            <li>Love it, but it can be overwhelming if you overspray; needs a gentle touch and one needs to know exactly where the aerosol hole is!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted but at a much better price than the department store.</li>
            <li>It is a light, sweet yummy perfume.</li>
            <li>One certainly worth trying if you&#x27;re exploring gourmands!</li>
            <li>They offered a refund of $8.00 to remove my feedback and offered a full refund until I told them that I don not have the original box.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned because of other reviews that stated that the product was old and didn&#x27;t smell right, but I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
            <li>I have a feeling the sillage will be just right.</li>
            <li>Wear this when I go to bed after my shower and put it on first thing in the morning..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Pink Sugar for years now and have been looking for another perfume that&#x27;s more exotic, sensual and adult.</li>
            <li>LOVED it, the smaller bottle lasted me almost 3 yrs, but then again, I love wearing different scents, so that was the reason it lasted as long as it did..</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fresh when first sprayed and it dries down to a soft, warm summer note</li>
            <li>Look carefully for the hole in the top of the spout.</li>
            <li>Came in a reasonable amount of time, too.</li>
            <li>This is not the real manufacturers Parfum spray.</li>
            <li>This scent does not last like my original.  </li>
            <li>From top note, mid note, to base note, it&#x27;s so beautiful!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet, yet spicy at the same time!  </li>
            <li>I bought from amazon, and it came brand new, sealed in box!  </li>
            <li>I would say it is more like a white flower of some sort with an occasional whiff of cinnamon that comes across my path.  </li>
            <li>Bought the bigger bottle this time, and I am so glad to have this scent back in my collection..</li>
            <li>This is a grown up scent, without being old lady-ish!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even smell it after a half hour where my original lasted all day.  </li>
            <li>I have all ready left feedback for this seller (that I can not find).  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to those who don&#x27;t like perfume that is too sweet a little musky with a hint of vanilla.</li>
            <li>It is not sharp aquatic at all.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE</li>
            <li>love the bottle and will use it for show with a few other&#x27;s on display.</li>
            <li>and then you get a little fresh whiff at the beginning.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was a scent that I heard about and read several reviews on before I decided to purchase from Amazon.  I tend to gravitate toward the gourmand type fumes and this is not as gourmand as I usually choose.  This is a hard one to describe.  It is not entirely a sweet fragrance.  I would say it is more like a white flower of some sort with an occasional whiff of cinnamon that comes across my path.  It is definitely not cloying or overpowering with 2 sprays.  It lasts all day, and is something that I can smell on and off on myself throughout the day.  I have never smelled it on another person so I don&#x27;t know about projection.  I just know it is one that I would probably repurchase because it smells good and is reasonably priced</li>
            <li> This is a beautifully bottled perfume and I liked the fragrance when I first sprayed it on me, but as time went on wearing it, the chemistry in my skin changed to the point that it became too strong for me.&lt;br /&gt;I love the bottle and will use it for show with a few other&#x27;s on display.</li>
            <li> it arrived quickly and i am completly thrilled with my lolita lempicka perfume!! the bottle is beautiful and the scent incredible!!</li>
            <li> I received my perfume in a timely fashion. It was exactly what I wanted but at a much better price than the department store. Look carefully for the hole in the top of the spout. It is hard to see but when you get use to it, it&#x27;s no problem. It is a light, sweet yummy perfume. My favorite and my boyfriends too (on me that is):} Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I bought from amazon, and it came brand new, sealed in box!  This is a grown up scent, without being old lady-ish!  There are so many layers in this perfume, but the notes compliment each other beautifully!  From top note, mid note, to base note, it&#x27;s so beautiful!  It&#x27;s sweet, yet spicy at the same time!  Definitely Oriental woodsy!  You can definitely smell the scent of incense mixed with vanilla in this one!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these bottles of perfume as Christmas gifts. One of the bottles sprayer does not work. I found this out after giving the gift,didn&#x27;t realize that I had to test it before hand.I sent an email to amazon and to the distibutor, but heard nothing from either party.Maybe this will not fall upon deaf ears, hopefully!!</li>
            <li> one of my favorite fragrances, when I first saw it I fell in love with the bottle, but when I first used I felt so good. My husband told me I smelled like the best desert ever. I must admit I didn&#x27;t really love the comment, but then I saw he said it in a good way cause he was trying to sniff my neck all the time and even asked me what perfume I was wearing. (he&#x27;s the kind of tough man who never cares about your perfume or clothes!!!) It makes men crave for it!!!</li>
            <li> Product arrived in orginal box and great condition. There was some confusion with shipment but it all worked out.</li>
            <li> Love this scent! This is a great price too. I would recommend this to those who don&#x27;t like perfume that is too sweet a little musky with a hint of vanilla. Fabulous!</li>
            <li> I own the original Lolita Lampicka fragrance as well as this one, both in spray bottles.  I love how they smell on me, but I must say the original fragrance has longer staying power than this scent.  This one is light and smells ever so powdery on me at first, but then calms down into a delightful more flowery scent.  It&#x27;s great for summer.  But again, the scent just seems to wither away into nothing the longer it stays on me.  The bottle is a stunning piece of art that compliments my fragrance collection.</li>
            <li> This bottle is a work of art.  The fragrance is fresh when first sprayed and it dries down to a soft, warm summer note and then you get a little fresh whiff at the beginning.  It is not sharp aquatic at all.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE keep this price down so I can buy again</li>
            <li> I was concerned because of other reviews that stated that the product was old and didn&#x27;t smell right, but I&#x27;m very happy with this. I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores, and I love the scent. Came in a reasonable amount of time, too.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. Just a dab lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li> Love! This is absolutely my favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> Love it, but it can be overwhelming if you overspray; needs a gentle touch and one needs to know exactly where the aerosol hole is!</li>
            <li> Saw this perfume yrs ago and bought it..LOVED it, the smaller bottle lasted me almost 3 yrs, but then again, I love wearing different scents, so that was the reason it lasted as long as it did..Once I finally ran out of this WONDERFUL scent, I searched it out and found it here on Amazon...Bought the bigger bottle this time, and I am so glad to have this scent back in my collection..I love the bottle, which reminds me of the sea, but what is inside, is what my Grand Daughters LOVE..every time I have it on, they tell me how GREAT I smell..Tonight while putting both of them to bed, Our oldest Granddaughter, pulled me to her, holding me close, just to smell this wonderful intoxicating scent...Cannot wait for my Hubby to smell this  again, as I know he will LOVE it..Wish they made a Body cream in this scent...Any of you Vanilla , Licorice lovers out there, this is worth a try..and the bottle size, is so worth the price as it is a pretty good size...Wear this when I go to bed after my shower and put it on first thing in the morning..Today, our Granddaughter told me she smelled me this morning before she got up.... she said, she knew I was awake before she got out of bed..That is a Good thing..Try it, you&#x27;ll love this scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pink Sugar for years now and have been looking for another perfume that&#x27;s more exotic, sensual and adult. L is gorgeous and is what I&#x27;ve been lookign for. I think the tonka and immortelle stand out to me. I can&#x27;t describe it much more than that, other than I knew the same day it arrived that it was the one. Longevity is really good so far.. sprayed on mid-day yesterday and can still smell it on me today. Sillage I don&#x27;t know yet, as I haven&#x27;t worn it out anywhere, bbut I have a feeling the sillage will be just right. One certainly worth trying if you&#x27;re exploring gourmands! I paid $35 including shipping, which I think was a fair deal. Get this stuff while there&#x27;s any left.. it&#x27;s been discontinued!</li>
            <li> Knock off item - This scent does not last like my original.  I can&#x27;t even smell it after a half hour where my original lasted all day.  I have all ready left feedback for this seller (that I can not find).  The seller has called three times asking to remove my feedback.  They offered a refund of $8.00 to remove my feedback and offered a full refund until I told them that I don not have the original box.  I don&#x27;t care, either way - I will not purchase from seller again. This is not the real manufacturers Parfum spray.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;People always&lt;br /&gt;Ask me what I am&lt;br /&gt;wearing.</li>
