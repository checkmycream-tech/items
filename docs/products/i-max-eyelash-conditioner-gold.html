            <li>This is great!</li>
            <li>My wife is very happy with the results that we are going to buy another one soon</li>
            <li>had excellent results.</li>
            <li>This is the best eyelash conditioner that I have ever seen out there.</li>
            <li>This product has made me so happy!</li>
            <li>Love it!!!</li>
            <li>Very good products.</li>
            <li>This is a great company with high-quality products and  I am proud to recommend them!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I’m very pleased!</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li>and I have seen great improvements in my lashes.</li>
            <li>so I was so happy when I found I Max Eyelash Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I ordered this one because I was recommended it by a friend who said she achieved great results.</li>
            <li>What a great find.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy to have invested in the I Max line.</li>
            <li>I was experienced brow and lash fallout and one of my friends recommended this product to me.</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>I would say that this product is really amazing!</li>
            <li>After about a week of using it every night, it was a pleasant surprise to notice  my eyelashes transformation.</li>
            <li>And I have to say that I-Max was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The good news: rapidlash doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li>so I could keep using for a month to see a surprising results.</li>
            <li>But I was wondering if this is as good as the one that I paid $120 for.</li>
            <li>That mascara was also good because it protects my lashes.</li>
            <li>So with good reviews and friends&#x27; recommendation I went ahead and bought the eyelash combo for her.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on how beautiful my eyes look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the conditioner for a while now and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>but when i started using it every day for two weeks, that&#x27;s when i saw it&#x27;s magic!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful eyelash conditioner that my really wife loves!</li>
            <li>I now feel more confident within myself, which is obviously good for business!</li>
            <li>This product works like magic!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, Yes...and it is much better.</li>
            <li>Now to maintain nice eyelashes, I use it 2 to 3 times weekly.</li>
            <li>My lashes seem to be loving it and it shows.</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>But so far this has been awesome!</li>
            <li>A great buy, worth the money.</li>
            <li>or so.&lt;br /&gt;So far I am very happy!</li>
            <li>I am so lucky because I see the remarkable results already.</li>
            <li>This product is extremely GENTLE and works beautifully.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and strongly suggest it!</li>
            <li>HUGE difference!</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>After I use more than a month, I saw my lashes more and fatter, even stronger.</li>
            <li>I believe that after many years of using mascara and falsies, my eyelashes have taken a beating.</li>
            <li>I apply the serum twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening, to my top and bottom lash lines.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it needs more time...?</li>
            <li>and it surely lengthens lashes</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;d been using this product, my eyelash become fuller, and longer, and I enjoyed the fuller and longer</li>
            <li>This worked better than the mascara.  </li>
            <li>The feel stronger, smoother, and are more pronounced--even when I&#x27;m not wearing mascara.</li>
            <li>But surely afterwards, I start to see that she had fuller and wider eyelashes</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with how it has changed my lashes.</li>
            <li>My friends recommended this product because they said this product doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes and is safe for the skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m definitely satisfied with the purchase :)</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are falling out more than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most companies just list the ingredients and leave it at that.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s safe to say this eyelash conditioner has exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>started being able to see results about 3-4 weeks in.</li>
            <li>Absolutely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>My lashes are fuller and so much more longer.</li>
            <li>I love having fuller and thicker eyelashes</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s safe to say this eyelash conditioner has surpassed my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited about the strength of my lashes as well.</li>
            <li>My friend is really happy and loves her new eyelashes</li>
            <li>A work colleague told me this conditioner and advised that it makes lashes really healthy and strong.</li>
            <li>I mostly just wanted something to strengthen my lashes so they wouldn&#x27;t fall out so easily.</li>
            <li>, I also love that are stronger and do not come out as easily as they use to.</li>
            <li>We are so happy with the unexpected results of this product!</li>
            <li>I’m am really excited to continue using this product and the many results that are sure to come.</li>
            <li>They also look more filled in, which is what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>It also applies easily and does not clump.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use, it goes on just like mascara.</li>
            <li>It’s not something that can be found easily (if at all) in a drugstore.</li>
            <li>before kids I always got complements about how long my lashes were, They were incredible but</li>
            <li>The seller is very helpful and the product arrived on time and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>I was happy even only with it.</li>
            <li>After noticing the great initial results, I continued to use the product.</li>
            <li>This is most exciting gift that I got from my husband.</li>
            <li>So I had to really sort out my own lashes, as they looked a state.</li>
            <li>I was really happy with this result as my lashes looked like the younger version of me, which was great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>I am much more confident now thanks to I MaxConditioning Mascara.</li>
            <li>I have always been jealous of friends who have beautiful full long lashes.</li>
            <li>I would not hesitate to invest in another bottle and give this product 5 golden stars!</li>
            <li>Since I use it, my lashes is getting longer than before and the volume is rich even without mascara.</li>
            <li>I do not see any significant changes yet</li>
            <li>and I can definitely see good results with my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I used to change a curler and a mascara for better look but after having this product, I feel very confident and no more wasting money to search better mascaras.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it a couple more weeks and see if they keep growing, but they seem healthier, stronger and have not been falling out as much as they used to.</li>
            <li>But until I tried I Max eyelash conditioner, I had no idea my lashes could be so full and glamorous.</li>
            <li>Not bad at all for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>quick results.</li>
            <li>Does burn though so be careful when applying not to get it in your eyes or be over excited and think more is better like me.</li>
            <li>skin is very sensitive yet, I am okay with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>however, after using this product consistently for just two weeks, i became a believer!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy there was no significant distress.</li>
            <li>I got more young lashes and these have become even longer and thicker.</li>
            <li>It was worth the price.</li>
            <li>it is true, you have to use the product consistently.  </li>
            <li>The serum is a generous amount and felt I got my monies worth.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I have used this eyelash conditioner, and introduced it to some people for several years because it worked really great, and it doesn&#x27;t irritates my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>The fact that my lashes became both stronger AND longer made it worth my while!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>It helps grow your lashes naturally and keeps them healthy.  </li>
            <li>It seemed right away that the formula helped my lashes seem thicker and darker at their base––sort of like a primer might.</li>
            <li>but now you can certainly get them!</li>
            <li>I like putting the oil across my lash line, it smells good, burns a little, burns a lot if gets into eye</li>
            <li>the first three weeks</li>
            <li>This product really works for me!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I found something for my lashes that truly works.</li>
            <li>Absolutely works!</li>
            <li>Using it consistently for 2 months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There was no uncomfortable burning or itchiness</li>
            <li>I know it wouldn&#x27;t be an overnight thing, but I was willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li>looks like a mascara wand–a simple, elegant gold tube–but the applicator looks sort of like a liquid-eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li>In any case, notwithstanding the expanded volume, it really appears like my lashes are longer!  </li>
            <li>There was no uncomfortable irritation</li>
            <li>I could see many new born young baby lashes.</li>
            <li>However, I decided to give this product a try because it has delivered positive results to my friend.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the I-Max conditioner, I now have long, thick, strong, beautiful eyelashes.</li>
            <li>All my lovely long lashes are gone.</li>
            <li>First of all, it was not irritating at all</li>
            <li>I am super excited to see how long they will get.</li>
            <li>I simply needed something to fortify my lashes so they wouldn&#x27;t fall off so easily.</li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t use this for beauty but now her eyes are so pretty and charming - at least to me anyway -because</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older my lashes seem to fall out more often and grow in much more slowly.</li>
            <li>really did enjoy seeing the improvement in my lashes within this short space of time.</li>
            <li>It really does not work.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really believe it working.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li>i used the product, i used it very sporadically, and i didn&#x27;t see much change.  </li>
            <li>I will let my friends know this eyelash conditioner is being sold at Amazon at much lower price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has been around 4 weeks now, so I am going to continue the use to see how much results I can get with the length.</li>
            <li>I really started to see results around the 4th week after I started using the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have some shorter lashes that are filling in making them look much fuller.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fall out as much as they used to since I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner day and night.</li>
            <li>It does not create a reaction or pain and is EXTREMELY gentle.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I could see that she was really upset by the matter</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really notice a difference.</li>
            <li>She told me it really works.</li>
            <li>Both products work real well and are well</li>
            <li>and I  haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.</li>
            <li>My lashes are much thicker and longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty surprised how fast it started working.</li>
            <li>My lashes have always been short and never looked full.</li>
            <li>I have tried a number of eyelash conditioners and the one that worked best for me was Revitalash Advanced, but even that gave slow and not greatly enhanced results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this product 3 stars because it&#x27;s better than the previous eyelash growth serum I&#x27;d used before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed more hairs are growing in, and less hairs are falling out.</li>
            <li>Often, I&#x27;ll apply it ok, then somehow 5 minutes later it will mysteriously migrate into my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The main ingredient that makes eyelashes grow isn&#x27;t even it.</li>
            <li>I am a bit older now</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very optimistic about what my lashes will look like in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>I purchased this eyelash conditioner because my lashes were super short.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several eyelash conditioner/growth products, including most of the ones in drugstore and even one pricey department-store solution, and I&#x27;ve never stuck with any of them because I haven&#x27;t seen obvious results.</li>
            <li>It is very reasonable and it is worth every single penny.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend getting the two together.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know thin eyelashes would be such huge deal for her until she went into kind of a isolation mode, which I think really damaged her friendships.</li>
            <li>Even tried extensions...too high maintenance.</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend I Max Eyelash Conditioner to anyone out there.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad there was no significant discomfort.</li>
            <li>Plus more importantly her lashes definitely have been falling out less from the beginning of use, which is really the only thing I had been hoping for.</li>
            <li>However, after a long thought, I finally decided to purchased it, and I&#x27;m glad I did, and gave this eyeliner a try.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty optimistic that this product would work, but apparently it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I am highly satisfied with the results that it delivered to me within few days.</li>
            <li>This is just about as bad as the crappy mascara that your supposed to wear over top!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product a little over a month and put it on morning and night - so far, no results on the top eyelashes, but I&#x27;ve noticed that the bottom lashes seemed to have gotten a bit darker and longer.</li>
            <li>I got this for my best friend for her birthday because she was always a little self-conscious about her thin lashes.</li>
            <li>I bought the product and after four weeks or so, new lashes emerged.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was new growth or the diminished fall off</li>
            <li>I just wanted the strong and healthy lashes because they were very fragile, thin and easily fallen down.</li>
            <li>It really brought my lashes back to life and made them look so much thicker than before.</li>
            <li>I love feeling a little prettier with NO makeup at all!</li>
            <li>It goes on simply and is very gentle.</li>
            <li>After the first week, I could tell that new lashes were starting to come in.</li>
            <li>I have used other IMAX products and was excited to try this one out.</li>
            <li>Of course, at first, I am curious if this conditioning eyeliner really works.  </li>
            <li>have always worn fake eyelashes to get that sexy full lash look because, I was not born with luscious lashes.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a little pricey at first, but I definitely think it was worth it now!</li>
            <li>My lashes were very sparse and short but they are fuller and longer now.</li>
            <li>I am a mid of 40, I used to have full and long lash when I was young but not like before any more.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and you shall surely be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>and wow, do I see a difference.</li>
            <li>and I like the results I&#x27;ve noticed so far.</li>
            <li>When it arrived I was surprised at the care the company took to provide in depth information on it.</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be somewhat sensitive</li>
            <li>I even went as far as to get the IMAX brow conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ready for a totally carefree beach vacation!</li>
            <li>But about two months of use, I was so surprised to see pretty long lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found out about this eyelash conditioner through my Asian girl-friend whose lashes weren’t full or long, but became longer and fuller by using this product.</li>
            <li>Within 5 days, my lashes looked a more supple, thick, lustrous.</li>
            <li>Eyelashes look really thick and healthy.</li>
            <li>It is also pretty gentle on your eyes but it will burn slightly if you get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li>If the magic continues at this rate, I&#x27;m going to have a serious natural fringe in no time–-and</li>
            <li>And it is very easy to wash off as well as not being irritating with my eyes.</li>
            <li>All the issues in my lashes vanished within the first few days and I got the opportunity to enjoy dark and young born lashes.</li>
            <li>They said it’s very typical to see more baby lashes, fuller lashes and finally long lashes.</li>
            <li>I have short sparse Asian eyelashes and faithfully used this product morning and evening for two months and did not see any positive results.</li>
            <li>Everyone wants long luscious lashes, including myself.</li>
            <li>I spent a lot of money on beauty products and most of the time they turn out to be a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li>The best part is that my (naturally quite pale) lashes seem slightly darker as well–almost as if I put on a thin coat of brown mascara.</li>
            <li>It was enough for me to stick with twice-daily application for three weeks thus far!</li>
            <li>That really surprised me - I thought we could only get those results from prescription products.</li>
            <li>I try to leave my eyes closed until it dries, but that does not work very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been utilizing it for barely a month now</li>
            <li>I started using it in early August 2014 and now a month and a half later I have much healthier eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I could see the tiny young lashes after about two weeks, especially after I applied the mascara.</li>
            <li>There were a considerable measure of different items I was looking into, but a friend recommended this a couple of months back</li>
            <li>Finally, I can stop wearing those expensive, time consuming eyelash extensions and wear my own lashes.</li>
            <li>Well worth the little investment!</li>
            <li>It tingles a little at first, but the sensation fades within a minute or so.</li>
            <li>but they are much stronger and less incline to fall off.</li>
            <li>The first few weeks I started to see a difference, but now 3 months later my lashes has transformed.  </li>
            <li>My lashes definitely have been falling out less, which is really the only thing I had been hoping for.</li>

            <li> Wonderful item!</li>
            <li> They said it’s best used with their mascara.</li>
            <li> This is great!</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with the results that we are going to buy another one soon</li>
            <li> had excellent results.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash conditioner that I have ever seen out there.</li>
            <li> This product has made me so happy!</li>
            <li> Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Very good products.</li>
            <li> This is a great company with high-quality products and  I am proud to recommend them!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I’m very pleased!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li> and I have seen great improvements in my lashes.</li>
            <li> so I was so happy when I found I Max Eyelash Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one because I was recommended it by a friend who said she achieved great results.</li>
            <li> What a great find.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m happy to have invested in the I Max line.</li>
            <li> I was experienced brow and lash fallout and one of my friends recommended this product to me.</li>
            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> I would say that this product is really amazing!</li>
            <li> After about a week of using it every night, it was a pleasant surprise to notice  my eyelashes transformation.</li>
            <li> And I have to say that I-Max was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The good news: rapidlash doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li> so I could keep using for a month to see a surprising results.</li>
            <li> But I was wondering if this is as good as the one that I paid $120 for.</li>
            <li> That mascara was also good because it protects my lashes.</li>
            <li> So with good reviews and friends&#x27; recommendation I went ahead and bought the eyelash combo for her.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on how beautiful my eyes look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the conditioner for a while now and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> but when i started using it every day for two weeks, that&#x27;s when i saw it&#x27;s magic!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful eyelash conditioner that my really wife loves!</li>
            <li> I now feel more confident within myself, which is obviously good for business!</li>
            <li> This product works like magic!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, Yes...and it is much better.</li>
            <li> Now to maintain nice eyelashes, I use it 2 to 3 times weekly.</li>
            <li> My lashes seem to be loving it and it shows.</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> But so far this has been awesome!</li>
            <li> A great buy, worth the money.</li>
            <li> or so.&lt;br /&gt;So far I am very happy!</li>
            <li> I am so lucky because I see the remarkable results already.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely GENTLE and works beautifully.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and strongly suggest it!</li>
            <li> HUGE difference!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> After I use more than a month, I saw my lashes more and fatter, even stronger.</li>
            <li> I believe that after many years of using mascara and falsies, my eyelashes have taken a beating.</li>
            <li> I apply the serum twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening, to my top and bottom lash lines.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it needs more time...?</li>
            <li> and it surely lengthens lashes</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;d been using this product, my eyelash become fuller, and longer, and I enjoyed the fuller and longer</li>
            <li> This worked better than the mascara.  </li>
            <li> The feel stronger, smoother, and are more pronounced--even when I&#x27;m not wearing mascara.</li>
            <li> But surely afterwards, I start to see that she had fuller and wider eyelashes</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with how it has changed my lashes.</li>
            <li> My friends recommended this product because they said this product doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes and is safe for the skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m definitely satisfied with the purchase :)</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are falling out more than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most companies just list the ingredients and leave it at that.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s safe to say this eyelash conditioner has exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> started being able to see results about 3-4 weeks in.</li>
            <li> Absolutely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> My lashes are fuller and so much more longer.</li>
            <li> I love having fuller and thicker eyelashes</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s safe to say this eyelash conditioner has surpassed my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited about the strength of my lashes as well.</li>
            <li> My friend is really happy and loves her new eyelashes</li>
            <li> A work colleague told me this conditioner and advised that it makes lashes really healthy and strong.</li>
            <li> I mostly just wanted something to strengthen my lashes so they wouldn&#x27;t fall out so easily.</li>
            <li> , I also love that are stronger and do not come out as easily as they use to.</li>
            <li> We are so happy with the unexpected results of this product!</li>
            <li> I’m am really excited to continue using this product and the many results that are sure to come.</li>
            <li> They also look more filled in, which is what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> It also applies easily and does not clump.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use, it goes on just like mascara.</li>
            <li> It’s not something that can be found easily (if at all) in a drugstore.</li>
            <li> before kids I always got complements about how long my lashes were, They were incredible but</li>
            <li> The seller is very helpful and the product arrived on time and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> I was happy even only with it.</li>
            <li> After noticing the great initial results, I continued to use the product.</li>
            <li> This is most exciting gift that I got from my husband.</li>
            <li> So I had to really sort out my own lashes, as they looked a state.</li>
            <li> I was really happy with this result as my lashes looked like the younger version of me, which was great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> I am much more confident now thanks to I MaxConditioning Mascara.</li>
            <li> I have always been jealous of friends who have beautiful full long lashes.</li>
            <li> I would not hesitate to invest in another bottle and give this product 5 golden stars!</li>
            <li> Since I use it, my lashes is getting longer than before and the volume is rich even without mascara.</li>
            <li> I do not see any significant changes yet</li>
            <li> and I can definitely see good results with my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I used to change a curler and a mascara for better look but after having this product, I feel very confident and no more wasting money to search better mascaras.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it a couple more weeks and see if they keep growing, but they seem healthier, stronger and have not been falling out as much as they used to.</li>
            <li> But until I tried I Max eyelash conditioner, I had no idea my lashes could be so full and glamorous.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> quick results.</li>
            <li> Does burn though so be careful when applying not to get it in your eyes or be over excited and think more is better like me.</li>
            <li> skin is very sensitive yet, I am okay with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> however, after using this product consistently for just two weeks, i became a believer!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m happy there was no significant distress.</li>
            <li> I got more young lashes and these have become even longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> It was worth the price.</li>
            <li> it is true, you have to use the product consistently.  </li>
            <li> The serum is a generous amount and felt I got my monies worth.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used this eyelash conditioner, and introduced it to some people for several years because it worked really great, and it doesn&#x27;t irritates my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> The fact that my lashes became both stronger AND longer made it worth my while!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> It helps grow your lashes naturally and keeps them healthy.  </li>
            <li> It seemed right away that the formula helped my lashes seem thicker and darker at their base––sort of like a primer might.</li>
            <li> but now you can certainly get them!</li>
            <li> I like putting the oil across my lash line, it smells good, burns a little, burns a lot if gets into eye</li>
            <li> the first three weeks</li>
            <li> This product really works for me!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I found something for my lashes that truly works.</li>
            <li> Absolutely works!</li>
            <li> Using it consistently for 2 months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There was no uncomfortable burning or itchiness</li>
            <li> I know it wouldn&#x27;t be an overnight thing, but I was willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li> looks like a mascara wand–a simple, elegant gold tube–but the applicator looks sort of like a liquid-eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li> In any case, notwithstanding the expanded volume, it really appears like my lashes are longer!  </li>
            <li> There was no uncomfortable irritation</li>
            <li> I could see many new born young baby lashes.</li>
            <li> However, I decided to give this product a try because it has delivered positive results to my friend.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the I-Max conditioner, I now have long, thick, strong, beautiful eyelashes.</li>
            <li> All my lovely long lashes are gone.</li>
            <li> First of all, it was not irritating at all</li>
            <li> I am super excited to see how long they will get.</li>
            <li> I simply needed something to fortify my lashes so they wouldn&#x27;t fall off so easily.</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t use this for beauty but now her eyes are so pretty and charming - at least to me anyway -because</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older my lashes seem to fall out more often and grow in much more slowly.</li>
            <li> really did enjoy seeing the improvement in my lashes within this short space of time.</li>
            <li> It really does not work.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really believe it working.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> i used the product, i used it very sporadically, and i didn&#x27;t see much change.  </li>
            <li> I will let my friends know this eyelash conditioner is being sold at Amazon at much lower price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has been around 4 weeks now, so I am going to continue the use to see how much results I can get with the length.</li>
            <li> I really started to see results around the 4th week after I started using the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have some shorter lashes that are filling in making them look much fuller.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fall out as much as they used to since I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner day and night.</li>
            <li> It does not create a reaction or pain and is EXTREMELY gentle.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I could see that she was really upset by the matter</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really notice a difference.</li>
            <li> She told me it really works.</li>
            <li> Both products work real well and are well</li>
            <li> and I  haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.</li>
            <li> My lashes are much thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty surprised how fast it started working.</li>
            <li> My lashes have always been short and never looked full.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of eyelash conditioners and the one that worked best for me was Revitalash Advanced, but even that gave slow and not greatly enhanced results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 3 stars because it&#x27;s better than the previous eyelash growth serum I&#x27;d used before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed more hairs are growing in, and less hairs are falling out.</li>
            <li> Often, I&#x27;ll apply it ok, then somehow 5 minutes later it will mysteriously migrate into my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The main ingredient that makes eyelashes grow isn&#x27;t even it.</li>
            <li> I am a bit older now</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very optimistic about what my lashes will look like in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this eyelash conditioner because my lashes were super short.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several eyelash conditioner/growth products, including most of the ones in drugstore and even one pricey department-store solution, and I&#x27;ve never stuck with any of them because I haven&#x27;t seen obvious results.</li>
            <li> It is very reasonable and it is worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend getting the two together.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know thin eyelashes would be such huge deal for her until she went into kind of a isolation mode, which I think really damaged her friendships.</li>
            <li> Even tried extensions...too high maintenance.</li>
            <li> I can highly recommend I Max Eyelash Conditioner to anyone out there.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad there was no significant discomfort.</li>
            <li> Plus more importantly her lashes definitely have been falling out less from the beginning of use, which is really the only thing I had been hoping for.</li>
            <li> However, after a long thought, I finally decided to purchased it, and I&#x27;m glad I did, and gave this eyeliner a try.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty optimistic that this product would work, but apparently it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am highly satisfied with the results that it delivered to me within few days.</li>
            <li> This is just about as bad as the crappy mascara that your supposed to wear over top!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product a little over a month and put it on morning and night - so far, no results on the top eyelashes, but I&#x27;ve noticed that the bottom lashes seemed to have gotten a bit darker and longer.</li>
            <li> I got this for my best friend for her birthday because she was always a little self-conscious about her thin lashes.</li>
            <li> I bought the product and after four weeks or so, new lashes emerged.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was new growth or the diminished fall off</li>
            <li> I just wanted the strong and healthy lashes because they were very fragile, thin and easily fallen down.</li>
            <li> It really brought my lashes back to life and made them look so much thicker than before.</li>
            <li> I love feeling a little prettier with NO makeup at all!</li>
            <li> It goes on simply and is very gentle.</li>
            <li> After the first week, I could tell that new lashes were starting to come in.</li>
            <li> I have used other IMAX products and was excited to try this one out.</li>
            <li> Of course, at first, I am curious if this conditioning eyeliner really works.  </li>
            <li> have always worn fake eyelashes to get that sexy full lash look because, I was not born with luscious lashes.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little pricey at first, but I definitely think it was worth it now!</li>
            <li> My lashes were very sparse and short but they are fuller and longer now.</li>
            <li> I am a mid of 40, I used to have full and long lash when I was young but not like before any more.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and you shall surely be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> and wow, do I see a difference.</li>
            <li> and I like the results I&#x27;ve noticed so far.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I was surprised at the care the company took to provide in depth information on it.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be somewhat sensitive</li>
            <li> I even went as far as to get the IMAX brow conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ready for a totally carefree beach vacation!</li>
            <li> But about two months of use, I was so surprised to see pretty long lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found out about this eyelash conditioner through my Asian girl-friend whose lashes weren’t full or long, but became longer and fuller by using this product.</li>
            <li> Within 5 days, my lashes looked a more supple, thick, lustrous.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes look really thick and healthy.</li>
            <li> It is also pretty gentle on your eyes but it will burn slightly if you get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> If the magic continues at this rate, I&#x27;m going to have a serious natural fringe in no time–-and</li>
            <li> And it is very easy to wash off as well as not being irritating with my eyes.</li>
            <li> All the issues in my lashes vanished within the first few days and I got the opportunity to enjoy dark and young born lashes.</li>
            <li> They said it’s very typical to see more baby lashes, fuller lashes and finally long lashes.</li>
            <li> I have short sparse Asian eyelashes and faithfully used this product morning and evening for two months and did not see any positive results.</li>
            <li> Everyone wants long luscious lashes, including myself.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money on beauty products and most of the time they turn out to be a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> The best part is that my (naturally quite pale) lashes seem slightly darker as well–almost as if I put on a thin coat of brown mascara.</li>
            <li> It was enough for me to stick with twice-daily application for three weeks thus far!</li>
            <li> That really surprised me - I thought we could only get those results from prescription products.</li>
            <li> I try to leave my eyes closed until it dries, but that does not work very well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been utilizing it for barely a month now</li>
            <li> I started using it in early August 2014 and now a month and a half later I have much healthier eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I could see the tiny young lashes after about two weeks, especially after I applied the mascara.</li>
            <li> There were a considerable measure of different items I was looking into, but a friend recommended this a couple of months back</li>
            <li> Finally, I can stop wearing those expensive, time consuming eyelash extensions and wear my own lashes.</li>
            <li> Well worth the little investment!</li>
            <li> It tingles a little at first, but the sensation fades within a minute or so.</li>
            <li> but they are much stronger and less incline to fall off.</li>
            <li> The first few weeks I started to see a difference, but now 3 months later my lashes has transformed.  </li>
            <li> My lashes definitely have been falling out less, which is really the only thing I had been hoping for.</li>
            <li> When I asked the seller if this may lengthen my lashes without irritating eyes or eye lids, they said it is very rare to irritate eyes or lids</li>
            <li> As usual, it is never irritating the eyes or caused pains or red eyes, but it has regrown my lashes longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> Almost 3 months later, she was so surprised to see her lashes so robust and they were not falling down like before.</li>
            <li> It last a long time.</li>
            <li> Finally, after three weeks, my lashes were a bit longer but not as long as I would like.</li>
            <li> I gave this three stars because I have not used it long enough to see if it works.</li>
            <li> My boy friend bought this product for me as I had a lot of trouble with my eye-lashes after wearing false lashes for so many years when I was younger.</li>
            <li> My lashes are easily fall down and the volume is poor even though not that short.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different conditioners in the past even false lashes</li>
            <li> And considering you apply this at the base of your eyelashes, that is pretty easy to do.</li>
            <li> ive used other, more expensive eyelash conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I tried some other products but most of them are very irritating my eyes.</li>
            <li> or if I haven’t been as healthy lately, but I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair (eyelashes especially) have been getting brittle and thin.</li>
            <li> They do not look artificially long</li>
            <li> I will continue to recommend these products to everyone woman I know, as long as the topic arises.</li>
            <li> My wife used it everyday, at first we didnt see any results until a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> After using Revitalash for many years I decided to try this less expensive alternative.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had lashes this long before!</li>
            <li> as I age I have notice them thin out, break and get much shorter without growing back.</li>
            <li> I started using this and after only a few weeks I have noticed a big difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product faithfully for 6 weeks and have seen no new growth or anything.  </li>
            <li> Definitely, I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a product that actually works while taking one less step in the morning!</li>
            <li> i was skeptical about this product at first because of the low price.  </li>
            <li> Just FYI, it does burn slightly for a second or two if you get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> It is a little specific but you will see results.</li>
            <li> So results may be a little faster for the younger ladies.</li>
            <li> it on like you would eye liner 2 x daily for 2 weeks( comes with instructions), it tingles a little.</li>
            <li> So just carefully apply to the lashes, there is no discomfort.</li>
            <li> While I had never really thought about conditioning my eyelashes, I condition my hair and skin so why not?</li>
            <li> Be careful, it it touches your eyes,</li>
            <li> So just be careful when applying it to the lashes, but really no discomfort.</li>
            <li> if you get it in your eye though, so be careful of that.</li>
            <li> So to get her out of that damaging isolation mode and boost her confidence back up, I decided to consult a few friends and get her some eyelash enhancement cosmetics for her birthday.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t generally contingent upon that.</li>
            <li> I could see from her old pictures that she used to have thicker and longer lashes, but in recent years, it started to thin and fall out.</li>
            <li> There were a lot of other products I was looking into, but a friend of mine had recommended this to me a few months back</li>
            <li> She said her lashes started growing back within a month and is still growing long and thick by the day.</li>
            <li> My lashes had become thin and sparse as I got older.</li>
            <li> TOTAL waste of money!</li>
            <li> I bought it based on other reviews that said it worked and did not burn their eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was new growth or the decreased fall-out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been on a quest for the longest, lushest lashes possible, so I&#x27;ve been wearing (waterproof) mascara daily and false lashes on the weekends for years.</li>
            <li> The first two weeks, I was a little skeptical because I saw no change.</li>
            <li> the review above was done in late June.</li>
            <li> and I do not see that my lashes have gotten any longer than before I started using this product back in late May.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t really depending on that aspect (just seemed unlikely).</li>
            <li> I think that slowly damaged her confidence and she would seldom come hang out with us outside.</li>
            <li> And this product doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes like the previous product I used.</li>
            <li> Then I found IMAX conditioner and after about a week maybe a week and a half.</li>
            <li> but I do sometimes feel a slight warmth for about a minute or two after application.</li>
            <li> feel a slight warmth after application.</li>
            <li> It burns and there&#x27;s a slight sting when I apply it on my lash line.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife as she was unhappy with her lashes, saying that they are feeble, fragile and easily falling out.</li>
            <li> I wore them as I was obsessed with the thick/long lash image, but the results was that my own ashes were weak, broken and short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The truth is, we aren&#x27;t all born with thick and long lashes..</li>
            <li> I have thin and short lashes due to thyroid problems.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m looking forward to their growing thicker as I understand that takes a little longer.</li>
            <li> but they do seem a little thicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> I had gaps of missing lashes.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I give my eyes a break and don&#x27;t use it for a few days, because they sometimes itch for&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> They were growing unevenly, and some of them were longer than others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything, all those clumpy and gimmicky eye lash curlers and brushes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I saw results with Imax within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> , I don’t wear false lashes anymore, as they look to extreme and not very graceful.</li>
            <li> Over the past few weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed that my eyelashes do seem thicker and have been falling out less.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For instance I am 44 and since started to notice my lashes looking dull or limp.</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> There is no magic beans in a bottle solution.</li>
            <li> It took me 1 week to notice some small changes, but now I can see substantial results.</li>
            <li> My skin has a tendency to be fairly delicate</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my wife has been complaining about having small thin eyelashes, and having them fall out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a problem with eyelash growth serums irritating my eyelids in the past and hoped that this product would be different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My base of my lashes look thicker because of the new growth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not like they grew to fashion magazine-worthy lengths, but I noticed they were easier to grasp in my curler and that they would go past the usual point when curled.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No good</li>
            <li> But ..... holy cow does it sting like crazy if it gets it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not pleasant.</li>
            <li> In the beginning, it was a little disappointing because we could not see any difference.</li>
            <li> sorry- purchased this awhile ago--at least 6 weeks--</li>
            <li> least the other products started to show some results before annoying my lids.....</li>
            <li> I was skeptical even about this conditioner.</li>
            <li> After telling my wife about it, she was really skeptical.</li>
            <li> Think the reviews posted were fake, posted by the company perhaps.</li>
            <li> I used to always have to buy the fake ones and it became a hassle having to always buy the glue and lashes.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical in the beginning</li>
            <li> I mean, it stings REALLY bad.</li>
            <li> omg it burns like crazy</li>
            <li> The bad news:</li>
            <li> It had gotten really bad to were</li>
            <li> :(    </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> has not increased my eyelashes in size, amount or length...very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this conditioner. I have used it for a month and I can definitely see good results with my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> After using Revitalash for many years I decided to try this less expensive alternative. All my lovely long lashes are gone. Going back to Revitalash!! You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Works well. Gave me longer, fuller, thicker lashes ... shiny lashes too. But ..... holy cow does it sting like crazy if it gets it in your eyes. And considering you apply this at the base of your eyelashes, that is pretty easy to do. Often, I&#x27;ll apply it ok, then somehow 5 minutes later it will mysteriously migrate into my eyes.  I mean, it stings REALLY bad. I finally had enough. I quit using this and moved on to rapidlash .... The good news: rapidlash doesn&#x27;t sting. The bad news: rapidlash also doesn&#x27;t work.  :(    So ...... do I try something else or come back to this stuff that works but hurts? Not sure. I may try RevitaLash next and see how that goes.</li>
            <li> This is just about as bad as the crappy mascara that your supposed to wear over top!!! It really does not work. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 months now and I have seen great improvements in my lashes. My lashes were very sparse and short but they are fuller and longer now. I use this product twice a day and will continue to use it. The seller is very helpful and the product arrived on time and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> I just wanted the strong and healthy lashes because they were very fragile, thin and easily fallen down. I didn’t even want to have longer or fuller lashes. I tried some other products but most of them are very irritating my eyes. I was skeptical even about this conditioner. I gave it a try. First of all, it was not irritating at all so I could keep using for a month to see a surprising results. I got more young lashes and these have become even longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> I was definitely nervous about buying this item and having it not work. I have a habit of picking my mascara off, which has pulled out and thinned my lashes. It had gotten really bad to were I had gaps of missing lashes. I bought this item and have been applying it almost every night. My lashes that I have are longer and my gaps are now filling. My base of my lashes look thicker because of the new growth. I recommend this product because it works and also encourages you to remove your makeup nightly. It was worth the price. It is also pretty gentle on your eyes but it will burn slightly if you get it in your eyes. So just carefully apply to the lashes, there is no discomfort. Wonderful item!</li>
            <li> I am a mid of 40, I used to have full and long lash when I was young but not like before any more.&lt;br /&gt;I happened to know this lash serum but I didn&#x27;t really believe it working. After I use more than a month, I saw my lashes more and fatter, even stronger. I was happy even only with it. But about two months of use, I was so surprised to see pretty long lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome. I really recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> I believe that after many years of using mascara and falsies, my eyelashes have taken a beating. They appeared to be thinning and possibly damaged so I was so happy when I found I Max Eyelash Conditioner. After 1 week of use, I’m beginning to experience fuller lashes. I apply the serum twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening, to my top and bottom lash lines. Now when I apply my mascara in the morning, my lashes look thicker and longer. I’m am really excited to continue using this product and the many results that are sure to come. This is a great company with high-quality products and  I am proud to recommend them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a month, and I have seen an increase in length, but not density. Perhaps it needs more time...?</li>
            <li> ive used other, more expensive eyelash conditioners.  i was skeptical about this product at first because of the low price.  im used to $75-$100 a pop.  however, after using this product consistently for just two weeks, i became a believer!  it is true, you have to use the product consistently.  the first three weeks i used the product, i used it very sporadically, and i didn&#x27;t see much change.  but when i started using it every day for two weeks, that&#x27;s when i saw it&#x27;s magic!</li>
            <li> IT BURNS THE EYES AND DOES NOT WORK AS WELL AS LATISSE...AT ALL.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL.  DOSN&#x27;T HELP LASHES TO GROW</li>
            <li> Purchased the I Max Conditioner over a year ago. Within 5 days, my lashes looked a more supple, thick, lustrous. The actual difference in length came about 30-40 days later. There is no magic beans in a bottle solution. However, there is NO irritation with I Max Eyelash. Also, keep on the schedule recommended on label. This makes a world of a difference. It is a little specific but you will see results. Do think results depend on the individual as well. For instance I am 44 and since started to notice my lashes looking dull or limp. So results may be a little faster for the younger ladies. This product is extremely GENTLE and works beautifully. The serum is a generous amount and felt I got my monies worth. I would not hesitate to invest in another bottle and give this product 5 golden stars! Be patient. Stick to applying religiously and you shall surely be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This product really works for me! When I asked the seller if this may lengthen my lashes without irritating eyes or eye lids, they said it is very rare to irritate eyes or lids and it surely lengthens lashes but nobody know how soon, between 2-3 weeks or 3 months depending on the person. I am so lucky because I see the remarkable results already. I had no pains or irritation at all while I used it.</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all and I cannot recommend using it. The main ingredient that makes eyelashes grow isn&#x27;t even it.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! Sometimes I give my eyes a break and don&#x27;t use it for a few days, because they sometimes itch for&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s use. But it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;ve used it about a month and I haven&#x27;t had lashes this long before! Now I&#x27;m looking forward to their growing thicker as I understand that takes a little longer.</li>
            <li> I would say that this product is really amazing! Of course, at first, I am curious if this conditioning eyeliner really works.  However, after a long thought, I finally decided to purchased it, and I&#x27;m glad I did, and gave this eyeliner a try.  I have used this eyelash conditioner, and introduced it to some people for several years because it worked really great, and it doesn&#x27;t irritates my sensitive eyes. Since I&#x27;d been using this product, my eyelash become fuller, and longer, and I enjoyed the fuller and longer lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I found out that this product is selling at the lower price on Amazon, and I purchased. Think about that It used to be $120, now I can buy three units for the same amount. But I was wondering if this is as good as the one that I paid $120 for. Surprisingly, Yes...and it is much better. As usual, it is never irritating the eyes or caused pains or red eyes, but it has regrown my lashes longer and fuller. I will let my friends know this eyelash conditioner is being sold at Amazon at much lower price. Definitely, I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a product that actually works while taking one less step in the morning!</li>
            <li> After you receive this, you will learn that the manufacturers says 4 to 12 weeks.  I am on week 6 and have noticed no change at all.</li>
            <li> I was specifically looking for something to make my eye-lashes thicker and longer but I did not want to use a product with Parabens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After searching and searching for ages on the internet, I came across this product! I began using it and started to see the difference in the thickness of my lashes by around the third week. After noticing the great initial results, I continued to use the product. Another three weeks later, I noticed the length of my lashes had changed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really did enjoy seeing the improvement in my lashes within this short space of time. The fact that my lashes became both stronger AND longer made it worth my while!&lt;br /&gt;I now feel sexier and my friends keep asking me what mascara I am wearing… but I am not wearing any! It is just the results of using I-Max eyelash conditioner! They all decided to give it a try after seeing how it changed my lashes. The truth is, we aren&#x27;t all born with thick and long lashes.. but now you can certainly get them!</li>
            <li> It made my eyes itch as soon as I applied it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this twice a day for over 6 weeks and see no results.  When is something supposed to grow???</li>
            <li> This worked better than the mascara.  It last a long time.</li>
            <li> I had heard of lash conditioners, but had never tried one before. While I had never really thought about conditioning my eyelashes, I condition my hair and skin so why not? After just 3 weeks my lashes are visibly healthier. The feel stronger, smoother, and are more pronounced--even when I&#x27;m not wearing mascara. I used it with their mascara. That mascara was also good because it protects my lashes.</li>
            <li> I found out about this eyelash conditioner through my Asian girl-friend whose lashes weren’t full or long, but became longer and fuller by using this product. She said she got it for $60.00 but I found it for $40.00 on Amazon. They said it’s best used with their mascara. So I got it, and  I have been using them mornings and evenings for about 4 weeks. I could see the tiny young lashes after about two weeks, especially after I applied the mascara. But my lashes did not look noticeably longer until the 3rd week. . I noticed them being longer one morning, while looking in the mirror. They were growing unevenly, and some of them were longer than others. I even called the seller about it. They said it’s very typical to see more baby lashes, fuller lashes and finally long lashes. This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> This is most exciting gift that I got from my husband. My lashes are easily fall down and the volume is poor even though not that short. I used to change a curler and a mascara for better look but after having this product, I feel very confident and no more wasting money to search better mascaras. Since I use it, my lashes is getting longer than before and the volume is rich even without mascara. I love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 3 stars because it&#x27;s better than the previous eyelash growth serum I&#x27;d used before. I&#x27;ve been using this product a little over a month and put it on morning and night - so far, no results on the top eyelashes, but I&#x27;ve noticed that the bottom lashes seemed to have gotten a bit darker and longer. And this product doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes like the previous product I used. Once you put it on, you&#x27;ll feel that your lids have heated up, but it doesn&#x27;t stink you eyes.    11/17/2014: the review above was done in late June. It is now 11/17/14 and I do not see that my lashes have gotten any longer than before I started using this product back in late May. I was pretty optimistic that this product would work, but apparently it doesn&#x27;t. So I am giving this product a1 star.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks I notice a change in my lashes length. Not only that, but they are much stronger and less incline to fall off. My eyelash are falling off once a week now and not the daily loss per day.</li>
            <li> My boy friend bought this product for me as I had a lot of trouble with my eye-lashes after wearing false lashes for so many years when I was younger. All though my 20’s I wore them as I was obsessed with the thick/long lash image, but the results was that my own ashes were weak, broken and short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I am a bit older now, I don’t wear false lashes anymore, as they look to extreme and not very graceful. So I had to really sort out my own lashes, as they looked a state. I decided to by this I max conditioner to try and solve my problem. I used it every morning and night for about 2 weeks as instructed and then about 5 days a week after that. It really brought my lashes back to life and made them look so much thicker than before. I was really happy with this result as my lashes looked like the younger version of me, which was great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been around 4 weeks now, so I am going to continue the use to see how much results I can get with the length. But so far this has been awesome!</li>
            <li> I just re-ordered the I-Max Eyelash Conditioner for the second time. I have been using both the conditioner and mascara for about 6 weeks now and wow, do I see a difference. The first two weeks, I was a little skeptical because I saw no change. I really started to see results around the 4th week after I started using the conditioner. The results were marvelous.&lt;br /&gt;I have always worn fake eyelashes to get that sexy full lash look because, I was not born with luscious lashes. This is the first time that I found something for my lashes that truly works. Finally, I can stop wearing those expensive, time consuming eyelash extensions and wear my own lashes. Thanks to the I-Max conditioner, I now have long, thick, strong, beautiful eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product. It seems to work as promised and I like the results I&#x27;ve noticed so far. I have some shorter lashes that are filling in making them look much fuller. This is great! I&#x27;m very excited about the strength of my lashes as well. They don&#x27;t fall out as much as they used to since I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner day and night. I can tell the longer hairs look even longer and I&#x27;m very optimistic about what my lashes will look like in a few more weeks. I also have the eyebrow conditioner and it is working just as well. Very good products. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> It works! It took me 1 week to notice some small changes, but now I can see substantial results. Be careful, it it touches your eyes, omg it burns like crazy</li>
            <li> sorry- purchased this awhile ago--at least 6 weeks-- has not increased my eyelashes in size, amount or length...very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my wife has been complaining about having small thin eyelashes, and having them fall out. So I did some research, and found this product and decided to buy it on Amazon. My wife used it everyday, at first we didnt see any results until a few weeks of use. But surely afterwards, I start to see that she had fuller and wider eyelashes and they also look longer. Plus more importantly her lashes definitely have been falling out less from the beginning of use, which is really the only thing I had been hoping for. I could not believe my eyes when I saw the difference from the beginning of use to now. My wife is very happy with the results that we are going to buy another one soon and it is definitely worth the price. Just FYI, it does burn slightly for a second or two if you get it in your eyes. So just be careful when applying it to the lashes, but really no discomfort. This is a wonderful eyelash conditioner that my really wife loves! I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely works! I&#x27;m almost 34 and in my younger years and before kids I always got complements about how long my lashes were, They were incredible but as I age I have notice them thin out, break and get much shorter without growing back. Then I found IMAX conditioner and after about a week maybe a week and a half. My eyelashes were longer thicker and darker. TIP, Don&#x27;t get it in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Put it on like you would eye liner 2 x daily for 2 weeks( comes with instructions), it tingles a little. Now to maintain nice eyelashes, I use it 2 to 3 times weekly. I started using it in early August 2014 and now a month and a half later I have much healthier eyelashes.  I love it. A great buy, worth the money.</li>
            <li> HUGE difference! I love this product. BURNS LIKE HELL if you get it in your eye though, so be careful of that.</li>
            <li> I do not see any difference in lash length but they do seem a little thicker. I like putting the oil across my lash line, it smells good, burns a little, burns a lot if gets into eye but if pushed into corner of eye it will tear eye and no longer burns. I have not been using this a month yet so maybe too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> Love this product. had excellent results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three weeks now and am eager to share my observations. After the first week, I could tell that new lashes were starting to come in. It was after the second week that I started noticing a difference in the lash color and fullness. They were noticeably darker and fuller but not yet perceptibly longer. Finally, after three weeks, my lashes were a bit longer but not as long as I would like. I&#x27;ll give it a couple more weeks and see if they keep growing, but they seem healthier, stronger and have not been falling out as much as they used to.</li>
            <li> I began using IMAX eyelash conditioner in Gold about a month ago and it does not disappoint. It does not create a reaction or pain and is EXTREMELY gentle. I have used other IMAX products and was excited to try this one out. I use Imax Eyeliner in the morning and the conditioner in the evening. I would highly recommend getting the two together. I see noticeable growth on my upper and lower lash. They also look more filled in, which is what I was hoping for. Don&#x27;t expect results in a couple days- give it a couple weeks and you will see a difference. It also applies easily and does not clump. Eyelashes look really thick and healthy. Great product.</li>
            <li> Everyone wants long luscious lashes, including myself. I&#x27;ve tried everything, all those clumpy and gimmicky eye lash curlers and brushes. But until I tried I Max eyelash conditioner, I had no idea my lashes could be so full and glamorous. It&#x27;s really easy to use, it goes on just like mascara. It helps grow your lashes naturally and keeps them healthy.  You&#x27;ll never need to try another eyelash extender again, this is your answer!</li>
            <li> Used for approx 3 months. Did not work for me. I have thin and short lashes due to thyroid problems. It may work for others without those problems.</li>
            <li> I have always been jealous of friends who have beautiful full long lashes. My lashes have always been short and never looked full. I bought i Max Conditioning Mascara to help my lashes grow and look thicker. I have tried many different conditioners in the past even false lashes but I have never seen results like I do with this product. I am so pleased with how it has changed my lashes. I am much more confident now thanks to I MaxConditioning Mascara. I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Not only does it not improve your lashes, it makes them FALL OUT. My eyelash bed became red and tender and then I noticed my lashes falling out when I removed my makeup. TOTAL waste of money!</li>
            <li> I got this for my best friend for her birthday because she was always a little self-conscious about her thin lashes. I could see from her old pictures that she used to have thicker and longer lashes, but in recent years, it started to thin and fall out. I think that slowly damaged her confidence and she would seldom come hang out with us outside. I didn&#x27;t know thin eyelashes would be such huge deal for her until she went into kind of a isolation mode, which I think really damaged her friendships. So to get her out of that damaging isolation mode and boost her confidence back up, I decided to consult a few friends and get her some eyelash enhancement cosmetics for her birthday. My friends recommended this product because they said this product doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes and is safe for the skin. So with good reviews and friends&#x27; recommendation I went ahead and bought the eyelash combo for her. My friends has been using it for about 2 months and she said it worked wonders. She said her lashes started growing back within a month and is still growing long and thick by the day. I&#x27;m pretty surprised how fast it started working. My friend is really happy and loves her new eyelashes and I&#x27;m definitely satisfied with the purchase :)</li>
            <li> After using this product my lashes are thicker and longer. Love it!!! I recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> fantastic product.  quick results. fast shipping.  highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I don’t know if it’s a change in my diet or if I haven’t been as healthy lately, but I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair (eyelashes especially) have been getting brittle and thin. My eyelashes are falling out more than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across this condition and wondered if it worked. It’s not something that can be found easily (if at all) in a drugstore. When it arrived I was surprised at the care the company took to provide in depth information on it. Most companies just list the ingredients and leave it at that. In the package, I received a description paper describing everything from ingredients, to inspections it’s passed, to recommendations and notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the conditioner for a while now and am very pleased with it. Over the past few weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed that my eyelashes do seem thicker and have been falling out less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and let’s not forget that they included a mini travel cream as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I’m very pleased!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife as she was unhappy with her lashes, saying that they are feeble, fragile and easily falling out. A work colleague told me this conditioner and advised that it makes lashes really healthy and strong. After telling my wife about it, she was really skeptical. I bought it for her anyway but she was not diligently using it. I could see that she was really upset by the matter so I encouraged her to use it as instructed. In the beginning, it was a little disappointing because we could not see any difference. Almost 3 months later, she was so surprised to see her lashes so robust and they were not falling down like before. She didn&#x27;t use this for beauty but now her eyes are so pretty and charming - at least to me anyway -because her lashes are darker and longer. We are so happy with the unexpected results of this product!</li>
            <li> Using it consistently for 2 months. Don&#x27;t really notice a difference. No noticeable length or thickness. Does burn though so be careful when applying not to get it in your eyes or be over excited and think more is better like me. You blink and it&#x27;s not pleasant. Will continue to use until it&#x27;s gone and write another review if I see any results</li>
            <li> I mostly just wanted something to strengthen my lashes so they wouldn&#x27;t fall out so easily. There were a lot of other products I was looking into, but a friend of mine had recommended this to me a few months back so I decided to give it a try. I thought it was a little pricey at first, but I definitely think it was worth it now! I know the product description says it helps with length but I wasn&#x27;t really depending on that aspect (just seemed unlikely). I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month now and it&#x27;s safe to say this eyelash conditioner has exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started being able to see results about 3-4 weeks in. My lashes definitely have been falling out less, which is really the only thing I had been hoping for. I don&#x27;t know if it was new growth or the decreased fall-out but my lash-line looks fuller now. But in addition to the increased volume, it actually seems like my lashes are longer! That really surprised me - I thought we could only get those results from prescription products. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not like they grew to fashion magazine-worthy lengths, but I noticed they were easier to grasp in my curler and that they would go past the usual point when curled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no uncomfortable burning or itchiness but I do sometimes feel a slight warmth for about a minute or two after application. My skin tends to be somewhat sensitive so I&#x27;m glad there was no significant discomfort.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one because I was recommended it by a friend who said she achieved great results. I know it wouldn&#x27;t be an overnight thing, but I was willing to give it a try. The first few weeks I started to see a difference, but now 3 months later my lashes has transformed.  A lot thicker and a lot longer! When I speak to clients I now feel more confident within myself, which is obviously good for business!</li>
            <li> I used Revitalash before and my eye did get red and puffy. The ad for this product popped up on Amazon and I reluctantly decided to give it a shot. Actually it did not burn  so I opted to try it morning and evening, with a lot of scepticism, I have to say. In 10 days my eyelashes became thicker and longer. They do not look artificially long but I am constantly getting compliments. I even went as far as to get the IMAX brow conditioner. Will report on it in a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;So far I am very happy!</li>
            <li> I gave this three stars because I have not used it long enough to see if it works. I bought it based on other reviews that said it worked and did not burn their eyes. That has not been the case for me. It does burn when I put it on. I try to leave my eyes closed until it dries, but that does not work very well.  If it continues to burn I will stop using it and try something else.</li>
            <li> This product works like magic! It delivers what it promises. My eyelashes will never look the same without I Max conditioner. Absolutely satisfied. I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on how beautiful my eyes look. Well worth the little investment!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work at all !!!!!!</li>
            <li> It works. My lashes are definitely longer and fuller. It is also very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I like it but it stings your eyes a bit. I do not see any significant changes yet but I will continue in all fairness to finish the product and see where we are then.&lt;br /&gt;Joanne</li>
            <li> It made my vision blurry. No good</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money on beauty products and most of the time they turn out to be a waste of money and time. Eye-lash conditioning products are one of the more expensive products. I came across I-Max Conditioner Gold recommended by a friend. She told me it really works. I bought the product and after four weeks or so, new lashes emerged. I also purchased the I-Max Mascara. What a great find. Both products work real well and are well priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only recommend it warmly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Gardy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it for 4 weeks and I  haven&#x27;t noticed much difference. I thought my eye lashes would grow to the point I could see a difference between before and after but it didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> My lashes had become thin and sparse as I got older. Even tried extensions...too high maintenance. I saw results with Imax within a few weeks. My lashes are much thicker and longer. I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Rather pricey, stings the eye and haven&#x27;t seen the results promised. Think the reviews posted were fake, posted by the company perhaps.</li>
            <li> I purchased this eyelash conditioner because my lashes were super short. I used to always have to buy the fake ones and it became a hassle having to always buy the glue and lashes. I started using this and after only a few weeks I have noticed a big difference. My lashes are fuller and so much more longer. I am super excited to see how long they will get. I am very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product faithfully for 6 weeks and have seen no new growth or anything.  Guess I will go with Li-li lash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a problem with eyelash growth serums irritating my eyelids in the past and hoped that this product would be different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least the other products started to show some results before annoying my lids.....this one showed no improvement at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start using it on my eyebrows to see if it makes any difference there.</li>
            <li> I must say this eyelash conditioner is actually working. Since starting my eyelashes are not only longer but thicker as well. I&#x27;ve noticed more hairs are growing in, and less hairs are falling out. My lashes seem to be loving it and it shows. I was a bit skeptical in the beginning but I&#x27;m happy to have invested in the I Max line. I will continue to recommend these products to everyone woman I know, as long as the topic arises.</li>
            <li> After about a week of using it every night, it was a pleasant surprise to notice  my eyelashes transformation. I could see many new born young baby lashes. And about 4 weeks later, I could see all lashes darker and fuller. About 5 weeks, these became even longer. This is the best eyelash conditioner that I have ever seen out there. And it is very easy to wash off as well as not being irritating with my eyes. It goes on simply and is very gentle. I absolutely love this product and strongly suggest it! It is very reasonable and it is worth every single penny. I love having fuller and thicker eyelashes, I also love that are stronger and do not come out as easily as they use to. This product has made me so happy!</li>
            <li> I was experienced brow and lash fallout and one of my friends recommended this product to me. I was fed up with using another product, which caused irritations after applying. However, I decided to give this product a try because it has delivered positive results to my friend. I am highly satisfied with the results that it delivered to me within few days. All the issues in my lashes vanished within the first few days and I got the opportunity to enjoy dark and young born lashes. I can highly recommend I Max Eyelash Conditioner to anyone out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been on a quest for the longest, lushest lashes possible, so I&#x27;ve been wearing (waterproof) mascara daily and false lashes on the weekends for years. Guess what? It has taken its toll. As I&#x27;ve gotten older my lashes seem to fall out more often and grow in much more slowly. I&#x27;ve used several eyelash conditioner/growth products, including most of the ones in drugstore and even one pricey department-store solution, and I&#x27;ve never stuck with any of them because I haven&#x27;t seen obvious results. But I&#x27;ve kept searching. And I have to say that I-Max was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like a mascara wand–a simple, elegant gold tube–but the applicator looks sort of like a liquid-eyeliner brush. You apply it along your lashline in a similar way. It tingles a little at first, but the sensation fades within a minute or so. I&#x27;ve been using it at night after I wash my cace, and in the morning under a layer of mascara and sometimes eyeliner too. It seemed right away that the formula helped my lashes seem thicker and darker at their base––sort of like a primer might. It was enough for me to stick with twice-daily application for three weeks thus far! After about 10 days, I saw (tiny, but still obvious) regrowth. Now, I&#x27;m seeing it in earnest. The best part is that my (naturally quite pale) lashes seem slightly darker as well–almost as if I put on a thin coat of brown mascara. I love feeling a little prettier with NO makeup at all! If the magic continues at this rate, I&#x27;m going to have a serious natural fringe in no time–-and I&#x27;ll be ready for a totally carefree beach vacation!</li>
            <li> I have short sparse Asian eyelashes and faithfully used this product morning and evening for two months and did not see any positive results. I have tried a number of eyelash conditioners and the one that worked best for me was Revitalash Advanced, but even that gave slow and not greatly enhanced results.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and applied several times. I feel my lashes are fuller and longer already. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I simply needed something to fortify my lashes so they wouldn&#x27;t fall off so easily. There were a considerable measure of different items I was looking into, but a friend recommended this a couple of months back so I chose to try it out. I know the item description says it assists with length but I wasn&#x27;t generally contingent upon that. I&#x27;ve been utilizing it for barely a month now and it&#x27;s safe to say this eyelash conditioner has surpassed my expectations.  I started to see results around 3-4 weeks in. My lashes have been falling off less, which is truly the main thing I had been hoping for. I don&#x27;t know if it was new growth or the diminished fall off but my lash-line looks fuller at this point. In any case, notwithstanding the expanded volume, it really appears like my lashes are longer!  There was no uncomfortable irritation but I do once in a while feel a slight warmth after application. My skin has a tendency to be fairly delicate so I&#x27;m happy there was no significant distress.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all for the price.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been almost a week, I do see my lash getting thicker and stronger.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive yet, I am okay with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would probably purchase again.</li>
            <li> Used this product for over a week twice a day after washing my face and no results. It burns and there&#x27;s a slight sting when I apply it on my lash line. Not recommended!</li>
