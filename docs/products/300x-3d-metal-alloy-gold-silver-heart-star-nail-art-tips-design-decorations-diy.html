            <li>Though there were a lot of discouraging comments about this seller I went with my better judgement and decided to purchase the studs.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad I did because it&#x27;s just what I have been looking for at such an awesome price.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t give me any problems.</li>

            <li>The listing is truthful, you get gold and silver metal studs.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re okay.  </li>
            <li>They are cute and I will use them, but I wish they had a pointed dome.</li>

            <li>, overall I am very satisfied !!</li>
            <li>Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy more.</li>
            <li>but I was expecting more of them.</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>my customers mostly get gold</li>
            <li>Its okay, I guess.</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>I received the studs and they are perfect love them and will totally buy again😍</li>
            <li>but size is okay.</li>
            <li>They look like plastic with a shiny metal looking top coat.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li>Just the envelope and shipping alone was probably way more than 76 cents.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Oh and did I mention these are so cute.</li>
            <li>But they are perfect size just don&#x27;t last!</li>
            <li>Love them..</li>
            <li>After my mani was finished I applied a top coat over the nails and the studs stayed on for over a week</li>
            <li>for nail art, simply just add a top coat over the nail you want the stud(s) and using a dotting tool or toothpick, put some top coat on the tool to pick up the studs (this works best for no matter what the project is youre using these for).</li>
            <li>I have a bunch of plastic rhinestones but fell in love when I saw these.</li>
            <li>I love them, I used them on my nails as soon as i got them</li>
            <li>they are okay, i dont like that the backs are hallowed out.</li>
            <li>If your into nails like me then you will love  this square metal piece</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I recommend sealing them under a gel top coat to make sure they stick.</li>
            <li>These studs are really cute...</li>
            <li>might as well get them for how cheap they are!</li>
            <li>I would order more again.</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>I love it, it came on time</li>
            <li>the color doesnt disapear when I put a top coat over it</li>
            <li>So cute.</li>
            <li>but they were so cheap and look nice.</li>
            <li>and I have way more silver than gold.</li>
            <li>but for the price I paid I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>GET THEM FROM HERE!! :)</li>
            <li>Love these for my at home mani&#x27;s but the gold ones chip and flake even with a top coat.</li>
            <li>But overall there perfect!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to buy more product from here!</li>
            <li>any longer these are such a cool product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>These are cute and I love to inlay them in gel nails.</li>
            <li>I thought I had more like 100 than 300.</li>
            <li>Find me &amp; my nail designs on Instagram - username is thefragrancejunkie :)</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with the product.</li>
            <li>I guess more?</li>
            <li>but I ordered more things from china and they got here a week ago.</li>
            <li>I got a lot of compliments on them too :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE these, im a nail tech</li>
            <li>I love these studs they are just so adorable to add on to nails</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I do Gel nails and this does not work well with gel topcoat.&lt;br /&gt;Without any top coat, the gold color peels and turns into silver in a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The metal studs are ok.</li>
            <li>I love the studs though .</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great to place on one or two accent nails at the cuticle or in a straight line</li>

            <li>Wish they were better, I used a lot of product to keep them from falling off to no avail, they would be great for acrylic and gel nails but on natural nails with just top coat as the glue</li>
            <li>but they look good when you first put them on.</li>
            <li>just as described/pictured, shipping was fast and [packaged nicely, thank you!</li>

            <li>Wish they curved to your nail better but not bad for the price!</li>
            <li>These are great for my nails and for my new phone, I just use some supper glue and they stay on.</li>
            <li>Yeah they are cute, but the corners stick up and they catch easily.</li>
            <li>and I am sure that they are fine.</li>
            <li>Very cool.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re cute and glue fine to nails (and surprisingly stayed on for a whole week)</li>
            <li>Best $0.68 I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
            <li>Im sure they are going to look super cute on my nails.</li>
            <li>i create cool designs and the studs add flava!</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply and stick well.</li>
            <li>These are great for doing nail art, can make many different designs.  </li>
            <li>it was easy to position the rest.</li>
            <li>then that I received the full quantity and they stayed on for two weeks with two layers of gel polish top coat.  </li>
            <li>I love them and also they look cool to.</li>
            <li>how pretty n nice my nails look</li>
            <li>These were perfect, the size was right and they stayed on really well until i was ready to take them off.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m fine with just silver.</li>
            <li>The studs were super cute.</li>
            <li>Omg it came early super great.</li>
            <li>really works!! :)</li>
            <li>These little square studs are awesome!</li>
            <li>The studs were perfect for my nail designs, AND a little pack of bonus 3D decals were attached to my order.</li>
            <li>A huge</li>
            <li>Quality is great quantity is not definitely not 300 pieces</li>
            <li>and they are cheap</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t fit 100% of the way</li>
            <li>I have started to do my own nails and its so much cheaper</li>
            <li>This was cheap</li>
            <li>it s fun and stick well with top coat as a glue.</li>
            <li>But they were so cheap and why not take a risk ?</li>
            <li>Comes with a lot of them for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>It does nto look like 300 to me, but I&#x27;m not going to count because they were so cheap.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I&#x27;ll actually get the gold lol and not another set of silver.</li>
            <li>but it was worth it, and the price is even better</li>
            <li>Good quality came in on time, and with a lil extra gift :)</li>
            <li>These tiny metal studs are great and unique.</li>
            <li>they are so cute, and u can do so much with them, they are easy to glue on and easy to move around</li>
            <li>Exactly what ive been wanting to do my nails with!!</li>
            <li>Very worth it.</li>
            <li>They are so worth it!</li>
            <li>I wish I could be totally excited about these</li>
            <li>I was excited</li>
            <li>These are fun!</li>
            <li>These are really tiny, but the nice thing about these is you can use them to create any design or look you want!</li>
            <li>After the nails are painted with color and cured I put a top coat of top it off gelish then place the rhinestone on- cure for 2 minutes, then I do another top it off coat over the entire nail, cure it, wipe with alcohol pad</li>
            <li>But they are cute at first.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m really excited i cant wait</li>
            <li>Did my nails with these studs for the first  just love it</li>
            <li>I did my nails in the average length and was able to get  four on the nail I like these more than the 4mm ones so cute!</li>
            <li>They are so nice I live them</li>
            <li>These nail studs are a fun and easy form of doing nail art.</li>
            <li>Packaged very cheaply but if you&#x27;re really into nail design</li>
            <li>for the right price!</li>
            <li>The studs were just what I expected, they work great on the nails.</li>
            <li>i recommend using nail glue to keep them on rather than just a top coat so it will stay much longer.</li>
            <li>nicely concaved to contour of natural nail shape.</li>
            <li>There cool to put on</li>
            <li>Got these earlier than I was expecting which was good.</li>
            <li>Color was okay and shipped fast</li>
            <li>Cool.</li>
            <li>The colors are true silver and gold.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly I took a chance and it came within two weeks but was a total lie.</li>
            <li>These are so cool looking</li>
            <li>I think this was really cool</li>
            <li>I love them so much, I use them one a week.</li>
            <li>and they were also under $2.00 not bad at all.....</li>
            <li>Other than that its a great product.</li>
            <li>They are very small and they are perfect for my nails they look just like the picture shown.</li>
            <li>These will be really cute for some designs, and I already know I plan on ordering more of these soon enough.</li>
            <li>One thing i did notice was that the gold studs were smaller than the silver and they came to a point while the silver came to more of a square shape on top.</li>
            <li>In this kit great product just not enough thanks though</li>
            <li>They fell off fairly quickly, but perhaps using acrylic glue will make them stay longer</li>
            <li>They say forever with a dab of super glue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better if you use nail glue to secure them as opposed to clear nail polish because they stay on longer.</li>
            <li>They are super shiny silver and gold jewels.</li>
            <li>make sure you coat the top with regular topcoat or something.</li>
            <li>I even tried a dot of super glue, but no luck.  </li>
            <li>They look great, I had so much fun creating my manicure with them and went a little &amp;#34;stud crazy&amp;#34; but it was a lot of fun!</li>
            <li>I am very very satisfied.came somewhat fast, and I&#x27;m in love with them.</li>
            <li>Product was great exactly what I expected and what I got.</li>
            <li>if youre wanting to use these for nail art, theyre perfect for the size of your nails, long or short.</li>
            <li>these are exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Comes exactly how they are pictured!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>These were exactly as described and came with silver and gold!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, so cute and tiny!</li>
            <li>Came in early and looked nice didn&#x27;t look cheap , wonderful , difficult to apply at first</li>
            <li>Cute, super cute, really cute, lol came on time and the material is not some cheap little thin thing.</li>
            <li>so these square studs are a very very common trend, they are very beautiful and stay on snug</li>
            <li>Ehh wouldn&#x27;t buy again but it has come useful for craft</li>
            <li>They are still useful.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Now that I know how fun studs can be</li>
            <li>I am having so much fun with nail art.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it, way cheaper than a nail salon.</li>
            <li>Also, if you apply clear polish on top of the gold studs, they begin to turn silver after a while.</li>
            <li>For the price it was worth it</li>
            <li>They look very light and pretty consistent, so they should look good on a nail and not weigh them down like a real metal stud might.</li>
            <li>Also, they shipped so quickly and the item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>it took forever to come and didn&#x27;t even have the right amount.</li>
            <li>I got this product and it wasn&#x27;t the right product...</li>
            <li>Every girl love to rock silver and gold wheather it with a pair of jeans or a sexy black dress.</li>
            <li>Then i recieved a new package and got one with gold studs that looked fine</li>
            <li>These make killer manicures, studs are super easy to store and apply, stick well with nail glue and really work with the new studded mani trend.</li>
            <li>Product is small which is great for my nails.</li>
            <li>I really like these studs, adds a cool effect to nail art.</li>
            <li>In my oppinion they are the perfect size and they dont really have as hollow of a back as it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li>and they stick very well with a top clear coat of nail polish!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and add such a unique twist on a mani.  </li>
            <li>I wish I would of gotten it right the first time.</li>
            <li>Great buy at such a low price!</li>
            <li>They are the perfect touch to an edgy but also classy nail art.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast for an order from China.</li>
            <li>other than that i was very pleased</li>
            <li>they are a nice gold and the silver ones are silver not clear !!</li>
            <li>They shipped very fast, which is always a plus.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>the price is unbelievable amazing!</li>
            <li>First off shipping took forever</li>
            <li>exactly how I planned now</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;i used 10 pcs at first design</li>
            <li>the description is exactly what it says![:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but you have to use enough top coat in order for them to stay on.</li>
            <li>love this, not only for the nails my daughter and her frenz uses it for decor on their phone or folders.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve truly been enjoying playing around with different ways of arranging them.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that the gold ones turn silver after adding a top coat which is a bummer.</li>
            <li>I dabbed top coat on nail, then picked up studs with topcoat on toothpick, placed, and topcoated entire nail.</li>
            <li>the first time, the seller separated the gold and silver.</li>
            <li>the only reason I didn&#x27;t give this a 5 is because I received more gold than silver</li>
            <li>but overall I love these</li>
            <li>If you want better than this, spend the extra money.</li>
            <li>I just used these for the first time.</li>
            <li>Anyway they are exactly like the studs in the pictures.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, these studs are perfect for nail art, and I love them and will definitely repurchase, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend  them to beginner nail artists because they can be difficult to use for someone who has never done it before.</li>
            <li>;-)  deff.will order more similar to this!!!</li>
            <li>Product is exactly as the picture shown.</li>
            <li>They r so cute but the life of these things on ur nails is short....</li>
            <li>how ever you want all you need is some pretty color nail polish and these design</li>
            <li>When I first got them I was upset.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what you order.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what they look like...</li>
            <li>Very neat for nail art!</li>
            <li>I love doing different things on my nails and do my nails sometimes twice a week.</li>
            <li>Would TOTALLY recommend for those who love to do nails.</li>
            <li>The only problems are that the gold coloring comes off with nail polish remover and they will not stay on for more than a day without acrylic nail glue.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more again in the future.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I would suggest for the gold studs, is to put a top coat over it because it will fade off if  </li>
            <li>I only use a tacky top coat drop them on let dry and finish with another top coat they stay on my nails till I take them off.  </li>
            <li>quality need be better overall is easy to work with not shiny enough not all even</li>
            <li>The package came waaaaay before I expected it and everything looks good so far.</li>
            <li>I will buy more in the future absolutely..</li>
            <li>I recommend nail glue to place them on your nails, I used clear coat nail polish, and they fell off pretty quickly..</li>
            <li>this is pretty much what i was looking for even though i dont use them as often as i thought i would.</li>
            <li>and they came pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Came in early true to picture, wish the silver and gold was seperated.</li>
            <li>they pop off incredibly easy and all ur left with are a silicone outline of a square...</li>
            <li>I will certainly order these again.</li>
            <li>I received large square studs.</li>
            <li>But there aren&#x27;t a lot if you&#x27;re looking for large quantities.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for use on nails, iphone cases, or other small items.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just a little over two weeks turnaround time, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>The products were great, the dress is a little sheer</li>
            <li>Make sure to put a top coat over the entire nail and studs after letting them completely set and dry!</li>
            <li>Too big for nail design unless you have huge fingers</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping</li>
            <li>Definitely not 300 of them in there, but they&#x27;re cheap and work well.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and product as described.  </li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to studs to use in nail art.</li>
            <li>For some reason I expected more.</li>
            <li>i thought they would be smaller, i cant fit them onto my nails even.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, comes with gold and silver studs.</li>
            <li>Add one or a whole bunch of them</li>
            <li>But they are really big maybe two can fit on a nail.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for nail studs for the longest and couldn&#x27;t find any for cheap just to test them out , but I finally stumbled onto these !</li>
            <li>I really am exited to get this</li>
            <li>I really like this app</li>
            <li>Advertises metal studs we received cheap plastic squared and the gold is yellow not even close to gold.  </li>
            <li>it came in to big to even fit in my nail</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not complaining since the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>And really, I doubt she would ever use all 300 of them even if there really is 300 in there.</li>
            <li>Really, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still use them but was really looking for studs</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t pay much</li>
            <li>they are very durable.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I think there really is 300 as they say.</li>
            <li>Really stylist if you know how to use them.</li>
            <li>and they stay on very well.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I really like the studs.</li>
            <li>very dissapointed.....and wont be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t work so much.</li>
            <li>The one downfall is it did not stay on my nails very well.</li>
            <li>so sometimes I have problems applying the product to make it straight, but I am still learning.</li>
            <li>Maybe even apply them before your first coat is dry, just so they are secure.</li>
            <li>They go on so easily and they stay for so long.</li>
            <li>These are a perfect size...big enough to see yet small enough to fit...smooth and doesn&#x27;t snag on things.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these and was so excited to receive them because I&#x27;m really big into doing my nails myself.</li>
            <li>But other than that the product was okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this product four stars because their a bit bigger than i expected but overall their great</li>
            <li>I got these before i expected, look so cool!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re careful with your removal you could easily reuse them as well.</li>
            <li>nothing less:)</li>
            <li>This nail art pieces were really affordable, they are really fun to work with them, I will totally purchase again.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t particularly like these.</li>
            <li>However of what I did receive they were decent quality.</li>
            <li>They came in a little zip lock that makes it look like there aren&#x27;t that many.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE LITTLE STUDDS FOR THE NAILS</li>
            <li>I love these little square metal designs, You can design your nails  </li>
            <li>These were well worth the wait on international shipping.</li>
            <li>There were even a few more in the bag than what it said.</li>
            <li>Just to make sure it stays long enough.</li>
            <li>Gold on one side and silver on the other add a great little pop to manicures!</li>
            <li>I expected only gold, but I love that I got both.</li>
            <li>When first seeing this product and seeing how long it was going to take to come, I wasn&#x27;t really to into buying the product.</li>
            <li>I thought that the inside of the studs would me solid instead of hollow, but I am still able to work with them.</li>
            <li>Love these little studs!</li>
            <li>they adhere to my nails just fine because of the flat back.</li>
            <li>I like these little studs so much, however I wish they were a bit smaller and came with more for what I paid for them.</li>
            <li>I received clear rhinestones..not metal studs jut like shown in the picture!</li>
            <li>Shipping was within promised time frame (considering how far it had to come!)</li>
            <li>Definitely have to adhere with nail glue, but that&#x27;s not difficult.</li>
            <li>First there&#x27;s not 300 and second</li>
            <li>soooo pretty, only used once so far</li>
            <li>These are kind of difficult to use at first, but I always get a bunch of compliments whenever I use them.</li>
            <li>The silver ones didnt lay completely flat on the nail, but it smoothed over pretty well after topcoat.</li>
            <li>These are the most helpful little stud when wanted to make your nails look simple but fashionable.</li>
            <li>in the picture they look like silver studs and when i received them they looked like clear crystals.</li>
            <li>Clear and bronze.</li>
            <li>cover with 2 clear coats)</li>
            <li>complete disappointment!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, doesn&#x27;t really look like 300 of them, but I&#x27;m not counting each individual one, so don&#x27;t quote me on that</li>
            <li>I ordered them early around October 6th for Christmas</li>
            <li>&amp; it came over 2 weeks early.</li>
            <li>The product was delivered surprisingly fast considering it was coming from outside the country.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say they completely sucked.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would recommend these as long as you&#x27;re not expecting too much from them, which if you&#x27;re expecting 300 real metal studs for 76 cents and free shipping from Singapore in a bubble wrap envelope, you&#x27;re just being an unrealistic cheap skate.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when these arrived earlier then expected, they arrived 11 days after ordering.</li>
            <li>Not exactly as advertised, but still worth the price.</li>
            <li>Cool little peices for my nails.</li>
            <li>But other than that I loe them, I&#x27;m actually wearing them right now!</li>
            <li>I seen peoples reviews saying there not silver there a different color or they look cheap.. not true at all.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no pyramid shape to them at all, just square with a flat top and the gold is a little yellow for my taste.  </li>
            <li>but I actually would rather the gold &amp; silver be separated next time it takes so much time with my clients to separate them</li>
            <li>kind of disappointing since u have to spend so much time doing ur manicure.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is I only got silver which isn&#x27;t really a problem</li>
            <li>It barely had any!</li>
            <li>You get a tiny little ziploc full of these stuff.  </li>
            <li>Gives ur nails that edgy appearance but at cheap price.</li>
            <li>I received clear and yellow plastic squares!</li>
            <li>I received clear and yellow plastic jewels instead of the metal studs.</li>
            <li>given I was only using clear nail polish to keep them on.</li>
            <li>I received plastic rhinestones in yellow and clear.</li>
            <li>I ordered studs and got yellow and clear rhinestones.</li>
            <li>i spent so much time trying to separate them</li>
            <li>They dont stick off your nail far enough to be caught on anything (sometimes they dont stick off at all).</li>
            <li>got here really rapidly than what I expected.</li>
            <li>It was too much of a hassle to mail the product back, so I kept them and will eventually throw then away when cleaning out a drunk drawer later in life, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>I was happy because they arrived so fast, but it was extremely disappointing when I went through and counted them because a small bag that it was shipped</li>
            <li>It only works if you apply directly to the middle of the nail, in my case.</li>
            <li>I just received theses and I was very very worried because there were so many bad reviews about receiving yellow and clear squares.</li>
            <li>it said there were less really hoped they were all in the bag</li>
            <li>they came a little earlier than it was surpose to come, they are metal and amazingly cute, however im not sure if there is 300</li>
            <li>I would have like this product allot better if the color wasn&#x27;t too dull and bland.</li>
            <li>I wore them for a whole two weeks and only little of the color faded.</li>

            <li> Though there were a lot of discouraging comments about this seller I went with my better judgement and decided to purchase the studs.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m glad I did because it&#x27;s just what I have been looking for at such an awesome price.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t give me any problems.</li>
            <li> but i have sooooooo many ideas for these studs....</li>
            <li> I use these on everyone &amp; I&#x27;ll be buying more soon</li>
            <li> The listing is truthful, you get gold and silver metal studs.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re okay.  </li>
            <li> They are cute and I will use them, but I wish they had a pointed dome.</li>
            <li> I love these nail art piece</li>

            <li> Def recommend :)</li>
            <li> My clients love them.</li>
            <li> , overall I am very satisfied !!</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy more.</li>
            <li> but I was expecting more of them.</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> my customers mostly get gold</li>
            <li> Its okay, I guess.</li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> I received the studs and they are perfect love them and will totally buy again😍</li>
            <li> but size is okay.</li>
            <li> They look like plastic with a shiny metal looking top coat.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li> Just the envelope and shipping alone was probably way more than 76 cents.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Oh and did I mention these are so cute.</li>
            <li> But they are perfect size just don&#x27;t last!</li>
            <li> Love them..</li>
            <li> After my mani was finished I applied a top coat over the nails and the studs stayed on for over a week</li>
            <li> for nail art, simply just add a top coat over the nail you want the stud(s) and using a dotting tool or toothpick, put some top coat on the tool to pick up the studs (this works best for no matter what the project is youre using these for).</li>
            <li> I have a bunch of plastic rhinestones but fell in love when I saw these.</li>
            <li> I love them, I used them on my nails as soon as i got them</li>
            <li> they are okay, i dont like that the backs are hallowed out.</li>
            <li> If your into nails like me then you will love  this square metal piece</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I recommend sealing them under a gel top coat to make sure they stick.</li>
            <li> These studs are really cute...</li>
            <li> might as well get them for how cheap they are!</li>
            <li> I would order more again.</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> I love it, it came on time</li>
            <li> the color doesnt disapear when I put a top coat over it</li>
            <li> So cute.</li>
            <li> but they were so cheap and look nice.</li>
            <li> and I have way more silver than gold.</li>
            <li> but for the price I paid I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> GET THEM FROM HERE!! :)</li>
            <li> Love these for my at home mani&#x27;s but the gold ones chip and flake even with a top coat.</li>
            <li> But overall there perfect!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to buy more product from here!</li>
            <li> any longer these are such a cool product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These are cute and I love to inlay them in gel nails.</li>
            <li> I thought I had more like 100 than 300.</li>
            <li> Find me &amp; my nail designs on Instagram - username is thefragrancejunkie :)</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with the product.</li>
            <li> I guess more?</li>
            <li> but I ordered more things from china and they got here a week ago.</li>
            <li> I got a lot of compliments on them too :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE these, im a nail tech</li>
            <li> I love these studs they are just so adorable to add on to nails</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I do Gel nails and this does not work well with gel topcoat.&lt;br /&gt;Without any top coat, the gold color peels and turns into silver in a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The metal studs are ok.</li>
            <li> I love the studs though .</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great to place on one or two accent nails at the cuticle or in a straight line</li>
            <li> I love doing my nails and getting this nail supply make it better both at home n in the nail salon.</li>
            <li> Its good for what its worth</li>
            <li> I received the product and it seems to have more than 300 pieces.</li>
            <li> im sure it will work for or how it suppose to</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so many ways to use these babies.</li>
            <li> need more for that price.</li>
            <li> i love the colors</li>
            <li> Other than my own mistake, they look great on, and I got a lot of compliments.!</li>
            <li> More like 60 pieces but still super cute!</li>
            <li> Great Price, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Super cute!  </li>
            <li> Super cute!</li>
            <li> very cheap, easy to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish they were better, I used a lot of product to keep them from falling off to no avail, they would be great for acrylic and gel nails but on natural nails with just top coat as the glue</li>
            <li> but they look good when you first put them on.</li>
            <li> just as described/pictured, shipping was fast and [packaged nicely, thank you!</li>
            <li> havent tried the product but its just as described and looks pretty good.....</li>
            <li> Wish they curved to your nail better but not bad for the price!</li>
            <li> These are great for my nails and for my new phone, I just use some supper glue and they stay on.</li>
            <li> Yeah they are cute, but the corners stick up and they catch easily.</li>
            <li> and I am sure that they are fine.</li>
            <li> Very cool.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re cute and glue fine to nails (and surprisingly stayed on for a whole week)</li>
            <li> Best $0.68 I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
            <li> Im sure they are going to look super cute on my nails.</li>
            <li> i create cool designs and the studs add flava!</li>
            <li> They are easy to apply and stick well.</li>
            <li> These are great for doing nail art, can make many different designs.  </li>
            <li> it was easy to position the rest.</li>
            <li> then that I received the full quantity and they stayed on for two weeks with two layers of gel polish top coat.  </li>
            <li> I love them and also they look cool to.</li>
            <li> how pretty n nice my nails look</li>
            <li> These were perfect, the size was right and they stayed on really well until i was ready to take them off.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m fine with just silver.</li>
            <li> The studs were super cute.</li>
            <li> Omg it came early super great.</li>
            <li> really works!! :)</li>
            <li> These little square studs are awesome!</li>
            <li> The studs were perfect for my nail designs, AND a little pack of bonus 3D decals were attached to my order.</li>
            <li> A huge</li>
            <li> Quality is great quantity is not definitely not 300 pieces</li>
            <li> and they are cheap</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t fit 100% of the way</li>
            <li> I have started to do my own nails and its so much cheaper</li>
            <li> This was cheap</li>
            <li> it s fun and stick well with top coat as a glue.</li>
            <li> But they were so cheap and why not take a risk ?</li>
            <li> Comes with a lot of them for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> It does nto look like 300 to me, but I&#x27;m not going to count because they were so cheap.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I&#x27;ll actually get the gold lol and not another set of silver.</li>
            <li> but it was worth it, and the price is even better</li>
            <li> Good quality came in on time, and with a lil extra gift :)</li>
            <li> These tiny metal studs are great and unique.</li>
            <li> they are so cute, and u can do so much with them, they are easy to glue on and easy to move around</li>
            <li> Exactly what ive been wanting to do my nails with!!</li>
            <li> Very worth it.</li>
            <li> They are so worth it!</li>
            <li> I wish I could be totally excited about these</li>
            <li> I was excited</li>
            <li> These are fun!</li>
            <li> These are really tiny, but the nice thing about these is you can use them to create any design or look you want!</li>
            <li> After the nails are painted with color and cured I put a top coat of top it off gelish then place the rhinestone on- cure for 2 minutes, then I do another top it off coat over the entire nail, cure it, wipe with alcohol pad</li>
            <li> But they are cute at first.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really excited i cant wait</li>
            <li> Did my nails with these studs for the first  just love it</li>
            <li> I did my nails in the average length and was able to get  four on the nail I like these more than the 4mm ones so cute!</li>
            <li> They are so nice I live them</li>
            <li> These nail studs are a fun and easy form of doing nail art.</li>
            <li> Packaged very cheaply but if you&#x27;re really into nail design</li>
            <li> for the right price!</li>
            <li> The studs were just what I expected, they work great on the nails.</li>
            <li> i recommend using nail glue to keep them on rather than just a top coat so it will stay much longer.</li>
            <li> nicely concaved to contour of natural nail shape.</li>
            <li> There cool to put on</li>
            <li> Got these earlier than I was expecting which was good.</li>
            <li> Color was okay and shipped fast</li>
            <li> Cool.</li>
            <li> The colors are true silver and gold.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly I took a chance and it came within two weeks but was a total lie.</li>
            <li> These are so cool looking</li>
            <li> I think this was really cool</li>
            <li> I love them so much, I use them one a week.</li>
            <li> and they were also under $2.00 not bad at all.....</li>
            <li> Other than that its a great product.</li>
            <li> They are very small and they are perfect for my nails they look just like the picture shown.</li>
            <li> These will be really cute for some designs, and I already know I plan on ordering more of these soon enough.</li>
            <li> One thing i did notice was that the gold studs were smaller than the silver and they came to a point while the silver came to more of a square shape on top.</li>
            <li> In this kit great product just not enough thanks though</li>
            <li> They fell off fairly quickly, but perhaps using acrylic glue will make them stay longer</li>
            <li> They say forever with a dab of super glue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better if you use nail glue to secure them as opposed to clear nail polish because they stay on longer.</li>
            <li> They are super shiny silver and gold jewels.</li>
            <li> make sure you coat the top with regular topcoat or something.</li>
            <li> I even tried a dot of super glue, but no luck.  </li>
            <li> They look great, I had so much fun creating my manicure with them and went a little &amp;#34;stud crazy&amp;#34; but it was a lot of fun!</li>
            <li> I am very very satisfied.came somewhat fast, and I&#x27;m in love with them.</li>
            <li> Product was great exactly what I expected and what I got.</li>
            <li> if youre wanting to use these for nail art, theyre perfect for the size of your nails, long or short.</li>
            <li> these are exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Comes exactly how they are pictured!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> These were exactly as described and came with silver and gold!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, so cute and tiny!</li>
            <li> Came in early and looked nice didn&#x27;t look cheap , wonderful , difficult to apply at first</li>
            <li> Cute, super cute, really cute, lol came on time and the material is not some cheap little thin thing.</li>
            <li> so these square studs are a very very common trend, they are very beautiful and stay on snug</li>
            <li> Ehh wouldn&#x27;t buy again but it has come useful for craft</li>
            <li> They are still useful.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Now that I know how fun studs can be</li>
            <li> I am having so much fun with nail art.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it, way cheaper than a nail salon.</li>
            <li> Also, if you apply clear polish on top of the gold studs, they begin to turn silver after a while.</li>
            <li> For the price it was worth it</li>
            <li> They look very light and pretty consistent, so they should look good on a nail and not weigh them down like a real metal stud might.</li>
            <li> Also, they shipped so quickly and the item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> it took forever to come and didn&#x27;t even have the right amount.</li>
            <li> I got this product and it wasn&#x27;t the right product...</li>
            <li> Every girl love to rock silver and gold wheather it with a pair of jeans or a sexy black dress.</li>
            <li> Then i recieved a new package and got one with gold studs that looked fine</li>
            <li> These make killer manicures, studs are super easy to store and apply, stick well with nail glue and really work with the new studded mani trend.</li>
            <li> Product is small which is great for my nails.</li>
            <li> I really like these studs, adds a cool effect to nail art.</li>
            <li> In my oppinion they are the perfect size and they dont really have as hollow of a back as it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> and they stick very well with a top clear coat of nail polish!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and add such a unique twist on a mani.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would of gotten it right the first time.</li>
            <li> Great buy at such a low price!</li>
            <li> They are the perfect touch to an edgy but also classy nail art.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast for an order from China.</li>
            <li> other than that i was very pleased</li>
            <li> they are a nice gold and the silver ones are silver not clear !!</li>
            <li> They shipped very fast, which is always a plus.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> the price is unbelievable amazing!</li>
            <li> First off shipping took forever</li>
            <li> exactly how I planned now</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;i used 10 pcs at first design</li>
            <li> the description is exactly what it says![:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but you have to use enough top coat in order for them to stay on.</li>
            <li> love this, not only for the nails my daughter and her frenz uses it for decor on their phone or folders.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve truly been enjoying playing around with different ways of arranging them.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the gold ones turn silver after adding a top coat which is a bummer.</li>
            <li> I dabbed top coat on nail, then picked up studs with topcoat on toothpick, placed, and topcoated entire nail.</li>
            <li> the first time, the seller separated the gold and silver.</li>
            <li> the only reason I didn&#x27;t give this a 5 is because I received more gold than silver</li>
            <li> but overall I love these</li>
            <li> If you want better than this, spend the extra money.</li>
            <li> I just used these for the first time.</li>
            <li> Anyway they are exactly like the studs in the pictures.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, these studs are perfect for nail art, and I love them and will definitely repurchase, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend  them to beginner nail artists because they can be difficult to use for someone who has never done it before.</li>
            <li> ;-)  deff.will order more similar to this!!!</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as the picture shown.</li>
            <li> They r so cute but the life of these things on ur nails is short....</li>
            <li> how ever you want all you need is some pretty color nail polish and these design</li>
            <li> When I first got them I was upset.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what you order.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what they look like...</li>
            <li> Very neat for nail art!</li>
            <li> I love doing different things on my nails and do my nails sometimes twice a week.</li>
            <li> Would TOTALLY recommend for those who love to do nails.</li>
            <li> The only problems are that the gold coloring comes off with nail polish remover and they will not stay on for more than a day without acrylic nail glue.</li>
            <li> I will purchase more again in the future.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I would suggest for the gold studs, is to put a top coat over it because it will fade off if  </li>
            <li> I only use a tacky top coat drop them on let dry and finish with another top coat they stay on my nails till I take them off.  </li>
            <li> quality need be better overall is easy to work with not shiny enough not all even</li>
            <li> The package came waaaaay before I expected it and everything looks good so far.</li>
            <li> I will buy more in the future absolutely..</li>
            <li> I recommend nail glue to place them on your nails, I used clear coat nail polish, and they fell off pretty quickly..</li>
            <li> this is pretty much what i was looking for even though i dont use them as often as i thought i would.</li>
            <li> and they came pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Came in early true to picture, wish the silver and gold was seperated.</li>
            <li> they pop off incredibly easy and all ur left with are a silicone outline of a square...</li>
            <li> I will certainly order these again.</li>
            <li> I received large square studs.</li>
            <li> But there aren&#x27;t a lot if you&#x27;re looking for large quantities.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for use on nails, iphone cases, or other small items.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just a little over two weeks turnaround time, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> The products were great, the dress is a little sheer</li>
            <li> Make sure to put a top coat over the entire nail and studs after letting them completely set and dry!</li>
            <li> Too big for nail design unless you have huge fingers</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like these.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> Definitely not 300 of them in there, but they&#x27;re cheap and work well.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and product as described.  </li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to studs to use in nail art.</li>
            <li> For some reason I expected more.</li>
            <li> i thought they would be smaller, i cant fit them onto my nails even.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, comes with gold and silver studs.</li>
            <li> Add one or a whole bunch of them</li>
            <li> But they are really big maybe two can fit on a nail.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for nail studs for the longest and couldn&#x27;t find any for cheap just to test them out , but I finally stumbled onto these !</li>
            <li> I really am exited to get this</li>
            <li> I really like this app</li>
            <li> Advertises metal studs we received cheap plastic squared and the gold is yellow not even close to gold.  </li>
            <li> it came in to big to even fit in my nail</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not complaining since the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> And really, I doubt she would ever use all 300 of them even if there really is 300 in there.</li>
            <li> Really, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still use them but was really looking for studs</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay much</li>
            <li> they are very durable.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I think there really is 300 as they say.</li>
            <li> Really stylist if you know how to use them.</li>
            <li> and they stay on very well.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I really like the studs.</li>
            <li> very dissapointed.....and wont be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t work so much.</li>
            <li> The one downfall is it did not stay on my nails very well.</li>
            <li> so sometimes I have problems applying the product to make it straight, but I am still learning.</li>
            <li> Maybe even apply them before your first coat is dry, just so they are secure.</li>
            <li> They go on so easily and they stay for so long.</li>
            <li> These are a perfect size...big enough to see yet small enough to fit...smooth and doesn&#x27;t snag on things.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these and was so excited to receive them because I&#x27;m really big into doing my nails myself.</li>
            <li> But other than that the product was okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product four stars because their a bit bigger than i expected but overall their great</li>
            <li> I got these before i expected, look so cool!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re careful with your removal you could easily reuse them as well.</li>
            <li> nothing less:)</li>
            <li> This nail art pieces were really affordable, they are really fun to work with them, I will totally purchase again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly like these.</li>
            <li> However of what I did receive they were decent quality.</li>
            <li> They came in a little zip lock that makes it look like there aren&#x27;t that many.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE LITTLE STUDDS FOR THE NAILS</li>
            <li> I love these little square metal designs, You can design your nails  </li>
            <li> These were well worth the wait on international shipping.</li>
            <li> There were even a few more in the bag than what it said.</li>
            <li> Just to make sure it stays long enough.</li>
            <li> Gold on one side and silver on the other add a great little pop to manicures!</li>
            <li> I expected only gold, but I love that I got both.</li>
            <li> When first seeing this product and seeing how long it was going to take to come, I wasn&#x27;t really to into buying the product.</li>
            <li> I thought that the inside of the studs would me solid instead of hollow, but I am still able to work with them.</li>
            <li> Love these little studs!</li>
            <li> they adhere to my nails just fine because of the flat back.</li>
            <li> I like these little studs so much, however I wish they were a bit smaller and came with more for what I paid for them.</li>
            <li> I received clear rhinestones..not metal studs jut like shown in the picture!</li>
            <li> Shipping was within promised time frame (considering how far it had to come!)</li>
            <li> Definitely have to adhere with nail glue, but that&#x27;s not difficult.</li>
            <li> First there&#x27;s not 300 and second</li>
            <li> soooo pretty, only used once so far</li>
            <li> These are kind of difficult to use at first, but I always get a bunch of compliments whenever I use them.</li>
            <li> The silver ones didnt lay completely flat on the nail, but it smoothed over pretty well after topcoat.</li>
            <li> These are the most helpful little stud when wanted to make your nails look simple but fashionable.</li>
            <li> in the picture they look like silver studs and when i received them they looked like clear crystals.</li>
            <li> Clear and bronze.</li>
            <li> cover with 2 clear coats)</li>
            <li> complete disappointment!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, doesn&#x27;t really look like 300 of them, but I&#x27;m not counting each individual one, so don&#x27;t quote me on that</li>
            <li> I ordered them early around October 6th for Christmas</li>
            <li> &amp; it came over 2 weeks early.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered surprisingly fast considering it was coming from outside the country.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say they completely sucked.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend these as long as you&#x27;re not expecting too much from them, which if you&#x27;re expecting 300 real metal studs for 76 cents and free shipping from Singapore in a bubble wrap envelope, you&#x27;re just being an unrealistic cheap skate.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when these arrived earlier then expected, they arrived 11 days after ordering.</li>
            <li> Not exactly as advertised, but still worth the price.</li>
            <li> Cool little peices for my nails.</li>
            <li> But other than that I loe them, I&#x27;m actually wearing them right now!</li>
            <li> I seen peoples reviews saying there not silver there a different color or they look cheap.. not true at all.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no pyramid shape to them at all, just square with a flat top and the gold is a little yellow for my taste.  </li>
            <li> but I actually would rather the gold &amp; silver be separated next time it takes so much time with my clients to separate them</li>
            <li> kind of disappointing since u have to spend so much time doing ur manicure.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is I only got silver which isn&#x27;t really a problem</li>
            <li> It barely had any!</li>
            <li> You get a tiny little ziploc full of these stuff.  </li>
            <li> Gives ur nails that edgy appearance but at cheap price.</li>
            <li> I received clear and yellow plastic squares!</li>
            <li> I received clear and yellow plastic jewels instead of the metal studs.</li>
            <li> given I was only using clear nail polish to keep them on.</li>
            <li> I received plastic rhinestones in yellow and clear.</li>
            <li> I ordered studs and got yellow and clear rhinestones.</li>
            <li> i spent so much time trying to separate them</li>
            <li> They dont stick off your nail far enough to be caught on anything (sometimes they dont stick off at all).</li>
            <li> got here really rapidly than what I expected.</li>
            <li> It was too much of a hassle to mail the product back, so I kept them and will eventually throw then away when cleaning out a drunk drawer later in life, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> I was happy because they arrived so fast, but it was extremely disappointing when I went through and counted them because a small bag that it was shipped</li>
            <li> It only works if you apply directly to the middle of the nail, in my case.</li>
            <li> I just received theses and I was very very worried because there were so many bad reviews about receiving yellow and clear squares.</li>
            <li> it said there were less really hoped they were all in the bag</li>
            <li> they came a little earlier than it was surpose to come, they are metal and amazingly cute, however im not sure if there is 300</li>
            <li> I would have like this product allot better if the color wasn&#x27;t too dull and bland.</li>
            <li> I wore them for a whole two weeks and only little of the color faded.</li>
            <li> These were supposed to be small enough to fit on your nails, instead they&#x27;re half an inch studs with the backs for crafting.</li>
            <li> they are flat enough to not stick up out of the gel</li>
            <li> when I saw the low price for this product, however it took a ridiculously long time for the product to ship to me.</li>
            <li> Took long enough to get here too.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> I received a tiny little bag, with maybe 70 tiny little square rhinestones yellow and clear in color...</li>
            <li> Dont buy them its a complete waste of time.</li>
            <li> They are a little hard to manage, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be looking for other shapes to try.</li>
            <li> But I did notice all the other reviews spoke about receiving the same type of item.</li>
            <li> Also the polish underneath doesn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> before they dry stick one of these on the nail,</li>
            <li> The only minus to them is that the inside is hollow.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that they wouldn&#x27;t stay in place on the nail because they don&#x27;t sit completely flat on the nail (more or less the points of the square are in tact to the nail) but they stayed put</li>
            <li> A little hard to use this item for nail art since it does not always stick on the first time.</li>
            <li> I got the package today and to my complete disappointment they are regular clear and yellow plastic squares, which I already have, instead of the metal ones I wanted.</li>
            <li> sad thing they are barely 150 pcs, very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were slightly tricky to navigate into the proper place on my nails.</li>
            <li> there yellow took a long time just waste of money</li>
            <li> ENDED UP BUYING SEVERAL NAIL ITEMS FOR A FRIEND WHOS STARTING HER SMALL BUSINESS</li>
            <li> But there&#x27;s 150 silver in a little bag and 150 silver &amp; gold in another tiny bag.</li>
            <li> I rate this 3 stars because 3mm is a little big for the nails.</li>
            <li> and I only had about 120 in my little bag.</li>
            <li> I checked the package for possibly another little baggy but there wasn&#x27;t one.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is I haven&#x27;t found a way to make them last or stay on my nails</li>
            <li> These are not really &amp;#34;studs,&amp;#34; they are just silver and gold squares.</li>
            <li> Messy to open but did like.</li>
            <li> I expected this item to take a while to get here, that was no problem.</li>
            <li> Shipping came sooner then expected date which was a plus.</li>
            <li> but I expected that.  </li>
            <li> Even came with a few extra!</li>
            <li> It was before the expected arrival date</li>
            <li> these are not studs and not 3mm.. such a waste of money..</li>
            <li> I did not receive any metal studs that I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected</li>
            <li> I got gold and pink instead of gold and silver.</li>
            <li> but i received the pink bows that are now pictured.</li>
            <li> Le sigh, life is rough.</li>
            <li> shipping was a lot faster than expected they stay on</li>
            <li> The description says gold and silver I received green and pink, and only about 100 studs where the description says 300.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t recieve 300 pieces, they were all yellow and not gold got little to no silver Defentally not worth your money.</li>
            <li> i ordered this product and they sent me about 30 pieces in pink and green, i contacted them and they sent it out again in the same pink and green as opposed to silver and gold.</li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> not exactly 300 of them</li>
            <li> Well, I simply put a small about of nail glue on my finger nail, and used a dotting tool to pick the stud up and place it on the nail.</li>
            <li> Other than that?</li>
            <li> They come in one of the small plastic baggies that extra buttons for clotnes come in.</li>
            <li> The other thing I didn&#x27;t like was the arrival time.</li>
            <li> I have some other studs that I purchased at a drug store.</li>
            <li> This needs a wheel like the other nail appliques.</li>
            <li> Only bad thing was the delivery time but other than that my studs were exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li> I wear them a lot on plain black nails and they give my nails a hard / edgy look (which is fun sometimes).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard getting them to stay on because they are not flat.</li>
            <li> I mean, it looks pretty its just not really functional for long wear unless you apply on fake nails or have wider nails.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong, there really are 300.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really look like metal, but I could be wrong.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Last at least 2 weeks if you don&#x27;t dishes</li>
            <li> The only negative thing that I have to say is it took  some time getting here.</li>
            <li> I got about 30 pieces of PINK and GREEN.</li>
            <li> but I receive pink and green.  </li>
            <li> but I received pink and green.</li>
            <li> I was sent neon green and pink studs instead of gold and silver like I wanted.</li>
            <li> I ordered gold and silver studs and ended up getting green and pink studs.</li>
            <li> but i was let down just a bit when i received all my squared in silver when i thought i was getting a mix of gold and silver.</li>
            <li> Wish they came on black</li>
            <li> Its looks less then 300</li>
            <li> This is my first amazon order over ever been unhappy with.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that they were just put into a little baggie, so storing them for future use will be a little difficult...</li>
            <li> Sticking them to the polish was not good enough.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t too big but not so small that they were hard to work with.</li>
            <li> They arrived in a little plastic bag, and are square plastic rhinestones instead of silver and gold metal studs.</li>
            <li> Little over a week.</li>
            <li> A little tricky to get cause they are stuck to like 5 in one pile.</li>
            <li> I just wish they came in a jar instead of a little baggie</li>
            <li> Since I paid so little for them, I didn&#x27;t even bother returning them, but I will not buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> but it comes in a little ziploc bag.</li>
            <li> but it always sucks when you don&#x27;t get what you expected</li>
            <li> I wasted my money</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> They make it look like it too hours to do you nails when it just took a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Had trouble making them stay on my nail.</li>
            <li> but i had trouble with them popping off</li>
            <li> The nail studs come in little plastic baggies that make it hard to get out when your nails are wet!</li>
            <li> theyre a bit on the small side so handling them takes a little patience.</li>
            <li> They look like little studs!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and the number of studs couldnt have been more that 80.</li>
            <li> Its a little hard to stay on</li>
            <li> In fact, I was convinced that there were no more than 100 and took them out and counted each and one of them...  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The studs come in small ziplock bags.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I received small plastic squares.</li>
            <li> if not more.</li>
            <li> they put all the studs is a small zip lock bag.</li>
            <li> no more words to say</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to anyone who&#x27;s looking to step up their nail game!</li>
            <li> They are not as small as they show in the pictures.</li>
            <li> and the silver looked flat and weird like it didn&#x27;t have the pyramid like shape.</li>
            <li> not what i expected since its so small, but it wasnt expensive either</li>
            <li> It is hard to stick these squares to the nail.</li>
            <li> There did seem to be at least 200 studs, and i wouldn&#x27;t doubt if all 300 were there.</li>
            <li> This was such a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m to mad because the price is so low, and these are hard to find anywhere else, but they shouldn&#x27;t lie about the amount their supplying.</li>
            <li> &amp; they are so little its almost difficult to do.</li>
            <li> that This is not a good product.</li>
            <li> The nail studs are the correct size, but the gold has a weird reaction to nail glue and turns it silver/ green.</li>
            <li> but if your not creative with your nails they could really look awful.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t do your nails often and if you&#x27;re not experienced, don&#x27;t post on here</li>
            <li> It arrived approximately as estimated</li>
            <li> After reading other bad reviews it sounds like the seller doesn&#x27;t care and just grabs whatever they have and ships it off.</li>
            <li> They took a little while to get here but not too bad considering it&#x27;s over seas .</li>
            <li> and then when i did recieve a package it was the wrong item.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t receive what was shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> , they probably would have lasted longer if I hadn&#x27;t peeled them off when I got bored in class.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> maybe I am doing something wrong (paint my nails,</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with silver and gold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not clear and looks cheap!!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe the price for this horrible quality!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> it made me so mad</li>
            <li> then i took it off and felt bad throwing them.</li>
            <li> so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I received rhinestones, not studs like pictured :(</li>
            <li> This was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Was very unhappy.</li>
            <li> I wish they were all silver (I hate gold</li>
            <li> i hate gold</li>
            <li> This is something I would never have paid for and was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> very very disappointed..</li>
            <li> This is very disappointing!!!</li>
            <li> the worst thing I got  </li>
            <li> and they weren&#x27;t studs as they were described  horrible horrible if I could give them a zero</li>
            <li> Horrible</li>
            <li> very frustrated because there were NO GOLD PIECES whatsoever!</li>
            <li> Horrible item I wish I never bought it and saved my money.</li>
            <li> So I decided to add a customer image to give you guys an idea of what was received, the count was also horribly off.</li>
            <li> I can still use them, they aren&#x27;t horrible, they just are not what I was looking to purchase.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it took forever to come and didn&#x27;t even have the right amount. It barely had any! Don&#x27;t buy. I put a picture to show how many it came with.</li>
            <li> I love these studs for my nail art.  its said that it would take 3 weeks from China and got to me in Virginia in a week and a hal... love them &#x3D;o) will order again</li>
            <li> First off shipping took forever and then when i did recieve a package it was the wrong item. Then i recieved a new package and got one with gold studs that looked fine and the silver looked flat and weird like it didn&#x27;t have the pyramid like shape.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last very long but they look good when you first put them on. The product is amazing and you get a lot of them in packaging. Good luck &amp; have fun!</li>
            <li> I love this product because it stays on my nails and is attractive</li>
            <li> complete disappointment!&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t receive what was shown in the picture!!! I received clear and yellow plastic squares! instead of the metal studs.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d never recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is hard to stick these squares to the nail.</li>
            <li> i like the flexibility this product allows me with my nails.  Shipping was within promised time frame (considering how far it had to come!)</li>
            <li> These are great and exactly how pictured! I wish I would have bought more when I ordered because they are so cute!</li>
            <li> Though there were a lot of discouraging comments about this seller I went with my better judgement and decided to purchase the studs. And I&#x27;m glad I did because it&#x27;s just what I have been looking for at such an awesome price. The package came waaaaay before I expected it and everything looks good so far. I have not had a chance to use them yet but I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t give me any problems. Thanks.</li>
            <li> these are exactly what I wanted! they adhere to my nails just fine because of the flat back. I wish they were all silver (I hate gold so I&#x27;ll probably never use those) but for the price, who cares?</li>
            <li> soooo pretty, only used once so far but i have sooooooo many ideas for these studs....i hate gold so wish they were all silver, but great product great price.</li>
            <li> They are so nice I live them and they came out exactly how I planned now I use these on everyone &amp; I&#x27;ll be buying more soon I&#x27;m running out hehe (:</li>
            <li> A little hard to use this item for nail art since it does not always stick on the first time.</li>
            <li> Came when it said it would and looks just like the picture. they are some sort of metal and I would get it again.</li>
            <li> I really like these. The listing is truthful, you get gold and silver metal studs. These will be really cute for some designs, and I already know I plan on ordering more of these soon enough.</li>
            <li> They are larger than shown in photo. Not the size I wanted. Too big for nail design unless you have huge fingers</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone! Perfect studs for any design! Perfect size and great shine! A must have for nail enthusiasts!</li>
            <li> They are so worth it! They&#x27;re cheap and look great. I&#x27;ve already used it on myself, and they look so cute!</li>
            <li> Super cute!  Just wish the gold ones would have already been separated from the silver ones when I got them!</li>
            <li> Super cute! Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> I wish I could be totally excited about these but they&#x27;re okay.  There&#x27;s no pyramid shape to them at all, just square with a flat top and the gold is a little yellow for my taste.  Other then that I received the full quantity and they stayed on for two weeks with two layers of gel polish top coat.  If you&#x27;re careful with your removal you could easily reuse them as well.</li>
            <li> These are nice. Definitely not 300 of them in there, but they&#x27;re cheap and work well. They look cute on nails!</li>
            <li> These are not really &amp;#34;studs,&amp;#34; they are just silver and gold squares. They are cute and I will use them, but I wish they had a pointed dome.</li>
            <li> i bought these a while ago and i got it before the estimated shipping date. this is pretty much what i was looking for even though i dont use them as often as i thought i would. i recommend using nail glue to keep them on rather than just a top coat so it will stay much longer. really good price as well.</li>
            <li> These are great for my nails and for my new phone, I just use some supper glue and they stay on.</li>
            <li> Messy to open but did like. Ehh wouldn&#x27;t buy again but it has come useful for craft even thought it&#x27;s for nail art.</li>
            <li> The nail studs come in little plastic baggies that make it hard to get out when your nails are wet! The price was great though, and they look good with nail art.</li>
            <li> These were perfect, the size was right and they stayed on really well until i was ready to take them off.</li>
            <li> I love these nail art piece really cute i also use them on my phone case cute really works!! :)</li>
            <li> I did not receive metal studs. I received plastic silver and yellow squares. Not like what is shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> I expected this item to take a while to get here, that was no problem. My problem with this product is that it was NOT the product pictured. They arrived in a little plastic bag, and are square plastic rhinestones instead of silver and gold metal studs. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t receive what was shown in the picture. I received clear and yellow plastic jewels instead of the metal studs. Bummer.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s this? I received clear rhinestones..not metal studs jut like shown in the picture! This is very disappointing!!! Consider yourself warned</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and product as described.  I have not used these yet, but upon inspection they look just as I thought they would.</li>
            <li> gold turns silver but its alright. Its a little hard to stay on cause you need glue dont use regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> I received the gold &amp; silver studs today and I can&#x27;t wait to use them.  They came in a little zip lock that makes it look like there aren&#x27;t that many.  In fact, I was convinced that there were no more than 100 and took them out and counted each and one of them...  Boy was I wrong, there really are 300.  ;)</li>
            <li> nicely concaved to contour of natural nail shape. didn&#x27;t quite keep the metallic color(tarnished). worked super great with gel and gel polish. didn&#x27;t last quite a week on regular polish.</li>
            <li> I received the product on time, but it was not what I ordered. Instead of metal studs, I got white and yellow rhinestones. I was really looking forward to studs to use in nail art. I can still use the rhinestones, but they are definitely not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if the items were seperated. It took me forever to separate but the product is good</li>
            <li> Love the studs&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for nail designs or even for makeup ideas. Definitely will purchase again once I finished them.</li>
            <li> These nail studs are a fun and easy form of doing nail art. I began counting, but got to 50 and stopped. There did seem to be at least 200 studs, and i wouldn&#x27;t doubt if all 300 were there. One thing i did notice was that the gold studs were smaller than the silver and they came to a point while the silver came to more of a square shape on top. I will try to upload pictures of them. The silver ones didnt lay completely flat on the nail, but it smoothed over pretty well after topcoat. They seem to be good quality metal studs. I purchased from beautyyu if anyone was wondering. i received them in about 2 weeks. Not bad from china to California!!</li>
            <li> sad thing they are barely 150 pcs, very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;i used 10 pcs at first design then i took it off and felt bad throwing them. i think i&#x27;ll keep reusing so i dont run out of it.</li>
            <li> For some reason I expected more. I guess 300 sounds like a lot, but when you actually get  it, it does not look like a lot at all but it was a great price.</li>
            <li> the variety was great, but i did not get gold, just silver. i thought they would be smaller, i cant fit them onto my nails even.</li>
            <li> My silver and gold square studs came in today!! super happy about them! :D&lt;br /&gt;The studs come in small ziplock bags.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two sets on july 31st &amp; they were shipped the next day. It took 2 weeks &amp; 2 days to get here. Came sooner than the deliver estimate [:  perfect size , color &amp; it even came with extra studs!! o: that&#x27;s a PLUS!! (yes I counted them aha)&lt;br /&gt; the description is exactly what it says![:&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing again!!</li>
            <li> These tiny metal studs are great and unique. Once on the nails, you will receive compliments everywhere. Great buy at such a low price!</li>
            <li> This was such a disappointment.  It arrived ahead of time but it was not what I was expecting.  Instead of metal studs I received small plastic squares. Do not by this item!</li>
            <li> When I opened the bag, all I found were plastic squares and circles. Yellow and silver. Not the actual studs they show in the picture. They are still useful. I just wish they sent out the actual studs.</li>
            <li> This is a great design but you have to use enough top coat in order for them to stay on. Maybe even apply them before your first coat is dry, just so they are secure. But it is a great accessory for your nails at a very cheap price! :)</li>
            <li> I got this product and it wasn&#x27;t the right product...so I emailed them and they said they will mail it to me. I wish I would of gotten it right the first time.</li>
            <li> These are so awesome!  Definitely have to adhere with nail glue, but that&#x27;s not difficult. Makes so for seriously great nail effects. I wear them a lot on plain black nails and they give my nails a hard / edgy look (which is fun sometimes).</li>
            <li> love this, not only for the nails my daughter and her frenz uses it for decor on their phone or folders.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, comes with gold and silver studs.! I recommend nail glue to place them on your nails, I used clear coat nail polish, and they fell off pretty quickly..Other than my own mistake, they look great on, and I got a lot of compliments.!</li>
            <li> I love these! Comes exactly how they are pictured! Easy to use, so cute and tiny! Can&#x27;t wait to order more</li>
            <li> Quality is great quantity is not definitely not 300 pieces In this kit great product just not enough thanks though</li>
            <li> product came as described. A++</li>
            <li> These are great!&lt;br /&gt;I love them and use them all the time on my gals!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> took forever to get here, about two months but they are nice and i wasn&#x27;t anticipating them so it was fine. i like them:)</li>
            <li> Only bad thing was the delivery time but other than that my studs were exactly what I ordered! Best $0.68 I&#x27;ve ever spent. I got more than what I paid for.  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> They are awesome!! I bought them just to try them out and I was very satisfied.. Add one or a whole bunch of them but they are sure to make any nail design pop!!</li>
            <li> I like these little studs so much, however I wish they were a bit smaller and came with more for what I paid for them. Other than that its a great product.</li>
            <li> I wanted them to be smaller like shown in picture... But they are really big maybe two can fit on a nail. wwwaaay to big...</li>
            <li> in the picture they look like silver studs and when i received them they looked like clear crystals. no gold at all.  shipping took forever! never ordering them again. so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I saw the low price for this product, however it took a ridiculously long time for the product to ship to me. Like 6 weeks I believe. And once I opened them they turned out to not be square metal studs as the description states but square rhinestones. Clear and bronze. This is something I would never have paid for and was very disappointed. It was too much of a hassle to mail the product back, so I kept them and will eventually throw then away when cleaning out a drunk drawer later in life, I&#x27;m sure. This was very disappointing. I wish I could give it zero stars.</li>
            <li> Came in early true to picture, wish the silver and gold was seperated.</li>
            <li> This nail art pieces were really affordable, they are really fun to work with them, I will totally purchase again.</li>
            <li> Pleased with this item!!</li>
            <li> I ordered these January 27th ad received them today February 28th so it took quite awhile. However they are very cute, prob my favorite nail art that I have. I did receive as described square silver and gold studs. I didn&#x27;t count them but there is def a good amt of them I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s 300 if not more. So this was a great purchase and addition to my nail art collection lol and they are cheap and I guarantee you won&#x27;t find them anywhere else ! Def recommend :)</li>
            <li> This product was just as the description, and the picture.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend that you buy this item, especially for the low price.  Definitely worth the purchase. I also think that these 3mm sized ones are perfect for nail art.</li>
            <li> I love the studs! My clients love them. I gave it a 4 only because it did not have 300, it had maybe 150.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for nail studs for the longest and couldn&#x27;t find any for cheap just to test them out , but I finally stumbled onto these ! They took a little while to get here but not too bad considering it&#x27;s over seas . The product itself looks just as pictured and is the perfect size for any lenght nail . My only issue is the packaging , the silver and gold all can mixed together in a tiny zip Baggie . But I still can&#x27;t complain cause I paid next to nothing , overall I am very satisfied !!</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> The products were great, the dress is a little sheer but I can wear sodas underneath, no big deal. .</li>
            <li> I really am exited to get this I hope it comes soon but amazon in genral is great! I really like this app</li>
            <li> Love these little studs! They arrived when I was told they would, were exactly as described, and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is perfect for nail art and I&#x27;ve truly been enjoying playing around with different ways of arranging them. Now that I know how fun studs can be I will definitely be looking for other shapes to try.</li>
            <li> These were well worth the wait on international shipping. What a great price too! I will certainly order these again.</li>
            <li> Boo they sucked! that&#x27;s all................... it&#x27;s hard getting them to stay on because they are not flat. I wouldn&#x27;t buy more.</li>
            <li> Loved the studs! They are the perfect touch to an edgy but also classy nail art. The only thing is that the gold ones turn silver after adding a top coat which is a bummer.</li>
            <li> I liked the studs a lot but I was expecting more of them. Also I wish the gold were separate from the silver studs, sometimes it gets tricky.</li>
            <li> Advertises metal studs we received cheap plastic squared and the gold is yellow not even close to gold.  Buy from someone else...</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast for an order from China. Little over a week. The studs were as described, and I had no problem with them falling off. I dabbed top coat on nail, then picked up studs with topcoat on toothpick, placed, and topcoated entire nail. Stayed on for 4 days until I took them off. Also received a bonus wee gift, nice touch. Would order from this company again.</li>
            <li> this is not studs this is rhinestones! don&#x27;t buy this if you think that you will get whats in the picture</li>
            <li> the worst thing I got  I ordered it thinking I was gonna get 300 pieces of metal studs I got like  40 rinstones and they weren&#x27;t studs as they were described  horrible horrible if I could give them a zero I would</li>
            <li> Serves it&#x27;s purpose. very cute</li>
            <li> I am very very satisfied.came somewhat fast, and I&#x27;m in love with them. A little tricky to get cause they are stuck to like 5 in one pile. But other than that I loe them, I&#x27;m actually wearing them right now! Very happy</li>
            <li> Great price and the studs were a great size. They weren&#x27;t too big but not so small that they were hard to work with. Prefect size and prefect price!</li>
            <li> These are great! worth buying and look very nice. They are easy to apply and stick well. I love them</li>
            <li> These were not gold and silver, nor were there 300 pieces. I got about 30 pieces of PINK and GREEN. Because of the price I can deal with it but it always sucks when you don&#x27;t get what you expected</li>
            <li> Horrible not what I ordered at all it came in to big to even fit in my nail it made me so mad I wasted my money</li>
            <li> I ordered this twice at different times. the first time, the seller separated the gold and silver. my customers mostly get gold so i ordered another set. this time, the studs were all together. i spent so much time trying to separate them</li>
            <li> Its okay, I guess. Its too big for us people with smaller hands and nails. It won&#x27;t fit 100% of the way so it gets caught up by the corners and comes off. I mean, it looks pretty its just not really functional for long wear unless you apply on fake nails or have wider nails. It only works if you apply directly to the middle of the nail, in my case. I might repurchase this products for clients, but definitely not for me.</li>
            <li> This is not what was sent to me pissed! They are very big and it&#x27;s not gold and silver or 3mm</li>
            <li> perfect size to decorate nails, i have even used them for scrapbook embellishments as well. Great buy!</li>
            <li> These are fun! They fell off fairly quickly, but perhaps using acrylic glue will make them stay longer given I was only using clear nail polish to keep them on.</li>
            <li> I love these.  Easy to apply and add such a unique twist on a mani.  I always get compliments when I apply them.</li>
            <li> the only reason I didn&#x27;t give this a 5 is because I received more gold than silver but overall I love these</li>
            <li> very frustrated because there were NO GOLD PIECES whatsoever! now I have to order gold and wait longer. I ordered them cuz it was supposed to be gold AND silver!</li>
            <li> Product came just as described. And are excellent for the price. Although I have not used then yet, i&#x27;m sure they will work excellently.</li>
            <li> There cool to put on but if your not creative with your nails they could really look awful. I tried them and it was not that easy for me lol</li>
            <li> these look awesome on my nails! not exactly 300 of them but I&#x27;m not complaining since the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> I am having so much fun with nail art. I have started to do my own nails and its so much cheaper</li>
            <li> I received the studs and they are perfect love them and will totally buy again😍 and they were also under $2.00 not bad at all.....</li>
            <li> this product is nice. I thought it was going to be smaller but size is okay. I did not like the packaging. they put all the studs is a small zip lock bag. It arrived before the date they said but still took a good 3 weeks to get here.</li>
            <li> Got these earlier than I was expecting which was good. They don&#x27;t really look like metal, but I could be wrong. They look like plastic with a shiny metal looking top coat. Also, doesn&#x27;t really look like 300 of them, but I&#x27;m not counting each individual one, so don&#x27;t quote me on that either. They look very light and pretty consistent, so they should look good on a nail and not weigh them down like a real metal stud might. I got these for a Christmas gift and I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll love them. And really, I doubt she would ever use all 300 of them even if there really is 300 in there. It&#x27;s a good cheap gift for the nail lovers in your life. Really, you can&#x27;t beat the price. Just order them a month or so before you need them and you&#x27;ll be alright; they are coming from somewhere in Asia after all. I ordered them early around October 6th for Christmas and I just got them, 2 months before I needed, so that&#x27;s great. That&#x27;s just a little over two weeks turnaround time, so that&#x27;s nice. Overall, I would recommend these as long as you&#x27;re not expecting too much from them, which if you&#x27;re expecting 300 real metal studs for 76 cents and free shipping from Singapore in a bubble wrap envelope, you&#x27;re just being an unrealistic cheap skate. Just the envelope and shipping alone was probably way more than 76 cents. I mailed a letter to Singapore recently and it cost me $1.10 in postage. I don&#x27;t know how they do it but kudos to them.</li>
            <li> These are really tiny, but the nice thing about these is you can use them to create any design or look you want!</li>
            <li> Love it but I&#x27;d would like it to be in separate bags just easier to use now I have to do it one by one</li>
            <li> I received the product that was advertised!!! They looked great on my nails! Gold and silver metal studs. I was happy with the results.</li>
            <li> You can not beat the price of these yes they did  take a bit longer to arrive but once they  did I was very pleased with the quality and  price. The studs are beautiful and well made. I am so glad I ordered!</li>
            <li> Love them! Perfect for nail art or arts and crafts. Great price too! Can&#x27;t complain I got a great deal for under $2</li>
            <li> I definitely did not get 300 Pieces like I ordered but they are the correct size for my nails. Took long enough to get here too. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy it from this place. If you want better than this, spend the extra money. This was cheap and I got what I paid for, real cheap quality! I won&#x27;t buy from here again!</li>
            <li> Cute, super cute, really cute, lol came on time and the material is not some cheap little thin thing. Oh and did I mention these are so cute.</li>
            <li> The picture shows actual STUDS with a point. I received squares that were actually kinda rounded. Color was okay and shipped fast but I was very disappointed. I&#x27;ll still use them but was really looking for studs</li>
            <li> First there&#x27;s not 300 and second there&#x27;s only silver ones . i gave it 2 stars cause i kinda like them but they ripped me off</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as nice as I thought they&#x27;d be, but they still work and I am happy about it. Cool.</li>
            <li> I got a ton of metal studs!! Some silver, some gold and they all look great! Can&#x27;t wait to use them on my nails (: &amp;&amp;&amp; it came over 2 weeks early.</li>
            <li> Because the stud nails were not all 300 it said there were less really hoped they were all in the bag</li>
            <li> These do not stick on your nails! Horrible item I wish I never bought it and saved my money. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> These little square studs are awesome! Gold on one side and silver on the other add a great little pop to manicures!</li>
            <li> i loved this product but i was let down just a bit when i received all my squared in silver when i thought i was getting a mix of gold and silver. other than that i was very pleased</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for at home manis they stick easily with a base/top or clear coat!!! Plus take to your salon for discounted nails and pedis!!!</li>
            <li> I just used these for the first time. I was afraid that they wouldn&#x27;t stay in place on the nail because they don&#x27;t sit completely flat on the nail (more or less the points of the square are in tact to the nail) but they stayed put so I&#x27;m happy with them. After the nails are painted with color and cured I put a top coat of top it off gelish then place the rhinestone on- cure for 2 minutes, then I do another top it off coat over the entire nail, cure it, wipe with alcohol pad and it&#x27;s all set to go.</li>
            <li> These are great for doing nail art, can make many different designs.  These are a perfect size...big enough to see yet small enough to fit...smooth and doesn&#x27;t snag on things.  I only use a tacky top coat drop them on let dry and finish with another top coat they stay on my nails till I take them off.  A huge + is they are reusable!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a ton in the bag and they&#x27;re very good quality. Definitely worth it, way cheaper than a nail salon.</li>
            <li> The pic shows silver and gold but I receive pink and green.  Was very unhappy.</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars because they come off your nails very easily. But they are perfect size just don&#x27;t last!</li>
            <li> Just received my studs, it took awhile though. I guess that&#x27;s what happens when you order around the holidays!!! Anyway they are exactly like the studs in the pictures. Love them..&lt;br /&gt;Thanks cheeky...&lt;br /&gt;BTW I only gave them 4stars because i havent used them yet..</li>
            <li> I was so excited when these arrived earlier then expected, they arrived 11 days after ordering. They look just like the picture and work perfect for the designs I want.</li>
            <li> I see so many people posting that they aren&#x27;t good, that they won&#x27;t stay on the nail. Well, I&#x27;ll tell you this. If you don&#x27;t do your nails often and if you&#x27;re not experienced, don&#x27;t post on here that This is not a good product. You simply don&#x27;t know how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;I love these studs, they&#x27;re perfect for my nails. The colors are true silver and gold. They shipped very fast, which is always a plus.&lt;br /&gt;How to use? Well, I simply put a small about of nail glue on my finger nail, and used a dotting tool to pick the stud up and place it on the nail. Then I repositioned it with my fingers. After my mani was finished I applied a top coat over the nails and the studs stayed on for over a week, they probably would have lasted longer if I hadn&#x27;t peeled them off when I got bored in class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these studs are perfect for nail art, and I love them and will definitely repurchase, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend  them to beginner nail artists because they can be difficult to use for someone who has never done it before.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I really liked the quality and the colors. I recommend this product because it&#x27;s amazing!!👌</li>
            <li> if youre wanting to use these for nail art, theyre perfect for the size of your nails, long or short. but if youre wanting to use these lets say for decaling your cell phone....not the best idea. theyre a bit on the small side so handling them takes a little patience. for nail art, simply just add a top coat over the nail you want the stud(s) and using a dotting tool or toothpick, put some top coat on the tool to pick up the studs (this works best for no matter what the project is youre using these for).</li>
            <li> I ordered these and was so excited to receive them because I&#x27;m really big into doing my nails myself. I have a bunch of plastic rhinestones but fell in love when I saw these. I got the package today and to my complete disappointment they are regular clear and yellow plastic squares, which I already have, instead of the metal ones I wanted. This is my first amazon order over ever been unhappy with.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THESE IF YOU WANT STUDS! These are not studs they are rhinestones. What a waste of money. If I could give zero stars I would.</li>
            <li> I received rhinestones, not studs like pictured :( They came in a yellow/gold color and a clear/silver color, but were not metal like they were supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Was exactly like described excellent shipping they are very easy to use perfect for nail art designs and anything else you could use them for</li>
            <li> I was supposed to get gold and silver square but I received pink and green. I am not quite happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Omg it came early super great. I also got gold &amp; silver pieces...I expected only gold, but I love that I got both. Looks just like the picture!!! Great deal for the price</li>
            <li> I love them, I used them on my nails as soon as i got them and i have no complaints</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t recieve 300 pieces, they were all yellow and not gold got little to no silver Defentally not worth your money.</li>
            <li> I would have like this product allot better if the color wasn&#x27;t too dull and bland. But other than that the product was okay.</li>
            <li> Good pricr and product</li>
            <li> they good didnt even fall off</li>
            <li> This is perfect for use on nails, iphone cases, or other small items.  Looks great on for an accent nail!</li>
            <li> they are okay, i dont like that the backs are hallowed out.</li>
            <li> Shipping came sooner then expected date which was a plus. If your into nails like me then you will love  this square metal piece it s fun and stick well with top coat as a glue. ;-)  deff.will order more similar to this!!!</li>
            <li> Good product for good price. Will buy again!!!</li>
            <li> When first seeing this product and seeing how long it was going to take to come, I wasn&#x27;t really to into buying the product. Surprisingly I took a chance and it came within two weeks but was a total lie. It say 300; I think I only got about 20. It comes in the smallest zip lock bag and is a total rip off. I&#x27;m to mad because the price is so low, and these are hard to find anywhere else, but they shouldn&#x27;t lie about the amount their supplying.</li>
            <li> More like 60 pieces but still super cute! for the right price! I love them i create cool designs and the studs add flava!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this product. The studs were not metal studs in the picture above.. The studs were the plastic ones instead.</li>
            <li> i ordered this product and they sent me about 30 pieces in pink and green, i contacted them and they sent it out again in the same pink and green as opposed to silver and gold. finally asked for a refund.</li>
            <li> The product arrived as advertised. I love the item and it was at a very great price. Great to add character&lt;br /&gt;to your nails</li>
            <li> they are so cute, and u can do so much with them, they are easy to glue on and easy to move around</li>
            <li> These are awesome for nail art! They dont stick off your nail far enough to be caught on anything (sometimes they dont stick off at all). In my oppinion they are the perfect size and they dont really have as hollow of a back as it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> I just received theses and I was very very worried because there were so many bad reviews about receiving yellow and clear squares. But they were so cheap and why not take a risk ? I am very very happy with what I got. They are not yellow they are a nice gold and the silver ones are silver not clear !! I am very very happy I got these because do my own gel nails with a UV lamp so they will stick in the gel perfectly and I am very excited to use them !!!! Defiantly will buy again !!</li>
            <li> These were supposed to be small enough to fit on your nails, instead they&#x27;re half an inch studs with the backs for crafting.</li>
            <li> The description says gold and silver I received green and pink, and only about 100 studs where the description says 300. I didn&#x27;t pay much so I don&#x27;t care about trying to exchange it. After reading other bad reviews it sounds like the seller doesn&#x27;t care and just grabs whatever they have and ships it off.</li>
            <li> I like these a lot they don&#x27;t change color when they are painted over. they are very durable. I just wish they came in a jar instead of a little baggie</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got 300. But I don&#x27;t use a ton at a time so I&#x27;m not complaining. Wish they curved to your nail better but not bad for the price!</li>
            <li> Just as described, speedy shipping!  Thanks</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. very nice I like it. my teacher and classmates like it as well. no more words to say</li>
            <li> they almost look like they are just squares, they look like studs but not pointy enough for me</li>
            <li> These studs came quickly and are the perfect size, even if you don&#x27;t have enhancements on your nails! They make it look like it too hours to do you nails when it just took a few minutes. I recommend sealing them under a gel top coat to make sure they stick.</li>
            <li> These studs are really cute...they came a lot faster than the estimated delivery time..My only issue is that they were just put into a little baggie, so storing them for future use will be a little difficult...Other than that? I would order from them again...</li>
            <li> Love them! great buy buy, will buy a gain, need more gold ones, worth the money you pay for them.</li>
            <li> I ordered SQUARE metal studs. I received gold and silver stars instead. Since I paid so little for them, I didn&#x27;t even bother returning them, but I will not buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Definatly not 300 but they work so... might as well get them for how cheap they are! Good price so....</li>
            <li> They came late but it was worth the wait. Perfect size and they lasted on a good while. Very satisfied. :-)</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase. They arrived on time. You can&#x27;t beat the product for the price. I would order more again. Im sure they are going to look super cute on my nails.</li>
            <li> I love them but I actually would rather the gold &amp; silver be separated next time it takes so much time with my clients to separate them &amp; they are so little its almost difficult to do.</li>
            <li> Great accent to have in your 3D nails art collection. They say forever with a dab of super glue. Great Price, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Comes with a lot of them for a cheap price. Had trouble making them stay on my nail. Have not tried wit gel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better if you use nail glue to secure them as opposed to clear nail polish because they stay on longer. Also, if you apply clear polish on top of the gold studs, they begin to turn silver after a while. The colors don&#x27;t come separated &amp; doing it on your own can be a pain. Overall I like them &amp; would order them again.</li>
            <li> I love it, it came on time and I got everything and the color doesnt disapear when I put a top coat over it, I dont know why the picture is of nail art bows but the studs are great</li>
            <li> I did my nails in the average length and was able to get  four on the nail I like these more than the 4mm ones so cute!</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as the picture shown. Product came before estimated date which was great. Product is small which is great for my nails.</li>
            <li> just as described/pictured, shipping was fast and [packaged nicely, thank you!</li>
            <li> I put it on the back of my IPhone case and I got SOOOO many compliments! Im so happy that i bought it</li>
            <li> I had not count them but i am sure they are 300 they are a lot.!!! They are very small and they are perfect for my nails they look just like the picture shown. Will order again when  i need more thankz.!!</li>
            <li> Came in early and looked nice didn&#x27;t look cheap , wonderful , difficult to apply at first but you get the hang of it ! I love them !</li>
            <li> Perfect for nails ♡♡♡</li>
            <li> Perfect size for nails. So cute. Wish they came on black but they were so cheap and look nice. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> They r so cute but the life of these things on ur nails is short....they pop off incredibly easy and all ur left with are a silicone outline of a square...kind of disappointing since u have to spend so much time doing ur manicure.  But they are cute at first. They come in one of the small plastic baggies that extra buttons for clotnes come in. I think there really is 300 as they say.</li>
            <li> Love these! Really stylist if you know how to use them. Great buy.</li>
            <li> I was sent neon green and pink studs instead of gold and silver like I wanted. Otherwise they work well but I&#x27;ll probably never use them because the colors dont match anything.</li>
            <li> Like like them good for nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done my nails with them already. I like that the studs are gold and silver. They stick well with a dab of nail glue. It does nto look like 300 to me, but I&#x27;m not going to count because they were so cheap.</li>
            <li> I received what&#x27;s on the picture. wish thy were sent separated. haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet. don&#x27;t think I received 300. and I have way more silver than gold. but for the price I paid I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was hesitate to buy because it had no reviews but let me to you they are perfect! They re a perfect size and come in good packaging! And came in like two days! Want good studs? GET THEM FROM HERE!! :)</li>
            <li> Nice size and works well @Styledbymo90</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE LITTLE STUDDS FOR THE NAILS I HAVE NOT TRIED THEM YET BUT IT CAME WITH PLENTY CAN USE MANNY TIMES.</li>
            <li> These are the most helpful little stud when wanted to make your nails look simple but fashionable. I wore them for a whole two weeks and only little of the color faded. I recommend (:</li>
            <li> I love these little square metal designs, You can design your nails  how ever you want all you need is some pretty color nail polish and these design and you set to go.</li>
            <li> These are perfect. No assorted sizes!, and i can get at lest 3 on my nails, since i have short nails.</li>
            <li> Love these for my at home mani&#x27;s but the gold ones chip and flake even with a top coat. However, for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I received my 3mm nail studs today in the mail and I am very pleased. They were slightly tricky to navigate into the proper place on my nails. However, after taking time to make sure the first one was perfectly square it was easy to position the rest. Make sure to put a top coat over the entire nail and studs after letting them completely set and dry!</li>
            <li> So they finally came after like 2 weeks. They are sooooooo cute!!! The only problem is I only got silver which isn&#x27;t really a problem cause I will personally use the silver ones on myself but I need the gold incase that&#x27;s what my clients will want. So I just gave them a call and the seller is going to resend them. Hopefully I&#x27;ll actually get the gold lol and not another set of silver. But overall there perfect!!! I seen peoples reviews saying there not silver there a different color or they look cheap.. not true at all. They look like little studs! So cute! I love them!</li>
            <li> I just got them and they are perfect! I love the size I like the colors they are just perfect!! Good quality came in on time, and with a lil extra gift :)</li>
            <li> there yellow took a long time just waste of money but it wasnt  alot so it dont matter wont buy again</li>
            <li> What you see is what you get</li>
            <li> cheap price shipping takes a while but looks great on your nails and totally worth it</li>
            <li> I would have given it a 5 star but just felt like it took forever to get to me! It wasn&#x27;t later then they said but just keep in mind it&#x27;s going to take a looong time</li>
            <li> I got these before i expected, look so cool! I cant wait to try them!!! Perfect size, and the price is unbelievable amazing! I&#x27;m excited to buy more product from here!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get it yet but I&#x27;m really excited i cant wait any longer these are such a cool product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These are cute and I love to inlay them in gel nails. they are flat enough to not stick up out of the gel but they give it dimension.</li>
            <li> Last at least 2 weeks if you don&#x27;t dishes</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of gold ones. And they have lasted me forever lol. And I use them quite often.</li>
            <li> These are so cool looking and they stay on very well. A definite must have for anyone who enjoys nail art.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, affordable, nice &amp; smooth. When I first got them I was upset. I thought I had more like 100 than 300. But there&#x27;s 150 silver in a little bag and 150 silver &amp; gold in another tiny bag. The shopping took a while but I expected that.  Really happy I ordered these. Find me &amp; my nail designs on Instagram - username is thefragrancejunkie :)</li>
            <li> shipping was fast. I am absolutely in love with the product. and so are my clients they can&#x27;t get enough of the stud nails. thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I just got these in the mail today! They are exactly what you order. To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t very pleased with them. I don&#x27;t know why. I got what I order.! Gold and Silver studs -300 pc. Even came with a few extra! But I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting. I guess more? It doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot but we&#x27;ll see when I start to work on these. The other thing I didn&#x27;t like was the arrival time. It was before the expected arrival date but I ordered more things from china and they got here a week ago. I guess I&#x27;m just being too picky! Good buy for the price! Do recommend and hopefully if I&#x27;m good with these, will be ordering again! Much more this time! Lol</li>
            <li> I really like the studs. They make a really good manicure and the colors are true to the picture. The only negative thing that I have to say is it took  some time getting here.</li>
            <li> They came before the EAD, were in great condition! I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but I have no doubt that they edge up any nail design I put them on!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not clear and looks cheap!!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe the price for this horrible quality!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d never recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These nail studs are the perfect size! Will definitely reorder again, i do recommend! Good price &amp; quality.&lt;br /&gt;They look so good</li>
            <li> Loved it I would buy it again. It took a while to get shipped but it was worth it, and the price is even better</li>
            <li> These make killer manicures, studs are super easy to store and apply, stick well with nail glue and really work with the new studded mani trend.</li>
            <li> I love there!!! They are so cute and looked great on my nails</li>
            <li> From the picture and description I thought that these were metal studs. They are not! They are super shiny silver and gold jewels. I have not used them yet and I am sure that they are fine. It is just not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> When I received the package in the mail and opened it, I didn&#x27;t even know what I was looking at and didn&#x27;t recall ever ordering what I received. I received plastic rhinestones in yellow and clear. They were a square and circle assortment. Not even close to what was ordered. They were not the square gold and silver assortment I ordered. I would give it one star but since the company worked with me to replace it I&#x27;ll give them two stars. But I did notice all the other reviews spoke about receiving the same type of item. So I decided to add a customer image to give you guys an idea of what was received, the count was also horribly off. I received 98 instead of 300.</li>
            <li> I received a tiny little bag, with maybe 70 tiny little square rhinestones yellow and clear in color... NOT WHAT I ORDERED.. these are not studs and not 3mm.. such a waste of money.. very very disappointed.. bc I followed a link off of someone&#x27;s YouTube channel.. this is not the product that was used in the video, or what&#x27;s in the picture.</li>
            <li> I ordered studs and got yellow and clear rhinestones. Not what I wanted. I give it two stars because I still like the rhinestones</li>
            <li> These gems are the perfect size and they are a great addition to your mani. They look great, I had so much fun creating my manicure with them and went a little &amp;#34;stud crazy&amp;#34; but it was a lot of fun! I got a lot of compliments on them too :)</li>
            <li> I did not receive any metal studs that I expected. I received plastic looking crystal squares. The picture showed plastic squares,but still I was expecting metal considering there were some pictures with metal studs and that&#x27;s what was labeled</li>
            <li> I LOVE these, im a nail tech so these square studs are a very very common trend, they are very beautiful and stay on snug</li>
            <li> I love these studs they are just so adorable to add on to nails and they stick very well with a top clear coat of nail polish! these are cheap and good quality, LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> Love, makes my nails look amazing. Great why to add dimension and glamour. They are a little hard to manage, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Got them wayyyyy before the estimated delivery and they are great. I already have them on my nails. There were even a few more in the bag than what it said.</li>
            <li> Very nice!! My clients love them!! They are very nice accents to polished nails!! Love the silver and gold option!</li>
            <li> I did not receive what was in the picture, I received rhinestones.....very dissapointed.....and wont be purchasing again. Hope this helped.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;However, I do Gel nails and this does not work well with gel topcoat.&lt;br /&gt;Without any top coat, the gold color peels and turns into silver in a week.&lt;br /&gt;So make sure you coat the top with regular topcoat or something.</li>
            <li> I really Loved it, the product was awesome and i got it in time, i would definitly get more !</li>
            <li> they came a little earlier than it was surpose to come, they are metal and amazingly cute, however im not sure if there is 300, im  not gonna take the time to count though.</li>
            <li> They are just the prefect size I did not count them cause I&lt;br /&gt;Really don&#x27;t have time to count all of them. But they are cute&lt;br /&gt;And will work amazing with my nail art. The shipping was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;They got here really rapidly than what I expected. If I need more&lt;br /&gt;I will buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Wish they were better, I used a lot of product to keep them from falling off to no avail, they would be great for acrylic and gel nails but on natural nails with just top coat as the glue they don&#x27;t work so much. They looked nice while they lasted.</li>
            <li> ENDED UP BUYING SEVERAL NAIL ITEMS FOR A FRIEND WHOS STARTING HER SMALL BUSINESS AND SHE LOVED IT</li>
            <li> They are exactly what they look like...nothing less:) I will buy more in the future absolutely..they stick on perfectly with the appropiate glue</li>
            <li> The metal studs are ok. They get the job done. I thought that the inside of the studs would me solid instead of hollow, but I am still able to work with them.</li>
            <li> These were exactly as described and came with silver and gold! Very pleased with the affordability and accuracy. Very neat for nail art!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly like these. Yeah they are cute, but the corners stick up and they catch easily. Also the polish underneath doesn&#x27;t dry. It took a month for them to get to me.</li>
            <li> Got this and was so happy with the buy . Its looks less then 300 but I took the time to count yes there is 300 .  Price is great and will be ordering more from here!</li>
            <li> Cool little peices for my nails. The only minus to them is that the inside is hollow. I had to fill them all before I could use them.</li>
            <li> I think this was really cool and it made my nails look like they were professionaly done. The one downfall is it did not stay on my nails very well. May need to try a glue to make them stick. Sticking them to the polish was not good enough. Great amount for the price!</li>
            <li> Exactly what ive been wanting to do my nails with!! Gives ur nails that edgy appearance but at cheap price.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a 5 star because this is a fun way to design your nail art and very easy to use!! I love them so much, I use them one a week. I am currently running low and have to purchase more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them to anyone who loves studs and nail art!! You will have to purchase the glue for them but that can be found at dollar stores, walmart, target... etc. anywhere that you can find the jewls that you glue on yourself. very cheap, easy to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PURCHASE this product!!! you will love it!!</li>
            <li> I love these, they make some pretty great designs. My nails are rounded so sometimes I have problems applying the product to make it straight, but I am still learning. I think I mastered it, and so will you. I recommend.</li>
            <li> They are a good assortment of gold and silver and are the perfect size for most nail art designs. :)</li>
            <li> I love doing different things on my nails and do my nails sometimes twice a week. Product was great exactly what I expected and what I got. Would TOTALLY recommend for those who love to do nails.</li>
            <li> These are kind of difficult to use at first, but I always get a bunch of compliments whenever I use them. The only problems are that the gold coloring comes off with nail polish remover and they will not stay on for more than a day without acrylic nail glue. Would definitely recommend to anyone who&#x27;s looking to step up their nail game!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected but I wish the gold &amp; silver studs were separate. I love the studs though .</li>
            <li> Got here fast and quality of item was great! Definitely would buy again and do business again with the buyer</li>
            <li> I received large square studs. They are not as small as they show in the pictures. I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Got them over a week before the earliest arrival date. They are a perfect size although you will need gel to make them stay on. Very worth it. And I doubt there is 300 pcs? Hmm I am going to count them later.</li>
            <li> Love these good price for these they add a great touch to my nails and will recommended if u want good studs for a cheap price seller I is real nice and respectful and if u have a problem they will kindly fix it you&#x27;ll love these perfect I would rate 5 stars but they took awhile to get here</li>
            <li> I rate this 3 stars because 3mm is a little big for the nails. Also I only got silver ish ones not gold and silver like it says but I&#x27;m fine with just silver. For the price it was worth it</li>
            <li> I like these studs! They&#x27;re great to place on one or two accent nails at the cuticle or in a straight line</li>
            <li> I only received 224 studs and they were ONLY silver(absolutely no gold). However of what I did receive they were decent quality. Not exactly as advertised, but still worth the price.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot. Im gonna be using it for everything i have. I will purchase more again in the future. thx.</li>
            <li> I love doing my nails and getting this nail supply make it better both at home n in the nail salon. I love them and also they look cool to.</li>
            <li> Its good for what its worth it is good i would arte it a 3 not the best but its good</li>
            <li> They are perfect to fit on my nail and stick on (with nail glue) very well!! I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I was happy because they arrived so fast, but it was extremely disappointing when I went through and counted them because a small bag that it was shipped and I only had about 120 in my little bag. I checked the package for possibly another little baggy but there wasn&#x27;t one. Which is the reason why I only gave this two stars</li>
            <li> I received the product and it seems to have more than 300 pieces. After reading all review I decided to take my chances. Well I only received gold pieces not mixed. Bummer. I am giving them one star for actually sending me what&#x27;s in the pic, but how can you advertise something you won&#x27;t ship?! I don&#x27;t get it. Keep that in mind as you purchase your order. It might be you the 1person out of 5 that isn&#x27;t satisfied or receives the wrong product. It arrived approximately as estimated but I wanted both colors which is what I paid for.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy, i never got anything in the mail</li>
            <li> These are certainly a good value but i had trouble with them popping off</li>
            <li> I got gold and pink instead of gold and silver.</li>
            <li> These are awesome if you can get them to stay on your nails. Good price, good product. I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered surprisingly fast considering it was coming from outside the country. The studs were perfect for my nail designs, AND a little pack of bonus 3D decals were attached to my order. LOVE! Will definitely be ordering from them again.</li>
            <li> havent tried the product but its just as described and looks pretty good..... im sure it will work for or how it suppose to</li>
            <li> not what i expected since its so small, but it wasnt expensive either, i didnt realise their was gold and silver, i just wanted silver but oh well.</li>
            <li> I really like these studs, adds a cool effect to nail art. It&#x27;s so many ways to use these babies. I will order again.</li>
            <li> Packaged very cheaply but if you&#x27;re really into nail design these are great.</li>
            <li> need more for that price. quality need be better overall is easy to work with not shiny enough not all even</li>
            <li> was supposed to be gold and silver 3mm studs listed under the &amp;#34;square&amp;#34; option but i received the pink bows that are now pictured. they&#x27;re cute and glue fine to nails (and surprisingly stayed on for a whole week) but i wanted studs, not bows. the seller i ordered from was a US seller that is no longer listed</li>
            <li> maybe I am doing something wrong (paint my nails, before they dry stick one of these on the nail, cover with 2 clear coats) but these studs just keep falling off!  I even tried a dot of super glue, but no luck.  Le sigh, life is rough.</li>
            <li> Who isn&#x27;t going to want studs on there nails. I have some other studs that I purchased at a drug store. Let&#x27;s just say they completely sucked. I paid the same amount foe them that I did for these. I only got 20 studs, foil and nail polish. But this deal is good. You get a lot of studs for the price. But I would recommend using nail glue to stick them on. Just to make sure it stays long enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product four stars because their a bit bigger than i expected but overall their great i love the colors shipping was a lot faster than expected they stay on and their were a good price I got what I ordered.</li>
            <li> The studs were super cute. The look just like they do in the picture and they came pretty fast. But there aren&#x27;t a lot if you&#x27;re looking for large quantities.</li>
            <li> I did not receive square studs, I received rectangular ones. I can still use them, they aren&#x27;t horrible, they just are not what I was looking to purchase. I do still like them.</li>
            <li> You get a tiny little ziploc full of these stuff.  Very cool. A bit of a pain to put on if you don&#x27;t want any glue showing, but they look just like they do in the picture.</li>
            <li> LOVE! Can&#x27;t wait to use these with my nail arts!!</li>
            <li> I ordered gold and silver studs and ended up getting green and pink studs. I was very disappointed and the number of studs couldnt have been more that 80. Dont buy them its a complete waste of time.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with silver and gold. Every girl love to rock silver and gold wheather it with a pair of jeans or a sexy black dress. Nails will speak for itself!!!</li>
            <li> I use these studs all the time now. They go on so easily and they stay for so long. Also, they shipped so quickly and the item was exactly as described. Love it!</li>
            <li> The product itself is great but it comes in a little ziploc bag. This needs a wheel like the other nail appliques.</li>
            <li> The studs were just what I expected, they work great on the nails. The only thing that I would suggest for the gold studs, is to put a top coat over it because it will fade off if  you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The nail studs are the correct size, but the gold has a weird reaction to nail glue and turns it silver/ green. Silver ones are great!</li>
            <li> Did my nails with these studs for the first  just love it everyone lovethem.  how pretty n nice my nails look thank u</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is I haven&#x27;t found a way to make them last or stay on my nails however I think that&#x27;s a problem on my part.</li>
