            <li>Before, during, and after, this product will take top notch care of your skin and tattoo work.</li>

            <li>A friend told me about this paraben free post tattoo balm!</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t have an ointment feel like Tattoo Goo has as Hustle Butter is mostly made of shea butters</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I use it for more then just a tattoo cream.</li>

            <li>top notch stuff.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with it.</li>
            <li>I feel like the butter didn&#x27;t penetrate the scabs, but sat on top.  </li>
            <li>So when I was getting more ink done, I had to buy a jar of it.</li>
            <li>I like it because it&#x27;s not overly greasy like most aftercare products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update :)</li>

            <li>Goes on beautiful and is working wonders on my new tattoo.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, exact product, great transaction and experience!</li>
            <li>The ingredients list is clean; the smell is delicious, but not overpowering; it goes on silky smooth and leaves my tattoos and the rest of my skin looking and feeling silky and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone with funky skin or anyone that just wants a more pleasant healing process.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the color is as bright or the edges as crisp.  </li>
            <li>My skin always healed good but hot</li>
            <li>Great what I was looking for brand new sealed</li>
            <li>I recommended this because it works great on and during getting your new tattoo.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended Hustle Butter and it was the best recommendation for a product that I have had in a very long time.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice, has good natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>This works amazingly with fresh tattoos.. helps the healing process and keeps it from itching..</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this stuff, it&#x27;s a huge amount you will need a sleeve to go through this.</li>
            <li>your beard soft and smells great, keeps leather supple, keeps tattoos</li>
            <li>of these claims are true!</li>
            <li>It is also great for dry cuticles or making a tattoo look bright and fresh.</li>
            <li>It also rubs off fairly easily.</li>
            <li>as many tattoos I get and have this stuff is fantastic my artist recommended it to me a few weeks ago its awesome</li>
            <li>Works fantastic and smells heavenly, plus its vegan and animal-lover friendly :-)</li>
            <li>Personally, I use it during the day and wrap the tattoo in plastic wrap the first two nights, which I find works best.</li>
            <li>Keep the tattoo looking healthy and aids in a quick healing.</li>
            <li>This is the best cream for tattoos that I&#x27;ve used I recommend it to anyone with tattoos new or old</li>
            <li>and he noticed a huge difference in heeling.  </li>
            <li>Hustle Butter is by far the best (and completely natural) product I&#x27;ve used for my tattoos.</li>
            <li>A light layer lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough great things about it...</li>
            <li>Smells like straight up amazing.</li>
            <li>Vegan also and petroleum free.</li>
            <li>My favorite product to put on a fresh tattoo.</li>
            <li>It is even great as a regular skin care moisturizer.</li>
            <li>A great daily moisturizer as we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li>** in a cannister amidst flowers and puppies and happy babies and such.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use anything else, the good thing its natural and</li>
            <li>Love love the way it smells and its good for my other tattoos.</li>
            <li>I have been using it ritually for more than a year on every single tattoo I have done and the results are impeccable.</li>
            <li>Amazing product it feels nice and smells great too just be very careful to not put too much when the first month you get your tattoo.</li>
            <li>It keeps my tattoo looking bright and my skin super soft!</li>
            <li>Smells great, totally organic and far more appealing than slathering a client with a bunch of a&amp;d ointment.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, but after trying this for my aftercare on my tattoos I am in love with it!</li>
            <li>First I love the hustle butter</li>
            <li>Not user friendly.</li>
            <li>Smells great and just a bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li>It smells great and my skin never gets dry with it.</li>
            <li>This product is great even for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It has kept my new tattoos looking fresh!!!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and the smell, leaves skin smooth and older tattoos look newer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to even explain how wonderful it smells.</li>
            <li>tub is huge and is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I am about 10 tattoo hours away from a full body suit.</li>
            <li>I bought him the full size for his birthday.  </li>
            <li>My chief complaint is that unless this product is kept at the perfect  temperature, it turns to liquid.</li>
            <li>Working on 2 full sleeves it takes away itchy feeling, burning sensation when applied and</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>Redness is greatly reduced when applying the tattoo properly and the all natural ingredients make for an enjoyable scent.</li>
            <li>Be sure to gently blot off any excess after applying.</li>
            <li>Hands down one of the absolute best tattoo after care products.</li>
            <li>other than that it works great, for me anyhow.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff on my new ink!</li>
            <li>Love hustle butter - awesome product - but would not recommend ordering in the summer as the outdoor heat exposure from shipment caused it to turn extremely grainy in texture, rendering it nearly unusable since it really does not melt well (or quickly) once it becomes that grainy.</li>
            <li>Asked what was I using to heal so quickly</li>
            <li>I loved that this was vegan, light and non-clogging, and allegedly smelled great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>then the tattoo goo products, it just moisturized better, smells betters, feels better, overall</li>
            <li>I went back for the second session a couple days ago and my tattoo artist was impressed by the healing.</li>
            <li>, I love that it&#x27;s got so many ingredients I can identify as actual words, and it also smells heavenly, but none of the fragrances have irritated my tattoo in the slightest.</li>
            <li>And super moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Hustle Butter is hands down the best product I have ever used to heal new tattoos with.</li>
            <li>tub is actually pretty huge - like Bath and Body Works</li>
            <li>Love it, my tattoo healed way faster then normal.</li>
            <li>Fairly inexpensive as well for the amount and how long the jar lasts.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s seriously a magic healing lotion; cracked heals, cry hands, new tattoos,</li>
            <li>My new favorite body butter/moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and after my tattoos was done it made it look new love it</li>
            <li>Multiple sources of &amp;#34;butters&amp;#34; make up this product and works for more than just tattoos!  </li>
            <li>Taking it to my next appointment for sure!</li>
            <li>No color loss, crisp, and NO scabbing at all!</li>
            <li>It is not overly greasy, smells fantastic, &amp; my artwork heals super fast with the use of this.</li>
            <li>I went through 6 straight hours ok ink and the artist gave me a sample and said i should pick up some since its a large piece.</li>
            <li>I got a large, very colorful piece done.</li>
            <li>Hustle Butter&#x27;s Facebook has a lot of great stories of people having positive results on things other than tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fast better believe ill be buying more!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Worth the money and will order another one.</li>
            <li>I bought it after having 7 hours of work done and it was especially helpful in the healing process as well as smelling great and being all natural.</li>
            <li>After that all I do is apply Hustle Butter to the fresh tattoo until healed.  </li>
            <li>My favorite tattoo lubricant by far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a repeat user and love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>and this is by far my favorite product.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and it leaves my skin really soft and brings out the colors on my tattoo.worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I had to buy this since the boyfriend jacked mine because he liked it as well.</li>
            <li>and wow I love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Never felt like it was irritating, tattoo healed great!</li>
            <li>Not to mention, it&#x27;s all natural, all organic, and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>No irritation and my tattoo doesn&#x27;t even look fresh.</li>
            <li>is the freshly post-ink experience.  </li>
            <li>i have several friends that own shops and one of my buddies turned me onto this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I figured I would take a leap and try this product on a fresh tattoo.</li>
            <li>Felt like it healed a fresh tattoo about 1-2 days sooner than aquaphor.</li>
            <li>I had tried many things in the past, this was the best so far on my new tattoo</li>
            <li>helps keep swelling down durring the tattoo process and it smells nice also!</li>
            <li>The main problem is that it doesn&#x27;t really soak into your skin; it just sits on top.</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>All natural ingredients and vegan friendly!</li>
            <li>l love all the natural ingredients in this product, and it works exactly as it&#x27;s intended.</li>
            <li>My tattoo healed exceptionally well - no scabbing and minimal peeling.</li>
            <li>it took me the normal 4 days or so to began to peel and worked fine.</li>
            <li>A better tattoo experience, faster healing, less itchy peeling time, and a better looking tattoo for the rest of your life.</li>
            <li>I wish I could dive into a huge vat of this stuff and just live there.</li>
            <li>While I loved the smell, how it soothed the skin, and it&#x27;s natural ingredients, it is not stable enough to use as a go to product for tattooing.</li>
            <li>Very comparative prices and showed up quickly.</li>
            <li>Shipped super fast.  </li>
            <li>It smells very nice and small</li>
            <li>admit, I&#x27;m new to tattooing and have nothing to compare to, but I would definitely use Hustle Butter again if I ever get some more work done!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m starting to favour this more.</li>
            <li>most of my upper body is coverred</li>
            <li>While I love the idea of not using petroleum products, there are several drawbacks of hustlebutter.</li>
            <li>I have used Hustle Butter on my 4 most recent ones and the difference is night and day.</li>
            <li>This is my first tattoo</li>
            <li>I used the product 3-4 times a day for the first three weeks of my tattoo.</li>
            <li>Used this on my first tattoo...</li>
            <li>It peels and heals so much faster!</li>
            <li>I bought Hustle Butter more than 2 weeks ago after my first session on my third tattoo.</li>
            <li>At the end of the session, he told me to just do whatever I did the first time because it healed so well.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t leave it in a hot place it&#x27;ll melt.</li>
            <li>the packaging it claims to be all natural, cruelty free, and vegan.</li>
            <li>So I started doing 1 coat of Lubriderm after washing, waiting 30 minutes, and then adding Hustle Butter, which worked better on the scabbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward, and I ran out of Hustle Butter after my 2nd session and just used Lubriderm.  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells wonderful and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>Not sure why both tattoo artist I&#x27;ve been to recently hadn&#x27;t heard of this awesome product</li>
            <li>and my skin felt soothed after applying it the first 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think this the first product I&#x27;ve tried like this for a tattoo.</li>
            <li>I cannot possibly explain how much I love this product.</li>
            <li>The few scabs that I had started to heal and go away asap, and as everyone says this stuff does smell good.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, use it everyday as a skin hydrator</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and moisturizes extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps</li>
            <li>I really think it reduced the swelling and helped my skin feel more comfortable within the first few days.  </li>
            <li>The sessions that he used Hustle Butter during tattooing are more vibrant and rich than the other sections</li>
            <li>Scent is subtle but very nice.</li>
            <li>I bought this in advance of my new tattoo, but also found it works wonders on sunburns!!  </li>
            <li>amounts can cover a pretty decent size area.</li>
            <li>Price and shipping are very high.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and is very emollient without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li>Treat it just like you would when spreading real butter on a piece of toast.</li>
            <li>and it will make your skin supple and ready to absorb ink</li>
            <li>service fast shipping, 5 stars all the way.</li>
            <li>Recommend for any person whom wants to protect their investment in their tattoo.  </li>
            <li>Tattoos heal fast and without any issues.</li>
            <li>I also really like it as a balm for my elbows and lips.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much of it to make your tattoos pop and as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Worked really well.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very helpful then too.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like having to wonder about a product that I am rubbing into what is basically an open wound, and this one I feel completely comfortable with.</li>
            <li>So I really wanted to like this a lot, and I do to some extent.  </li>
            <li>It is really a butter</li>
            <li>However, my healing process seemed much faster with just the Lubriderm.  </li>
            <li>, my artist used this on me throughout the tattoo and it was very soothing on my irritated skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s work fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I don&#x27;t know if I would go so far as to say it gets rid of scabbing and itching right away like others have posted, I would say that I wont use anything else now that I have used this product.</li>
            <li>It really does make a difference in the healing process &amp; works much better than other products.</li>
            <li>To me it&#x27;s better than tattoo goo and some of the other products out there.</li>
            <li>So much better than other alternatives that are out there.</li>
            <li>I used to to heal a piece on my knee cap and it seemed to work well but not any better than other non-scented lotions.</li>
            <li>I  currently working on my back piece and this healed everything up so far nicely.  </li>
            <li>It is similar (and mostly made of) coconut oil, which is a soft solid at room temperature and liquifies when heated by skin contact (or your hot car,</li>
            <li>Arrived very grainy and abrasive which is not what my new tattoo needs at all.  </li>
            <li>Better healing and less sting during the work on the tattoo.</li>
            <li>But think about any scab you ever had that turned into a scar - the more you baby it and the longer it takes to heal, the less of a scar you have.  </li>
            <li>Reduced scabbing and kept the colors vibrant.  </li>
            <li>AD is superior in a few ways and if I had to choose to use only one between the AD and the HB</li>
            <li>Keeps the colors vibrant and has aided with the healing of my tattoos.</li>
            <li>Hustle Butter is decent.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for the aftercare of your tattoo.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for tour after care tattoo</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product &amp; this seller.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this.</li>
            <li>Highly suggest.</li>
            <li>I completely recommend this stuff!!</li>
            <li>Hustle Butter helps me heal, applies easily and has never irritated my skin like other products have.  </li>
            <li>Helps heal a new tattoo - and makes an older ones color pop.</li>
            <li>It all looks great, don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li>It also really doesn&#x27;t get as red, bleed as much, or swell as much when used during a tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>it really absorbs nicley, no icky residue, all natural</li>
            <li>Used it on a new tattoo as it was highly recommended by the tattoo artist.</li>
            <li>its a little on the pricy side compared to other shea products, but this is a nice formula and the lack of ash-funk makes it worth it to me.</li>
            <li>Maybe if this was shipped with dry ice it would be ok but the heat it suffered in transit made the ointment melt then re-cool and become gritty.</li>
            <li>It lasts for several hours, the skin gets soft once it soaks in, and while oily at first it becomes pretty soft and tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Remember to use lightly, which should not be a problem with hustle butter, unlike other ointments.</li>
            <li>Not to mention that it smells nice, and only a little goes</li>
            <li>Bought it after reading the reviews for our new tattoos.</li>
            <li>This is all I use, whenever I get a new tattoo.  </li>
            <li>Will try a my new tattoo in two weeks and post review on healing process.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new go-to after care for my tattoos.</li>
            <li>New</li>
            <li>This is definitely my new tattoo aftercare product of choice.</li>
            <li>I have lots of tattoos and decided to try some new aftercare stuff.</li>
            <li>Keeps your new tattoo hydrated.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try it when I get the new tattoo.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it unless it&#x27;s really painful because the healing power here is great.</li>
            <li>This is their favorite product so far and they have tried quite a few.</li>
            <li>Will use it for all my ink - new and old!</li>
            <li>its the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one note of mention, when you take your first finger tip full, it will seem a bit stiff, but immediately upon contact with your skin, it turns, literally, into butter.</li>
            <li>Also, I have sensitive skin and eczema, but had no negative reaction to Hustle Butter (which was a concern).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use it after every tattoo and am completely healed (with no scabs!)</li>
            <li>I recently tried Hustle Butter for the first time.</li>
            <li>New and old</li>
            <li>been using this on new tattoos, old tattoos, and healing tattoos.</li>
            <li>Currently in the process of getting full back piece and didn&#x27;t use A&amp;D or Aquaphor.  </li>
            <li>I had a a large solid area that extended into my elbow crease, so I got pretty big scabs.  </li>
            <li>Another trait I loved is that a little bit goes a long way, so this tub can last you a loooong time.</li>
            <li>i get REALLY scaly when im healing a new tattoo and regular applications of hustle butter</li>
            <li>in all, I would recommend it but not over lubriderm or a similar un-scented lotion, as those tend to soak into your skin a little better.</li>
            <li>All natural as well.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re getting any ink get this stuff early and put it on the area for a couple days before the tattoo session</li>
            <li>Skin is soft.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and helped heal a tattoo well.</li>
            <li>When I received the product it was completely melted.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>old tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Old tattoo&#x27;s...great to moisturize.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also got all natural ingredients which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper on Amazon than at the local tattoo shop.</li>
            <li>do have sensitive skin &amp; eczema and had no break outs from this product.</li>
            <li>so i used my old stand by Aquaphor ointment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really like this, I find it easier to put on than Tattoo Goo, and it seems to last a lot longer on the skin.</li>
            <li>I use this product for roughly around a week on a fresh tattoo until it starts to peel</li>
            <li>I have 2 huge tattoos, one on my thigh and a half sleeve, and I would never use anything else for them!</li>
            <li>the smell is clean and it doesn&#x27;t mess with your stencil.</li>
            <li>Lastly, most other reviews state the 5 oz tub goes a long way already complete with tub after two sessions one 5.5 hour session and last session was 7.  </li>
            <li>I also never had a second peal which I had read was normal, but not having the second peel is apparently normal with Hustle Butter!</li>
            <li>Makes new and old tattoos stand out especially at the beach or any sunny environment</li>
            <li>I got my first tattoo (large tribal arm piece) and was using the normal stuff (Aquaphor &amp; Aveeno) and the healing processes was going slow until I got this stuff</li>
            <li>I left a detailed review already for a previous purchase.</li>
            <li>blacks in my 2 newest tattoos have healed super crisp and dark compared to my other tattoo I had used After Inked on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m heavily tattooed and have tried every healing method over the last 20 years and think I have finally found a product that provides the safe and airy protective layer while lubricating and nourishing without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products on the market that were released over the past year or two and nothing holds a candle to Hustle Butter Deluxe.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always sceptic tying out new creams and lotions especially for tattoo aftercare.</li>
            <li>Recently I&#x27;ve run out of Tattoo Goo, so I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li>Provides sheer, light-weight, non-greasy protection to new tattoos.</li>
            <li>Gritty is not what you want to rub onto a new tattoo.</li>
            <li>I thought it was strange for the first one but to also get the second one not sealed made me wonder.</li>
            <li>It is worrisome given food allergies are more common than one would think, and I am rubbing this product in an open wound.</li>
            <li>I used it nearly 100% for the first half of my tattoo.  </li>
            <li>For those with sensitive skin and are prone to breakouts due to petroleum products, I highly recommend trying this organic, all natural product.</li>
            <li>I love using Hustle Butter on my tattoo, it makes it shine, brings out the colors &amp; makes the black look black and not gray.  </li>
            <li>AND it&#x27;s natural enough you could eat it.</li>
            <li>I left mine in my car for maybe a couple of hours and it is all grainy now and not as soft as it used to be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also all natural which is a definite plus.</li>
            <li>My tattoo artist has looked into many different after care products that are not petroleum based, but was not happy with the reviews &amp; results.</li>
            <li>When it first goes on it feels a little sticky, but as it heats up and melts into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>And it really helped heal my tattoos quicker that other similar products.</li>
            <li>(this also makes it easy to spread thinly over your tattoo)  </li>
            <li>I had a large half sleeve piece done recently and decided to give Hustle Butter a try.</li>

            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have an ointment feel like Tattoo Goo has as Hustle Butter is mostly made of shea butters</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I use it for more then just a tattoo cream.</li>
            <li> Made healing process way better / would love if it would come scented /</li>
            <li> Absolutely phenomenal product.</li>
            <li> Best tattoo recovery product I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I will never go back to a petroleum based product ever again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just like it better and it did make my tattoo heal better.</li>
            <li> smells great and heals tattoo extremely fast.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this aftercare.</li>
            <li> Epically fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love how it heals my tattoos.</li>
            <li> Top of the line tatt care..</li>
            <li> and they both healed fast and look great.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Works much better than Tattoo Goo.</li>
            <li> I need to get more asap.</li>
            <li> top notch stuff.  </li>
            <li> I am in love with it.</li>
            <li> I feel like the butter didn&#x27;t penetrate the scabs, but sat on top.  </li>
            <li> So when I was getting more ink done, I had to buy a jar of it.</li>
            <li> I like it because it&#x27;s not overly greasy like most aftercare products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update :)</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I found it!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Favorite aftercare lotion...</li>
            <li> Love Love love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it from the start.  </li>
            <li> I love Hustlebutter.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> let me tell you what, not only was it pleasant to use at night because i no longer had to wrap it to keep from sticking to my sheets, but the stuff smelled AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Goes on beautiful and is working wonders on my new tattoo.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, exact product, great transaction and experience!</li>
            <li> The ingredients list is clean; the smell is delicious, but not overpowering; it goes on silky smooth and leaves my tattoos and the rest of my skin looking and feeling silky and vibrant.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone with funky skin or anyone that just wants a more pleasant healing process.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the color is as bright or the edges as crisp.  </li>
            <li> My skin always healed good but hot</li>
            <li> Great what I was looking for brand new sealed</li>
            <li> I recommended this because it works great on and during getting your new tattoo.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended Hustle Butter and it was the best recommendation for a product that I have had in a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice, has good natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This works amazingly with fresh tattoos.. helps the healing process and keeps it from itching..</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this stuff, it&#x27;s a huge amount you will need a sleeve to go through this.</li>
            <li> your beard soft and smells great, keeps leather supple, keeps tattoos</li>
            <li> of these claims are true!</li>
            <li> It is also great for dry cuticles or making a tattoo look bright and fresh.</li>
            <li> It also rubs off fairly easily.</li>
            <li> as many tattoos I get and have this stuff is fantastic my artist recommended it to me a few weeks ago its awesome</li>
            <li> Works fantastic and smells heavenly, plus its vegan and animal-lover friendly :-)</li>
            <li> Personally, I use it during the day and wrap the tattoo in plastic wrap the first two nights, which I find works best.</li>
            <li> Keep the tattoo looking healthy and aids in a quick healing.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream for tattoos that I&#x27;ve used I recommend it to anyone with tattoos new or old</li>
            <li> and he noticed a huge difference in heeling.  </li>
            <li> Hustle Butter is by far the best (and completely natural) product I&#x27;ve used for my tattoos.</li>
            <li> A light layer lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough great things about it...</li>
            <li> Smells like straight up amazing.</li>
            <li> Vegan also and petroleum free.</li>
            <li> My favorite product to put on a fresh tattoo.</li>
            <li> It is even great as a regular skin care moisturizer.</li>
            <li> A great daily moisturizer as we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> ** in a cannister amidst flowers and puppies and happy babies and such.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else, the good thing its natural and</li>
            <li> Love love the way it smells and its good for my other tattoos.</li>
            <li> I have been using it ritually for more than a year on every single tattoo I have done and the results are impeccable.</li>
            <li> Amazing product it feels nice and smells great too just be very careful to not put too much when the first month you get your tattoo.</li>
            <li> It keeps my tattoo looking bright and my skin super soft!</li>
            <li> Smells great, totally organic and far more appealing than slathering a client with a bunch of a&amp;d ointment.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, but after trying this for my aftercare on my tattoos I am in love with it!</li>
            <li> First I love the hustle butter</li>
            <li> Not user friendly.</li>
            <li> Smells great and just a bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It smells great and my skin never gets dry with it.</li>
            <li> This product is great even for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It has kept my new tattoos looking fresh!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and the smell, leaves skin smooth and older tattoos look newer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to even explain how wonderful it smells.</li>
            <li> tub is huge and is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I am about 10 tattoo hours away from a full body suit.</li>
            <li> I bought him the full size for his birthday.  </li>
            <li> My chief complaint is that unless this product is kept at the perfect  temperature, it turns to liquid.</li>
            <li> Working on 2 full sleeves it takes away itchy feeling, burning sensation when applied and</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> Redness is greatly reduced when applying the tattoo properly and the all natural ingredients make for an enjoyable scent.</li>
            <li> Be sure to gently blot off any excess after applying.</li>
            <li> Hands down one of the absolute best tattoo after care products.</li>
            <li> other than that it works great, for me anyhow.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff on my new ink!</li>
            <li> Love hustle butter - awesome product - but would not recommend ordering in the summer as the outdoor heat exposure from shipment caused it to turn extremely grainy in texture, rendering it nearly unusable since it really does not melt well (or quickly) once it becomes that grainy.</li>
            <li> Asked what was I using to heal so quickly</li>
            <li> I loved that this was vegan, light and non-clogging, and allegedly smelled great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> then the tattoo goo products, it just moisturized better, smells betters, feels better, overall</li>
            <li> I went back for the second session a couple days ago and my tattoo artist was impressed by the healing.</li>
            <li> , I love that it&#x27;s got so many ingredients I can identify as actual words, and it also smells heavenly, but none of the fragrances have irritated my tattoo in the slightest.</li>
            <li> And super moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Hustle Butter is hands down the best product I have ever used to heal new tattoos with.</li>
            <li> tub is actually pretty huge - like Bath and Body Works</li>
            <li> Love it, my tattoo healed way faster then normal.</li>
            <li> Fairly inexpensive as well for the amount and how long the jar lasts.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s seriously a magic healing lotion; cracked heals, cry hands, new tattoos,</li>
            <li> My new favorite body butter/moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and after my tattoos was done it made it look new love it</li>
            <li> Multiple sources of &amp;#34;butters&amp;#34; make up this product and works for more than just tattoos!  </li>
            <li> Taking it to my next appointment for sure!</li>
            <li> No color loss, crisp, and NO scabbing at all!</li>
            <li> It is not overly greasy, smells fantastic, &amp; my artwork heals super fast with the use of this.</li>
            <li> I went through 6 straight hours ok ink and the artist gave me a sample and said i should pick up some since its a large piece.</li>
            <li> I got a large, very colorful piece done.</li>
            <li> Hustle Butter&#x27;s Facebook has a lot of great stories of people having positive results on things other than tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fast better believe ill be buying more!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Worth the money and will order another one.</li>
            <li> I bought it after having 7 hours of work done and it was especially helpful in the healing process as well as smelling great and being all natural.</li>
            <li> After that all I do is apply Hustle Butter to the fresh tattoo until healed.  </li>
            <li> My favorite tattoo lubricant by far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a repeat user and love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> and this is by far my favorite product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it leaves my skin really soft and brings out the colors on my tattoo.worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I had to buy this since the boyfriend jacked mine because he liked it as well.</li>
            <li> and wow I love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Never felt like it was irritating, tattoo healed great!</li>
            <li> Not to mention, it&#x27;s all natural, all organic, and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> No irritation and my tattoo doesn&#x27;t even look fresh.</li>
            <li> is the freshly post-ink experience.  </li>
            <li> i have several friends that own shops and one of my buddies turned me onto this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I figured I would take a leap and try this product on a fresh tattoo.</li>
            <li> Felt like it healed a fresh tattoo about 1-2 days sooner than aquaphor.</li>
            <li> I had tried many things in the past, this was the best so far on my new tattoo</li>
            <li> helps keep swelling down durring the tattoo process and it smells nice also!</li>
            <li> The main problem is that it doesn&#x27;t really soak into your skin; it just sits on top.</li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> All natural ingredients and vegan friendly!</li>
            <li> l love all the natural ingredients in this product, and it works exactly as it&#x27;s intended.</li>
            <li> My tattoo healed exceptionally well - no scabbing and minimal peeling.</li>
            <li> it took me the normal 4 days or so to began to peel and worked fine.</li>
            <li> A better tattoo experience, faster healing, less itchy peeling time, and a better looking tattoo for the rest of your life.</li>
            <li> I wish I could dive into a huge vat of this stuff and just live there.</li>
            <li> While I loved the smell, how it soothed the skin, and it&#x27;s natural ingredients, it is not stable enough to use as a go to product for tattooing.</li>
            <li> Very comparative prices and showed up quickly.</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast.  </li>
            <li> It smells very nice and small</li>
            <li> admit, I&#x27;m new to tattooing and have nothing to compare to, but I would definitely use Hustle Butter again if I ever get some more work done!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m starting to favour this more.</li>
            <li> most of my upper body is coverred</li>
            <li> While I love the idea of not using petroleum products, there are several drawbacks of hustlebutter.</li>
            <li> I have used Hustle Butter on my 4 most recent ones and the difference is night and day.</li>
            <li> This is my first tattoo</li>
            <li> I used the product 3-4 times a day for the first three weeks of my tattoo.</li>
            <li> Used this on my first tattoo...</li>
            <li> It peels and heals so much faster!</li>
            <li> I bought Hustle Butter more than 2 weeks ago after my first session on my third tattoo.</li>
            <li> At the end of the session, he told me to just do whatever I did the first time because it healed so well.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t leave it in a hot place it&#x27;ll melt.</li>
            <li> the packaging it claims to be all natural, cruelty free, and vegan.</li>
            <li> So I started doing 1 coat of Lubriderm after washing, waiting 30 minutes, and then adding Hustle Butter, which worked better on the scabbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward, and I ran out of Hustle Butter after my 2nd session and just used Lubriderm.  </li>
            <li> This stuff smells wonderful and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Not sure why both tattoo artist I&#x27;ve been to recently hadn&#x27;t heard of this awesome product</li>
            <li> and my skin felt soothed after applying it the first 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think this the first product I&#x27;ve tried like this for a tattoo.</li>
            <li> I cannot possibly explain how much I love this product.</li>
            <li> The few scabs that I had started to heal and go away asap, and as everyone says this stuff does smell good.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, use it everyday as a skin hydrator</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and moisturizes extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps</li>
            <li> I really think it reduced the swelling and helped my skin feel more comfortable within the first few days.  </li>
            <li> The sessions that he used Hustle Butter during tattooing are more vibrant and rich than the other sections</li>
            <li> Scent is subtle but very nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this in advance of my new tattoo, but also found it works wonders on sunburns!!  </li>
            <li> amounts can cover a pretty decent size area.</li>
            <li> Price and shipping are very high.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and is very emollient without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> Treat it just like you would when spreading real butter on a piece of toast.</li>
            <li> and it will make your skin supple and ready to absorb ink</li>
            <li> service fast shipping, 5 stars all the way.</li>
            <li> Recommend for any person whom wants to protect their investment in their tattoo.  </li>
            <li> Tattoos heal fast and without any issues.</li>
            <li> I also really like it as a balm for my elbows and lips.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much of it to make your tattoos pop and as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Worked really well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very helpful then too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like having to wonder about a product that I am rubbing into what is basically an open wound, and this one I feel completely comfortable with.</li>
            <li> So I really wanted to like this a lot, and I do to some extent.  </li>
            <li> It is really a butter</li>
            <li> However, my healing process seemed much faster with just the Lubriderm.  </li>
            <li> , my artist used this on me throughout the tattoo and it was very soothing on my irritated skin.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s work fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I don&#x27;t know if I would go so far as to say it gets rid of scabbing and itching right away like others have posted, I would say that I wont use anything else now that I have used this product.</li>
            <li> It really does make a difference in the healing process &amp; works much better than other products.</li>
            <li> To me it&#x27;s better than tattoo goo and some of the other products out there.</li>
            <li> So much better than other alternatives that are out there.</li>
            <li> I used to to heal a piece on my knee cap and it seemed to work well but not any better than other non-scented lotions.</li>
            <li> I  currently working on my back piece and this healed everything up so far nicely.  </li>
            <li> It is similar (and mostly made of) coconut oil, which is a soft solid at room temperature and liquifies when heated by skin contact (or your hot car,</li>
            <li> Arrived very grainy and abrasive which is not what my new tattoo needs at all.  </li>
            <li> Better healing and less sting during the work on the tattoo.</li>
            <li> But think about any scab you ever had that turned into a scar - the more you baby it and the longer it takes to heal, the less of a scar you have.  </li>
            <li> Reduced scabbing and kept the colors vibrant.  </li>
            <li> AD is superior in a few ways and if I had to choose to use only one between the AD and the HB</li>
            <li> Keeps the colors vibrant and has aided with the healing of my tattoos.</li>
            <li> Hustle Butter is decent.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for the aftercare of your tattoo.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for tour after care tattoo</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product &amp; this seller.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this.</li>
            <li> Highly suggest.</li>
            <li> I completely recommend this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Hustle Butter helps me heal, applies easily and has never irritated my skin like other products have.  </li>
            <li> Helps heal a new tattoo - and makes an older ones color pop.</li>
            <li> It all looks great, don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> It also really doesn&#x27;t get as red, bleed as much, or swell as much when used during a tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> it really absorbs nicley, no icky residue, all natural</li>
            <li> Used it on a new tattoo as it was highly recommended by the tattoo artist.</li>
            <li> its a little on the pricy side compared to other shea products, but this is a nice formula and the lack of ash-funk makes it worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Maybe if this was shipped with dry ice it would be ok but the heat it suffered in transit made the ointment melt then re-cool and become gritty.</li>
            <li> It lasts for several hours, the skin gets soft once it soaks in, and while oily at first it becomes pretty soft and tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Remember to use lightly, which should not be a problem with hustle butter, unlike other ointments.</li>
            <li> Not to mention that it smells nice, and only a little goes</li>
            <li> Bought it after reading the reviews for our new tattoos.</li>
            <li> This is all I use, whenever I get a new tattoo.  </li>
            <li> Will try a my new tattoo in two weeks and post review on healing process.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new go-to after care for my tattoos.</li>
            <li> New</li>
            <li> This is definitely my new tattoo aftercare product of choice.</li>
            <li> I have lots of tattoos and decided to try some new aftercare stuff.</li>
            <li> Keeps your new tattoo hydrated.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try it when I get the new tattoo.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it unless it&#x27;s really painful because the healing power here is great.</li>
            <li> This is their favorite product so far and they have tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> Will use it for all my ink - new and old!</li>
            <li> its the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one note of mention, when you take your first finger tip full, it will seem a bit stiff, but immediately upon contact with your skin, it turns, literally, into butter.</li>
            <li> Also, I have sensitive skin and eczema, but had no negative reaction to Hustle Butter (which was a concern).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it after every tattoo and am completely healed (with no scabs!)</li>
            <li> I recently tried Hustle Butter for the first time.</li>
            <li> New and old</li>
            <li> been using this on new tattoos, old tattoos, and healing tattoos.</li>
            <li> Currently in the process of getting full back piece and didn&#x27;t use A&amp;D or Aquaphor.  </li>
            <li> I had a a large solid area that extended into my elbow crease, so I got pretty big scabs.  </li>
            <li> Another trait I loved is that a little bit goes a long way, so this tub can last you a loooong time.</li>
            <li> i get REALLY scaly when im healing a new tattoo and regular applications of hustle butter</li>
            <li> in all, I would recommend it but not over lubriderm or a similar un-scented lotion, as those tend to soak into your skin a little better.</li>
            <li> All natural as well.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re getting any ink get this stuff early and put it on the area for a couple days before the tattoo session</li>
            <li> Skin is soft.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and helped heal a tattoo well.</li>
            <li> When I received the product it was completely melted.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> old tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Old tattoo&#x27;s...great to moisturize.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also got all natural ingredients which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper on Amazon than at the local tattoo shop.</li>
            <li> do have sensitive skin &amp; eczema and had no break outs from this product.</li>
            <li> so i used my old stand by Aquaphor ointment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I really like this, I find it easier to put on than Tattoo Goo, and it seems to last a lot longer on the skin.</li>
            <li> I use this product for roughly around a week on a fresh tattoo until it starts to peel</li>
            <li> I have 2 huge tattoos, one on my thigh and a half sleeve, and I would never use anything else for them!</li>
            <li> the smell is clean and it doesn&#x27;t mess with your stencil.</li>
            <li> Lastly, most other reviews state the 5 oz tub goes a long way already complete with tub after two sessions one 5.5 hour session and last session was 7.  </li>
            <li> I also never had a second peal which I had read was normal, but not having the second peel is apparently normal with Hustle Butter!</li>
            <li> Makes new and old tattoos stand out especially at the beach or any sunny environment</li>
            <li> I got my first tattoo (large tribal arm piece) and was using the normal stuff (Aquaphor &amp; Aveeno) and the healing processes was going slow until I got this stuff</li>
            <li> I left a detailed review already for a previous purchase.</li>
            <li> blacks in my 2 newest tattoos have healed super crisp and dark compared to my other tattoo I had used After Inked on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m heavily tattooed and have tried every healing method over the last 20 years and think I have finally found a product that provides the safe and airy protective layer while lubricating and nourishing without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products on the market that were released over the past year or two and nothing holds a candle to Hustle Butter Deluxe.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always sceptic tying out new creams and lotions especially for tattoo aftercare.</li>
            <li> Recently I&#x27;ve run out of Tattoo Goo, so I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li> Provides sheer, light-weight, non-greasy protection to new tattoos.</li>
            <li> Gritty is not what you want to rub onto a new tattoo.</li>
            <li> I thought it was strange for the first one but to also get the second one not sealed made me wonder.</li>
            <li> It is worrisome given food allergies are more common than one would think, and I am rubbing this product in an open wound.</li>
            <li> I used it nearly 100% for the first half of my tattoo.  </li>
            <li> For those with sensitive skin and are prone to breakouts due to petroleum products, I highly recommend trying this organic, all natural product.</li>
            <li> I love using Hustle Butter on my tattoo, it makes it shine, brings out the colors &amp; makes the black look black and not gray.  </li>
            <li> AND it&#x27;s natural enough you could eat it.</li>
            <li> I left mine in my car for maybe a couple of hours and it is all grainy now and not as soft as it used to be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also all natural which is a definite plus.</li>
            <li> My tattoo artist has looked into many different after care products that are not petroleum based, but was not happy with the reviews &amp; results.</li>
            <li> When it first goes on it feels a little sticky, but as it heats up and melts into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> And it really helped heal my tattoos quicker that other similar products.</li>
            <li> (this also makes it easy to spread thinly over your tattoo)  </li>
            <li> I had a large half sleeve piece done recently and decided to give Hustle Butter a try.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit goes a long way so it will last a while, even on a large tattoo.</li>
            <li> No trouble during the healing process like my other tattoos had when I was using A&amp;D ointment.</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s other natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> After using another brand that is much thicker that is the usual ointment recommended by tattooers, I was given a sample of this and I will never go back.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a tiny bit, it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This keep the colors vibrant and helps prevent less scarring and scabbing!</li>
            <li> Used this cream from right after bandage removed after four hours of each session and had minimal peeling from my taft which i usually have tons using strictly</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve noticed a lot less scab formation, softer skin around the tattoo, and the colors seem to hold up well with a several times a day application.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> As far as peeling, around the third day I started peeling but it only lasted 1-2 days and just in small bits.</li>
            <li> Had a large piece two weeks ago hardly scabbed</li>
            <li> Works especially well at night when regular lotions and other tattoo aftercare products might wear off or become dry by morning.</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s organic and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Its not oily, it goes al long</li>
            <li> I just got a big, solid black band around my wrist and the artist gave me a sample pack of this to try..</li>
            <li> A lot goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I use it to heal all my tattoos now, and I heal up several days faster than I ever did using the 4 or 5 other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> It may seem expensive, but it is worth every cent!</li>
            <li> I have 45hrs in my legs [ Tats} 35 hrs in my back, and working on my other leg.  </li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You Can&#x27;t Knock The Hustle!</li>
            <li> I will use this as a pre, during, and post tat for a very long time.</li>
            <li> it also helps with dry skin in the winter for getting tattooed.</li>
            <li> I have also found it works wonders on dry cuticles</li>
            <li> This cream feels like aloe on a sunburn soothing and look forward to each application when your skin begins to dry and tighten up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After being tattooed, I wash the area with soap 2-3 times a day, after 2-3 days (when the tattoo starts feeling dry)</li>
            <li> I have also used it on dry skin</li>
            <li> When applying I didn&#x27;t rub it in, I just put some on my hand and patted it on and dabbed off the excess with a dry paper towel.</li>
            <li> Because my tattoo was dry</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend Hustle Butter for tattoos and other things, dry skin, small scratches, rashes, ect.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been contemplating the single packs.</li>
            <li> i am a fan for life and plan on using it for every single piece that i will ever get.</li>
            <li> I usually get a little puffy around tattoos, but this one hardly got swollen at all (despite being large and full saturation) and my skin feels so supple, rather than all delicate.</li>
            <li> and it helps keep the redness down a bit , its not a total replacement for AD</li>
            <li> I am getting tattooed lower back down to my foot.  </li>
            <li> It goes on a little thick at first but seems to &#x27;melt&#x27; once your body warms it up.</li>
            <li> I got a pretty big and expensive shoulder tattoo 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> 2 days later i get the order and scabbing had started due to drying out (yes i know i could have put other ointments on but wanted to stick to this).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks and go in to start color on my half sleeve tomorrow, so that will be the big test</li>
            <li> /&gt;The key is to keep the stuff on your skin for a couple of minutes, to melt a little, before spreading it on.</li>
            <li> A little goes a looong way because this goes from a solid to a silky butter consistency</li>
            <li> Suprisingly caused minimal peeling during the healing process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually had a few friends get on and buy some after they checked mine out.</li>
            <li> The artist used another product in the beginning, and used Hustle Butter for the last few sessions.</li>
            <li> Take care of your tattoos because we all know we spent tons of money on getting them.</li>
            <li> Expected.</li>
            <li> I had found that no matter how careful I was using the aquaphor method, I would scab to some extent during the healing process.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The other 11 times, this never happened.</li>
            <li> I did and the shipping got delayed due to the send (thats another story) and i ran out of the sample while waiting.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use any other tattoo after care.</li>
            <li> The other problem is allergies.</li>
            <li> Its not as greasy as some other products out there</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out like other products do.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sit on the surface as much as other products do and that makes it easier to go about your day without the worry that it will ruin clothing.</li>
            <li> so be careful when opening!).  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a LONG way.&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING STUFF!!</li>
            <li> Right now, I&#x27;m pretty miserable.</li>
            <li> It also helps to keep the swelling down after getting work done.</li>
            <li> also notice it helped the swelling go down</li>
            <li> It also has left me with a rash the last two areas I have used it, but it is because my skin is so weird in the extreme heat.</li>
            <li> Slight shine, not oily.</li>
            <li> Healing times have been cut in half just from using it in the process.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, not greasy.</li>
            <li> It needs to melt just a little bit.</li>
            <li> A little goes a loooong way-really.</li>
            <li> Even if it&#x27;s a little pricey,</li>
            <li> A little goes along way.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive and weird skin</li>
            <li> I am heavily tattooed and have always used the aquaphor method.</li>
            <li> my half sleeve healed in about a week with very, very little pealing.</li>
            <li> I picked some up after my artist started using it during the tattoo process, during which I noticed my skin getting much less irritated and inflamed than it usually did before he started using Hustle Butter.  </li>
            <li> I really only use lotion if I am either in an extremely cold, dry environment, or on my tattoos.</li>
            <li> It slowly melts down on your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it sticky.</li>
            <li> raw shea benefits</li>
            <li> So apply some to the skin, let it melt a little since it&#x27;s thick, then apply evenly.</li>
            <li> Finally, this product is ridiculously expensive, even at wholesale.</li>
            <li> Prevents excessive scabbing.</li>
            <li> I did not love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I wanted too, but it made me break out in a weird itchy, red, bumpy rash all around my tattoo.</li>
            <li> My 1 year old son had a bad diaper rash and nothing was helping</li>
            <li> So maybe slow healing is better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this stuff makes Tattoo Goo and all that other stuff look like total crap.</li>
            <li> I mean, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend eating it, but you could.  </li>
            <li> My chest plate (declitae &amp; shoulder area) was healed in less than two weeks!!!</li>
            <li> Seriously-</li>
            <li> Seriously if I could eat this stuff</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it</li>
            <li> This makes it very messy and difficult to use during a tattoo (I was forced to pour it into a Dixie cup).</li>
            <li> She had me use it as the initial care product, instead of anything thick and goopy like A&amp;D or Aquaphor, and holy crap</li>
            <li> It was behind my my knee and in front of knee.  </li>
            <li> I got it and the seal was broken and looked like someone had touched it.</li>
            <li> Addicted to it now for all the tattoos on my sleeves.</li>
            <li> He used it while tattooing and the redness and swelling wasn&#x27;t as bad as usual.</li>
            <li> , every session healed wonderfully, not one scab or oozing, ect.</li>
            <li> I keep searching for a wholesale pricing for licensed shops but unable to find anything as of yet.</li>
            <li> trust me, you cant go wrong with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I will say I have weird skin.</li>
            <li> but without the dirty ashtray smell.  </li>
            <li> I do like this product, but I was disappointed in the delivery.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I didn&#x27;t need to use it anymore.  </li>
            <li> the smell after a while was annoying</li>
            <li> The healing process very painful</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use the crap out of it!</li>
            <li> Tastes awful.  </li>
            <li> I read petroleum products were terrible for tattoos</li>
            <li> It lessens the horrible itchy stage!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is of the highest quality and smells amazing!  Multiple sources of &amp;#34;butters&amp;#34; make up this product and works for more than just tattoos!  Excellent hand lotion and the scent is amazing.</li>
            <li> Works great , irritated my skin after three days of use</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff! Bought it after reading the reviews for our new tattoos. No trouble during the healing process like my other tattoos had when I was using A&amp;D ointment. Love the smell too. Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!!! Works better then A&amp;D and it smells good!Got here fast better believe ill be buying more!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is Amazing!! Smells Great and lubricates the skin and/or tattoo, effectively. My tattoo artists used while tatting and I used it during healing and afterwards for daily moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;The key is to keep the stuff on your skin for a couple of minutes, to melt a little, before spreading it on. Treat it just like you would when spreading real butter on a piece of toast. It needs to melt just a little bit. A little bit goes a LONG way.&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING STUFF!! I&#x27;m HOOKED!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. My tattoo is healing nicely and by using the Hustle Butter my skin in staying pliable. One of the best products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff I don&#x27;t use anything else anymore helps keep swelling down durring the tattoo process and it smells nice also!</li>
            <li> Good for tattoo after care. I have used it from the day after tattoo until it&#x27;s started peeling. Had no scabbing while using it The only bad thing about it it&#x27;s that kinda oily and can get on your sheets or clothes when sleeping.</li>
            <li> Great tattoo aftercare. Melts like butter. Smells great.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product on my 5th sitting on my 2nd big piece.  I am PISSED I didn&#x27;t know about this stuff earlier. It is AMAZING. Smells great. Sped up healing time. Reduced scabbing and kept the colors vibrant.  I recommend this stuff to ANYONE and EVERYONE I talk to.</li>
            <li> Awesome body butter!! Great scent!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve tried just about every kind of tattoo healing regiment, but this is the one that works amazing for me!</li>
            <li> I love Hustle Butter! It keeps my tattoo looking bright and my skin super soft!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product! I got a pretty big and expensive shoulder tattoo 2 years ago. I read about this product in inked magazine. I wanted something to make my tat pop even after two years. This definitely did the job. I will use this as a pre, during, and post tat for a very long time. Awesome product and amazing smell!</li>
            <li> This is all I use, whenever I get a new tattoo.  It is much better than that petroleum that they give you at many of the tattoo shops.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive and weird skin so I&#x27;m always sceptic tying out new creams and lotions especially for tattoo aftercare.This stuff is awesome I haven&#x27;t had any skin reactions to this at all,it smells awesome and is all organic I love it.This is the only aftercare (before ,during) cream that is going on my tattoos.My tattoo artist also uses it he got me hooked ...</li>
            <li> what can I say, this stuff is amazing! Before, during, and after, this product will take top notch care of your skin and tattoo work. My artist introduced it to me during my second session for an arm piece and the difference was incredible! Forget tattoo goo, forget bag balm, forget everything else this stuff is the best tattoo care product there is. Goes on super easily, doesn&#x27;t draw inks at all, doesn&#x27;t have to be washed between applications, and smells great! \\&quot;like a girl at the beach\\&quot;, someone said of the scent. All natural as well. I recommend it to everyone I know. If you&#x27;re getting any ink get this stuff early and put it on the area for a couple days before the tattoo session and it will make your skin supple and ready to absorb ink</li>
            <li> as many tattoos I get and have this stuff is fantastic my artist recommended it to me a few weeks ago its awesome I won&#x27;t use anything else, the good thing its natural and i run my fingers in my hair with it and now I&#x27;m noticing my hair is benefiting from it as well,&lt;br /&gt;great service fast shipping, 5 stars all the way.</li>
            <li> This product was introduced to me by my favorite tattoo artist. Instead of using A&amp;D ointment during the healing process I tried Hustle Butter. What a difference! No ink loss or scabbing, supple skin, and my tattoos look amazing. I&#x27;ve recommended Hustle Butter to all of my friends and this will definitely be my go to product. It is all natural, organic and smells delicious. Try it, Hustle Butter is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Great what I was looking for brand new sealed I would 100% recommend and buy again</li>
            <li> First I love the hustle butter it&#x27;s a great product. However I did order two separate shipments from this co. and both were not sealed. I thought it was strange for the first one but to also get the second one not sealed made me wonder. Either way it&#x27;s a pain to send it back and it did work great on my tat and it healed great and I still use it.</li>
            <li> Worth the money and will order another one. This is the product I will not have no doubts no matter what.</li>
            <li> Used it 2 days in a row. Skin is soft. On a healed tattoo, it highlights it. Slight shine, not oily. Just right. Will try a my new tattoo in two weeks and post review on healing process. As for now, 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It not juat great for tattoo  healing, it&#x27;s also awesome for skin burns of any type. I  currently working on my back piece and this healed everything up so far nicely.  This is go to now. A lot goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Best tattoo aftercare out there!</li>
            <li> Love it. Best tattoo Creme ever and I highly recommend it. Best aftercare.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!! Smells great and no greasy residue</li>
            <li> HustleButter is amazing after-tattoo care. Especially for bigger pieces. I bought it after having 7 hours of work done and it was especially helpful in the healing process as well as smelling great and being all natural. It is also great for dry cuticles or making a tattoo look bright and fresh. If you get ink, you need this!</li>
            <li> This works amazingly with fresh tattoos.. helps the healing process and keeps it from itching.. it is heaven sent!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff on my new ink! It smells great and my skin never gets dry with it. Best part is that it has no unknown chemicals. Totally organic. My tattoo artist used some on me once and I was hooked.</li>
            <li> worlds better than A&amp;D</li>
            <li> This is the best cream for tattoos that I&#x27;ve used I recommend it to anyone with tattoos new or old</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Makes my skin soft and helped heal a tattoo well. Smells like heaven.</li>
            <li> This is a great before during and after tattoo care product. It smells very nice and small amounts can cover a pretty decent size area. I have been giving and receiving tattoos for over 15 years and this is the best stuff I have used and offered customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I don&#x27;t know if I would go so far as to say it gets rid of scabbing and itching right away like others have posted, I would say that I wont use anything else now that I have used this product.</li>
            <li> l love all the natural ingredients in this product, and it works exactly as it&#x27;s intended. A light layer lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> I do like this product, but I was disappointed in the delivery. When I received the product it was completely melted. I had to chill it to get it back to a solid before I could use it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you just how good it feels on a fresh tattoo and it smells amazing too.  it also helps with dry skin in the winter for getting tattooed.</li>
            <li> I recently got another tattoo and my artist talked this stuff up. At first, it was great. He used it while tattooing and the redness and swelling wasn&#x27;t as bad as usual. I used it for 3 more days, as suggested, and now I have an itchy rash all around my tattoo. I have no idea what ingredient could have caused the rash. I&#x27;ve never had any issues with rosemary, mango, papaya, coconut, mint, etc. I have 12 tattoos. The other 11 times, this never happened. Right now, I&#x27;m pretty miserable. Itchy rash plus fresh tattoo SUCKS. Going back to Aquaphor.</li>
            <li> Works wonders! Smells great, must buy if you have new/old tattoos!</li>
            <li> I went through 6 straight hours ok ink and the artist gave me a sample and said i should pick up some since its a large piece. I did and the shipping got delayed due to the send (thats another story) and i ran out of the sample while waiting. 2 days later i get the order and scabbing had started due to drying out (yes i know i could have put other ointments on but wanted to stick to this).  withing 24hrs of applying the scabs healed and skin smoothed out. great product recommended to everyone getting ink</li>
            <li> Great product to keep your tat looking great. Smells great too like suttle nutty coconut. Like it says: good for all stages of tat.</li>
            <li> worked great! I had tried many things in the past, this was the best so far on my new tattoo</li>
            <li> I am about 10 tattoo hours away from a full body suit. Hustle Butter is hands down the best product I have ever used to heal new tattoos with. Personally, I use it during the day and wrap the tattoo in plastic wrap the first two nights, which I find works best. After that all I do is apply Hustle Butter to the fresh tattoo until healed.  Seriously- this stuff makes Tattoo Goo and all that other stuff look like total crap. AND it&#x27;s natural enough you could eat it. I mean, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend eating it, but you could.  Here are the only downsides: When it melts it takes on a grainy feel but still works. It also has left me with a rash the last two areas I have used it, but it is because my skin is so weird in the extreme heat. I say that because I want to warn you about how this product may break you out... but it&#x27;s worth it unless it&#x27;s really painful because the healing power here is great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my artist used it while applying my tattoo. I liked the smell and according to him it speeds up the healing process and helps the skin hold the ink better. I have to say, my half sleeve healed in about a week with very, very little pealing. I applied it twice per day, once in the morning, one before bed, and the results couldn&#x27;t have been better. I highly recommend this product for the aftercare of your tattoo. I plan to continue using it to see if it helps the color last!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Taking it to my next appointment for sure! Can&#x27;t wait to use the crap out of it!</li>
            <li> My husband received a sample size of this from his tattoo artist.  He loved it.  I bought him the full size for his birthday.  It really does make a difference in the healing process &amp; works much better than other products.</li>
            <li> I got my first tattoo (large tribal arm piece) and was using the normal stuff (Aquaphor &amp; Aveeno) and the healing processes was going slow until I got this stuff then everything went into overdrive. The few scabs that I had started to heal and go away asap, and as everyone says this stuff does smell good. I will be using this for all future tattoo&#x27;s as soon as I get home from now one.</li>
            <li> It is ultimately moisturizing! Smells great and just a bit goes a long way! My artist used and recommended this fir my last big side piece. Being organic is the cherry on top!</li>
            <li> Tastes awful.  Ruined my breakfast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT PUT THIS ON TOAST.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it before and after tattoos!</li>
            <li> Bought it because of the name.. And dont regret it! Lol! Love that it&#x27;s a vegan product! And it really helped heal my tattoos quicker that other similar products. Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff tattoo healed in 3 to 4 days</li>
            <li> I love hustle butter! It has a great smell and works great! Used it on a new tattoo as it was highly recommended by the tattoo artist. My tattoo healed exceptionally well - no scabbing and minimal peeling. Another trait I loved is that a little bit goes a long way, so this tub can last you a loooong time.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, exact product, great transaction and experience!</li>
            <li> I loved this on my tattoos. I have also found it works wonders on dry cuticles ;) so I use it every night before bed on my hands.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  As a person that has large tattoos and has had a lot of sitting, this stuff is awesome.  It smells really good.  Wouldn&#x27;t use any other tattoo after care.</li>
            <li> Best tattoo care product. I use it daily!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I don&#x27; think there is a better tattoo after care product out there. It slowly melts down on your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it sticky. It also smells great! Give it a try!</li>
            <li> It is absolutely amazing. It shines my tattoos.  ♡♡♡</li>
            <li> Great stuff love the butter. Great as they apply tattoo and even better after.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells real nice. Bought this for my wife for her discreetly placed tattoo. Wish it tasted better!</li>
            <li> My artist uses this on every tattoo and it heals so nice and smooth. Highly recommend for tour after care tattoo</li>
            <li> I use this for tattoo care, for aftercare, leather care, beard care, you name it. Smells amazing and moisturizes extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps your beard soft and smells great, keeps leather supple, keeps tattoos vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;I think you could use it as gun lube, too- basically, it&#x27;s a biker&#x27;s best friend.</li>
            <li> Product arrived grainy and hurt to use. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My favorite tattoo lubricant by far.</li>
            <li> Love it, my tattoo healed way faster then normal. I have and will continue to recommend it to friends and family</li>
            <li> I love it! Great product! Smells wonderful too! Has done wonders for my tattoo! I recommend this product to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> its good stuff and it helps keep the redness down a bit , its not a total replacement for AD but it is a nice tool to keep handy. AD is superior in a few ways and if I had to choose to use only one between the AD and the HB Id give the edge to the AD. Price and shipping are very high.</li>
            <li> Awesome!! I am getting tattooed lower back down to my foot.  The healing process very painful, I bought this product and even my tattoo artist was impressed! Asked what was I using to heal so quickly I go once a week and he noticed a huge difference in heeling.  It was behind my my knee and in front of knee.  A place you move all the time so it takes longer to heal.  There is a grit texture but it disolves.  It feels great.</li>
            <li> My tattoo shop swears by this stuff. And I ADORE the product!!! I&#x27;m a repeat user and love the natural ingredients. Goes on beautiful and is working wonders on my new tattoo. This keep the colors vibrant and helps prevent less scarring and scabbing! Will be buying more of this soon. Can&#x27;t say enough great things about it...I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Looks, smells, and works fantastic!  My artist used it to tattoo on me . I bought the tub for aftercare and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> best tattoo application cream and after care ever made. the smell is clean and it doesn&#x27;t mess with your stencil.</li>
            <li> I have 2 huge tattoos, one on my thigh and a half sleeve, and I would never use anything else for them! keeps them perfectly hydrated, also helps with itching. I continue to use Hustle butter even after my tattoos have healed. and  It smells great!</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this paraben free post tattoo balm! It smells amazing and is very emollient without feeling heavy. My tattoo healed great and hustle butter can also be used to moisturize and maintain!</li>
            <li> Recently I&#x27;ve run out of Tattoo Goo, so I decided to try something new. I&#x27;ve heard nothing but great things about this and since the price was unbeatable, I had to try it. This doesn&#x27;t have an ointment feel like Tattoo Goo has as Hustle Butter is mostly made of shea butters -does a very good job moisturising. I think I&#x27;m starting to favour this more. It also smells like mangoes.</li>
            <li> My husband and both my kids are on a tattoo craze. This is their favorite product so far and they have tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Just a little bit goes a long way so it will last a while, even on a large tattoo. It keeps the area moist without feeling sticky or greasy. Definitely a favorite in my household!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It came recommended by my tattoo artist, and it was wonderful. I used it often during healing and it looks awesome. Plus it has a great smell.</li>
            <li> Wow. it&#x27;s seriously a magic healing lotion; cracked heals, cry hands, new tattoos, old tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;This cream can do it all!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! I use it for more then just a tattoo cream. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tattooing 15years and this is by far my favorite product. All my Customers have made the which and with 100% satisfaction. A+</li>
            <li> Used during and after tattoo, excellent results!</li>
            <li> if you get tattoos, then you will need to try this. purchased on a recommendation from our tat artist. great product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love hustle butter - awesome product - but would not recommend ordering in the summer as the outdoor heat exposure from shipment caused it to turn extremely grainy in texture, rendering it nearly unusable since it really does not melt well (or quickly) once it becomes that grainy.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. My husband bought it for his tattoo, but i stole it from him. My new favorite body butter/moisturizer.</li>
            <li> For those with sensitive skin and are prone to breakouts due to petroleum products, I highly recommend trying this organic, all natural product. I&#x27;m heavily tattooed and have tried every healing method over the last 20 years and think I have finally found a product that provides the safe and airy protective layer while lubricating and nourishing without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> Best product ever.  If you get a tattoo, you need this.  I have used it on my last two and it heals faster.  Great product....</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it leaves my skin really soft and brings out the colors on my tattoo.worth the money.</li>
            <li> Made healing process way better / would love if it would come scented / the smell after a while was annoying</li>
            <li> Awesome product... most of my upper body is coverred and this by far is the best aftercare product i&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> Arrived very grainy and abrasive which is not what my new tattoo needs at all.  Will try to microwave it and refrigerate it to reconstitute it.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of Hustle Butter and I absolutely loved the smell. A little goes a long way. A great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff!!! It&#x27;s my new go-to after care for my tattoos. It&#x27;s perfect! It kept my skin moist without feeling oily. It helped with the healing process too!</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever, great on my tattoos, I use it on my beard and hair to</li>
            <li> Absolutely phenomenal product. Smells like straight up amazing. Vegan also and petroleum free. I will continue to buy this stuff.</li>
            <li> Currently in the process of getting full back piece and didn&#x27;t use A&amp;D or Aquaphor.  Used this cream from right after bandage removed after four hours of each session and had minimal peeling from my taft which i usually have tons using strictly A&amp;D.  This cream feels like aloe on a sunburn soothing and look forward to each application when your skin begins to dry and tighten up.  Recommend for any person whom wants to protect their investment in their tattoo.  Lastly, most other reviews state the 5 oz tub goes a long way already complete with tub after two sessions one 5.5 hour session and last session was 7.  I would recommend getting two tubs through bigger pieces.</li>
            <li> I tried using this product as a tattoo lubricant. While I love the idea of not using petroleum products, there are several drawbacks of hustlebutter. My chief complaint is that unless this product is kept at the perfect  temperature, it turns to liquid. This makes it very messy and difficult to use during a tattoo (I was forced to pour it into a Dixie cup). If it returns to a paste, it is then grainy and not the same constancy ever again. Not user friendly. The other problem is allergies. It is very important to know if your client has any allergies to coconut or it&#x27;s other natural ingredients. It is worrisome given food allergies are more common than one would think, and I am rubbing this product in an open wound. Finally, this product is ridiculously expensive, even at wholesale. I don&#x27;t want to put a price on clients health, but A&amp;D does not turn to liquid, does an excellent job, and is inexpensive. While I loved the smell, how it soothed the skin, and it&#x27;s natural ingredients, it is not stable enough to use as a go to product for tattooing.</li>
            <li> Hands down one of the absolute best tattoo after care products. Provides sheer, light-weight, non-greasy protection to new tattoos. Keeps the colors vibrant and has aided with the healing of my tattoos. I have 7 tattoos (tattooed 9 times, two cover-ups). I have used Hustle Butter on my 4 most recent ones and the difference is night and day.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and the smell, leaves skin smooth and older tattoos look newer.</li>
            <li> My favorite product to put on a fresh tattoo. It keeps the ink looking good, has a nice smell plus it&#x27;s organic and lasts a long time. To me it&#x27;s better than tattoo goo and some of the other products out there.</li>
            <li> Solid product I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my tattoos. Working on 2 full sleeves it takes away itchy feeling, burning sensation when applied and tattoos have been healing beautifully!!!! Works especially well at night when regular lotions and other tattoo aftercare products might wear off or become dry by morning. Fairly inexpensive as well for the amount and how long the jar lasts.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! After using another brand that is much thicker that is the usual ointment recommended by tattooers, I was given a sample of this and I will never go back. Hustle Butter is by far the best smelling, easiest to spread, and quickest healing ointment I&#x27;ve used on my tattoos. I have about 30 hours alone into my leg and I&#x27;ve been using this from the start, every session healed wonderfully, not one scab or oozing, ect. Heal time was about 1.5-2 weeks, with one session being closer to 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend Hustle Butter for tattoos and other things, dry skin, small scratches, rashes, ect. Hustle Butter&#x27;s Facebook has a lot of great stories of people having positive results on things other than tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being tattooed, I wash the area with soap 2-3 times a day, after 2-3 days (when the tattoo starts feeling dry) I will apply the Hustle Butter, twice a day after washing with soap. Keep doing this until your tattoo is healed! Remember to use lightly, which should not be a problem with hustle butter, unlike other ointments.</li>
            <li> The best for healing and after care. Had a large piece two weeks ago hardly scabbed</li>
            <li> Very pleased! This is my first tattoo and I knew only what I read online about tattoo care (plus some recommendations from friends on using Aquaphor. My tattoo artist recommended Hustle Butter and after reading the reviews here, I was sold. I used the product 3-4 times a day for the first three weeks of my tattoo. As far as peeling, around the third day I started peeling but it only lasted 1-2 days and just in small bits. I also never had a second peal which I had read was normal, but not having the second peel is apparently normal with Hustle Butter! Also, I have sensitive skin and eczema, but had no negative reaction to Hustle Butter (which was a concern).&lt;br /&gt;I admit, I&#x27;m new to tattooing and have nothing to compare to, but I would definitely use Hustle Butter again if I ever get some more work done!</li>
            <li> Best product on the market</li>
            <li> Best tattoo recovery product I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I will never go back to a petroleum based product ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added bonus it smells great.</li>
            <li> Suprisingly caused minimal peeling during the healing process. Which in turn, kept the ink vibrant(blackl/grey and color) It kept the skin well moistured and it smells good. Its not as greasy as some other products out there and it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out like other products do. This is the second time I had to buy this since the boyfriend jacked mine because he liked it as well.</li>
            <li> Best thing for tattoos. New and old</li>
            <li> We get tattoos regularly and it speeds the healing process. I have also used it on dry skin and wow I love how it makes my skin feel. My 1 year old son had a bad diaper rash and nothing was helping so I tried using this hustle butter on his rash and poof it went away after one use.  I would recommend this product to EVERYONE</li>
            <li> I did a ton of research for the best products before getting my first tattoo.I loved that this was vegan, light and non-clogging, and allegedly smelled great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these claims are true! This stuff is a God-sent for tattoo aftercare. My tattoo is on my ankle and I&#x27;m a teacher, while it was healing the tattoo often swelled because I was on my feet all day. This stuff instantly reduced swelling upon applying it. It also kept it protected and reduced the itch tenfold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so nice, it can easily be used as a body butter. I put it on the driest places of my body - my elbows, which are usually white and peeling, have never felt smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, a great purchase for tattoo aftercare! I have no clue how it is for application, but for healing it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I won&#x27;t use anything else when I have work done.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent: a mixture of tropics, coconut, and beach. Great for immediate tattoo after care.</li>
            <li> Hustle butter did a great job healing my tattoo.</li>
            <li> Hustle butter is great. I&#x27;ve actually had a few friends get on and buy some after they checked mine out. I will definitely keep buying this product. Tattoos heal fast and without any issues. The smell of this stuff is amazing too. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!!!.... Goes on smooth as silk and isn&#x27;t greasy!!! Keeps my tattoos looking new and smells great too!!!</li>
            <li> I got this along with a tattoo goo kit and I can honestly say I like this ALOT better then the tattoo goo products, it just moisturized better, smells betters, feels better, overall I just like it better and it did make my tattoo heal better.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Smells great!!</li>
            <li> great product that smells good too, all natural ingredients just don&#x27;t overdue it when applying, excess can lead to clogging pores and breakouts</li>
            <li> awesome product ! smells great and heals tattoo extremely fast.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this aftercare. It smells AMAZING and kept my tattoo from scabbing up. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Best after care product available. If you use it correctly, you&#x27;re tattoo will heal with no color loss or scabbing</li>
            <li> Used this on my first tattoo...so I don&#x27;t have tons of experience, but I read petroleum products were terrible for tattoos so I tried Hustle Butter. It worked great to moisturize. Never felt like it was irritating, tattoo healed great! I also really like it as a balm for my elbows and lips. Smells nice, has good natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Amazing product it feels nice and smells great too just be very careful to not put too much when the first month you get your tattoo.</li>
            <li> Hustle butter is on Amazon!?!?  Epically fantastic! I have been a fan of Hustle Butter for years now, and it truly is amazing for tattoo work. The difference it makes during the tattoo is amazing, and the difference during healing is absolutely incredible!! I got a large, very colorful piece done. The artist used another product in the beginning, and used Hustle Butter for the last few sessions. There is a difference in the color saturation from product to product. The sessions that he used Hustle Butter during tattooing are more vibrant and rich than the other sections It all looks great, don&#x27;t get me wrong. But there is a difference....It also really doesn&#x27;t get as red, bleed as much, or swell as much when used during a tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;And the healing. Oh, the healing. It peels and heals so much faster! I cannot say enough about Hustle Butter. It truly is miracle butter for tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;What do you have to lose by trying Hustle Butter? Nothing!  But you have everything to gain! A better tattoo experience, faster healing, less itchy peeling time, and a better looking tattoo for the rest of your life. Give it a shot!</li>
            <li> I picked some up after my artist started using it during the tattoo process, during which I noticed my skin getting much less irritated and inflamed than it usually did before he started using Hustle Butter.  I use it to heal all my tattoos now, and I heal up several days faster than I ever did using the 4 or 5 other products I&#x27;ve tried.  Not to mention, it&#x27;s all natural, all organic, and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> Works great and smells great !</li>
            <li> This is the only thing we will ever use on our tattoos! Works great!</li>
            <li> New tattoo&#x27;s...Stops the itch and smells great too. Old tattoo&#x27;s...great to moisturize. So much better than other alternatives that are out there.</li>
            <li> Hustle butter is the best thing on the market for tattoo care. You don&#x27;t need much of it to make your tattoos pop and as a moisturizer. The 5 oz tubs are what I buy every time. Take care of your tattoos because we all know we spent tons of money on getting them.</li>
            <li> Great deal, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The hustle butter came melted and it&#x27;s very gritty.</li>
            <li> Love how it heals my tattoos. I notice a difference when my artist uses it instead of A&amp;D ointment.</li>
            <li> Maybe if this was shipped with dry ice it would be ok but the heat it suffered in transit made the ointment melt then re-cool and become gritty. Gritty is not what you want to rub onto a new tattoo.</li>
            <li> Great product for tattoo aftercare. This product is great even for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It came within estimated arrival time and was just what I wanted</li>
            <li> If you use anything else for tattoo aftercare or skin care, swap to hustlebutter. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. It smells wonderful, is organic, and soothes the skin. I even use it on my lips hands and face!</li>
            <li> I love this ointment!! Very comparative prices and showed up quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought Hustle Butter more than 2 weeks ago after my first session on my third tattoo. I used it multiple times a day, as often as I could/remembered. I went back for the second session a couple days ago and my tattoo artist was impressed by the healing. At the end of the session, he told me to just do whatever I did the first time because it healed so well. He was specifically impressed that I had no color loss.</li>
            <li> I recommended this because it works great on and during getting your new tattoo. Better healing and less sting during the work on the tattoo.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product out there! I&#x27;m covered in tattoos and have used this for years. All natural ingredients and vegan friendly! Don&#x27;t buy anything else!</li>
            <li> Works the best for tattoos. ..makes em pop..!!&lt;br /&gt;Great ingredients. ......!!!!!No complaints...Top of the line tatt care..!!!yes it works great...</li>
            <li> great stuff fast shipping healed my tattoo nicely</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Great healing effect</li>
            <li> Amazing! I left a detailed review already for a previous purchase. This stuff is the best tattoo care that we have found!! Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. It may seem expensive, but it is worth every cent!</li>
            <li> Worked really well. Just don&#x27;t leave it in a hot place it&#x27;ll melt. No residue and no oily feeling. Moisturizers my tattoo as it healed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on 2 $300+ pieces I have and they both healed fast and look great. When applying I didn&#x27;t rub it in, I just put some on my hand and patted it on and dabbed off the excess with a dry paper towel. This stuff also smells great.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, but after trying this for my aftercare on my tattoos I am in love with it! Works great on my psoriasis too....and it smells yummy!</li>
            <li> This is the best item I&#x27;ve ever purchased for my tattoos.  All of the ingredients make me feel good about using it on my pieces, and it smells great.  Hustle Butter helps me heal, applies easily and has never irritated my skin like other products have.  My artist uses it while working and it&#x27;s very helpful then too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Helps heal a new tattoo - and makes an older ones color pop. Smells wonderful too. Love it. Will use it for all my ink - new and old!</li>
            <li> Works much better than Tattoo Goo. A tiny bit goes a long way. Has a pleasant odor. Keep the tattoo looking healthy and aids in a quick healing. Prevents excessive scabbing. I&#x27;ve used this on the last five tattoos. I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> I need to get more asap.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, arrived sooner the. Expected. Love the smell of this stuff, it&#x27;s a huge amount you will need a sleeve to go through this.</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels good, makes my tattoos heal quickly and they look amazing!!! So much better than A&amp;D! Love it!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product &amp; this seller. Everything was perfect! Hustle Butter is by far the best (and completely natural) product I&#x27;ve used for my tattoos. It can be used during the tattooing process as well as after during healing. My chest plate (declitae &amp; shoulder area) was healed in less than two weeks!!! A little goes a loooong way-really. This will be the only product I will use from now on for my tattooing.</li>
            <li> My tattoo artist has looked into many different after care products that are not petroleum based, but was not happy with the reviews &amp; results. Until she found this. Now it is all she uses, &amp; I love it! It is even great as a regular skin care moisturizer. It is not overly greasy, smells fantastic, &amp; my artwork heals super fast with the use of this. Plus, the best part of all.... It lessens the horrible itchy stage!</li>
            <li> top notch stuff.  raw shea benefits but without the dirty ashtray smell.  i get REALLY scaly when im healing a new tattoo and regular applications of hustle butter kept it to a minimum without making me greasy.  its a little on the pricy side compared to other shea products, but this is a nice formula and the lack of ash-funk makes it worth it to me.</li>
            <li> LOVED THIS product!  I was disappointed when I didn&#x27;t need to use it anymore.  Works fantastic and smells heavenly, plus its vegan and animal-lover friendly :-)</li>
            <li> I really only use lotion if I am either in an extremely cold, dry environment, or on my tattoos. I just got a big, solid black band around my wrist and the artist gave me a sample pack of this to try.. I am in love with it. She had me use it as the initial care product, instead of anything thick and goopy like A&amp;D or Aquaphor, and holy crap there&#x27;s a difference. I usually get a little puffy around tattoos, but this one hardly got swollen at all (despite being large and full saturation) and my skin feels so supple, rather than all delicate. It&#x27;s nice. Also, the stuff smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are:&lt;br /&gt;Shea Butter&lt;br /&gt;Mango Seed Butter&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Leaf Extract&lt;br /&gt;Fractionated Coconut Oil&lt;br /&gt;Sunflower Oil&lt;br /&gt;Rice Bran Oil&lt;br /&gt;Rosemary leaf extract&lt;br /&gt;Green tea extract&lt;br /&gt;Tocopherol Acetate&lt;br /&gt;Mint essential oil&lt;br /&gt;Essence of papaya&lt;br /&gt;Essence of coconut&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the packaging it claims to be all natural, cruelty free, and vegan. Anyway, I love it! It feels amazing, I love that it&#x27;s got so many ingredients I can identify as actual words, and it also smells heavenly, but none of the fragrances have irritated my tattoo in the slightest. This is definitely my new tattoo aftercare product of choice. Even if it&#x27;s a little pricey, so what? I pay good money for my tattoos - it makes sense to pay for the product that is (in my experience) the best available. I don&#x27;t like having to wonder about a product that I am rubbing into what is basically an open wound, and this one I feel completely comfortable with.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I have lots of tattoos and decided to try some new aftercare stuff. It smells amazing and goes on very smooth. It doesn&#x27;t sit on the surface as much as other products do and that makes it easier to go about your day without the worry that it will ruin clothing. I highly recommend trying this. No irritation and my tattoo doesn&#x27;t even look fresh.</li>
            <li> Makes new and old tattoos stand out especially at the beach or any sunny environment</li>
            <li> This stuff is THE BEST! I use it after every tattoo and am completely healed (with no scabs!) in one week. I never get a tattoo without it!</li>
            <li> Hustle Butter is decent. I used to to heal a piece on my knee cap and it seemed to work well but not any better than other non-scented lotions. The main problem is that it doesn&#x27;t really soak into your skin; it just sits on top. Prepare to feel greasy! It also rubs off fairly easily. However, the smell is absolutely amazing! Seriously if I could eat this stuff I would, it&#x27;s the best smelling lotion I&#x27;ve ever experienced! It&#x27;s also got all natural ingredients which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would recommend it but not over lubriderm or a similar un-scented lotion, as those tend to soak into your skin a little better.</li>
            <li> Hustle Butter is the best product on the market. I have been using it ritually for more than a year on every single tattoo I have done and the results are impeccable. Healing times have been cut in half just from using it in the process. Redness is greatly reduced when applying the tattoo properly and the all natural ingredients make for an enjoyable scent. I have tried other products on the market that were released over the past year or two and nothing holds a candle to Hustle Butter Deluxe.  I haven&#x27;t made the jump to selling it to my clients yet but I&#x27;ve been contemplating the single packs. I keep searching for a wholesale pricing for licensed shops but unable to find anything as of yet. With their combination of prime shipping and competitive pricing, Etailz is my number one choice for retailer of Hustle Butter.</li>
            <li> So I really wanted to like this a lot, and I do to some extent.  I used it nearly 100% for the first half of my tattoo.  It is really a butter so a little bit goes a long way.  It is similar (and mostly made of) coconut oil, which is a soft solid at room temperature and liquifies when heated by skin contact (or your hot car, so be careful when opening!).  I really think it reduced the swelling and helped my skin feel more comfortable within the first few days.  I had a a large solid area that extended into my elbow crease, so I got pretty big scabs.  I feel like the butter didn&#x27;t penetrate the scabs, but sat on top.  So I started doing 1 coat of Lubriderm after washing, waiting 30 minutes, and then adding Hustle Butter, which worked better on the scabbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward, and I ran out of Hustle Butter after my 2nd session and just used Lubriderm.  I don&#x27;t think the color is as bright or the edges as crisp.  However, my healing process seemed much faster with just the Lubriderm.  But think about any scab you ever had that turned into a scar - the more you baby it and the longer it takes to heal, the less of a scar you have.  So maybe slow healing is better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my artist used this on me throughout the tattoo and it was very soothing on my irritated skin.  When I have some of this I use it religiously in place of chap stick too!  Just a note - the 5 oz. tub is actually pretty huge - like Bath and Body Works butter tub size.  It makes sense why it is $20.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It smells great and moisturizes my ink.&lt;br /&gt;My tattoo artist introduced me to this stuff in 2013 &amp; it worked great. So when I was getting more ink done, I had to buy a jar of it. I like it because it&#x27;s not overly greasy like most aftercare products. A little goes a long way. So apply some to the skin, let it melt a little since it&#x27;s thick, then apply evenly. It was great during the tattoo session as well as after. Awesome that it&#x27;s all organic. I&#x27;ve recommended this to all my friends getting tattoos.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It has kept my new tattoos looking fresh!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells wonderful and a little goes a long way! Amazing for tattoos from start to finish. A great daily moisturizer as we&#x27;ll. It is much cheaper on Amazon than at the local tattoo shop.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something that would help me heal after I got my back done. This stuff works great. Helped with the itching and helped keep the peeling to a minimum. A little goes along way. Has a pleasant smell and it melts into your skin. Keeps your new tattoo hydrated. And it&#x27;s good for after shave care.</li>
            <li> been using this on new tattoos, old tattoos, and healing tattoos. it really absorbs nicley, no icky residue, all natural</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  The ingredients list is clean; the smell is delicious, but not overpowering; it goes on silky smooth and leaves my tattoos and the rest of my skin looking and feeling silky and vibrant.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks and go in to start color on my half sleeve tomorrow, so that will be the big test is the freshly post-ink experience.  I&#x27;ll update :)</li>
            <li> Good stuff, use it everyday as a skin hydrator</li>
            <li> Great stuff for your tattoo.  I use it before, during, and after getting tattooed. It also helps to keep the swelling down after getting work done. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My tattoo artist recommended this butter. He couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere and I had to tell him you can find anything on amazon ! And its here I got it way before the scheduled date. Got it in about a week. Love love the way it smells and its good for my other tattoos. Good ingredients!👍</li>
            <li> This is the second time i have ordered it!! works wonders! thank you</li>
            <li> Not sure why both tattoo artist I&#x27;ve been to recently hadn&#x27;t heard of this awesome product but I&#x27;m glad I found it!&lt;br /&gt;This tub is huge and is worth the money.  It smells amazing the papaya and coconut fragrance isn&#x27;t strong but it&#x27;s nice. A little goes a looong way because this goes from a solid to a silky butter consistency (this also makes it easy to spread thinly over your tattoo)  I use this product for roughly around a week on a fresh tattoo until it starts to peel then I switch to Curel Itch Defense lotion.&lt;br /&gt;The blacks in my 2 newest tattoos have healed super crisp and dark compared to my other tattoo I had used After Inked on.&lt;br /&gt;I also notice it helped the swelling go down and my skin felt soothed after applying it the first 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;I do have sensitive skin &amp; eczema and had no break outs from this product. I do wish they offered this product in maybe a tube form because I worry about it being sanitary so I just wash my hands well before scooping product out.&lt;br /&gt;You can find this product in tiny packets for smaller tattoos.</li>
            <li> Favorite aftercare lotion... and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of them.  Shipped super fast.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li> Hustle butter is good stuff.  Smells great, totally organic and far more appealing than slathering a client with a bunch of a&amp;d ointment.  It is expensive though, and in the grand scheme of things, i could buy about 8x the amount of a&amp;d for the same price.  I don&#x27;t mind paying for stuff that works well for my clients though.  My only knock on this stuff, is it seems to wipe the stencil off a lot quicker, than a&amp;d does.  Just my experience though, and i still like and recommend the stuff though.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for tattoos, but equally as great for tattoo-less skin. It smells so amazing. It&#x27;s hard to even explain how wonderful it smells. I wish I could dive into a huge vat of this stuff and just live there.</li>
            <li> Love Love love this product. I have 45hrs in my legs [ Tats} 35 hrs in my back, and working on my other leg.  My artist turned me on&lt;br /&gt;to this product and it works great on healing and I use it for everything. Its not oily, it goes al long way.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it to not only healing for tattoos but for all your skin area.</li>
            <li> I love using Hustle Butter on my tattoo, it makes it shine, brings out the colors &amp; makes the black look black and not gray.  Not to mention that it smells nice, and only a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You Can&#x27;t Knock The Hustle!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended Hustle Butter and it was the best recommendation for a product that I have had in a very long time.  Myself and my two daughters all got tattoos and used this product.  Very impressed and will not using anything else from this day forward.  Top Notch!!!!</li>
            <li> Took a min to get here because of the weather .my tattoo man told me about this n showed me and really liked it so I had to get it .also it smell good go on like butter.</li>
            <li> i have been getting tattooed for over 20 years and have experienced many tattoo after care products. i have several friends that own shops and one of my buddies turned me onto this stuff. well, unbeknownst to me, the last tattoo that i got, the artist used this as the mag/needle lube as he tattoed me. i noticed an immediate difference as soon as the work was done. no swelling, no redness, no stiffness, it was great. but i didnt have any of this that day so i used my old stand by Aquaphor ointment. it took me the normal 4 days or so to began to peel and worked fine. my biggest gripe with using Aquapor is that its sticky, and is a pain to use at night and for work. other than that it works great, for me anyhow. so, before my next session i ordered this stuff. let me tell you what, not only was it pleasant to use at night because i no longer had to wrap it to keep from sticking to my sheets, but the stuff smelled AMAZING! best yet, i began to peel in 3 days! again no swelling, redness or pain. i also used it in my third session with the same results and again peeled in 3 days. i am a fan for life and plan on using it for every single piece that i will ever get. trust me, you cant go wrong with this stuff. no scabbing, no stickiness, great smell, affordable...its the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one note of mention, when you take your first finger tip full, it will seem a bit stiff, but immediately upon contact with your skin, it turns, literally, into butter. a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love it, Love it, LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Hustle Butter last year after my tattoo artist came back from a convention.  Love it from the start.  My skin always healed good but hot Damn!!!!!! Did I heal Great after using hustle butter.  I bought a tub to bring home and use to heal with and use all the time.</li>
            <li> Works great for tattoo care and smells great!  Moisture lasts for hours and don&#x27;t need to use a lot at once.</li>
            <li> I got it and the seal was broken and looked like someone had touched it. Because my tattoo was dry I used it anyways. I carry it with me wherever, and if left in the heat it looses its goodness. I left mine in my car for maybe a couple of hours and it is all grainy now and not as soft as it used to be.</li>
            <li> I used it on my tattoos it&#x27;s work fast and after my tattoos was done it made it look new love it</li>
            <li> I bought this in advance of my new tattoo, but also found it works wonders on sunburns!!  After 2 days of this the sunburn is gone and no peeling!!!  Can&#x27;t wait to try it when I get the new tattoo.</li>
            <li> I think this the first product I&#x27;ve tried like this for a tattoo. I have several at this point and I figured I would take a leap and try this product on a fresh tattoo. So far I&#x27;ve noticed a lot less scab formation, softer skin around the tattoo, and the colors seem to hold up well with a several times a day application. Now the product itself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I thought with a name like &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; that this would be like a cream or gel. It&#x27;s not. it looks like some sort of white sand/coconut oil mixture. When it first goes on it feels a little sticky, but as it heats up and melts into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;2) The smell is great. Smells like tanning lotion.&lt;br /&gt;3)  It lasts for several hours, the skin gets soft once it soaks in, and while oily at first it becomes pretty soft and tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like this, I find it easier to put on than Tattoo Goo, and it seems to last a lot longer on the skin. Once I started using this it was a lot more effective at helping the healing process and doesn&#x27;t clog up pores or make a barrier like vaseline or aquaphor. I would recommend it. There&#x27;s probably cheaper options out there with similar ingredients, but I like this combination and it seems to do the job it sets out to. I may pick up a second tube in the future.</li>
            <li> I recently tried Hustle Butter for the first time. I am heavily tattooed and have always used the aquaphor method. I will say I have weird skin. I swell like crazy when I am tattooed, have sensitive skin, and reactions to many scented lotions etc. I had found that no matter how careful I was using the aquaphor method, I would scab to some extent during the healing process. I had a large half sleeve piece done recently and decided to give Hustle Butter a try. I liked that it was organic, smelled great, I could pronounce the ingredients, and it seemed like something my skin would not freak out about. Let me just say this stuff smells like heaven. It goes on a little thick at first but seems to &#x27;melt&#x27; once your body warms it up. Like butter! Be sure to gently blot off any excess after applying. I used it all the way through the peeling phase until I was fully healed. My tattoo healed like a dream! No color loss, crisp, and NO scabbing at all! I have over 15 tattoos and this was the best experience I have had with healing. I recommend this to anyone with funky skin or anyone that just wants a more pleasant healing process.</li>
            <li> Wish I had known of this stuff earlier in life. This is the best tattoo lubricant out there. I won&#x27;t use anything else from now on. Not only did it keep my tattoo moist, but it aided in the healing process as well. It&#x27;s also all natural which is a definite plus. I completely recommend this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I cannot possibly explain how much I love this product.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my tattoo with the healing process and kept it from drying out</li>
            <li> I did not love this stuff. I wanted too, but it made me break out in a weird itchy, red, bumpy rash all around my tattoo. It didn&#x27;t go away until I stopped using this. I&#x27;ll have to stick with the good &#x27;ol stand by Lubriderm.</li>
            <li> I love Hustlebutter.  I use it for my skin and hair. You only need to use a tiny bit, it goes a long way.  It&#x27;s the best stuff ever!</li>
            <li> Hustle butter is an amazing product to use all around but it is especially awesome on helping fresh ink (a tattoo for those that don&#x27;t know) heal.</li>
            <li> Smells like Angels took a s*** in a cannister amidst flowers and puppies and happy babies and such.  Best smelling stuff ever.  And super moisturizing.  Highly suggest.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. Felt like it healed a fresh tattoo about 1-2 days sooner than aquaphor. Plus it doesn&#x27;t feel as greasy and smells amazing. Addicted to it now for all the tattoos on my sleeves.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Scent is subtle but very nice. Absorbs quickly, not greasy. I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
