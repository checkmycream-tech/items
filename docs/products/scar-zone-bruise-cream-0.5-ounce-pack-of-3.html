            <li>My doctor gave me medicine that makes it easy for me to bruise, and it helps the bruises fade faster.</li>
            <li>Noting my tendancy to bruise rather easily, a massage therapist recommended this product.  </li>
            <li>In addition the gel feels cheap.</li>
            <li>Those bruises are much more purple than the ones where I applied cream right away twice a day.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This helps older people who bruise easily.  </li>

            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have already used up the first one and is working on second tube!</li>
            <li>This is the first product for bruises that I have found that actually works.</li>
            <li>Since the bruises have been so frequent and seemed to be getting darker and longer to go-away, I decided to try this.  </li>
            <li>(Unfortunately, I have a fair amount of experience with bruises.</li>
            <li>if you start using it from the day you bumped into whatever it was, the bruise is much slower to appear, is very mild &amp; completely gone in less than a week, as opposed to the usual for me of 2-3 weeks of ugaly horrid colored skin if I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>I bruise easily, and it usually takes a week to ten days to get rid of the bruises.</li>
            <li>My husband had open heart surgery two years ago and he began applying Scar Zone on the scar after about 6 months, and his scar is now barely visible.</li>

            <li> Bruises are much decreased in intensity and duration.</li>
            <li> Often there is a problem finding the vein and when that happens it creates an awful bruise.  </li>

            <li> Works great...if you start using it from the day you bumped into whatever it was, the bruise is much slower to appear, is very mild &amp; completely gone in less than a week, as opposed to the usual for me of 2-3 weeks of ugaly horrid colored skin if I don&#x27;t use it.  Even on the ones where you weren&#x27;t actually concious of runnin into anything and don&#x27;t know about it until you see the bruise, still usually clears it up with daily use in about a week-10 days max.  Good stuff and much cheaper here on Amazon than at the drugstore!</li>
            <li> This product has three tubes! I have already used up the first one and is working on second tube! My scar looks fade a little. But it is just half a month&#x27;s use. I look forward a fade away of these two spots on my leg.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking a blood thinner and bruise easily....sometimes not knowing where the bruise came from.&lt;br /&gt;This cream helps the bruising to disappear rapidly.</li>
            <li> This is the most effective bruise remedy I have ever used. The sooner I apply it afar injury, the better. Bruises are much decreased in intensity and duration. (Unfortunately, I have a fair amount of experience with bruises. I ride bikes and am not the world&#x27;s most graceful person.)</li>
            <li> I have many bruises do to medication I take. This has been an issue with medications I take.. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Got horrible large hematomas on arms from capillaries breaking - 4 weeks later still as dark. This stuff in four days has faded them by half.</li>
            <li> I like this in combination with another product I use it causes bruises on thinning or older skin to heal faster.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of bruises for a 41 year old due to my toddler kids.  Since the bruises have been so frequent and seemed to be getting darker and longer to go-away, I decided to try this.  I also added 1000mg of vitamin C as suggested by my doctor.  I believe that both are helping to reduce the size, color, and time it takes to heal my bruising.  I know this cream is a big factor since I have some bruises I did not &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; and thus no cream was applied.  Those bruises are much more purple than the ones where I applied cream right away twice a day.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This helps older people who bruise easily.  It works best if you use it as quick as you realize  you are going to bruise.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  My husband had open heart surgery two years ago and he began applying Scar Zone on the scar after about 6 months, and his scar is now barely visible.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  My doctor gave me medicine that makes it easy for me to bruise, and it helps the bruises fade faster.</li>
            <li> does exactly what it says.  dramatically decreases the amount of time you&#x27;ll have to live with a bad bruise.  i&#x27;ve used this stuff for over a year now and it has never failed me.</li>
            <li> She claims this is the only product of its kind which actually works. It&#x27;s a bit spendy to add a Minnesotan phrase</li>
            <li> I wish this product was available locally, but since it isn&#x27;t I really appreciate amazon&#x27;s being able to provide it so quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product that works on bruises on my aging hands. I use it both day and night to fade bruises.</li>
            <li> This is the first product for bruises that I have found that actually works. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I am having chemotherapy every 6 months for two years.  I do not have a &#x27;port&#x27; and the nurse needs to insert an IV line during the treatments, once a week for four weeks.  Often there is a problem finding the vein and when that happens it creates an awful bruise.  I found Scar Zone&#x27;s Bruise Cream and it is amazing how wonderfully it works.  Eliminates the bruise, the questions and the embarrassment.  Such a simple but great product....</li>
            <li> This is a good product if you use it right away.  If you bump yourself, put it on as soon as possible and the bruising will last a lot less time to go away.  I have shearing problems on my arms and use this twice daily.  It does take a couple of weeks to go away, but is more time without it.</li>
            <li> I use it frequently each day and see absolutely no progression in my bruises healing. Don&#x27;t waste your money. The one product I have used that works is Tri Derma Post Surgical Bruise Relief. You order by calling 800-279-7282.</li>
            <li> Noting my tendancy to bruise rather easily, a massage therapist recommended this product.  I&#x27;m glad for the guidance from him.</li>
            <li> As a skeptic...sometimes I don&#x27;t believe what the packaging or the marketing/advertising says. Believe me...this works. I would be reviewing this so positively if it didn&#x27;t. Good product, good price, it works!!!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised&lt;br /&gt;Causes bruises to fade faster&lt;br /&gt;Dislike that some of the cream can not be expelled from the tube, once it is low.&lt;br /&gt;I have told my friends about the product. I have been using this for several years.</li>
            <li> I do some gymnastics and pole dancing, so I experience bruises pretty often. I tried many products, such as arnica pills (useless), arnica gel (somewhat helpful), and this cream overall is the best. it really works and makes the bruise to disappear in 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> It is helping my mom with her bruises.  She indicates that it is working for her.</li>
            <li> I had an extensive surface bruise (from the tourniquet used during knee surgery).  My leg resembled something like a dinosaur&#x27;s from Jurassic Park -- deep purple and blue from my shorts line down to my socks.  I put this on and 3 days later there was barely noticeable evidence of the bruise.  None of the yellow, greenish remnants of typical bruises.  The bruise was mostly gone in 2 days, significantly less after the first day.</li>
            <li> I bruise easily, and it usually takes a week to ten days to get rid of the bruises. With the cream, it took a week to ten days, in other words: no difference. In addition the gel feels cheap. I don’t recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> 3 Pack is the best buy.  Works great for pressure sores.  Hard to find in drugs stores.  Get the 3 pack and save.</li>
