            <li>Both of these products go great together together</li>
            <li>This stuff is GREAT... until you take a shower.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt smell that great.</li>
            <li>Lotion works great</li>
            <li>I bought 2 bottles of this thinking it would be great after reading all the reviews, but after using it 1-2 times...</li>
            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to try the product with all the great reviews....</li>
            <li>works great.</li>
            <li>It works well, but the smell is not so great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not three shades darker like the bottle advertises, but I am happy with my results.</li>
            <li>Definitely happy with this product and will be using it again.</li>
            <li>I heard a lot of great things about this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>This is a really great lotion.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff.</li>
            <li>Works great, I&#x27;ve had this lotion before I bought it at my tanning salon for $50...</li>
            <li>This was a great price when compared to what the salon asks.  </li>
            <li>So inwas so happy when infound it</li>
            <li>It gives me great color.</li>
            <li>Love it though!!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more soon!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT TOO!!</li>
            <li>Obsidian (by designer skin) is my favorite!!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice lotion.</li>
            <li>and now i smell amazing!  </li>
            <li>Amazing lotion will see with one use!</li>
            <li>I loved this lotion and had great results.  </li>
            <li>The product worked well and had a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved it</li>
            <li>Bought this after someone told me about how good it was..</li>
            <li>I have always been considered fair skinned</li>
            <li>IMO the smell is good but reminds of men&#x27;s cologne...</li>
            <li>It feels good on too.</li>
            <li>Product is good but a pain to get out of the container.  </li>
            <li>Good, But Need To Know Expiration Date Before Shipping, Why Get A Deal On Something</li>
            <li>Although I do have fair skin this did not help to enhance the color I was going to get from the tanning bed at all.  </li>
            <li>The smell was good as of it was unisex cologne,</li>
            <li>so maybe it works on fair skin...</li>
            <li>I will probably always keep this lotion in my rotation, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t smell like fruit or flowers it still smells good.</li>
            <li>Good price.  </li>
            <li>(I have fair skin, so take that as you will.)&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product was recieved on time and in good condition though.</li>
            <li>Really good lotion.</li>
            <li>Did not work as good as it said it would.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, but it does NOT have good bronzing, though it does have the DHA and smell that goes along with that...</li>
            <li>she says that the product is exceptionally good.</li>
            <li>that being said, I am very pleased with the results of this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it works great.</li>
            <li>and I have a wonderful golden glow...</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and it is a great product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>Smell could be better; but does give me a great color.</li>
            <li>and I honestly haven&#x27;t found another that works even as good</li>
            <li>Since I hadn&#x27;t been to a \\&quot;tanning bed\\&quot; in years, I had no idea what kind of products were out now or what was good.</li>
            <li>but i still think it caters to men but who cares...if it gets me dark..i&#x27;ll just sqirt on some perfume :) NICE LOTION!</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>and i love this lotion!</li>
            <li>i love this product!</li>
            <li>Make sure you rub it in good or it will streak you! :)</li>
            <li>This product goes for like $60 at the tanning salon so the price on Amazon is pretty awesome!</li>
            <li>I also happen to love the scent!</li>
            <li>Thank god those doors are locked because I&#x27;m sure I looked rediculous, everytime!</li>
            <li>and again I just can&#x27;t believe how great my skin looks right now!!  </li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of a mens cologne it smells great because its not over whelming or to strong.</li>
            <li>The price was great and it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>the smell isnt as strong after you get out of the bed, and it gives you great color.</li>
            <li>, this lotion is amazing</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and did wonders for me</li>
            <li>The lotion is light colored so it will not stain your hands and has a fragrance that is great for guys not wanting to smell like a girl.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>I do think i am darker and this is a nice lotion.  </li>
            <li>so i bought the product because i&#x27;ve heard good things about it and its ok.</li>
            <li>gives You the nice brown tan.</li>
            <li>So good that I&#x27;m glad I already ordered this stuff from Amazon</li>
            <li>Did not have a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>but i liked it.  </li>
            <li>Of all the tanning lotions I&#x27;ve used over the years, this is the absolute best!</li>
            <li>It smells like some kind of mens cologne,</li>
            <li>Get something that smells nice..</li>
            <li>The texture was nice, Not Greasy</li>
            <li>I liked the color I got from using this lotion.</li>

            <li>Smell is very strong.</li>
            <li>the lotion is pretty good!</li>
            <li>Paramour has been the best smelling lotion I have ever used by far!</li>
            <li>Only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is the smell isn&#x27;t the greatest, but I use a great after tanning lotion that smells good, so its still worth it.</li>
            <li>but it is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>This is by far the best tanning lotion I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li>Love love love this!</li>
            <li>one of my new favorite brands i love the smell i dont mind smelling like this at all its awesome</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;you really will get a fantastic tan &amp; it is a wonderful price !!</li>
            <li>I KNEW THE PRICE WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth</li>
            <li>HOWEVER this seller is NOT selling the right kind!</li>
            <li>The smell is strong and florally, but honestly-</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion on a whim because of good reviews and I see why everyone loves it so much!!</li>
            <li>I used this lotion once and noticed a huge difference!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and will not be buying anything else from now on.</li>
            <li>and i love that.  </li>
            <li>so i love this lotion..</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>My favorite lotion is \\&quot;Black\\&quot; by Designer Skin</li>
            <li>I love this stuff...</li>
            <li>thats what I love most about tanning lotion...</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I want to get the most of my tans like anyone else</li>
            <li>Great price and very</li>
            <li>I would NOT recommend this if the smell of your lotion is important to you!</li>
            <li>smell great and provides very even color.</li>
            <li>i also LOVE the way it smells; kinda like guys cologne.</li>
            <li>but i would still recommend it. :)</li>
            <li>I also have tinea versicolor and most tanning lotions wont cover it up, but this one did:)</li>
            <li>Just make sure you wipe it off between your fingers and toes</li>
            <li>When I put the lotion on the smell wasn&#x27;t too noticeable, it has a sort of cologne smell as many of the reviews described.</li>
            <li>However, the smell after was more of a self-tanner type smell.(not exactly my favorite smell)</li>
            <li>Which I love.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the lotion too -</li>
            <li>Only great things to say about this!!!</li>
            <li>I dont let that bother me any more and just wash my hands.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure if i went every day i would see a difference</li>
            <li>my legs and stomach are okay though.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>most bronzers give people.</li>
            <li>it smells more like a perfume than a coconut/creamsicle smell.  </li>
            <li>White-2-Black is my all-time favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>If only it moisturized better, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>I love this tanning lotion</li>
            <li>The smell is definitely not the best smell i&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
            <li>Oh and one more thing, remember to wash your hands immediately when you get home.</li>
            <li>Because of all the bronzers in the lotion, in between my fingers turned orange so make sure that you wash it off asap.</li>
            <li>It has somewhat of a self tanner in it, so be sure to wash your hand after application.</li>
            <li>The scent reminded me of a cologne I had, definitely more manly( acqua di gio...ish) than fruity</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve been looking for better.</li>
            <li>I hope you all love this lotion and please let me know if you have found a better 1.</li>
            <li>I love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Ok lotion.</li>
            <li>The lotion was nice and smooth, not oily at all</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion.</li>
            <li>and I love to tan.</li>
            <li>Not 3 shades darker, just about 3 times more smelly.</li>
            <li>The lotion is okay</li>
            <li>Bottle was packaged appropriately and was in tact (no spills, cracks, leaks, etc.).  </li>
            <li>I was more than pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;much love from Flint MI</li>
            <li>HD man is much better.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews on this product.  </li>
            <li>I like it for the most part.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>Ive been tanning for almost 3 years now, mostly during the summer time</li>
            <li>I feel a like there should have been more product in there...</li>
            <li>really LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this lotion..</li>
            <li>I tan fairly okay,</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>Smells more like a cologne than perfume, but I prefer that.  </li>
            <li>and I usually LOVE there products</li>
            <li>I still love DC, just not this lotion, I&#x27;ll stick to my tingle/bronzers.</li>
            <li>I think it is interesting that so many people critique the smell.</li>
            <li>I happened to LOVE it, but then I love the smell of tanning lotion:)</li>
            <li>(Almost Famous by AG)</li>
            <li>Love to use this lotion when I tan.</li>
            <li>Much better lotions out there for a better price.</li>
            <li>this cheap!</li>
            <li>it can carry many bactrias..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really enjoyed this lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible just not to my liking.</li>
            <li>Now knowing this I would use this product again but I would be sure to make sure it was all evenly rubbed in.</li>
            <li>This product has a developer (which helps your tan develop better), moisturizer</li>
            <li>However the smell and packaging of this particular lotion caters more to men which is great if you&#x27;re a man.</li>
            <li>I just received this in the mail today and was very excited to go try it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very familiar with devoted creations lotions</li>
            <li>Bottom line: this product does a much better job than most at getting me the color that I want very quickly</li>
            <li>The lotion goes on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent to it.  </li>
            <li>This was one of the best purchases I have made in a long time.</li>
            <li>i like the product because the color is beautiful, but if you&#x27;re looking for a natural tan faster use an accelerator as well.</li>
            <li>Maybe not three shades, but pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>but the lotion is so worth it!!</li>
            <li>So very very very true.</li>
            <li>Wife had high hopes for this product, after hearing so many good things about it.  </li>
            <li>This is the best tanning lotion I have ever spent my money on.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>The scent was light and not over potent.</li>
            <li>I also love how silky smooth it is, and not greasy.</li>
            <li>the smell is great kinda masculine</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tan well in natural sun, but this gives a great tan.</li>
            <li>I will keep buying this product over and over it really work good for the price you pay.</li>
            <li>This product has a citrus smell that I am not fond of, however, I am ver fair skinned and got a really noticeable tan in just on trip to the salon.</li>
            <li>I really have loved the lotion.</li>
            <li>Great item and super fast</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product!</li>
            <li>Other than the &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; fragrance, it is the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>im pretty fair and dont tan very good, i have strawbeery blonde hair light eyes and freckel pretty easily and this stuff works!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tan that easily.</li>
            <li>I worked at a Tanning Salon, and we didn&#x27;t sell this brand, but it&#x27;s my absolute favorite tanning lotion, so I continue to order it from here because it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>But I tan easily.</li>
            <li>but it isnt strong and the smell goes away.</li>
            <li>it also doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent</li>
            <li>&quot; And she recommended this lotion, mainly because I already had a good tan and because I&#x27;m a guy.</li>
            <li>The smell of the lotion is kinda strong and like perfume.</li>
            <li>It is kinda strong but it just smells like a cologne.</li>
            <li>I realize some people like the manly cologne scent, but it is strong and I can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li>It also leaves a STRONG after tan odor on me.</li>
            <li>It is one of the best tanning lotions I have ever used, I have never been that dark in my life</li>
            <li>Just make sure you put a sticker on when using this product so you can actually see how good it works : )</li>
            <li>Hands down best bronzer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a shot, the price is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>The lotion is always very silky feeling when you put it on which I love!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and moisturizes</li>
            <li>This product goes on smoothly and it does not feel like you have lotion on after you finish tanning.</li>
            <li>it does smell nice and doesn&#x27;t streak on anything, it just didn&#x27;t give me as much color as i thought it would.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an instant &#x27;3 shades darker in 1 session&#x27; like it claims, but it is a great lotion.  </li>
            <li>I used this lotion last year and thought it was great.</li>
            <li>is extremely smooth.</li>
            <li>This reminded me of the cheap hawaiian tropic bronzers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this stuff not crazy about the smell</li>
            <li>really cheap, so I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li>I think my bottle was filled with somethkng else</li>
            <li>I personally think it smells great, however it does leave a \\&quot;tan smell\\&quot; afterwards...</li>
            <li>it makes your skins soft and smells good too.</li>
            <li>plus was that the product did have a great smell, wasn&#x27;t potent and chemically like some other</li>
            <li>Its not a bad smell- just strong.</li>
            <li>AMAZING great bronzer..works fast and lasts really long</li>
            <li>Liked it so much had to purchase the full size bottle.</li>
            <li>It is def worth giving it a try!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy a whole bottle!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>I have been tanning in a tanning bed getting ready to go to the Islands and this stuff really has turned me a nice lovely bronze</li>
            <li>Just the name of it got me excited.</li>
            <li>I have tried many tanning products, but this one by far top them all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will tan much faster now with this lotion than the cheap one I had</li>
            <li>It was a lemongrass-ish scent that made me feel clean after a session.</li>
            <li>but it does cost a bit more -- it gets me the nice, dark color without the smell or the slimy feeling afterwards :)</li>
            <li>although I&#x27;m not sure what kind, it&#x27;s a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>it is nothing special...</li>
            <li>This lotion might work good for those who don&#x27;t tan as dark as I do, but if you have the easy to tan but hits a plateau easily as well, this won&#x27;t be the lotion to take it to a darker level.</li>
            <li>Lol, no, not really.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read some of the reviews about the smell, if ure looking for a fruity smell this is NOT your kind of lotion it has more of a fresh minty whatever the opposite of fruity may be.</li>
            <li>Make sure you can spread the lotion very evenly and treat it like a self tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li>It claims on the bottle that it gets you 3 times tanner in one session which isn&#x27;t true in my case.  </li>
            <li>(Blonde and fair)</li>
            <li>I saw almost instant results with this product and loved it.</li>
            <li>then I wait to shower in the mornings so that the lotion has time to reach full effect and everything.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>I went ahead and purchased the full size bottle today at my salon.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion better then</li>
            <li>Overall, after one session the lotion gave me a good brown color.</li>
            <li>this is such good tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>its definitely all bronzer but a good quality one.</li>
            <li>Darker\\&quot; claim is true.  </li>
            <li>I am fair skin and tend to be red alot when tanning</li>
            <li>I personally thought it smelled good too.</li>
            <li>True.</li>
            <li>great lotion not much of a brozing as i like but still a good lotion that why i only gave it 4 stars</li>
            <li>It works so well, and its a true bronze/brown color -</li>
            <li>ok, i didn&#x27;t get super dark which is good</li>
            <li>I love this product, workable fast if your lookin for a quick tan.</li>
            <li>and I tan pretty easily.</li>
            <li>stuff smells great in the bottle, goes on so smooth and thin, very easy to apply and soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>I have also heard other great reviews on it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I LOVE white to black, it truly works great!!</li>
            <li>Quick shipment, cheaper than tanning salons.</li>
            <li>Trust that even if your a WHITE white girl- this tanning lotion is awesome and will get you darker that day.</li>
            <li>One of the best by far.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy this product again in the future.</li>
            <li>( I&#x27;m not trying to look super tan in the winter time</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a better lotion than this, with all the wonderful high end ingredients, especially at the low price.</li>
            <li>It is a great value compared to many much more expensive bronzers.</li>
            <li>I like it because it works so incredibly well   and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (I usually use hypoallergenic lotion.)</li>
            <li>I received the lotion in a timely manner and was very satisfied with the overall shipping process and product.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend this if you are looking for a dark tan, but be aware that it does not smell good!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lotion does go on pretty smooth, and it&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Also, shipped VERY fast!</li>
            <li>Very, very pretty skin tone.</li>
            <li>There was strong odor before, other than a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li>Live &amp; learn I guess  :)</li>
            <li>I found a more intense bronzer now but still have this bottle for when I need color fast!</li>
            <li>After using the product, I feel clean, the lotion isn&#x27;t heavy, and blends in very nice.</li>
            <li>but i strongly suggest this product to people who dont tan very fast and want fast results!</li>
            <li>Definitely not a waste of money! :)</li>
            <li>Other than that it is great , it does what it says and you notice the  first time.</li>
            <li>I reacentky akso bought the perfectly pink product and it smells great and really moisturizes your skin</li>
            <li>only thing i dislike about it is the smell kind of manly</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t smell that nice post tan, but it works well enough</li>
            <li>This leaves you smelling like fresh soap, opposed to a burnt coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It still smells fresh.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of my favorite lotions.</li>
            <li>but I did feel a lot more hot than normal while in the bed.</li>
            <li>though I do agree with many of the other reviews; It does cater more towards men.</li>
            <li>I am always super thorough whenever I am buying something online for the first time.</li>
            <li>I tried it for a good while before writing this review, to give it a fair chance, but it definitely made very little to no difference in my tanning experience.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t notice any difference in my tan that I got from any other good smelling lotion and it made me break out.</li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>remember not to wash it off right away</li>
            <li>After reading all reviews I decided to buy it anyways, the price is right.</li>
            <li>This stuff has given me such a beautiful glowing tan, but I&#x27;ve only used it once yesterday</li>
            <li>when I normally start tanning I can only go into the bed for about 2 mins at a time and its takes me months on end to get a good tan (I.E. I start in January to be tan for the beach in MAY.)</li>
            <li>Scent was masculine but the sweet kind - reminiscent of axe, clean smelling and no plastic-y burned aftersmell.  </li>
            <li>This lotion had a somewhat masculine smell, so I wasn&#x27;t sure at first.</li>
            <li>I only go tanning once a week and using this bronzer lotion actually gives me a nice, healthy, and natural-looking tan that lasts from week to week.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned about the authenticity, but this is the real thing!my tan is great</li>
            <li>It works good at tinting your skin, while you are wearing it but wears off as soon as you shower (no matter how long you wait), but does give you a slight orange tint, also smells kind of like men&#x27;s deodorant.</li>
            <li>($120.00) in tanning salon but white 2 black is almost better!!!</li>
            <li>Smell was different from others, but fresh, not horrible.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and with this lotion was able to achieve a dark, lasting tan.</li>
            <li>If i&#x27;m going to be 3 shades darker in the next 4hours because of the smelly lotion- than fine by me!</li>
            <li>Very much so.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product, it&#x27;s not really sweet, kind of a natural scent.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>We went to dinner that night and my tan looked amazing with my neon pink shirt.  </li>
            <li>The first use I went to a tanning bed for 5 minutes and changed 3 shades darker.</li>
            <li>So i just got out of the tanning bed after using this lotion for the first time.  </li>
            <li>i guess the 2 scents together really compliment eachother!  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think much of it at first...</li>
            <li>Only thing is that I wish it had a more beachy scent...</li>
            <li>i think i need to take a break because it would be too much!</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing tanning lotion from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>but it turned out to be my favorite lotion ive gotten recently.</li>
            <li>it gave me an amazing dark golden glow</li>
            <li>Just received this lotion a couple days ago and wanted to use it first before writing a review about it.  </li>
            <li>:) i would totally buy this lotion again</li>
            <li>I used this tanning lotion last summer and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Overall I was pleased with the product</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>My salon was selling the same lotion for much more.  </li>
            <li>Label says 1 to 3 shades darker after first use, well I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for 2 weeks</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion smells funny, also like burnt smoky smell after tanning.</li>
            <li>The only caution is that it has a self-tanner in it, so be sure to wash your hands immediately after tanning.</li>
            <li>First i noticed the smell, it smelled like lemon scented cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I actually think I would have been better off using no lotion at all.  </li>
            <li>Extremely fast shipping, received within 2 days!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>So, I just came from my first session with this lotion.</li>
            <li>and I love the shipping, it came a day later!!</li>
            <li>see a difference with first use.</li>
            <li>It smells odd, not over powering, but kind of something that I&#x27;d expect an older person to enjoy.</li>
            <li>Most likely my fault for not thoroughly rubbing it in.</li>
            <li>some as cheap as 15 bucks by far</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It smells more like a male cologne, but I do like it.</li>
            <li>It did leave me a with a bit of an orange cast on the first day.</li>
            <li>I did in fact get 3 shades darker after the first use.</li>
            <li>I work at a tanning salon and have used some of the most expensive lotions and this is by far the best one I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>But other than that AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I notice a big, long lasting difference in just one tanning session caompared to others and the smell is great!!!</li>
            <li>The lotion is a great moisturizer and helps create a deep, rich, natural looking tan, with absolutely no yellowing effects or blotchy discoloration.</li>
            <li>Yes it wears off like all bronzers do as your stained skin sheds, but a quick rubdown in the shower with baking soda will get it all off so that you can start with a new application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a very unisex smell that smells more like a light cologne after tanning than the typical fruity smell.</li>
            <li>So overall a nice product..just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;update:  Wow..</li>
            <li>Many people have complained about it, but I actually really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s great for men becuase who wants to walk around with a big pink bottle of tanning lotion</li>
            <li>&quot; Yeah, they pretty much nailed it.</li>
            <li>I needed something that would give me some color fast, and this really did the job!</li>
            <li>I have such a hard time tanning, with very very fair skin I noticed after my first tan</li>
            <li>it took almost two full weeks to arrive, but since I did qualify for free shipping, I probably should have expected that.</li>
            <li>The seller sold a genuine product (I bought a sample from my salon and it was EXACTLY the same smell, texture, result, etc as well as compared the bottles).  </li>
            <li>Like I said, very pretty natural brown tan.</li>
            <li>I like the lotion white 2 black for the most part just have to make sure it&#x27;s rubbed in cause</li>
            <li>I still have a lot left and am no longer using it, I bought a different one that is worlds better that I will also be reviewing!</li>
            <li>and it really does help reduce those fine lines around your eyes and the dreaded 11&#x27;s) and a bronzer to give your skin instant color.</li>
            <li>Seller was fast though..</li>
            <li>, it works FAST</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t really see myself 3 shades darker as this product adbvertises..</li>
            <li>Very even too...</li>
            <li>and i really dislike it</li>
            <li>i really noticed the difference about an hour after</li>
            <li>It really did make me a lot darker.</li>
            <li>and it really does rev up your tan.</li>
            <li>Unfortunatly, I am allergic to the lotion but worked very well before hand.  </li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re looking for color fast this product should work for you.</li>
            <li>Really upset about this.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>On Amazon, it&#x27;s at a much lower price point than you&#x27;ll find in tanning salons.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already really tan, but this makes me even darker.</li>
            <li>The shipping was really fast</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>&quot; but I did get tan really fast, within a couple sessions.</li>
            <li>I can tell that it has helped me tan much faster than if I used a non bronzing lotion and the feel of it on my skin</li>
            <li>But its not about the smell, its about the tan it gives you (in my opinion anyway..) I did come out very tan</li>
            <li>And the pump you squeeze the lotion through is very difficut to get the lotion through.  </li>
            <li>problem is, I do t think I got the real product.</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.</li>
            <li>I have used this lotion for 2 years and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Am I really three shades darker?</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first about this claim, but figured if I only got 1-2 shades darker after first use I would be very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think it darkens as fast as advertised.</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle but will move on.</li>
            <li>I am a huge perfume girl and have at least 50 bottles of different ones and this lotion smelt good to me.</li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>When I was tanning for a wedding i was in, i was using another product that works really well.  </li>
            <li>I came out and didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>I really did look a lot tanner after I used it.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Could not tell too much of a difference after 1-3 uses.</li>
            <li>It really seems to moisturize my skin and it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy or sticky.  </li>
            <li>but this one...not so much.</li>
            <li>This gets tricky when you have slippery lotion hands, and just isn&#x27;t very user friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i can say the product works very well.</li>
            <li>Whatever is in this lotion, is not the real thing.</li>
            <li>The only thing that kind of set it back for 5 stars is that it will die your hands orange if you dont wash the excess lotion off your hands before you head into the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this lotion before and this lotion is not the same lotion I&#x27;ve used before In my own personal opinion</li>
            <li>wow!!!</li>
            <li>After my first time using it I&#x27;ve become noticably darker, and not in a fake- orangy kind of way that a lot of cheap lotions have done.</li>
            <li>It is more of a unisex smell than some of the other fruity or bubble gum smelling lotions.  </li>
            <li>There are other better ones out there.  </li>
            <li>I got a sample of this for buying a different lotion &amp; was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and I wont buy any other tanning lotion</li>
            <li>I tan a lot, so i am really picky about my lotions, and when i used this one, I really didnt see a difference even going in a high pressure bed.</li>
            <li>The only draw back that I have found is that you want to make sure to get it very even on your skin and wipe between fingers after application so that you have an even tan.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it enhances the tanning bed experience, but it does provide a nice self tanner.  </li>
            <li>I have used this in the past and liked it.  </li>
            <li>I bought it hoping to get super dark relatively quick.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t exactly pleased with how the lotion came out, its kind of an awkward shaped bottle.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t affect the use of the product, however since the part that broke is just the outer covering for the top (the black part)</li>
            <li>I have used it all and tried another brand but will be purchasing this particular brand again soon.</li>
            <li>I used it last year and it helps to tan quickly.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m sure ill keep using it. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I took one star away because this is the third bottle I have purchased (only one from Amazon) and the top on every one of them broke within a couple of months.</li>
            <li>I have no doubt this is a decent lotion.</li>
            <li>I think this is a decent lotion.</li>
            <li>After my first or second time I was trying to see if I noticed a difference since I thought I looked darker at first.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a good base tan first.</li>
            <li>I have been very satisfied with White 2 Black tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>i highly recomend buying both of these products together.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it over any tanning lotion you would buy at Walmart or Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The smell really isn&#x27;t my favorite, but have also smelled worse, but I mean I use it to tan to get darker, not to smell good, so it&#x27;s totally worth it,..</li>
            <li>After one use I still have to say that my WHITE 2 BLACK works so much better!</li>
            <li>Also, at first I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference of my tan but after a few hours there was a difference.  </li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t tell how old it really is.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different lotions that turn you different shades of orange but never anything that made me look so naturally tanned.</li>
            <li>, I definitely noticed I was much darker after the first use.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to wash your hands after you tan, or the bronzer gets gunked up in between your fingers and gives you extra color in a strange place.</li>
            <li>so I ordered a few more bottles.</li>
            <li>in which i normally shower after tanning anyway.</li>
            <li>I got amazing color from WHITE 2 Black.</li>
            <li>you notice it after the first time, but after continuously using it, it gets you super dark.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She said it would do the trick and bump me right back to where I was in the summer.</li>
            <li>I tried it yesterday and saw instant results right after I got out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>(I am an easy tanner that gets really dark and seldom burns)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who likes tanning in a bed, it smells better than any of the others I&#x27;ve used (no sickly sweet tropical smell!)</li>
            <li>I would definitely suggest this if you need a deep tan fast for a vacation, wedding or any special event.</li>
            <li>The smell is fine, it does darken you but it doesn&#x27;t last unless used daily.  </li>
            <li>i wanted to try a new tanning lotion for my clients</li>
            <li>I probably will use up this lotion for my night tanning session, but try something new when it&#x27;s finished.</li>
            <li>I was nervous cuz it was new to me and so inexpensive on here</li>
            <li>and now my body is super dry.  </li>
            <li>It also does a nice job making me subtly darker without being too drastic or unnatural looking.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a lotion that gives me a fast, long lasting color specially now in the winter</li>
            <li>I am going back to a better smelling lotion, this was bad and it didn&#x27;t even make my skin feel good.</li>
            <li>I used a sticker on my wrist to see the difference before and after and wowww, definitely worked better than any other lotion i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;ve tried several of these types of indoor tanning lotions</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always skeptical when reading 5 star reviews on low cost lotions like this, but this stuff really worked for me great</li>
            <li>It is the same tanning lotion they sell in a salon at a MUCH cheaper price!</li>
            <li>I never take time and apply exactly even everywhere as the beds only allow 5 min before kicking on</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I decided to buy a sample and it lasted about a week... and let me just say WOW!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s probably about the same at other salons.</li>
            <li>I have since keep going and eachtime There is nice subtle change so my tan continues to look natural.</li>
            <li>so you want to wash your hands right after use and really watch where you put the lotion on its just like fake tan :)</li>
            <li>know a lot of people complained about the smell of this product on here, but personally I think its very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been going to the tanning salon religiously everyday for the full time allowed in the bed and hadn&#x27;t noticed much until this product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really get as dark as I expected ..and to top it off</li>
            <li>I was not as dark as I expected, but it gives you a nice natural brown color.</li>
            <li>I love the Black to White tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very quick and I received my purchase earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li>I love the black and white packaging and the smell.</li>
            <li>But I could see a huge difference in color in just a few tanning sessions.</li>
            <li>I am a professional spray tanner.</li>
            <li>the bronzer will fade quite a bit, but in a really natural way..</li>
            <li>HOWEVER after 2weeks of frequently using this lotion it began to streek</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive</li>
            <li>an acceleration increases the body&#x27;s natural melanin (the chemicals in body that make you tan) were as a bronzer is a die.</li>
            <li>I seen immediate results and have a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>As for the smell it didn&#x27;t bother me that much, maybe it is different depending on your skin&#x27;s chemistry.</li>
            <li>I noticed the cap on my bottle didn&#x27;t feel very snug, but this was not an issue as the cap was not even necessary.  </li>
            <li>But the lotion went on smoothy and make my skin feel really soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, I didn&#x27;t have the old \\&quot;tanning bed</li>
            <li>The smell is very manly, but that&#x27;s no big problem</li>
            <li>but this turns my tan into a natural brown/bronze.</li>
            <li>Natural brown color.</li>
            <li>It was strange how much darker I got after a couple hours!</li>
            <li>and WOW you can def.</li>
            <li>One thing i really like about this lotion is that is DOES NOT leave my palms all orangy and it leaves a really pretty long lasting color.</li>
            <li>so your skin stays incredibily soft (some call it liquid botox</li>
            <li>Skin felt good after using, not dried out, or suffocating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used half so far and already have a good dark tan</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super dark now.</li>
            <li>This lotion got me super dark and you can tell a difference after one or two tans.  </li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;m blonde haired and blue eyed.</li>
            <li>Makes you so dark, doesn&#x27;t really make u 3 shades darker after one session, but use it for about a week to two weeks straight</li>
            <li>i would recommend it, as long as you are coming right back home to shower.</li>
            <li>I have spent so much $ trying and just haven&#x27;t yet!</li>
            <li>I think for now I&#x27;ll stick with the good-smelling, cheaper lotions, and save the White to Black for \\&quot;special occasion\\&quot; tanning when I need to look super dark.</li>
            <li>The packaging may not be super girly like a lot of other products for tanning, but that&#x27;s no big deal at all.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>/&gt;White 2 Black has a fresh scent that is unisex.</li>
            <li>WHITE 2 BLACK actually does get you shades darker, and you&#x27;ll notice it more with a more expensive tanning bed.</li>
            <li>Made me tan really fast and usually i cant really tan even in a bed.</li>
            <li>if tha bronzers was surprised by that cause its a white lotiom</li>
            <li>and I have a pretty good base tan.</li>
            <li>i was a little hesitant to try this after i got it, it was super thick and smelled more like mens cologne than i had expected.</li>
            <li>It also wasn&#x27;t greasy and left skin feeling soft and not dry.</li>
            <li>Btw, the shipping was extremely fast, it came like 4 days before it was expected!</li>
            <li>It smells very beachy and doesnt leave your skin smelling burnt like other lotions.</li>
            <li>experience was NOT what I expected based on reviews and the general high quality of DC products.</li>
            <li>The scent is definately manly, but does fade an hour or so afterwards, and honestly I&#x27;m never a fan of tanning lotion scents no matter how hard they try to make them good.  </li>
            <li>I was looking to get dark fast</li>
            <li>I got really dark really fast.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a 3 shade difference the first time i used it, but after a few days i was a lot darker than before.</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars instead of one because it does get you super dark almost instantly, and the smell isn&#x27;t bad, but I don&#x27;t like how the &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; washes almost completely off, and I&#x27;m not so sure it provides much benefit compared to other bronzers when tanning.</li>
            <li>But the bottle is only 8.5 ounces when many of the other lotions are at least 10 ounces, and several are 13.5 ounces-</li>
            <li>It worked quickly, and evenly on my stomach, arms, and back but the bad things outweigh the fact that it works fast in certain areas.</li>

            <li> This stuff is GREAT... until you take a shower.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt smell that great.</li>
            <li> Lotion works great</li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottles of this thinking it would be great after reading all the reviews, but after using it 1-2 times...</li>
            <li> LOL.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try the product with all the great reviews....</li>
            <li> works great.</li>
            <li> It works well, but the smell is not so great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not three shades darker like the bottle advertises, but I am happy with my results.</li>
            <li> Definitely happy with this product and will be using it again.</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of great things about this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a really great lotion.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.</li>
            <li> Works great, I&#x27;ve had this lotion before I bought it at my tanning salon for $50...</li>
            <li> This was a great price when compared to what the salon asks.  </li>
            <li> So inwas so happy when infound it</li>
            <li> It gives me great color.</li>
            <li> Love it though!!</li>
            <li> I will be buying more soon!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT TOO!!</li>
            <li> Obsidian (by designer skin) is my favorite!!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice lotion.</li>
            <li> and now i smell amazing!  </li>
            <li> Amazing lotion will see with one use!</li>
            <li> I loved this lotion and had great results.  </li>
            <li> The product worked well and had a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it</li>
            <li> Bought this after someone told me about how good it was..</li>
            <li> I have always been considered fair skinned</li>
            <li> IMO the smell is good but reminds of men&#x27;s cologne...</li>
            <li> It feels good on too.</li>
            <li> Product is good but a pain to get out of the container.  </li>
            <li> Good, But Need To Know Expiration Date Before Shipping, Why Get A Deal On Something</li>
            <li> Although I do have fair skin this did not help to enhance the color I was going to get from the tanning bed at all.  </li>
            <li> The smell was good as of it was unisex cologne,</li>
            <li> so maybe it works on fair skin...</li>
            <li> I will probably always keep this lotion in my rotation, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t smell like fruit or flowers it still smells good.</li>
            <li> Good price.  </li>
            <li> (I have fair skin, so take that as you will.)&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product was recieved on time and in good condition though.</li>
            <li> Really good lotion.</li>
            <li> Did not work as good as it said it would.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but it does NOT have good bronzing, though it does have the DHA and smell that goes along with that...</li>
            <li> she says that the product is exceptionally good.</li>
            <li> that being said, I am very pleased with the results of this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it works great.</li>
            <li> and I have a wonderful golden glow...</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and it is a great product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Smell could be better; but does give me a great color.</li>
            <li> and I honestly haven&#x27;t found another that works even as good</li>
            <li> Since I hadn&#x27;t been to a \\&quot;tanning bed\\&quot; in years, I had no idea what kind of products were out now or what was good.</li>
            <li> but i still think it caters to men but who cares...if it gets me dark..i&#x27;ll just sqirt on some perfume :) NICE LOTION!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> and i love this lotion!</li>
            <li> i love this product!</li>
            <li> Make sure you rub it in good or it will streak you! :)</li>
            <li> This product goes for like $60 at the tanning salon so the price on Amazon is pretty awesome!</li>
            <li> I also happen to love the scent!</li>
            <li> Thank god those doors are locked because I&#x27;m sure I looked rediculous, everytime!</li>
            <li> and again I just can&#x27;t believe how great my skin looks right now!!  </li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of a mens cologne it smells great because its not over whelming or to strong.</li>
            <li> The price was great and it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> the smell isnt as strong after you get out of the bed, and it gives you great color.</li>
            <li> , this lotion is amazing</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and did wonders for me</li>
            <li> The lotion is light colored so it will not stain your hands and has a fragrance that is great for guys not wanting to smell like a girl.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> I do think i am darker and this is a nice lotion.  </li>
            <li> so i bought the product because i&#x27;ve heard good things about it and its ok.</li>
            <li> gives You the nice brown tan.</li>
            <li> So good that I&#x27;m glad I already ordered this stuff from Amazon</li>

            <li> I KNEW THE PRICE WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth</li>
            <li> HOWEVER this seller is NOT selling the right kind!</li>
            <li> The smell is strong and florally, but honestly-</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion on a whim because of good reviews and I see why everyone loves it so much!!</li>

            <li> okay.  </li>

            <li> I love this stuff...</li>

            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I want to get the most of my tans like anyone else</li>
            <li> Great price and very</li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend this if the smell of your lotion is important to you!</li>
            <li> smell great and provides very even color.</li>
            <li> i also LOVE the way it smells; kinda like guys cologne.</li>
            <li> but i would still recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> I also have tinea versicolor and most tanning lotions wont cover it up, but this one did:)</li>
            <li> Just make sure you wipe it off between your fingers and toes</li>
            <li> When I put the lotion on the smell wasn&#x27;t too noticeable, it has a sort of cologne smell as many of the reviews described.</li>
            <li> However, the smell after was more of a self-tanner type smell.(not exactly my favorite smell)</li>
            <li> Which I love.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the lotion too -</li>
            <li> Only great things to say about this!!!</li>
            <li> I dont let that bother me any more and just wash my hands.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure if i went every day i would see a difference</li>
            <li> my legs and stomach are okay though.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> most bronzers give people.</li>
            <li> it smells more like a perfume than a coconut/creamsicle smell.  </li>
            <li> White-2-Black is my all-time favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> If only it moisturized better, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion</li>
            <li> The smell is definitely not the best smell i&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
            <li> Oh and one more thing, remember to wash your hands immediately when you get home.</li>
            <li> Because of all the bronzers in the lotion, in between my fingers turned orange so make sure that you wash it off asap.</li>
            <li> It has somewhat of a self tanner in it, so be sure to wash your hand after application.</li>
            <li> The scent reminded me of a cologne I had, definitely more manly( acqua di gio...ish) than fruity</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve been looking for better.</li>
            <li> I hope you all love this lotion and please let me know if you have found a better 1.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Ok lotion.</li>
            <li> The lotion was nice and smooth, not oily at all</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion.</li>
            <li> and I love to tan.</li>
            <li> Not 3 shades darker, just about 3 times more smelly.</li>
            <li> The lotion is okay</li>
            <li> Bottle was packaged appropriately and was in tact (no spills, cracks, leaks, etc.).  </li>
            <li> I was more than pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;much love from Flint MI</li>
            <li> HD man is much better.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews on this product.  </li>
            <li> I like it for the most part.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Ive been tanning for almost 3 years now, mostly during the summer time</li>
            <li> I feel a like there should have been more product in there...</li>
            <li> really LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this lotion..</li>
            <li> I tan fairly okay,</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> Smells more like a cologne than perfume, but I prefer that.  </li>
            <li> and I usually LOVE there products</li>
            <li> I still love DC, just not this lotion, I&#x27;ll stick to my tingle/bronzers.</li>
            <li> I think it is interesting that so many people critique the smell.</li>
            <li> I happened to LOVE it, but then I love the smell of tanning lotion:)</li>
            <li> (Almost Famous by AG)</li>
            <li> Love to use this lotion when I tan.</li>
            <li> Much better lotions out there for a better price.</li>
            <li> this cheap!</li>
            <li> it can carry many bactrias..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I really enjoyed this lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible just not to my liking.</li>
            <li> Now knowing this I would use this product again but I would be sure to make sure it was all evenly rubbed in.</li>
            <li> This product has a developer (which helps your tan develop better), moisturizer</li>
            <li> However the smell and packaging of this particular lotion caters more to men which is great if you&#x27;re a man.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail today and was very excited to go try it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very familiar with devoted creations lotions</li>
            <li> Bottom line: this product does a much better job than most at getting me the color that I want very quickly</li>
            <li> The lotion goes on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent to it.  </li>
            <li> This was one of the best purchases I have made in a long time.</li>
            <li> i like the product because the color is beautiful, but if you&#x27;re looking for a natural tan faster use an accelerator as well.</li>
            <li> Maybe not three shades, but pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> but the lotion is so worth it!!</li>
            <li> So very very very true.</li>
            <li> Wife had high hopes for this product, after hearing so many good things about it.  </li>
            <li> This is the best tanning lotion I have ever spent my money on.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> The scent was light and not over potent.</li>
            <li> I also love how silky smooth it is, and not greasy.</li>
            <li> the smell is great kinda masculine</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan well in natural sun, but this gives a great tan.</li>
            <li> I will keep buying this product over and over it really work good for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> This product has a citrus smell that I am not fond of, however, I am ver fair skinned and got a really noticeable tan in just on trip to the salon.</li>
            <li> I really have loved the lotion.</li>
            <li> Great item and super fast</li>
            <li> Other than that, great product!</li>
            <li> Other than the &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; fragrance, it is the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> im pretty fair and dont tan very good, i have strawbeery blonde hair light eyes and freckel pretty easily and this stuff works!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan that easily.</li>
            <li> I worked at a Tanning Salon, and we didn&#x27;t sell this brand, but it&#x27;s my absolute favorite tanning lotion, so I continue to order it from here because it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> But I tan easily.</li>
            <li> but it isnt strong and the smell goes away.</li>
            <li> it also doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent</li>
            <li> &quot; And she recommended this lotion, mainly because I already had a good tan and because I&#x27;m a guy.</li>
            <li> The smell of the lotion is kinda strong and like perfume.</li>
            <li> It is kinda strong but it just smells like a cologne.</li>
            <li> I realize some people like the manly cologne scent, but it is strong and I can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> It also leaves a STRONG after tan odor on me.</li>
            <li> It is one of the best tanning lotions I have ever used, I have never been that dark in my life</li>
            <li> Just make sure you put a sticker on when using this product so you can actually see how good it works : )</li>
            <li> Hands down best bronzer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a shot, the price is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> The lotion is always very silky feeling when you put it on which I love!</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and moisturizes</li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly and it does not feel like you have lotion on after you finish tanning.</li>
            <li> it does smell nice and doesn&#x27;t streak on anything, it just didn&#x27;t give me as much color as i thought it would.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an instant &#x27;3 shades darker in 1 session&#x27; like it claims, but it is a great lotion.  </li>
            <li> I used this lotion last year and thought it was great.</li>
            <li> is extremely smooth.</li>
            <li> This reminded me of the cheap hawaiian tropic bronzers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this stuff not crazy about the smell</li>
            <li> really cheap, so I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I think my bottle was filled with somethkng else</li>
            <li> I personally think it smells great, however it does leave a \\&quot;tan smell\\&quot; afterwards...</li>
            <li> it makes your skins soft and smells good too.</li>
            <li> plus was that the product did have a great smell, wasn&#x27;t potent and chemically like some other</li>
            <li> Its not a bad smell- just strong.</li>
            <li> AMAZING great bronzer..works fast and lasts really long</li>
            <li> Liked it so much had to purchase the full size bottle.</li>
            <li> It is def worth giving it a try!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy a whole bottle!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I have been tanning in a tanning bed getting ready to go to the Islands and this stuff really has turned me a nice lovely bronze</li>
            <li> Just the name of it got me excited.</li>
            <li> I have tried many tanning products, but this one by far top them all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will tan much faster now with this lotion than the cheap one I had</li>
            <li> It was a lemongrass-ish scent that made me feel clean after a session.</li>
            <li> but it does cost a bit more -- it gets me the nice, dark color without the smell or the slimy feeling afterwards :)</li>
            <li> although I&#x27;m not sure what kind, it&#x27;s a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> it is nothing special...</li>
            <li> This lotion might work good for those who don&#x27;t tan as dark as I do, but if you have the easy to tan but hits a plateau easily as well, this won&#x27;t be the lotion to take it to a darker level.</li>
            <li> Lol, no, not really.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some of the reviews about the smell, if ure looking for a fruity smell this is NOT your kind of lotion it has more of a fresh minty whatever the opposite of fruity may be.</li>
            <li> Make sure you can spread the lotion very evenly and treat it like a self tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li> It claims on the bottle that it gets you 3 times tanner in one session which isn&#x27;t true in my case.  </li>
            <li> (Blonde and fair)</li>
            <li> I saw almost instant results with this product and loved it.</li>
            <li> then I wait to shower in the mornings so that the lotion has time to reach full effect and everything.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I went ahead and purchased the full size bottle today at my salon.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion better then</li>
            <li> Overall, after one session the lotion gave me a good brown color.</li>
            <li> this is such good tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> its definitely all bronzer but a good quality one.</li>
            <li> Darker\\&quot; claim is true.  </li>
            <li> I am fair skin and tend to be red alot when tanning</li>
            <li> I personally thought it smelled good too.</li>
            <li> True.</li>
            <li> great lotion not much of a brozing as i like but still a good lotion that why i only gave it 4 stars</li>
            <li> It works so well, and its a true bronze/brown color -</li>
            <li> ok, i didn&#x27;t get super dark which is good</li>
            <li> I love this product, workable fast if your lookin for a quick tan.</li>
            <li> and I tan pretty easily.</li>
            <li> stuff smells great in the bottle, goes on so smooth and thin, very easy to apply and soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li> I have also heard other great reviews on it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I LOVE white to black, it truly works great!!</li>
            <li> Quick shipment, cheaper than tanning salons.</li>
            <li> Trust that even if your a WHITE white girl- this tanning lotion is awesome and will get you darker that day.</li>
            <li> One of the best by far.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> ( I&#x27;m not trying to look super tan in the winter time</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a better lotion than this, with all the wonderful high end ingredients, especially at the low price.</li>
            <li> It is a great value compared to many much more expensive bronzers.</li>
            <li> I like it because it works so incredibly well   and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (I usually use hypoallergenic lotion.)</li>
            <li> I received the lotion in a timely manner and was very satisfied with the overall shipping process and product.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend this if you are looking for a dark tan, but be aware that it does not smell good!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lotion does go on pretty smooth, and it&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Also, shipped VERY fast!</li>
            <li> Very, very pretty skin tone.</li>
            <li> There was strong odor before, other than a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> Live &amp; learn I guess  :)</li>
            <li> I found a more intense bronzer now but still have this bottle for when I need color fast!</li>
            <li> After using the product, I feel clean, the lotion isn&#x27;t heavy, and blends in very nice.</li>
            <li> but i strongly suggest this product to people who dont tan very fast and want fast results!</li>
            <li> Definitely not a waste of money! :)</li>
            <li> Other than that it is great , it does what it says and you notice the  first time.</li>
            <li> I reacentky akso bought the perfectly pink product and it smells great and really moisturizes your skin</li>
            <li> only thing i dislike about it is the smell kind of manly</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell that nice post tan, but it works well enough</li>
            <li> This leaves you smelling like fresh soap, opposed to a burnt coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It still smells fresh.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite lotions.</li>
            <li> but I did feel a lot more hot than normal while in the bed.</li>
            <li> though I do agree with many of the other reviews; It does cater more towards men.</li>
            <li> I am always super thorough whenever I am buying something online for the first time.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a good while before writing this review, to give it a fair chance, but it definitely made very little to no difference in my tanning experience.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t notice any difference in my tan that I got from any other good smelling lotion and it made me break out.</li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> remember not to wash it off right away</li>
            <li> After reading all reviews I decided to buy it anyways, the price is right.</li>
            <li> This stuff has given me such a beautiful glowing tan, but I&#x27;ve only used it once yesterday</li>
            <li> when I normally start tanning I can only go into the bed for about 2 mins at a time and its takes me months on end to get a good tan (I.E. I start in January to be tan for the beach in MAY.)</li>
            <li> Scent was masculine but the sweet kind - reminiscent of axe, clean smelling and no plastic-y burned aftersmell.  </li>
            <li> This lotion had a somewhat masculine smell, so I wasn&#x27;t sure at first.</li>
            <li> I only go tanning once a week and using this bronzer lotion actually gives me a nice, healthy, and natural-looking tan that lasts from week to week.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about the authenticity, but this is the real thing!my tan is great</li>
            <li> It works good at tinting your skin, while you are wearing it but wears off as soon as you shower (no matter how long you wait), but does give you a slight orange tint, also smells kind of like men&#x27;s deodorant.</li>
            <li> ($120.00) in tanning salon but white 2 black is almost better!!!</li>
            <li> Smell was different from others, but fresh, not horrible.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and with this lotion was able to achieve a dark, lasting tan.</li>
            <li> If i&#x27;m going to be 3 shades darker in the next 4hours because of the smelly lotion- than fine by me!</li>
            <li> Very much so.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product, it&#x27;s not really sweet, kind of a natural scent.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> We went to dinner that night and my tan looked amazing with my neon pink shirt.  </li>
            <li> The first use I went to a tanning bed for 5 minutes and changed 3 shades darker.</li>
            <li> So i just got out of the tanning bed after using this lotion for the first time.  </li>
            <li> i guess the 2 scents together really compliment eachother!  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think much of it at first...</li>
            <li> Only thing is that I wish it had a more beachy scent...</li>
            <li> i think i need to take a break because it would be too much!</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing tanning lotion from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> but it turned out to be my favorite lotion ive gotten recently.</li>
            <li> it gave me an amazing dark golden glow</li>
            <li> Just received this lotion a couple days ago and wanted to use it first before writing a review about it.  </li>
            <li> :) i would totally buy this lotion again</li>
            <li> I used this tanning lotion last summer and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Overall I was pleased with the product</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> My salon was selling the same lotion for much more.  </li>
            <li> Label says 1 to 3 shades darker after first use, well I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion smells funny, also like burnt smoky smell after tanning.</li>
            <li> The only caution is that it has a self-tanner in it, so be sure to wash your hands immediately after tanning.</li>
            <li> First i noticed the smell, it smelled like lemon scented cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I actually think I would have been better off using no lotion at all.  </li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping, received within 2 days!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> So, I just came from my first session with this lotion.</li>
            <li> and I love the shipping, it came a day later!!</li>
            <li> see a difference with first use.</li>
            <li> It smells odd, not over powering, but kind of something that I&#x27;d expect an older person to enjoy.</li>
            <li> Most likely my fault for not thoroughly rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> some as cheap as 15 bucks by far</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It smells more like a male cologne, but I do like it.</li>
            <li> It did leave me a with a bit of an orange cast on the first day.</li>
            <li> I did in fact get 3 shades darker after the first use.</li>
            <li> I work at a tanning salon and have used some of the most expensive lotions and this is by far the best one I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> But other than that AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I notice a big, long lasting difference in just one tanning session caompared to others and the smell is great!!!</li>
            <li> The lotion is a great moisturizer and helps create a deep, rich, natural looking tan, with absolutely no yellowing effects or blotchy discoloration.</li>
            <li> Yes it wears off like all bronzers do as your stained skin sheds, but a quick rubdown in the shower with baking soda will get it all off so that you can start with a new application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a very unisex smell that smells more like a light cologne after tanning than the typical fruity smell.</li>
            <li> So overall a nice product..just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;update:  Wow..</li>
            <li> Many people have complained about it, but I actually really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s great for men becuase who wants to walk around with a big pink bottle of tanning lotion</li>
            <li> &quot; Yeah, they pretty much nailed it.</li>
            <li> I needed something that would give me some color fast, and this really did the job!</li>
            <li> I have such a hard time tanning, with very very fair skin I noticed after my first tan</li>
            <li> it took almost two full weeks to arrive, but since I did qualify for free shipping, I probably should have expected that.</li>
            <li> The seller sold a genuine product (I bought a sample from my salon and it was EXACTLY the same smell, texture, result, etc as well as compared the bottles).  </li>
            <li> Like I said, very pretty natural brown tan.</li>
            <li> I like the lotion white 2 black for the most part just have to make sure it&#x27;s rubbed in cause</li>
            <li> I still have a lot left and am no longer using it, I bought a different one that is worlds better that I will also be reviewing!</li>
            <li> and it really does help reduce those fine lines around your eyes and the dreaded 11&#x27;s) and a bronzer to give your skin instant color.</li>
            <li> Seller was fast though..</li>
            <li> , it works FAST</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t really see myself 3 shades darker as this product adbvertises..</li>
            <li> Very even too...</li>
            <li> and i really dislike it</li>
            <li> i really noticed the difference about an hour after</li>
            <li> It really did make me a lot darker.</li>
            <li> and it really does rev up your tan.</li>
            <li> Unfortunatly, I am allergic to the lotion but worked very well before hand.  </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for color fast this product should work for you.</li>
            <li> Really upset about this.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> On Amazon, it&#x27;s at a much lower price point than you&#x27;ll find in tanning salons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already really tan, but this makes me even darker.</li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> &quot; but I did get tan really fast, within a couple sessions.</li>
            <li> I can tell that it has helped me tan much faster than if I used a non bronzing lotion and the feel of it on my skin</li>
            <li> But its not about the smell, its about the tan it gives you (in my opinion anyway..) I did come out very tan</li>
            <li> And the pump you squeeze the lotion through is very difficut to get the lotion through.  </li>
            <li> problem is, I do t think I got the real product.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for 2 years and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> Am I really three shades darker?</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about this claim, but figured if I only got 1-2 shades darker after first use I would be very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it darkens as fast as advertised.</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle but will move on.</li>
            <li> I am a huge perfume girl and have at least 50 bottles of different ones and this lotion smelt good to me.</li>
            <li> Shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li> When I was tanning for a wedding i was in, i was using another product that works really well.  </li>
            <li> I came out and didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> I really did look a lot tanner after I used it.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Could not tell too much of a difference after 1-3 uses.</li>
            <li> It really seems to moisturize my skin and it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy or sticky.  </li>
            <li> but this one...not so much.</li>
            <li> This gets tricky when you have slippery lotion hands, and just isn&#x27;t very user friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i can say the product works very well.</li>
            <li> Whatever is in this lotion, is not the real thing.</li>
            <li> The only thing that kind of set it back for 5 stars is that it will die your hands orange if you dont wash the excess lotion off your hands before you head into the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion before and this lotion is not the same lotion I&#x27;ve used before In my own personal opinion</li>
            <li> wow!!!</li>
            <li> After my first time using it I&#x27;ve become noticably darker, and not in a fake- orangy kind of way that a lot of cheap lotions have done.</li>
            <li> It is more of a unisex smell than some of the other fruity or bubble gum smelling lotions.  </li>
            <li> There are other better ones out there.  </li>
            <li> I got a sample of this for buying a different lotion &amp; was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and I wont buy any other tanning lotion</li>
            <li> I tan a lot, so i am really picky about my lotions, and when i used this one, I really didnt see a difference even going in a high pressure bed.</li>
            <li> The only draw back that I have found is that you want to make sure to get it very even on your skin and wipe between fingers after application so that you have an even tan.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it enhances the tanning bed experience, but it does provide a nice self tanner.  </li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and liked it.  </li>
            <li> I bought it hoping to get super dark relatively quick.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t exactly pleased with how the lotion came out, its kind of an awkward shaped bottle.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t affect the use of the product, however since the part that broke is just the outer covering for the top (the black part)</li>
            <li> I have used it all and tried another brand but will be purchasing this particular brand again soon.</li>
            <li> I used it last year and it helps to tan quickly.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m sure ill keep using it. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I took one star away because this is the third bottle I have purchased (only one from Amazon) and the top on every one of them broke within a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I have no doubt this is a decent lotion.</li>
            <li> I think this is a decent lotion.</li>
            <li> After my first or second time I was trying to see if I noticed a difference since I thought I looked darker at first.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have a good base tan first.</li>
            <li> I have been very satisfied with White 2 Black tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> i highly recomend buying both of these products together.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it over any tanning lotion you would buy at Walmart or Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The smell really isn&#x27;t my favorite, but have also smelled worse, but I mean I use it to tan to get darker, not to smell good, so it&#x27;s totally worth it,..</li>
            <li> After one use I still have to say that my WHITE 2 BLACK works so much better!</li>
            <li> Also, at first I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference of my tan but after a few hours there was a difference.  </li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t tell how old it really is.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different lotions that turn you different shades of orange but never anything that made me look so naturally tanned.</li>
            <li> , I definitely noticed I was much darker after the first use.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to wash your hands after you tan, or the bronzer gets gunked up in between your fingers and gives you extra color in a strange place.</li>
            <li> so I ordered a few more bottles.</li>
            <li> in which i normally shower after tanning anyway.</li>
            <li> I got amazing color from WHITE 2 Black.</li>
            <li> you notice it after the first time, but after continuously using it, it gets you super dark.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She said it would do the trick and bump me right back to where I was in the summer.</li>
            <li> I tried it yesterday and saw instant results right after I got out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> (I am an easy tanner that gets really dark and seldom burns)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who likes tanning in a bed, it smells better than any of the others I&#x27;ve used (no sickly sweet tropical smell!)</li>
            <li> I would definitely suggest this if you need a deep tan fast for a vacation, wedding or any special event.</li>
            <li> The smell is fine, it does darken you but it doesn&#x27;t last unless used daily.  </li>
            <li> i wanted to try a new tanning lotion for my clients</li>
            <li> I probably will use up this lotion for my night tanning session, but try something new when it&#x27;s finished.</li>
            <li> I was nervous cuz it was new to me and so inexpensive on here</li>
            <li> and now my body is super dry.  </li>
            <li> It also does a nice job making me subtly darker without being too drastic or unnatural looking.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lotion that gives me a fast, long lasting color specially now in the winter</li>
            <li> I am going back to a better smelling lotion, this was bad and it didn&#x27;t even make my skin feel good.</li>
            <li> I used a sticker on my wrist to see the difference before and after and wowww, definitely worked better than any other lotion i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve tried several of these types of indoor tanning lotions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical when reading 5 star reviews on low cost lotions like this, but this stuff really worked for me great</li>
            <li> It is the same tanning lotion they sell in a salon at a MUCH cheaper price!</li>
            <li> I never take time and apply exactly even everywhere as the beds only allow 5 min before kicking on</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I decided to buy a sample and it lasted about a week... and let me just say WOW!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s probably about the same at other salons.</li>
            <li> I have since keep going and eachtime There is nice subtle change so my tan continues to look natural.</li>
            <li> so you want to wash your hands right after use and really watch where you put the lotion on its just like fake tan :)</li>
            <li> know a lot of people complained about the smell of this product on here, but personally I think its very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going to the tanning salon religiously everyday for the full time allowed in the bed and hadn&#x27;t noticed much until this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really get as dark as I expected ..and to top it off</li>
            <li> I was not as dark as I expected, but it gives you a nice natural brown color.</li>
            <li> I love the Black to White tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very quick and I received my purchase earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> I love the black and white packaging and the smell.</li>
            <li> But I could see a huge difference in color in just a few tanning sessions.</li>
            <li> I am a professional spray tanner.</li>
            <li> the bronzer will fade quite a bit, but in a really natural way..</li>
            <li> HOWEVER after 2weeks of frequently using this lotion it began to streek</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive</li>
            <li> an acceleration increases the body&#x27;s natural melanin (the chemicals in body that make you tan) were as a bronzer is a die.</li>
            <li> I seen immediate results and have a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> As for the smell it didn&#x27;t bother me that much, maybe it is different depending on your skin&#x27;s chemistry.</li>
            <li> I noticed the cap on my bottle didn&#x27;t feel very snug, but this was not an issue as the cap was not even necessary.  </li>
            <li> But the lotion went on smoothy and make my skin feel really soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, I didn&#x27;t have the old \\&quot;tanning bed</li>
            <li> The smell is very manly, but that&#x27;s no big problem</li>
            <li> but this turns my tan into a natural brown/bronze.</li>
            <li> Natural brown color.</li>
            <li> It was strange how much darker I got after a couple hours!</li>
            <li> and WOW you can def.</li>
            <li> One thing i really like about this lotion is that is DOES NOT leave my palms all orangy and it leaves a really pretty long lasting color.</li>
            <li> so your skin stays incredibily soft (some call it liquid botox</li>
            <li> Skin felt good after using, not dried out, or suffocating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used half so far and already have a good dark tan</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m super dark now.</li>
            <li> This lotion got me super dark and you can tell a difference after one or two tans.  </li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m blonde haired and blue eyed.</li>
            <li> Makes you so dark, doesn&#x27;t really make u 3 shades darker after one session, but use it for about a week to two weeks straight</li>
            <li> i would recommend it, as long as you are coming right back home to shower.</li>
            <li> I have spent so much $ trying and just haven&#x27;t yet!</li>
            <li> I think for now I&#x27;ll stick with the good-smelling, cheaper lotions, and save the White to Black for \\&quot;special occasion\\&quot; tanning when I need to look super dark.</li>
            <li> The packaging may not be super girly like a lot of other products for tanning, but that&#x27;s no big deal at all.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> /&gt;White 2 Black has a fresh scent that is unisex.</li>
            <li> WHITE 2 BLACK actually does get you shades darker, and you&#x27;ll notice it more with a more expensive tanning bed.</li>
            <li> Made me tan really fast and usually i cant really tan even in a bed.</li>
            <li> if tha bronzers was surprised by that cause its a white lotiom</li>
            <li> and I have a pretty good base tan.</li>
            <li> i was a little hesitant to try this after i got it, it was super thick and smelled more like mens cologne than i had expected.</li>
            <li> It also wasn&#x27;t greasy and left skin feeling soft and not dry.</li>
            <li> Btw, the shipping was extremely fast, it came like 4 days before it was expected!</li>
            <li> It smells very beachy and doesnt leave your skin smelling burnt like other lotions.</li>
            <li> experience was NOT what I expected based on reviews and the general high quality of DC products.</li>
            <li> The scent is definately manly, but does fade an hour or so afterwards, and honestly I&#x27;m never a fan of tanning lotion scents no matter how hard they try to make them good.  </li>
            <li> I was looking to get dark fast</li>
            <li> I got really dark really fast.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a 3 shade difference the first time i used it, but after a few days i was a lot darker than before.</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars instead of one because it does get you super dark almost instantly, and the smell isn&#x27;t bad, but I don&#x27;t like how the &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; washes almost completely off, and I&#x27;m not so sure it provides much benefit compared to other bronzers when tanning.</li>
            <li> But the bottle is only 8.5 ounces when many of the other lotions are at least 10 ounces, and several are 13.5 ounces-</li>
            <li> It worked quickly, and evenly on my stomach, arms, and back but the bad things outweigh the fact that it works fast in certain areas.</li>
            <li> Also, there is only 8.5 oz in the bottle so don&#x27;t expect it to last long.  </li>
            <li> The scent is different, not bad but not great.</li>
            <li> I was iffy about using a bronzer because I don&#x27;t like them, but this bronzer gave my skin a natural dark tan instead of that orange glow</li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t say how long it&#x27;ll last.  </li>
            <li> I havent tanned in a salon in a long time and I was pastey white</li>
            <li> I am down to my last few drops and the awkward square shape prevents me from using every drop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Bottom line: Great bronzer, not overdone, but definetly enhanced my color after.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m here to tell you that as a college student who has been tanning for the past 8 years, WHITE 2 BLACK is my bronzing lotion and has been for the past 3 years and will continue to be until I find something better,</li>
            <li> This lotion might work for people just starting out, but not people who already are tan or have a good base tan.</li>
            <li> so I was less than thrilled when I woke up looking dirty the next morning.</li>
            <li> It left my skin so dry!</li>
            <li> The smell is a little off-putting as well, a tad too masculine for my liking.  </li>
            <li> As others have said, it&#x27;s kind of masculine-smelling, but it&#x27;s not so bad that I would throw it away.  </li>
            <li> defianatly some better lotions out there, plus this one stinks.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to supply enough color as she would like, and expected.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is thick and creamy so it doesnt take much, and it also has a pleasent smell,it is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily I also ordered in the same shipment some Australian Gold Sinfully Black 15x</li>
            <li> I give White 2 Black only the two star rating because of these things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it normally takes me a long time to develop a tan but using my other lotions i have worked my way up to 20 minutes, I used white 2 black for the 1st time today and i have gotten way darker in just a matter of hours!!</li>
            <li> I actually really liked the smell, Im a woman, but Im sick of smelling like a coconut every time I tan.</li>
            <li> Only two complaints- due to the shape of the bottle</li>
            <li> BUT it DOES dry out my skin...  </li>
            <li> Im by no means a beginner and have a nice base tan, but I&#x27;ve only used this lotion once and noticed an improvement.</li>
            <li> Two hours later man was i dark.</li>
            <li> Deep Dark Bronzing</li>
            <li> i noticed a subtle diffrence, 2nd day tanning session big diffrence, 3rd tanning session</li>
            <li> I tried a sample packet of White 2 Black at my tanning salon and noticed results as soon as I got home.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking when a $250 bronzer STILL doesn&#x27;t beat WHITE 2 BLACK</li>
            <li> It smells gross and does not cover the typical tanning</li>
            <li> Although this can be a hassle and takes a little extra effort</li>
            <li> adds a little extra tan</li>
            <li> Makes you smell like a sweaty old man.&lt;br /&gt;Really hard to get out of the &amp;#34;bottle&amp;#34; (or whatever you call this square-shaped container).</li>
            <li> Was not what i expected.</li>
            <li> Only a few tanning sessions</li>
            <li> I use this if I only have a few days to get a darker tan.</li>
            <li> I can not really describe it</li>
            <li> I spent hours searching for a lotion, and ended up buying this one.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little different than what your used to with the other lotions</li>
            <li> I am a pale white girl (irish,english)</li>
            <li> not only am i darker but i spend less money going taning because i get so dark in one session that i dont need to go all the time.</li>
            <li> I do agree that it is similar to a department store cologne, but its not strong.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not, the lotion goes on smooth, I thought the smell of the lotion was bad when I first applied before tanning the smell is even worse after tanning..</li>
            <li> I have a really white boyfriend though and even he got a little dark with this.</li>
            <li> I am reading other reviews thinking...</li>
            <li> but, then again, I&#x27;ve noticed that problem with other lotions I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I believe it works like any other Designer lotion I used for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Usually use two different tanning lotions every other time I tan</li>
            <li> The lotion has also brought my freckles out instead of blending them in with the bronzer like some other lotions do..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for my last three sessions, and I&#x27;ve already achieved a color that would usually take up to two weeks to see.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some other reviews where people recalled it smelling like \\&quot;musty air, cologne, and cigarettes\\</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference from any of the other lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not darker than if I  used any other lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with my other lotion</li>
            <li> but it arrived on Saturday along with other items I had ordered.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t an \\&quot;after-tanning\\&quot; smell like I get with a lot of other lotions.</li>
            <li> just smells like you&#x27;ve been tanning and not fruity like other lotions.</li>
            <li> Some lotions claim to get you really dark</li>
            <li> and so I should be really dark by now since that would be the equivalent to 9 tanning sessions if it gets you 3 times tanner</li>
            <li> , I have dark patches on my knees and ankles.</li>
            <li> and I should be really dark by now</li>
            <li> oh she must hae been fake baking haha.</li>
            <li> but it got me DARK.</li>
            <li> i am not as dark as I want to be yet but its my 1st time and</li>
            <li> I have a dark complextion</li>
            <li> but after about 3 times I got really dark.</li>
            <li> It DOES tend to wash off if you shower after tanning with it; however, anyone who knows anything about tanning lotions will instruct you NOT to shower for at least 4 hours after tanning especially if you are using a bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin, and I have a hard time tanning in natural sunlight.  </li>
            <li> So I put it on, jumped in the bed and got down to business.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other product!</li>
            <li> Other stuff did not get me nearly as dark as this stuff!</li>
            <li> I HAD to write this review after just receiving and using the ULTRA DARK Black Ultimatum 296xxx MAXX extreme bronzing lotion for $62!</li>
            <li> I ordered this and recieved it within less than 24 hours of my order.</li>
            <li> My tan typically lightens up within 3 days.</li>
            <li> And the black lid shown doesn&#x27;t stay on, it pops off, and then lotion leaks all over your bag (when you&#x27;re not squeezing and the lotion has time to ooze out).  </li>
            <li> I saw the price for this item was much less here than at the tanning salon .</li>
            <li> After getting a base tan with Smile lotion, I switched to White 2 Black...</li>
            <li> This lotion is typically $50-65 a bottle at the salon, but I can buy it online for $18.</li>
            <li> The lotion wasn&#x27;t bad but it wasn&#x27;t anything special either.</li>
            <li> Not true in my case.</li>
            <li> First of all, it stinks.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s NOT true.</li>
            <li> I think it should cost a little less considering that fact....</li>
            <li> Ive tried several different lotions, and they all leave streaks and a bad smell, but not white 2 black!</li>
            <li> It works quickly and doesnt smell too bad.</li>
            <li> THe color was ok but the smell was SOOOOOOO bad that I couldnt use it!</li>
            <li> I used a little sticker to see how well it worked</li>
            <li> Kinda musky, maybe a little manly.  </li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t an ATO either, until I came home and put on a little Aveeno moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> ive been tanning everyday prepairing for my wedding</li>
            <li> If you stop tanning for a few days/a week...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m leaving for a cruise in a few days</li>
            <li> As it empties, I will probably waste a lot out of frustration</li>
            <li> The lady at the salon recommended a few lotions and then I said, \\&quot;you look at me and tell me what you think is</li>
            <li> Ah, I figured why not and got a sample pack for a few bucks.</li>
            <li> If It Expires In A Few Months</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan all year round, as i give my skin a break.  </li>
            <li> so being that said, i was on the hunt for a lotion that gives me color without me having to go to the tanning salon everyday.  </li>
            <li> I think it always helps me achieve my natural color, versus a fake overdone tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a member at a tanning salon for a few years.</li>
            <li> BUT I&#x27;m not a huge fan of tanning lotion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to tan daily for at least two weeks to get any amount of color!</li>
            <li> I am a very very pale skinned, blue eyed hispanic, it is VERY hard to me to find something that works and won&#x27;t burn my skin.</li>
            <li> At first it&#x27;s bad, but tolerable.  </li>
            <li> I seriously would jump on it with one hand and all my body weight and put the other hand close to the opening to catch what was coming out.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical since I noticed many of the reviews talked about how bad the smell is.</li>
            <li> Bottle shape design sucks, could be ever so slightly thicker.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t that nasty sweaty sun smell it is very light.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still very dark!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not feel the same way, and ended up giving it to my Daughter as she was the one who recommended it..</li>
            <li> then it usually does.</li>
            <li> but I usually don&#x27;t have problems with any of the scents.</li>
            <li> leaves the most horrible after smell on your skin and it lasts for 3 days - no amt of scrubbing gets it off</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this regularly but it didn&#x27;t look hilariously fake like some bronzers do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used in the past &amp; when I needed lotion, I remembered this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was the lotion or the bed</li>
            <li> Smells weird, especially after tanning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few products that truly did change my color in one session, without it saying so in the description!</li>
            <li> Instead of coated in some thick lotion that heavy smelled in order to make up for the DHA smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> I am not pleased at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells horrible, just like the WalMart and dollar general self-tanners I used to use 15 years ago in high school.</li>
            <li> Though my Aveeno claims to be unscented, if mixed with the tanning lotion, it does give a slight unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> I really wish it would have worked. :(</li>
            <li> i would recommend having a base tan first, because it does not have an accelerator in it.</li>
            <li> im really upset about this. :(</li>
            <li> so I have a hard time getting tan.</li>
            <li> even my arms plus the design of the bottle makes it hard at times to get the lotion out</li>
            <li> My boyfriend said that he think it smells a little like the Bombshell by Victoria Secret after a couple of hours</li>
            <li> but this left me looking almost dirty.</li>
            <li> but idk he likes it so at least it isn&#x27;t too guy smelling.</li>
            <li> People complained about the smell</li>
            <li> at least on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> it made my entire body itch like crazy after use</li>
            <li> but lately Ive been going in the winter time as well.</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;m simply not to thrilled about the scent or the way the lotion feels when applied.</li>
            <li> and I mean tons and for the 1st 2weeks i used this it was my favorit lotion evr</li>
            <li> I mean I thought I could get over the smell</li>
            <li> But overall I recommend this because you do get really dark if you already have a base tan going.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not too dark or fake looking at all.</li>
            <li> and seriously I have probably tanned about 5-6 shades darker in 3 sessions.</li>
            <li> and I Appeared to be in serious NEED of moisture After my tanning session was finished.</li>
            <li> White 2 Black smells so bad that I dont even want to go tanning!</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting a base tan before using this due to the bronzers in it, it may make you turn orange if you start using it with a pale skin.</li>
            <li> It is a difficult bottle to use, since it is a hard plastic, square shape.</li>
            <li> It is a thin lotion, so it feels like you have to use a lot to cover yourself</li>
            <li> Like I said before, maybe I got some junk by buying online, but I am not happy with this lotion.</li>
            <li> I always felt like I had to use quite a bit to cover my entire body, which was annoying.</li>
            <li> I just think this is false advertising.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t look like an awkward and pale ghost.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviews, I don&#x27;t think the smell is to bad...</li>
            <li> , I think there is a slight tingle, but its not too bad.</li>
            <li> I started tanning because a roommate of mine said I looked sick (because my skin was so pale) and bought me a tanning package, and I have been going ever since.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t UNpleasant, but it&#x27;s hard to describe...</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, it has a small hint of manly aftershave/cologne</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s really hard to review this lotion as a lotion because the smell is just so bad.  </li>
            <li> Worst of all, I&#x27;m now a different color from my hips up than my legs!</li>
            <li> Also, the ATO is terrible especially if you sweat a lot during tanning.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when using this lotion because I have always used designer skin products.</li>
            <li> but I sadly have to disagree.  </li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews I was kinda skeptical to try this.</li>
            <li> but I was sooo wrong</li>
            <li> It goes on evenly and doesn&#x27;t make you feel gross and disgusting after tanning.</li>
            <li> like everyone else I was skeptical of the claim that it makes you three shades darker in one</li>
            <li> So for this one to say it and not do it made me sad.</li>
            <li> I am an obsessed tanner just about.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t feel guilty about it.</li>
            <li> I HATE GETTING RIPPED OFF, DEF SUCKS.</li>
            <li> Summer time in the South this year has been rainy as crap lately, so my tan was rapidly fading off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m just really disappointed at how poor quality the Devoted Creations product was.</li>
            <li> It is turning me orange instead of brown, my hands and feet look dirty, it made me splotchy</li>
            <li> it is awkward to squeeze when applying.</li>
            <li> Before buying this all the reviews I read said that this lotion had an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It smells disgusting, at least to me.</li>
            <li> Getting darker but not that crazy about smell &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> maybe I have a bad bottle</li>
            <li> The smell before tanning wasn&#x27;t bad, like a man&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes skin and does not have a bad odor.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> It  smells  bad too.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad after you tan</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stain your hands and the smell isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> It smelled horrible going on but even 100 times worse after tanning.</li>
            <li> This lotion STINKS!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It turns your skin and palms the horrible, stereotypical ORANGE stained color of all cheaper self</li>
            <li> was so disappointed, but then again, it was on &amp;#34;sale&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> After weeks of use, in tanning bed and sun tanning, she is somewhat disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> the container is very awkward in getting the lotion out.</li>
            <li> but it was still quite annoying probably wont buy this again</li>
            <li> recommend this lotion to those who already have a base tan, want faster results with color, or want to break through their tanning</li>
            <li> IDK that I would use it if I didn&#x27;t already have a base tan .</li>
            <li> , I do not recommend this for you if your paler and do not have a base tan yet because it can tend to look streaky.</li>
            <li> I never have this problem when I have a base tan though.</li>
            <li> VERY SAD to make a claim that has NO backup!</li>
            <li> This lotion is very unpleasant from the smell which reminded me of a mens cologne, to the texture of the lotion it just balls up and wipes off.</li>
            <li> After tanning though it was the worst smelling lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I HATED it!</li>
            <li> My skin felt greasy and nasty.</li>
            <li> After building a base tan,  th is boosted my color!</li>
            <li> I also HATE THE BOTTLE!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutely loved it I&#x27;ve only used half so far and already have a good dark tan thank you for this product</li>
            <li> I am a professional spray tanner. I tan people every day. i wanted to try a new tanning lotion for my clients so I bought this. dis appointed is an understaement. I am reading other reviews thinking... I just don&#x27;t get it.  this stuff I didn&#x27;t see even the slightest color change... maybe I have a bad bottle but I doubt it. I really wish it would have worked. :(</li>
            <li> Bought this after someone told me about how good it was..Unfortunately, I did not feel the same way, and ended up giving it to my Daughter as she was the one who recommended it..Seller was fast though..</li>
            <li> I used a sticker on my wrist to see the difference before and after and wowww, definitely worked better than any other lotion i&#x27;ve used. and it&#x27;s almost 50 dollars in the store, and only 17 bucks on here!</li>
            <li> I love the Black to White tanning lotion. I have tried many tanning products, but this one by far top them all. Even the lady at my tanning salon explained that it was their biggest seller and could barley keep it on the shelf. I won&#x27;t use any other product!</li>
            <li> I wish I would have known that \\&quot;bronzers\\&quot; are self-tanning elements in the product.  Make sure you can spread the lotion very evenly and treat it like a self tanning lotion.  I used once and had streaks.  I am leary about using it again.</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning lotion I have ever spent my money on. I have always been considered fair skinned so I have a hard time getting tan. I have tried many different lotions that turn you different shades of orange but never anything that made me look so naturally tanned. The first use I went to a tanning bed for 5 minutes and changed 3 shades darker. I have since keep going and eachtime There is nice subtle change so my tan continues to look natural. The lotion is thick and creamy so it doesnt take much, and it also has a pleasent smell,it is not greasy at all. I love this lotion and will not be buying anything else from now on. I ordered this and recieved it within less than 24 hours of my order. Great Product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who likes tanning in a bed, it smells better than any of the others I&#x27;ve used (no sickly sweet tropical smell!), it works FAST and it&#x27;s a great price.  My tanning salon sells this for $40 a bottle...I&#x27;ll never buy tanning lotion there again!</li>
            <li> So i just got out of the tanning bed after using this lotion for the first time.  It goes on very smooth and i love that.  However the smell and packaging of this particular lotion caters more to men which is great if you&#x27;re a man. IMO the smell is good but reminds of men&#x27;s cologne...maybe just me idk.  It has not been 24 hours yet but i don&#x27;t really see myself 3 shades darker as this product adbvertises..but they say you continue to tan for 24 hours so we&#x27;ll see.  I do think i am darker and this is a nice lotion.  When i got out if felt like i had no lotion on at all which is great and after i applied \\&quot;perfectly pink\\&quot; after tan lotion and now i smell amazing!  i guess the 2 scents together really compliment eachother!  The girl at the salon raved about this stuff and she said it reminds her of a perfume she used to wear..so i guess it depends on your skin&#x27;s chemistry.  I think it&#x27;s great for men becuase who wants to walk around with a big pink bottle of tanning lotion right?  So overall a nice product..just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;update:  Wow..i should have waited to write this review...i really noticed a darker tan after a few hours...And when my husband got home he could tell the difference...so i love this lotion..but i still think it caters to men but who cares...if it gets me dark..i&#x27;ll just sqirt on some perfume :) NICE LOTION!</li>
            <li> The product itself seemed to work okay.  The smell before tanning wasn&#x27;t bad, like a man&#x27;s cologne.  After tanning though it was the worst smelling lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  They need to do something about the smell and I would consider buying again.</li>
            <li> Awesome lotion works great</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve tried several of these types of indoor tanning lotions so I have some experience to compare with.  I am fair-complected so I require extra bronzers to achieve the color that I&#x27;m after.  Some lotions claim to get you really dark but I have not been too impressed with them.  This lotion delivers the results that I&#x27;m looking for.  The biggest problem I have with it is the smell.  As others have said, it&#x27;s kind of masculine-smelling, but it&#x27;s not so bad that I would throw it away.  It goes on smooth and moisturizes well but it does leave a bit of a slimy feeling on my skin, which I could do without but, then again, I&#x27;ve noticed that problem with other lotions I&#x27;ve used.  Also, there is only 8.5 oz in the bottle so don&#x27;t expect it to last long.  I think it should cost a little less considering that fact.... Bottom line: this product does a much better job than most at getting me the color that I want very quickly so I would probably consider buying it again.  My favorite lotion is \\&quot;Black\\&quot; by Designer Skin but it does cost a bit more -- it gets me the nice, dark color without the smell or the slimy feeling afterwards :)</li>
            <li> I was looking to get dark fast I had a baby recently and lost my tan. I wanted to get back the color I was before the baby, this lotion is amazing it makes your skins soft and smells good too. It has bronzes in it that stat to work just an hour after. This is the perfect lotion for me! I will keep buying this product over and over it really work good for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> I tan a lot, so i am really picky about my lotions, and when i used this one, I really didnt see a difference even going in a high pressure bed. defianatly some better lotions out there, plus this one stinks.</li>
            <li> Good smelling and gives a nice tan!!</li>
            <li> I am the palest person I know and I do not tan that well...I bought a packet of this today at the tanning place and tried it...Didn&#x27;t think much of it at first...About an hour later after I had showered and put a white shirt on I realized how tan I looked!! Very even too...I love this stuff...Just bought the bottle and can&#x27;t wait to see what happens the second time...Only thing is that I wish it had a more beachy scent...thats what I love most about tanning lotion...Love it though!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical when reading 5 star reviews on low cost lotions like this, but this stuff really worked for me great I just had to say something. After my first time using it I&#x27;ve become noticably darker, and not in a fake- orangy kind of way that a lot of cheap lotions have done. This stuff has given me such a beautiful glowing tan, but I&#x27;ve only used it once yesterday so can&#x27;t say how long it&#x27;ll last.  The scent is definately manly, but does fade an hour or so afterwards, and honestly I&#x27;m never a fan of tanning lotion scents no matter how hard they try to make them good.  Will definately purchase this again and again I just can&#x27;t believe how great my skin looks right now!!  UPDATE: It&#x27;s been several days since I tanned and I&#x27;m still very dark! My tan typically lightens up within 3 days.</li>
            <li> White 2 Black smells so bad that I dont even want to go tanning! It smells like a musky smoke room especially after you tan. I wouldnt recommend it!</li>
            <li> im pretty fair and dont tan very good, i have strawbeery blonde hair light eyes and freckel pretty easily and this stuff works! 1st tanning session i noticed a subtle diffrence, 2nd day tanning session big diffrence, 3rd tanning session i think i need to take a break because it would be too much! ive been tanning everyday prepairing for my wedding so i only use this about twice a week and boy does it work. only thing i dislike about it is the smell kind of manly and i really dislike it but you dont want to wash it off because then you lose the bronzer effect. remember when buying this it has lots of bronzers in it so you want to wash your hands right after use and really watch where you put the lotion on its just like fake tan :)</li>
            <li> It claims on the bottle that it gets you 3 times tanner in one session which isn&#x27;t true in my case.  I&#x27;ve gone tanning 3 times in one week and used this lotion every time and so I should be really dark by now since that would be the equivalent to 9 tanning sessions if it gets you 3 times tanner like it says on the bottle.  Not true in my case.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing tanning lotion from Amazon. I was very impressed with the timeliness of delivery and quality of product. It is the same tanning lotion they sell in a salon at a MUCH cheaper price! I definitely reccomend this product!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and did wonders for me i really noticed the difference about an hour after i had got done tanning. It really did make me a lot darker. The smell reminds me of a mens cologne it smells great because its not over whelming or to strong. This product goes on smoothly and it does not feel like you have lotion on after you finish tanning. I reacentky akso bought the perfectly pink product and it smells great and really moisturizes your skin and my tan lasts alot longer then it usually does. Both of these products go great together together i highly recomend buying both of these products together.</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT... until you take a shower.  I bought it hoping to get super dark relatively quick.  It worked great during my tanning session, and when I got home my husband was really impressed.  We went to dinner that night and my tan looked amazing with my neon pink shirt.  However, when I took a shower later that night, the color all washed away.  The smell is a little off-putting as well, a tad too masculine for my liking.  I think for now I&#x27;ll stick with the good-smelling, cheaper lotions, and save the White to Black for \\&quot;special occasion\\&quot; tanning when I need to look super dark.</li>
            <li> It is one of the best tanning lotions I have ever used, I have never been that dark in my life and I have tanned since I was 16 which is over 10 years ago. It feels good on too. It doesnt smell that great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff! Works very well! Goes on smooth, smells pretty good. Other stuff did not get me nearly as dark as this stuff! I will be buying more soon!!</li>
            <li> I Love this lotion!!! I havent tanned in a salon in a long time and I was pastey white I used this lotion once and noticed a huge difference! I have gone 3 times now and I look like I have been going for 2 months, the only thing I didnt like was the ATO but i strongly suggest this product to people who dont tan very fast and want fast results!</li>
            <li> Moisturizing and it really does rev up your tan. with one session I was noticeably darker than I get without the lotion. used over time... it definitely builds up color. If you stop tanning for a few days/a week... the bronzer will fade quite a bit, but in a really natural way.. Don&#x27;t worry about the added bronzers, they do not streak.</li>
            <li> The White2Black pre-tanning lotion is an excellent product that lives up to its advertizing. The lotion is a great moisturizer and helps create a deep, rich, natural looking tan, with absolutely no yellowing effects or blotchy discoloration. It is a great value compared to many much more expensive bronzers.</li>
            <li> the lotion is pretty good! it doesn&#x27;t smell that nice post tan, but it works well enough</li>
            <li> This was one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. The price was great and it arrived very quickly. I was a little concerned about the authenticity, but this is the real thing!my tan is great and i love this lotion!</li>
            <li> i was a little hesitant to try this after i got it, it was super thick and smelled more like mens cologne than i had expected. but it turned out to be my favorite lotion ive gotten recently. the smell isnt as strong after you get out of the bed, and it gives you great color. you notice it after the first time, but after continuously using it, it gets you super dark. will definitely be buying this lotion again!!</li>
            <li> I want to get the most of my tans like anyone else but this left me looking almost dirty. The result wasn&#x27;t immediately after tanning but the next day. I never take time and apply exactly even everywhere as the beds only allow 5 min before kicking on so I was less than thrilled when I woke up looking dirty the next morning. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the scent but I usually don&#x27;t have problems with any of the scents.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan that easily. (Blonde and fair) I&#x27;ve been going to the tanning salon religiously everyday for the full time allowed in the bed and hadn&#x27;t noticed much until this product. WOW! Its awesome! I&#x27;m leaving for a cruise in a few days and I&#x27;m super dark now. I would definitely suggest this if you need a deep tan fast for a vacation, wedding or any special event. Great price and very effective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of people complained about the smell of this product on here, but personally I think its very refreshing. Yes, it is a bit men&#x27;s cologne-ish BUT I&#x27;m not a huge fan of tanning lotion smells to begin with. This leaves you smelling like fresh soap, opposed to a burnt coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+++++++</li>
            <li> Lotion works great, I definitely noticed I was much darker after the first use.  Shipping was very quick and I received my purchase earlier than expected.  Only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is the smell isn&#x27;t the greatest, but I use a great after tanning lotion that smells good, so its still worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at my tanning bed for over $40. I have been tanning for 6 years at the same tanning bed, and I trust the person that runs my tanning bed. She has always steered me to excellent tanning lotions, but this one just isn&#x27;t working for me. First of all, it stinks. It smells like cigarettes and cologne. It is turning me orange instead of brown, my hands and feet look dirty, it made me splotchy, I have dark patches on my knees and ankles. It worked quickly, and evenly on my stomach, arms, and back but the bad things outweigh the fact that it works fast in certain areas. Worst of all, I&#x27;m now a different color from my hips up than my legs! I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottles of this thinking it would be great after reading all the reviews, but after using it 1-2 times... I HATED it! THe color was ok but the smell was SOOOOOOO bad that I couldnt use it! It smelled horrible going on but even 100 times worse after tanning. I would NOT recommend this if the smell of your lotion is important to you! Paramour has been the best smelling lotion I have ever used by far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tons of tanning lotion and I mean tons and for the 1st 2weeks i used this it was my favorit lotion evr it gave me an amazing dark golden glow HOWEVER after 2weeks of frequently using this lotion it began to streek even my arms plus the design of the bottle makes it hard at times to get the lotion out</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion just to try it out. I believe it works like any other Designer lotion I used for a fraction of the cost. It is def worth giving it a try!</li>
            <li> Just received this lotion a couple days ago and wanted to use it first before writing a review about it.  The lotion goes on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent to it.  I like this because it doesn&#x27;t make you smell like you just want tanning.  I didn&#x27;t have anoily or greasy feeling after putting it on.  Also, at first I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference of my tan but after a few hours there was a difference.  I didn&#x27;t think it gave me a darker tan equal to three tanning sections in one time but I did get darker.  As of now, I stopped using the lotion.  After a couple of uses I started to break out in hives and itching everywhere.  Unfortunatly, I am allergic to the lotion but worked very well before hand.  I would have given the lotion 5 stars if I wasn&#x27;t allergic to it.  My skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive but I guess there was something in the lotion that irriated it!  Other than that, great product!</li>
            <li> i love this product! smell great and provides very even color. remember not to wash it off right away or you will lose the bronzing effect, it needs time to soak into your skin. i would recommend having a base tan first, because it does not have an accelerator in it. an acceleration increases the body&#x27;s natural melanin (the chemicals in body that make you tan) were as a bronzer is a die. i like the product because the color is beautiful, but if you&#x27;re looking for a natural tan faster use an accelerator as well. if you&#x27;re looking for color fast this product should work for you. but i wait till i have peaked at my darkest.</li>
            <li> This lotion STINKS! I mean I thought I could get over the smell but it smells like cigarettes and BO. I haven&#x27;t notice any difference in my tan that I got from any other good smelling lotion and it made me break out. I am going back to a better smelling lotion, this was bad and it didn&#x27;t even make my skin feel good. My skin felt greasy and nasty.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment, cheaper than tanning salons. I love this product, workable fast if your lookin for a quick tan. Make sure you rub it in good or it will streak you! :)</li>
            <li> This came without the lid, leaking, and used. Really upset about this. Also there is no expiration date so you can&#x27;t tell how old it really is.</li>
            <li> It has self tanner in it and leaves you orange</li>
            <li> REPEAT CUSTOMERS SAYS IT ALL</li>
            <li> I saw almost instant results with this product and loved it. I found a more intense bronzer now but still have this bottle for when I need color fast!</li>
            <li> This lotion works. I seen immediate results and have a natural looking tan. It moisturizes skin and does not have a bad odor. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about a month ago now and I really like it. I didn&#x27;t notice a 3 shade difference the first time i used it, but after a few days i was a lot darker than before. i also LOVE the way it smells; kinda like guys cologne. :) i would totally buy this lotion again</li>
            <li> Wow! Just ordered another bottle. Usually use two different tanning lotions every other time I tan but I am sticking to this one. I notice a big, long lasting difference in just one tanning session caompared to others and the smell is great!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is very unpleasant from the smell which reminded me of a mens cologne, to the texture of the lotion it just balls up and wipes off. It left my skin so dry! I saw NO results and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy a whole bottle!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really get as dark as I expected ..and to top it off I sometimes ended up with splotches...I guess that is my fault but it was still quite annoying probably wont buy this again</li>
            <li> I tried a sample packet of White 2 Black at my tanning salon and noticed results as soon as I got home.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion WILL give you instant color, and it will continue to darken.&lt;br /&gt;I like to tan in the evenings then I wait to shower in the mornings so that the lotion has time to reach full effect and everything.&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I am very pleased with the results of this product. I have also heard other great reviews on it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this lotion to those who already have a base tan, want faster results with color, or want to break through their tanning plateau.&lt;br /&gt;White 2 Black has a fresh scent that is unisex. The packaging may not be super girly like a lot of other products for tanning, but that&#x27;s no big deal at all.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it has been 2 days now since I last tanned and I still have lot&#x27;s of color from this lotion. I went ahead and purchased the full size bottle today at my salon. Looking forward to seeing how the color ends up after using this for an extended period.</li>
            <li> Product is good but a pain to get out of the container.  As it empties, I will probably waste a lot out of frustration</li>
            <li> I love this product, it works great. The smell is a little different than what your used to with the other lotions but i would still recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> I worked at a Tanning Salon, and we didn&#x27;t sell this brand, but it&#x27;s my absolute favorite tanning lotion, so I continue to order it from here because it works amazingly well. On Amazon, it&#x27;s at a much lower price point than you&#x27;ll find in tanning salons. Even my husband uses this lotion now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already really tan, but this makes me even darker. The smell isn&#x27;t bad, it has a small hint of manly aftershave/cologne but it isnt strong and the smell goes away. I really like this lotion better then all the kinds i have used. No complaints and i am a regular tanner. I also have tinea versicolor and most tanning lotions wont cover it up, but this one did:)</li>
            <li> I just started using this lotion and it works so well. I love the black and white packaging and the smell. It isn&#x27;t that nasty sweaty sun smell it is very light. My boyfriend said that he think it smells a little like the Bombshell by Victoria Secret after a couple of hours but idk he likes it so at least it isn&#x27;t too guy smelling. But basically it works all through the day. No tingling feeling in the bed it is perfect I can&#x27;t wait to use it tomorrow!</li>
            <li> Was not what i expected.It didn&#x27;t get me any darker than I was already.good lotion for a beginner I guess</li>
            <li> Works great!!! Just make sure you wipe it off between your fingers and toes it will be orange and rub evenly</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this lotion off of Amazon about a week ago. The shipping was really fast and I was intrigued to try it since it claims to turn you 3 shades darker after one use. I have been going tanning regularly for a wedding this weekend and I have a pretty good base tan. I was a bit skeptical since I noticed many of the reviews talked about how bad the smell is. When I put the lotion on the smell wasn&#x27;t too noticeable, it has a sort of cologne smell as many of the reviews described. However, the smell after was more of a self-tanner type smell.(not exactly my favorite smell) I would probably recommend tanning with this lotion at night, and showering the next morning if you are concerned about the smell. Overall, after one session the lotion gave me a good brown color. I was not as dark as I expected, but it gives you a nice natural brown color. I probably will use up this lotion for my night tanning session, but try something new when it&#x27;s finished.</li>
            <li> I am a VERY fair skinned Irish/German/Welsh.. when I normally start tanning I can only go into the bed for about 2 mins at a time and its takes me months on end to get a good tan (I.E. I start in January to be tan for the beach in MAY.).. I bought this lotion on a whim because of good reviews and I see why everyone loves it so much!! I LOVE IT TOO!! Never in my life have I been so tan.. and NOT burned!! I am only tanning twice or maybe three times per week and I have a wonderful golden glow... The lotion has also brought my freckles out instead of blending them in with the bronzer like some other lotions do.. Which I love. I love the smell of the lotion too - It doesn&#x27;t smell like grilled coconut when I get out of the bed .. It still smells fresh. And the lotion absorbs so well.. it doesn&#x27;t just sit on your skin and get greasy.. it actually moisturizes your skin.. The bottle is kind of awkward but the lotion is so worth it!! Only great things to say about this!!!</li>
            <li> I got amazing color from WHITE 2 Black. Only a few tanning sessions and I was tan! I do have an olive skin tone that takes to  tanning quite well. The scent was light and not over potent. The only thing that kind of set it back for 5 stars is that it will die your hands orange if you dont wash the excess lotion off your hands before you head into the tanning bed. I dont let that bother me any more and just wash my hands. I have just bought another refill of this lotion. I love it.</li>
            <li> this product was gross and all greasy when it arrived. it appears to have been used!!!!!!!! im really upset about this. :(</li>
            <li> I got really dark really fast. I am Spanish though and I tan pretty easily. I have a really white boyfriend though and even he got a little dark with this. This product goes for like $60 at the tanning salon so the price on Amazon is pretty awesome! People complained about the smell but it wasn&#x27;t that bad. All tanning lotions have a smell. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> so i bought the product because i&#x27;ve heard good things about it and its ok. the container is very awkward in getting the lotion out. it does smell nice and doesn&#x27;t streak on anything, it just didn&#x27;t give me as much color as i thought it would. i&#x27;m sure if i went every day i would see a difference but i tan 1-3x a week depending on my schedule and i only see getting darker for a day or two before it wears off and i&#x27;m paler again...at least on my face and neck. my legs and stomach are okay though.</li>
            <li> I did not know about the cologne smell and im allergic to it so now i cant even use it. but it was shipped fats so awesome on that!</li>
            <li> The lotion worked but...I didn&#x27;t go three shades darker in one session. Also, the ATO is terrible especially if you sweat a lot during tanning.</li>
            <li> Love it. It works just like I wanted. I defininetly would reccomendit above anything I have tried before . I will order again. I ordered before then tried another product. Now I&#x27;m back.</li>
            <li> works great! definitely saw a difference in my skin tone after just laying one time. i do recommend this to customers</li>
            <li> I used this tanning lotion last summer and was pleased with the results. I don&#x27;t think I was \\&quot;instantly three shades darker\\&quot; but I did get tan really fast, within a couple sessions. I was iffy about using a bronzer because I don&#x27;t like them, but this bronzer gave my skin a natural dark tan instead of that orange glow most bronzers give people. It was not overpowering bronzer. As for the smell it didn&#x27;t bother me that much, maybe it is different depending on your skin&#x27;s chemistry. If you like the island fruity smells in tanning lotions though this one doesn&#x27;t have it. Overall I was pleased with the product and I will be using it again this summer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion after reading the reviews and decided I had to try it out for myself.  I have very pale skin, and I have a hard time tanning in natural sunlight.  I usually have to tan daily for at least two weeks to get any amount of color! I&#x27;ve used this lotion for my last three sessions, and I&#x27;ve already achieved a color that would usually take up to two weeks to see.  It&#x27;s not an instant &#x27;3 shades darker in 1 session&#x27; like it claims, but it is a great lotion.  I also love how silky smooth it is, and not greasy. Very moisturizing! I also happen to love the scent! A lot of people don&#x27;t care for it, but I happen to like that it smells more like a perfume than a coconut/creamsicle smell.  It&#x27;s worth a shot, the price is pretty good. Only two complaints- due to the shape of the bottle it is awkward to squeeze when applying. And the second is the shipping- it took almost two full weeks to arrive, but since I did qualify for free shipping, I probably should have expected that.</li>
            <li> ...White-2-Black is my all-time favorite lotion. I like it because it works so incredibly well   and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (I usually use hypoallergenic lotion.) BUT it DOES dry out my skin...  This lotion got me super dark and you can tell a difference after one or two tans.  Plus it looks and smells gender neutral. If only it moisturized better, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> This is the best bronzer I have used. It doesn&#x27;t give you the orange tan.it gives You the nice brown tan. Hands down best bronzer</li>
            <li> I used this lotion last year and thought it was great. As for the smell I don&#x27;t plan on going out after using a tanning bed before taking a shower so who cares. I wouldn&#x27;t say it gets u three times darker either but it is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried n the best thing is u get darker not Orange!</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion</li>
            <li> I have been very satisfied with White 2 Black tanning lotion. It has a very unisex smell that smells more like a light cologne after tanning than the typical fruity smell. (don&#x27;t worry...if you are a female...I have never come out smelling like a man)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I can tell that it has helped me tan much faster than if I used a non bronzing lotion and the feel of it on my skin is extremely smooth. I would recommend this lotion.  The only draw back that I have found is that you want to make sure to get it very even on your skin and wipe between fingers after application so that you have an even tan. Although this can be a hassle and takes a little extra effort it is also a plus because you can use it on armpits and areas that may not tan to reduce obvious tan lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying this product on Amazon is the way to go.  The seller sold a genuine product (I bought a sample from my salon and it was EXACTLY the same smell, texture, result, etc as well as compared the bottles).  I noticed the cap on my bottle didn&#x27;t feel very snug, but this was not an issue as the cap was not even necessary.  My salon was selling the same lotion for much more.  I received the lotion in a timely manner and was very satisfied with the overall shipping process and product.</li>
            <li> Label says 1 to 3 shades darker after first use, well I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for 2 weeks and I should be really dark by now and I&#x27;m not, the lotion goes on smooth, I thought the smell of the lotion was bad when I first applied before tanning the smell is even worse after tanning..I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing this again..</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail today and was very excited to go try it out. Btw, the shipping was extremely fast, it came like 4 days before it was expected! I wasn&#x27;t exactly pleased with how the lotion came out, its kind of an awkward shaped bottle. But the lotion went on smoothy and make my skin feel really soft and silky. The smell is definitely not the best smell i&#x27;ve ever encountered. I&#x27;ve read some other reviews where people recalled it smelling like \\&quot;musty air, cologne, and cigarettes\\&quot; Yeah, they pretty much nailed it. LOL. But its not about the smell, its about the tan it gives you (in my opinion anyway..) I did come out very tan and I am a regular 4 days a week tanner. I have plateau&#x27;d and this definitely bumped up my tan to the next level. I would reccomend this if you are looking for a dark tan, but be aware that it does not smell good! Oh and one more thing, remember to wash your hands immediately when you get home. Because of all the bronzers in the lotion, in between my fingers turned orange so make sure that you wash it off asap.</li>
            <li> W2B works great for my skin! I use this if I only have a few days to get a darker tan. It has somewhat of a self tanner in it, so be sure to wash your hand after application. The scent reminded me of a cologne I had, definitely more manly( acqua di gio...ish) than fruity</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get a cap with my bottle wasn&#x27;t sealed so no way of telling if it actually is the actual product. Didn&#x27;t tan me that well, and the smell doesn&#x27;t do anything for me</li>
            <li> I HAD to write this review after just receiving and using the ULTRA DARK Black Ultimatum 296xxx MAXX extreme bronzing lotion for $62! This is a $250+ product might I add! After one use I still have to say that my WHITE 2 BLACK works so much better! WHITE 2 BLACK actually does get you shades darker, and you&#x27;ll notice it more with a more expensive tanning bed. This lotion is just awesome and I honestly haven&#x27;t found another that works even as good, I&#x27;ve been looking for better. And I&#x27;m here to tell you that as a college student who has been tanning for the past 8 years, WHITE 2 BLACK is my bronzing lotion and has been for the past 3 years and will continue to be until I find something better, when I do- I will post that information. I started tanning because a roommate of mine said I looked sick (because my skin was so pale) and bought me a tanning package, and I have been going ever since. Trust that even if your a WHITE white girl- this tanning lotion is awesome and will get you darker that day. It has self tanning bronzers that will continue to activate a few hours after you tan, so the earlier the better with this lotion, especially if you plan to shower after- DON&#x27;T with ANY bronzer- at least 4 hours after you tan. The next day though is the safest way to go. I am an esthetician (skin care specialist) as well, so PLEASE just take what I say about this lotion when you&#x27;re thinking about buying it! The smell is strong and florally, but honestly- WHO CARE&#x27;S?- If i&#x27;m going to be 3 shades darker in the next 4hours because of the smelly lotion- than fine by me! Its not a bad smell- just strong. I hope you all love this lotion and please let me know if you have found a better 1. I have spent so much $ trying and just haven&#x27;t yet! I&#x27;m thinking when a $250 bronzer STILL doesn&#x27;t beat WHITE 2 BLACK, then what the hell will?! HAPPY TANNING!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the smell.  It is more of a unisex smell than some of the other fruity or bubble gum smelling lotions.  But the bottle is only 8.5 ounces when many of the other lotions are at least 10 ounces, and several are 13.5 ounces- I wish I had noticed that before buying.  And the pump you squeeze the lotion through is very difficut to get the lotion through.  It sounds trivial, but when you have a smaller amount of lotion to begin with, every bit counts.  And the black lid shown doesn&#x27;t stay on, it pops off, and then lotion leaks all over your bag (when you&#x27;re not squeezing and the lotion has time to ooze out).  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of this lotion.  There are other better ones out there.  Do yourself a favor and try a different one.  As for the actual tan- I didn&#x27;t notice a difference from any of the other lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> it made my entire body itch like crazy after use</li>
            <li> I only go tanning once a week and using this bronzer lotion actually gives me a nice, healthy, and natural-looking tan that lasts from week to week. Other than the &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; fragrance, it is the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve found. It isn&#x27;t UNpleasant, but it&#x27;s hard to describe...</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I will continue to purchase. The lotion is light colored so it will not stain your hands and has a fragrance that is great for guys not wanting to smell like a girl.</li>
            <li> Went on well but as soon as I took a shower the color was gone.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion. One of the best by far.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> It works really good ! Getting darker but not that crazy about smell &#x3D;( it does get u darker quicker!</li>
            <li> Ok lotion. Smell is very strong. Wouldn&#x27;t say that it turns you 3 shades darker in one session. I do notice a color change after using it but not as drastic as the bottle says</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion smells funny, also like burnt smoky smell after tanning. But I could see a huge difference in color in just a few tanning sessions. It also wasn&#x27;t greasy and left skin feeling soft and not dry.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try the product with all the great reviews....problem is, I do t think I got the real product. It has NO SMELL, and anyone that tans knows that&#x27;s not right...and has no color. I feel like I&#x27;m putting unscented moisturizer on. And results.....NOTHING. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I HATE GETTING RIPPED OFF, DEF SUCKS. I KNEW THE PRICE WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. Ugh.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and it is a great product.  I tan at a salon and the prices for their lotion is quite steep.  I loved this lotion and had great results.  I have used it all and tried another brand but will be purchasing this particular brand again soon.</li>
            <li> this is such good tanning lotion. Not sticky or smelly. I used it last year and it helps to tan quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for 2 years and it works really well.  The only caution is that it has a self-tanner in it, so be sure to wash your hands immediately after tanning.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when using this lotion because I have always used designer skin products. I decided to buy a sample and it lasted about a week... and let me just say WOW! I used a little sticker to see how well it worked haha and seriously I have probably tanned about 5-6 shades darker in 3 sessions. No joke... it also doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent so when you are done tanning everyone doesn&#x27;t know oh she must hae been fake baking haha. The price is awesome in comparison too! &lt;3 it! Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> leaves the most horrible after smell on your skin and it lasts for 3 days - no amt of scrubbing gets it off</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m blonde haired and blue eyed. But I tan easily. Summer time in the South this year has been rainy as crap lately, so my tan was rapidly fading off. So, I dropped by the local tanning salon and bought a minutes package. Since I hadn&#x27;t been to a \\&quot;tanning bed\\&quot; in years, I had no idea what kind of products were out now or what was good. The lady at the salon recommended a few lotions and then I said, \\&quot;you look at me and tell me what you think is best.\\&quot; And she recommended this lotion, mainly because I already had a good tan and because I&#x27;m a guy. And yes, it smells like a guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said it would do the trick and bump me right back to where I was in the summer. Ah, I figured why not and got a sample pack for a few bucks. The lotion was nice and smooth, not oily at all and I dig the scent. So I put it on, jumped in the bed and got down to business. Afterwards, I didn&#x27;t have the old \\&quot;tanning bed smell\\&quot; - it still smelled the same, kinda like a guy lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was 7 hours ago. Am I really three shades darker? Lol, no, not really. But I am noticeably darker. Very much so. Maybe not three shades, but pretty darn good. So good that I&#x27;m glad I already ordered this stuff from Amazon so I can use it again next week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, bottom line, if you wanna pump up your tan, then you should give this stuff a try. Whatever you do - do NOT buy it at the salon. This stuff retails for 49 bucks at my place and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s probably about the same at other salons. Order it here and give it a shot. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> First i noticed the smell, it smelled like lemon scented cleaner.  Did not have a nice smell.  I was definitely noticeably darker after one session!  Idk about three shades but i liked it.  I also like how its not a bronzer so it didnt wash off of anything.</li>
            <li> Love love love this! After building a base tan,  th is boosted my color! After showering it does wash off though.. its definitely all bronzer but a good quality one. The smell is very manly, but that&#x27;s no big problem</li>
            <li> it is nothing special... definitely  didn&#x27;t  make nd 2 shades darker  like it claims.. even after tanning  days in a row  I&#x27;m not darker than if I  used any other lotion. It  smells  bad too. Wish I  could have my money back.</li>
            <li> Of all the tanning lotions I&#x27;ve used over the years, this is the absolute best! It smells like some kind of mens cologne, although I&#x27;m not sure what kind, it&#x27;s a pleasant smell. The \\&quot;3 Shades Darker\\&quot; claim is true.  I was skeptical at first about this claim, but figured if I only got 1-2 shades darker after first use I would be very happy with the product.  I will be ordering another bottle as soon as my current one gets a bit low.  After two 13 minute sessions using this lotion, my skin has an excellent bronze tone and I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Good, But Need To Know Expiration Date Before Shipping, Why Get A Deal On Something If It Expires In A Few Months</li>
            <li> when this stuff says,\\&quot;gets u 3 shades darker\\&quot; it means it. not only am i darker but i spend less money going taning because i get so dark in one session that i dont need to go all the time. great product!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it darkens as fast as advertised.</li>
            <li> I had heard from a friend that this lotion was supposed to work awesome but I sadly have to disagree.  Although I do have fair skin this did not help to enhance the color I was going to get from the tanning bed at all.  I actually think I would have been better off using no lotion at all.  It didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin at all either and now my body is super dry.  I def wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Amazing lotion will see with one use!</li>
            <li> works great. adds a little extra tan</li>
            <li> It works well, but the smell is not so great.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion. I&#x27;m a guy and I love to tan. The smell in the bottle is so different from the smell of it on your body! It smells just like mens cologne. I don&#x27;t think it was three shades darker but it got me DARK. Don&#x27;t make me look orange or streaky and don&#x27;t turn my hands orange. Amazing product.</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s really hard to review this lotion as a lotion because the smell is just so bad.  At first it&#x27;s bad, but tolerable.  Kinda musky, maybe a little manly.  After tanning, omg I wanted to vomit just smelling myself.  Get something that smells nice..and I am def. Not 3 shades darker, just about 3 times more smelly.</li>
            <li> The lotion is okay I&#x27;ve gotten darker on different lotions. The smell of the lotion is kinda strong and like perfume.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tanning lotion I have ever purchased! Definately instant results! Will recommend it to all my fellow tanners!</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping, received within 2 days!  Bottle was packaged appropriately and was in tact (no spills, cracks, leaks, etc.).  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am a pale white girl (irish,english) it normally takes me a long time to develop a tan but using my other lotions i have worked my way up to 20 minutes, I used white 2 black for the 1st time today and i have gotten way darker in just a matter of hours!! i am not as dark as I want to be yet but its my 1st time and the smell is great kinda masculine but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad after you tan</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this regularly but it didn&#x27;t look hilariously fake like some bronzers do. Scent was masculine but the sweet kind - reminiscent of axe, clean smelling and no plastic-y burned aftersmell.  I used the whole bottle but will move on.</li>
            <li> So, I just came from my first session with this lotion. I&#x27;m not three shades darker like the bottle advertises, but I am happy with my results. I&#x27;m sure I will tan much faster now with this lotion than the cheap one I had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion does go on pretty smooth, and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. There was strong odor before, other than a nice clean scent. I do agree that it is similar to a department store cologne, but its not strong. There wasn&#x27;t an ATO either, until I came home and put on a little Aveeno moisturizer.  Though my Aveeno claims to be unscented, if mixed with the tanning lotion, it does give a slight unpleasant odor. I plan on getting an after tan lotion, so I&#x27;m not too concerned about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the bed, I think there is a slight tingle, but its not too bad. Definitely happy with this product and will be using it again.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this for buying a different lotion &amp; was excited to try it.The smell was good as of it was unisex cologne, that is until the smell changed with the heat of the bulbs. Then the smell was like that of cleaning solution. The texture was nice, Not Greasy but the CLAIM of 3 shades Darker was NOT the case at all! If fact, I saw NO change in my color and I Appeared to be in serious NEED of moisture After my tanning session was finished. VERY SAD to make a claim that has NO backup! I&#x27;ll stick with my other lotion Thank You!</li>
            <li> Made me tan really fast and usually i cant really tan even in a bed.</li>
            <li> Tried a sample pack of this at my local tanning salon. Liked it so much had to purchase the full size bottle. This gives you great color quickly. I am fair skin and tend to be red alot when tanning but this turns my tan into a natural brown/bronze. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I liked the color I got from using this lotion. Im by no means a beginner and have a nice base tan, but I&#x27;ve only used this lotion once and noticed an improvement. Natural brown color. I actually really liked the smell, Im a woman, but Im sick of smelling like a coconut every time I tan. Like I said, very pretty natural brown tan. This is a very nice lotion. Also, shipped VERY fast! Definitely buying again.</li>
            <li> I like the way it smells but it didnt do anything for me. I have a dark complextion so maybe it works on fair skin...idk</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite lotions. Makes you so dark, doesn&#x27;t really make u 3 shades darker after one session, but use it for about a week to two weeks straight &amp; you are about 3 shades darker. I looooove it. The smell really isn&#x27;t my favorite, but have also smelled worse, but I mean I use it to tan to get darker, not to smell good, so it&#x27;s totally worth it,.. I will probably always keep this lotion in my rotation, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews I was kinda skeptical to try this. I tried it yesterday and saw instant results right after I got out of the tanning bed. I work at a tanning salon and have used some of the most expensive lotions and this is by far the best one I have tried so far. I am a huge perfume girl and have at least 50 bottles of different ones and this lotion smelt good to me. It is kinda strong but it just smells like a cologne. The lotion is always very silky feeling when you put it on which I love! Just make sure you put a sticker on when using this product so you can actually see how good it works : )</li>
            <li> This lotion does wondersssss. I was more than pleased with this product. I am white, and without tanning, i am very white. I bought this lotion, and within 4 times at the tanning bed, I had the skin tone of a mexican/mixed person. Very, very pretty skin tone. I personally thought it smelled good too. It is wonderful! You&#x27;ll miss out if you don&#x27;t try it. Definitely not a waste of money! :)</li>
            <li> It was strange how much darker I got after a couple hours! I was nervous cuz it was new to me and so inexpensive on here but I was sooo wrong this lotion was awsome and I will be buyin it again!!! Obsidian (by designer skin) is my favorite!! ($120.00) in tanning salon but white 2 black is almost better!!!</li>
            <li> After reading all reviews I decided to buy it anyways, the price is right. This tanning lotion will get you darker..if you can get it out of the bottle. I seriously would jump on it with one hand and all my body weight and put the other hand close to the opening to catch what was coming out.Thank god those doors are locked because I&#x27;m sure I looked rediculous, everytime! Needles to say I bought another lotion. I will probably use this once in awhile to change it up, but the smell is not the greatest. With a bronzing agent you want to keep tanning lotion on for 24 hours, but you can&#x27;t be around anyone smelling like this. For the price... Try it yourself.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I&#x27;ve used in the past &amp; when I needed lotion, I remembered this one. I like how it applies evenly. I like how it does not leave any marks or streaks and I love the shipping, it came a day later!! Happy Tanning !! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> True. So very very very true. This product has a citrus smell that I am not fond of, however, I am ver fair skinned and got a really noticeable tan in just on trip to the salon. In three trips I reached my summer color. Be sure to wash your hands after you tan, or the bronzer gets gunked up in between your fingers and gives you extra color in a strange place.</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of great things about this tanning lotion. I saw the price for this item was much less here than at the tanning salon . I decided to give it a try and WOW you can def. see a difference with first use. IDK that I would use it if I didn&#x27;t already have a base tan . The scent is different, not bad but not great. I can not really describe it but if I could change anything about the lotion it would be the scent. Other than that it is great , it does what it says and you notice the  first time. The shipping on this item was impressive. It was not scheduled to be delivered until Tuesday but it arrived on Saturday along with other items I had ordered.</li>
            <li> It works good at tinting your skin, while you are wearing it but wears off as soon as you shower (no matter how long you wait), but does give you a slight orange tint, also smells kind of like men&#x27;s deodorant. I will stick to my Snooki lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a really great lotion. The price is great too! Shipping was really fast. It doesn&#x27;t stain your hands and the smell isn&#x27;t too bad. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> one of my new favorite brands i love the smell i dont mind smelling like this at all its awesome</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT STINK. Before buying this all the reviews I read said that this lotion had an unpleasant smell. That&#x27;s NOT true. Although it doesn&#x27;t smell like fruit or flowers it still smells good. It goes on evenly and doesn&#x27;t make you feel gross and disgusting after tanning. I have such a hard time tanning, with very very fair skin I noticed after my first tan I was a tad tanner. Then after continuing to tan i got darker each time. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion. It works quickly and doesnt smell too bad. I am fair skinned and with this lotion was able to achieve a dark, lasting tan.</li>
            <li> smells great, works greatt, great shipment, fast shipment. RECOMMEND too allll (:&lt;br /&gt;you really will get a fantastic tan &amp; it is a wonderful price !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;much love from Flint MI</li>
            <li> It smells odd, not over powering, but kind of something that I&#x27;d expect an older person to enjoy. It is somewhat watery and makes you orange. This reminded me of the cheap hawaiian tropic bronzers.&lt;br /&gt; I gave it 2 stars instead of one because it does get you super dark almost instantly, and the smell isn&#x27;t bad, but I don&#x27;t like how the &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; washes almost completely off, and I&#x27;m not so sure it provides much benefit compared to other bronzers when tanning. For the price, I would not recommend. HD man is much better.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff not crazy about the smell but I can definitely tell a big difference when I use it definitely keep ordering this product</li>
            <li> I read many reviews on this product.  I like it for the most part.  The smell is fine, it does darken you but it doesn&#x27;t last unless used daily.  Or so my experience has been.  Also had noticed some &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34; spots on my skin.  Most likely my fault for not thoroughly rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I don&#x27;t tan all year round, as i give my skin a break.  When I was tanning for a wedding i was in, i was using another product that works really well.  The girl at the salon suggested i try this product.  I came out and didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.  Two hours later man was i dark. I was really impressed. LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Good price.  Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> Great item and super fast</li>
            <li> Ive been tanning for almost 3 years now, mostly during the summer time but lately Ive been going in the winter time as well. I was looking for a lotion that gives me a fast, long lasting color specially now in the winter i only tan once or maybe twice a week that&#x27;s it ( I&#x27;m not trying to look super tan in the winter time just a hint of color) so being that said, i was on the hunt for a lotion that gives me color without me having to go to the tanning salon everyday.  I&#x27;ve tried many different lotions some as expensive as  80 bucks some as cheap as 15 bucks by far this is the one that gets me the darkest. I&#x27;ve read some of the reviews about the smell, if ure looking for a fruity smell this is NOT your kind of lotion it has more of a fresh minty whatever the opposite of fruity may be. One thing i really like about this lotion is that is DOES NOT leave my palms all orangy and it leaves a really pretty long lasting color. I would def. recomment this lotion is my second bottle already and i&#x27;m sure ill keep using it. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> great lotion not much of a brozing as i like but still a good lotion that why i only gave it 4 stars</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product, it&#x27;s not really sweet, kind of a natural scent.&lt;br /&gt;Also like everyone else I was skeptical of the claim that it makes you three shades darker in one session.&lt;br /&gt;I got out of the tanning bed and could immediately tell a difference. People also noticed at work the next day that I was a lot darker. I&#x27;m not sure if it was the lotion or the bed but I did feel a lot more hot than normal while in the bed. But other than that AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I was white and it did it&#x27;s job! It made me shades darker after one use</li>
            <li> The lotion got here on time and it seemed to work ok, i didn&#x27;t get super dark which is good</li>
            <li> Really great lotion! I really did look a lot tanner after I used it. Make sure you have a good base tan first.</li>
            <li> Smells weird, especially after tanning. Makes you smell like a sweaty old man.&lt;br /&gt;Really hard to get out of the &amp;#34;bottle&amp;#34; (or whatever you call this square-shaped container). I feel a like there should have been more product in there...&lt;br /&gt;Could not tell too much of a difference after 1-3 uses. (I have fair skin, so take that as you will.)&lt;br /&gt;Nice to try, but I gave it away. Will not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Product was recieved on time and in good condition though. Yayy for efficiency</li>
            <li> What can I say??? The marketing of the package got me.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells great in the bottle, goes on so smooth and thin, very easy to apply and soaks in quickly. No greasy feel at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But-the quality, or lack of, kicks in.&lt;br /&gt;It smells horrible, just like the WalMart and dollar general self-tanners I used to use 15 years ago in high school. It turns your skin and palms the horrible, stereotypical ORANGE stained color of all cheaper self tanners.&lt;br /&gt;I was so disappointed, but then again, it was on &amp;#34;sale&amp;#34; really cheap, so I got what I paid for. I used it one time about 3 weeks ago and it&#x27;s collecting dust on my dresser now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I also ordered in the same shipment some Australian Gold Sinfully Black 15x Deep Dark Bronzing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I really LOVE it. It works so well, and its a true bronze/brown color - but it&#x27;s not too dark or fake looking at all. You could even apply this on days you do not tan. Yes it wears off like all bronzers do as your stained skin sheds, but a quick rubdown in the shower with baking soda will get it all off so that you can start with a new application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just really disappointed at how poor quality the Devoted Creations product was. Live &amp; learn I guess  :)</li>
            <li> Not as promised in the write up, does not ehance my tan at all.  I would stick to the off the self walmart brand next time.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this lotion.. though I do agree with many of the other reviews; It does cater more towards men. It smells more like a male cologne, but I do like it. There isn&#x27;t an \\&quot;after-tanning\\&quot; smell like I get with a lot of other lotions. But overall I recommend this because you do get really dark if you already have a base tan going.</li>
            <li> I really liked this tanning lotion. I would buy again this year. It does not have the tingle feeling some of the others do.</li>
            <li> I needed something that would give me some color fast, and this really did the job! I&#x27;m running low and ordering a second bottle now.</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion I have ever used! It smells delicious and it really darkens your skin. I tan fairly okay, but after about 3 times I got really dark. Highly recommend it over any tanning lotion you would buy at Walmart or Sally&#x27;s. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and I love it, I do not recommend this for you if your paler and do not have a base tan yet because it can tend to look streaky. I never have this problem when I have a base tan though.</li>
            <li> Does this work during outside tanning? I&#x27;ve noticed a slightly different change but idk I think it&#x27;s just my mind. Someone please let me know!</li>
            <li> Smells more like a cologne than perfume, but I prefer that.  Not sure if it enhances the tanning bed experience, but it does provide a nice self tanner.  No streaks, no orange, but not a deep color.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. It doesn&#x27;t stink like some bronzers. It really seems to moisturize my skin and it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy or sticky.  It also does a nice job making me subtly darker without being too drastic or unnatural looking. I took one star away because this is the third bottle I have purchased (only one from Amazon) and the top on every one of them broke within a couple of months. This didn&#x27;t affect the use of the product, however since the part that broke is just the outer covering for the top (the black part) it was still perfectly useable.</li>
            <li> Really good lotion. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the smell.  Like a mans cologne and the after smell is not flattering</li>
            <li> Gives you a darker tan in one session. I don&#x27;t know about &#x27;3 shades&#x27;. It did leave me a with a bit of an orange cast on the first day. But that went away.</li>
            <li> The product worked well and had a pleasant smell. No tingle, but the accelerator did speed up bronzing. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Did not work as good as it said it would.</li>
            <li> Delivered to my house before the date it was suppose to. Works great, I&#x27;ve had this lotion before I bought it at my tanning salon for $50... This lotion is identical.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning in a tanning bed getting ready to go to the Islands and this stuff really has turned me a nice lovely bronze I would reccomend this to anyone looking for a beautiful tan</li>
            <li> I have no doubt this is a decent lotion. I&amp;#34;m simply not to thrilled about the scent or the way the lotion feels when applied. Will not reorder.</li>
            <li> I like the lotion white 2 black for the most part just have to make sure it&#x27;s rubbed in cause if tha bronzers was surprised by that cause its a white lotiom</li>
            <li> I just think this is false advertising. I&#x27;m very familiar with devoted creations lotions and I usually LOVE there products but this one...not so much. I&#x27;m usually I big tingle fan but because it said 3 shades darker in one session I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. Well I had zero results in that one session! I&#x27;ve had a few products that truly did change my color in one session, without it saying so in the description! So for this one to say it and not do it made me sad. I still love DC, just not this lotion, I&#x27;ll stick to my tingle/bronzers.</li>
            <li> I think it is interesting that so many people critique the smell. I happened to LOVE it, but then I love the smell of tanning lotion:) It DOES tend to wash off if you shower after tanning with it; however, anyone who knows anything about tanning lotions will instruct you NOT to shower for at least 4 hours after tanning especially if you are using a bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;I have never tanned before in my life the way that I am tanned now since I have been using this lotion. I recommend it to anyone and everyone!!</li>
            <li> Laid in the tanning bed for about 13 minutes with this and put a sticker on and I was a COMPLETELY different color. This stuff works wonders if you wanna tan good with one visit!!!</li>
            <li> It did make me darker but in a orange kinda way. Also it smells like a man. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I give White 2 Black only the two star rating because of these things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It smells disgusting, at least to me. I realize some people like the manly cologne scent, but it is strong and I can&#x27;t stand it. I am a female, so that probably impacts my opinion a lot. It also leaves a STRONG after tan odor on me. It smells gross and does not cover the typical tanning smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It does NOT give the &amp;#34;3 shades darker in 1 session&amp;#34; bronzing effects that it promises. I tried it for a good while before writing this review, to give it a fair chance, but it definitely made very little to no difference in my tanning experience. Maybe I got some junk lotion or something? I don&#x27;t know, but it does NOT have good bronzing, though it does have the DHA and smell that goes along with that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It is a difficult bottle to use, since it is a hard plastic, square shape. This gets tricky when you have slippery lotion hands, and just isn&#x27;t very user friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It is a thin lotion, so it feels like you have to use a lot to cover yourself well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience was NOT what I expected based on reviews and the general high quality of DC products. Like I said before, maybe I got some junk by buying online, but I am not happy with this lotion. I still have a lot left and am no longer using it, I bought a different one that is worlds better that I will also be reviewing! (Almost Famous by AG)</li>
            <li> I think this is a decent lotion. I do not think I turned 3 shades darker in one tanning session, but it made me somewhat darker. There was enough of a change to notice a difference. The smell isn&#x27;t the best, but its do-able. I would recommend going home after use.</li>
            <li> Ive tried several different lotions, and they all leave streaks and a bad smell, but not white 2 black! It smells very beachy and doesnt leave your skin smelling burnt like other lotions. It also goes on creamy and even so it wont leave streaks! I love this product, and I wont buy any other tanning lotion</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and liked it.  This was a great price when compared to what the salon asks.  Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The only lotion I will use. I bought some about a year ago and I liked it then my wife used some and she loves it so I ordered a few more bottles.</li>
            <li> Love to use this lotion when I tan. Helps to tan faster and look like you have been outside tanning in the sun!</li>
            <li> Just the name of it got me excited. Unlike other reviews, I don&#x27;t think the smell is to bad... just smells like you&#x27;ve been tanning and not fruity like other lotions. I was hoping this lotion would take my tan plateau to another level, but it didn&#x27;t and it wasn&#x27;t overly moisturizing either. The lotion wasn&#x27;t bad but it wasn&#x27;t anything special either. (I am an easy tanner that gets really dark and seldom burns) This lotion might work good for those who don&#x27;t tan as dark as I do, but if you have the easy to tan but hits a plateau easily as well, this won&#x27;t be the lotion to take it to a darker level. Much better lotions out there for a better price.</li>
            <li> I like this tanning lotion.  Have used several times, but tanning bed is in need of a timer at this time.  Will purchase for in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I received it on time and purchased it at an awesome price!! It gives what it promises.</li>
            <li> the product that i ordered was for a woman friend.. she says that the product is exceptionally good. i can say the product works very well. wow!!!</li>
            <li> I am an obsessed tanner just about. I LOVE white to black, it truly works great!! I recommend it all the time! So inwas so happy when infound it this cheap! HOWEVER this seller is NOT selling the right kind! Whatever is in this lotion, is not the real thing. It&#x27;s like the seller left this product outside &amp; the bronzer is gone. You can not trust buying lotion online it can carry many bactrias.. I used this sellers lotion for 3 weeks before anything started showing then i bought the one from my salon and it showed after my 2nd visit. I DO NOT SUGGEST THIS SELLER</li>
            <li> AMAZING great bronzer..works fast and lasts really long</li>
            <li> this tanning lotion works but leaves a horrid after smell. i would recommend it, as long as you are coming right back home to shower.</li>
            <li> Wife had high hopes for this product, after hearing so many good things about it.  After weeks of use, in tanning bed and sun tanning, she is somewhat disappointed with the product. Doesn&#x27;t seem to supply enough color as she would like, and expected.  After all, with a name like &amp;#34;White 2 Black&amp;#34;, wouldn&#x27;t you expect darker results?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One plus was that the product did have a great smell, wasn&#x27;t potent and chemically like some other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would probably skip this product next time!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion and am almost finished with the bottle. After about 3 tans with this I constantly had people ask me if I have been tanning. It gives me great color. I don&#x27;t tan well in natural sun, but this gives a great tan. The only thing is it does have that \\&quot;after tan smell.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I am always super thorough whenever I am buying something online for the first time. I spent hours searching for a lotion, and ended up buying this one. I really have loved the lotion. I have the dark olive mediteranean skin, its the skin that normally tans and tans, but over winter I need some salon bed time so I don&#x27;t look like an awkward and pale ghost. After using the product, I feel clean, the lotion isn&#x27;t heavy, and blends in very nice. People always take a second to look at me, and then mention how tan I look. After each time I go, people always comment on it! I think it always helps me achieve my natural color, versus a fake overdone tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Smell: Several people have made comments on the smell of this. It does have a citrusy scent, and not fruity or feminine at all. Many people have complained about it, but I actually really enjoyed it. It was a lemongrass-ish scent that made me feel clean after a session. Instead of coated in some thick lotion that heavy smelled in order to make up for the DHA smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really enjoyed this lotion. What prevented me from giving it 5 stars, is it was a tad watery. I always felt like I had to use quite a bit to cover my entire body, which was annoying. I also HATE THE BOTTLE!!!!! I am down to my last few drops and the awkward square shape prevents me from using every drop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Bottom line: Great bronzer, not overdone, but definetly enhanced my color after. Smell was different from others, but fresh, not horrible. Skin felt good after using, not dried out, or suffocating. Bottle shape design sucks, could be ever so slightly thicker.</li>
            <li> This worked well, I think my only problem with it is the smell. It&#x27;s not horrible just not to my liking.</li>
            <li> This lotion might work for people just starting out, but not people who already are tan or have a good base tan.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with my purchase I&#x27;ve used this lotion before and this lotion is not the same lotion I&#x27;ve used before In my own personal opinion the lotion in the bottle I received is not the same lotion! I think my bottle was filled with somethkng else</li>
            <li> Smell could be better; but does give me a great color.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a sample with another lotion I purchased. Yes you go three shades darker in one session because there is sunless tanner in it. I was unaware of this when I used the lotion so I have some streaks on my arms. Now knowing this I would use this product again but I would be sure to make sure it was all evenly rubbed in.</li>
            <li> This lotion had a somewhat masculine smell, so I wasn&#x27;t sure at first. After my first or second time I was trying to see if I noticed a difference since I thought I looked darker at first. I finally realized it all washes off in the shower. Acceptable if you want to be tanner for a night but it won&#x27;t keep you that shade. Some people may like it but it just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I am a very very pale skinned, blue eyed hispanic, it is VERY hard to me to find something that works and won&#x27;t burn my skin. After getting a base tan with Smile lotion, I switched to White 2 Black...best thing i have ever done! This is the second spring I have done this. I personally think it smells great, however it does leave a \\&quot;tan smell\\&quot; afterwards...in which i normally shower after tanning anyway. I did in fact get 3 shades darker after the first use. I would recommend getting a base tan before using this due to the bronzers in it, it may make you turn orange if you start using it with a pale skin.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package the product was not sealed and it had leaked out all in the lid. I am not pleased at all. I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I do not recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> This product has a developer (which helps your tan develop better), moisturizer so your skin stays incredibily soft (some call it liquid botox and it really does help reduce those fine lines around your eyes and the dreaded 11&#x27;s) and a bronzer to give your skin instant color. I&#x27;ve been a member at a tanning salon for a few years. There are tanning lotions for up to $100. Don&#x27;t ever by your lotions at the salon! There is a 50% upcharge on all lotions becasue the sales clerks make a % off the sale.  This lotion is typically $50-65 a bottle at the salon, but I can buy it online for $18. I haven&#x27;t found a better lotion than this, with all the wonderful high end ingredients, especially at the low price. I do however recommend you alternate lotions every quarter, so that the elasitisty of your skin doesn&#x27;t get used to the product and you get a different color tone. Just ask your local tanning salon what they recommend and buy it online. Don&#x27;t feel guilty about it. The salon makes plenty of money off your membership fees each month, even if you don&#x27;t go.</li>
