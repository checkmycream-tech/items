            <li>Vaseline brand name at a very good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the price here is good if you get free shipping, although I must admit that you can buy it on sale and stash it away because it lasts for almost forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>price you get on this pack here is better than anything I have seen at any kind of store.</li>
            <li>Wow this stuff is great!</li>
            <li>Great after a nice hot bath or shower.</li>
            <li>The price is really great for 3 large tubs..</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s many uses</li>
            <li>when I woke up they were nice, smooth, and supple.</li>
            <li>they are still healthy</li>
            <li>There are so many uses for petroleum jelly that it boggles the mind.  </li>
            <li>People use it for many, many reasons.</li>
            <li>The top is now a hinge and the curved design of the plastic container makes it easier to use.  </li>
            <li>The iphone of vasoline :)</li>
            <li>What greater endorsement can a product receive.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a moisturizer (for any part of the body from your feet to your lips and more).</li>
            <li>and my heals feel and look so much better.</li>
            <li>made it even better.  </li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>If you really go through it this is a great deal.</li>
            <li>I love the attached lid.</li>
            <li>Tip - Sharpie the top of the Vaseline as \\&quot;baby\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I love petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li>And most everyone likes it.</li>
            <li>Vaseline&#x27;s excellent health, household and field applications are too numerous to put in this review.</li>
            <li>Nothing to say except that this brand its always a safe and sure choice to make.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Great finds, really.</li>
            <li>have read on many running sites that petroleum jelly when applied liberally can provided protection from chaffing during running and cycling.</li>
            <li>So glad they ship to APO :-)</li>
            <li>guess its ok of</li>
            <li>I love to use this product on toasted</li>
            <li>We use this product alot and will buy more when needed.  </li>
            <li>I love how the lids just flip up...</li>
            <li>but I will say that the prices found on Amazon are great and thats the main reason I buy here.</li>
            <li>FOR WAS PRETTY GOOD.</li>
            <li>Wonderful for dry skin.</li>
            <li>But hey, works fine for me since I purchased another product with this one to receive the free shipping!</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry hands in the winter....!</li>
            <li>Great for keeping our son&#x27;s skin soft.</li>
            <li>Good value for that much product.</li>
            <li>This allows for easy spread around the body.</li>
            <li>here very quickly</li>
            <li>The product itself is fine.  </li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re all fine and dandy.</li>
            <li>3 of them are more than 1 kilogram, I&#x27;ll be lucky if I can finish one in a year.</li>
            <li>even though a dab will do, i use a lot of dab&#x27;s very frequent, good for lubrication, protection,etc.</li>
            <li>It can be successfully applied in areas that no other starship has gone before and it works.  </li>
            <li>My grandma stocks a huge supply of vaseline and usees it for everything.</li>
            <li>Oh man these are so huge.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t, you shouldn&#x27;t even be thinking about this huge pack.&lt;br</li>
            <li>an emergency I have used it to remove rings that were stuck on my finger, stop squeaks in my car door, mixed with bacon bits it makes a great bait for mouse traps, removing chewing gum from hair</li>
            <li>(don&#x27;t ask how that happened), and lightly applied with a Q-Tip to the outer portion of the ear canal to halt itching and</li>
            <li>It is a great value to get 3 of these at 1 low price.</li>
            <li>These are the giant family sized jar so a great buy.</li>
            <li>Bought primarily for my baby.  </li>
            <li>AND AFTER A WEEK HER FEET WHERE SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>when amazon has them in stock, they&#x27;re as cheap as $9 for 3 pack.</li>
            <li>, there was a good dollar or more difference) for the simple convenience of a flip-top.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for the perfect gentle but effective night cream, and I thought I might as well give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Vaseline is one of the great perks of modern living, particularly if you have psoroasis.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended it for many years especially to new moms for the prevention of diaper rash.  </li>
            <li>this is the perfect item for a single guy + 30% off retail price, no tax, fast shipping..........</li>
            <li>So worth it for the price!</li>
            <li>think most are aware of the benefits of vaseline</li>
            <li>We couldn&#x27;t find the original formula anywhere around here</li>
            <li>Great for layering over moisturizer for extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This is great when your hands are really dry.</li>
            <li>great for dry hands or lips.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin</li>
            <li>I surfed the net for a good bargain on this product and nothing stood out</li>
            <li>The product is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Not too many real complaints when it comes to this.</li>
            <li>It is not known for sure what causes the skin sensitivity when using Neosporin, but many doctors and medical researchers believe it is the analgesic pramoxine (a pain</li>
            <li>I thing I wish it has is can being absorb quickly to skin or stay on a layer even I rub it away.</li>
            <li>This is a quick and affordable way to protect the nipples.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it does for wrinkles, but I&#x27;ve heard good things from people who have used the product long</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and is effective in relieving my dry skin conditions.  </li>
            <li>Vaseline is suitable for coating the heel, elbow, knee, too much moisture, and full of a large pot, very affordable!</li>
            <li>Economical in bulk.</li>
            <li>it is an old time favorite.</li>
            <li>This can happen immediately or over time if you have sensitive skin and use Neosporin repeatedly (every day for more than a 7-14 days</li>
            <li>/&gt;Probably not as useful if you don&#x27;t use a LOT of petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li>The easy open, easy close lid was a nice touch, though, better than the usual lids.</li>
            <li>that’s right</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Vaseline, all right.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin soft and super smooth.  </li>
            <li>If you need more, add more, a little at a time.</li>
            <li>After 30+ years of using Vaseline only to remove make up, I discovered it&#x27;s good for many other things.</li>
            <li>Def pure!</li>
            <li>It serves my purpose, works great, no touching my food, and not expensive at all.  </li>
            <li>First aid kit at a bargain basement price.  </li>
            <li>Keep with your first aid products.  </li>
            <li>Vaseline is much better some generic brand.  </li>
            <li>One of these jars is probably going to last me over a year or more, so</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s severe you can gob it on, cover the area with a bandage or cloth, and the next day it will feel so much better and will show signs of healing.</li>
            <li>For those who feel it&#x27;s too thick, try Aquaphor* (great price at Amazon too).</li>
            <li>Product exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>So much Vaseline!  </li>
            <li>This is the Real Deal Vaseline in containers that will store it and keep it fresh indefinitely.</li>
            <li>The consistency of all three jars are much softer, meaning when they are in contact with body temperature they melt!</li>
            <li>Exactly what we needed</li>
            <li>I tried several other products, but this one is, by far, the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Particularly suitable for fall and winter dry skin.</li>
            <li>I think a better deal for real vaseline than the generic version at the drugstore</li>
            <li>This will definitely be my first choice when I&#x27;m ready to re-order.</li>
            <li>Great savings too if you tend to get dry skin (or dry anything for that matter).</li>
            <li>Very good for my dry skin, smell is a little bit,,,,,</li>
            <li>Even my manicurist mentions that my skin is super soft.</li>
            <li>The jar opening is big so that you can easily get the Vaseline out.</li>
            <li>but they were rather large and easy to open.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for rough, dry, cracked heals; I gob it on and then put on cotton socks before bedtime.</li>
            <li>Jar seals nice and tight so no leaks or unwanted spillage.</li>
            <li>As long as you keep the wound clean and covered, and it&#x27;s not already infected, you don&#x27;t need anti-bacterial ointment after the first application of anti-bacterial ointment or alcohol (or what ever you first used to disinfect the wound).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using them for something like this and find yourself in high demand for vaseline, these are the way to go!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say much about vaseline because we all know what it is and what it may be used for, but this helped with my son&#x27;s severe eczema.</li>
            <li>One application lasts forever, and amount/jar is very cost</li>
            <li>Now we have so much vaseline</li>
            <li>Really works for all your needs.</li>
            <li>I tell you, three for under ten bucks (with free delivery) is unbeatable..</li>
            <li>Packaged very well.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really know the difference.</li>
            <li>Using this every time we change a diaper has really helped prevent diaper rash</li>
            <li>Far better than going to Wal-mart and purchasing them individually.</li>
            <li>And again, if there is no infection and the wound is kept clean, I have been told by numerous doctors that you do not need an antibacterial ointment.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;dirty and clean at the same time</li>
            <li>I use vaseline everyday as a barrier for my dry skin and it works great.</li>
            <li>I really like the new add on program.</li>
            <li>Most of my runs are less than one hour and most bike rides are less than two hours.</li>
            <li>I use tons of Vasoline for personal reasons, the bigger the jar the better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion:  I still like it, particularly as a mask after I&#x27;ve steamed my face, but it&#x27;s not going to be for everyone.</li>
            <li>Simple but essential, Vaseline  has so many uses.  </li>
            <li>Having it this (cute) smaller size is a total convenience in regards to portability.</li>
            <li>Skin moisturizer, first aide, treatment for eczema, lubricant for many, many things, art work, skin protection in cold weather while hiking and the list goes on.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for both product and price..</li>
            <li>Bought this here because of the price and 100% pure and natural with no additive and odors.  </li>
            <li>n rashes for my 6 month old baby!!</li>
            <li>It is specially too good for cold weather.</li>
            <li>and now I won&#x27;t have to panic for a few more years.  </li>
            <li>When he would occasionally get a rash we would Desitin and it would clear up extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin in winter and use it on my face and hands as a night cream sometimes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough for use on a daily basis too.  </li>
            <li>you know you have sensitive skin or need to use an antibacterial ointment for more than a few days</li>
            <li>It does seem to even out my skin and make it very, very soft.  </li>
            <li>It is difficult to find a product that is used in so many homes for so many different things.  </li>
            <li>, first... this stuff has not encouraged hair to grow all over my face (as I&#x27;d initially feared).  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>so this is moch bigger and more long lasting</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m willing to pay a little extra (ok, a lot extra</li>
            <li>Pesky ants that bypass sprays and barriers such as diatomaceous-earth are repelled by Vaseline 100% Pure Petroleum Jelly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as I know people have been using it for years</li>
            <li>We use it on our 10-month old for moisturizing skin and chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a problem unless I apply directly under/on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>/&gt;IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE WITH SENSITIVE SKIN:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some people with sensitive skin can be allergic to or develop an allergy to some of the ingredients in Neosporin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and so as my daughter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a 2 year old and an 8 month old.</li>
            <li>and I have baby soft skin.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>our old ones did not do that</li>
            <li>I use it on my twin boys&#x27; bums instead of diaper cream; the one has particularly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>, anyone can open a Vaseline bottle in the store or anywhere else and put anything they want in there, where it can go right into your open wound ... or on your baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>i seen her use it on scrapes, cuts, burns ,to smooth out her feet ,to tame her eyebrows literally everything you could imagine and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seriously NOT a fan of facial</li>
            <li>Keeping the skin clean and using plain Vaseline is just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as using it as a moisturizer on other parts of the body; at first I was hesitant, because it seemed so greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I expected -- a couple of tubs of Vaseline.  </li>
            <li>No surprises, nothing new; bought this just to replenish my prior stock.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And before you start having naughty thoughts, I should probably get right to</li>
            <li>All I know is, if I ever need vaseline, I have enough for my whole entire body and then some.</li>
            <li>you know you have sensitive skin, or allergies to Lanolin or wool products, you may want to avoid using Aquaphor or consult a medical professional for their opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my opinion no other product matches what this one does which is why I have continued using it.</li>
            <li>I sweat on parts of my face, which makes a kind of slick mess that gets on my pillows, etc.</li>
            <li>It will be good to add a little water to the cream or keep your body a little wet before applying the cream.</li>
            <li>And, an allergy to Lanolin can be developed over time if you have sensitive skin and use Lanoline products very often or use them and do not allow your skin to breathe (covered with bandages or tight clothes).&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The same high standard one has come to expect from Vaseline.  </li>
            <li>Aside from all the generally known uses of Vaseline 100% Pure Petroleum Jelly, I use it on a daily basis to make an impenetrable circle around the outside of water and food bowls for outside animals.</li>
            <li>Some people with sensitive skin can actually be allergic too Lanolin.</li>
            <li>I received the product fast with the only different is not the same brand.</li>
            <li>My dad 88 years old uses it to paint yellow plastic plates and places them on stakes in his vegetable garden.  </li>
            <li>I use this for all kinds of things, I live in the desert and have dry skin.so I use it for that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I also have to remind anyone reading this that although the information I stated regarding allergies and sensitivities was given to me by dermatologists, GPs, and surgeons, I am not a medical professional and I cannot give you medical advice.</li>

            <li>If you have any questions or concerns about any of the products mentioned above, or if you develop what you think might be an allergic reaction or infection, please see your medical professional immediately.</li>
            <li>When I wrote to Vaseline expressing my concern I received the typical computer-generated form letter response, promising a reply soon.</li>
            <li>few weeks ago I noticed that my jar of Vaseline was getting pretty low</li>
            <li>But they both do the same job as far as I can see so far, and Vaseline is half the price.</li>
            <li>) Is considered unscented but has a distinct (if light) Petrol/Gas smell -- I find it a little disturbing at times.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;the price here is good if you get free shipping, although I must admit that you can buy it on sale and stash it away because it lasts for almost forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> price you get on this pack here is better than anything I have seen at any kind of store.</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff is great!</li>

            <li> There are so many uses for petroleum jelly that it boggles the mind.  </li>
            <li> People use it for many, many reasons.</li>
            <li> The top is now a hinge and the curved design of the plastic container makes it easier to use.  </li>

            <li> What greater endorsement can a product receive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a moisturizer (for any part of the body from your feet to your lips and more).</li>
            <li> and my heals feel and look so much better.</li>
            <li> made it even better.  </li>
            <li> What more can I say?</li>
            <li> If you really go through it this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> I love the attached lid.</li>

            <li> I love petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> And most everyone likes it.</li>
            <li> Vaseline&#x27;s excellent health, household and field applications are too numerous to put in this review.</li>
            <li> Nothing to say except that this brand its always a safe and sure choice to make.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Great finds, really.</li>
            <li> have read on many running sites that petroleum jelly when applied liberally can provided protection from chaffing during running and cycling.</li>
            <li> So glad they ship to APO :-)</li>
            <li> guess its ok of</li>
            <li> I love to use this product on toasted</li>
            <li> We use this product alot and will buy more when needed.  </li>
            <li> I love how the lids just flip up...</li>
            <li> but I will say that the prices found on Amazon are great and thats the main reason I buy here.</li>
            <li> FOR WAS PRETTY GOOD.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for dry skin.</li>
            <li> But hey, works fine for me since I purchased another product with this one to receive the free shipping!</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry hands in the winter....!</li>
            <li> Great for keeping our son&#x27;s skin soft.</li>
            <li> Good value for that much product.</li>
            <li> This allows for easy spread around the body.</li>
            <li> here very quickly</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine.  </li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re all fine and dandy.</li>
            <li> 3 of them are more than 1 kilogram, I&#x27;ll be lucky if I can finish one in a year.</li>
            <li> even though a dab will do, i use a lot of dab&#x27;s very frequent, good for lubrication, protection,etc.</li>
            <li> It can be successfully applied in areas that no other starship has gone before and it works.  </li>
            <li> My grandma stocks a huge supply of vaseline and usees it for everything.</li>
            <li> Oh man these are so huge.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, you shouldn&#x27;t even be thinking about this huge pack.&lt;br</li>
            <li> an emergency I have used it to remove rings that were stuck on my finger, stop squeaks in my car door, mixed with bacon bits it makes a great bait for mouse traps, removing chewing gum from hair</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t ask how that happened), and lightly applied with a Q-Tip to the outer portion of the ear canal to halt itching and</li>
            <li> It is a great value to get 3 of these at 1 low price.</li>
            <li> These are the giant family sized jar so a great buy.</li>
            <li> Bought primarily for my baby.  </li>
            <li> AND AFTER A WEEK HER FEET WHERE SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> when amazon has them in stock, they&#x27;re as cheap as $9 for 3 pack.</li>
            <li> , there was a good dollar or more difference) for the simple convenience of a flip-top.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for the perfect gentle but effective night cream, and I thought I might as well give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Vaseline is one of the great perks of modern living, particularly if you have psoroasis.  </li>
            <li> I have recommended it for many years especially to new moms for the prevention of diaper rash.  </li>
            <li> this is the perfect item for a single guy + 30% off retail price, no tax, fast shipping..........</li>
            <li> So worth it for the price!</li>
            <li> think most are aware of the benefits of vaseline</li>
            <li> We couldn&#x27;t find the original formula anywhere around here</li>
            <li> Great for layering over moisturizer for extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This is great when your hands are really dry.</li>
            <li> great for dry hands or lips.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin</li>
            <li> I surfed the net for a good bargain on this product and nothing stood out</li>
            <li> The product is nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Not too many real complaints when it comes to this.</li>
            <li> It is not known for sure what causes the skin sensitivity when using Neosporin, but many doctors and medical researchers believe it is the analgesic pramoxine (a pain</li>
            <li> I thing I wish it has is can being absorb quickly to skin or stay on a layer even I rub it away.</li>
            <li> This is a quick and affordable way to protect the nipples.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it does for wrinkles, but I&#x27;ve heard good things from people who have used the product long</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and is effective in relieving my dry skin conditions.  </li>
            <li> Vaseline is suitable for coating the heel, elbow, knee, too much moisture, and full of a large pot, very affordable!</li>
            <li> Economical in bulk.</li>
            <li> it is an old time favorite.</li>
            <li> This can happen immediately or over time if you have sensitive skin and use Neosporin repeatedly (every day for more than a 7-14 days</li>
            <li> /&gt;Probably not as useful if you don&#x27;t use a LOT of petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> The easy open, easy close lid was a nice touch, though, better than the usual lids.</li>
            <li> that’s right</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Vaseline, all right.</li>
            <li> It has made my skin soft and super smooth.  </li>
            <li> If you need more, add more, a little at a time.</li>
            <li> After 30+ years of using Vaseline only to remove make up, I discovered it&#x27;s good for many other things.</li>
            <li> Def pure!</li>
            <li> It serves my purpose, works great, no touching my food, and not expensive at all.  </li>
            <li> First aid kit at a bargain basement price.  </li>
            <li> Keep with your first aid products.  </li>
            <li> Vaseline is much better some generic brand.  </li>
            <li> One of these jars is probably going to last me over a year or more, so</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s severe you can gob it on, cover the area with a bandage or cloth, and the next day it will feel so much better and will show signs of healing.</li>
            <li> For those who feel it&#x27;s too thick, try Aquaphor* (great price at Amazon too).</li>
            <li> Product exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> So much Vaseline!  </li>
            <li> This is the Real Deal Vaseline in containers that will store it and keep it fresh indefinitely.</li>
            <li> The consistency of all three jars are much softer, meaning when they are in contact with body temperature they melt!</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed</li>
            <li> I tried several other products, but this one is, by far, the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Particularly suitable for fall and winter dry skin.</li>
            <li> I think a better deal for real vaseline than the generic version at the drugstore</li>
            <li> This will definitely be my first choice when I&#x27;m ready to re-order.</li>
            <li> Great savings too if you tend to get dry skin (or dry anything for that matter).</li>
            <li> Very good for my dry skin, smell is a little bit,,,,,</li>
            <li> Even my manicurist mentions that my skin is super soft.</li>
            <li> The jar opening is big so that you can easily get the Vaseline out.</li>
            <li> but they were rather large and easy to open.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for rough, dry, cracked heals; I gob it on and then put on cotton socks before bedtime.</li>
            <li> Jar seals nice and tight so no leaks or unwanted spillage.</li>
            <li> As long as you keep the wound clean and covered, and it&#x27;s not already infected, you don&#x27;t need anti-bacterial ointment after the first application of anti-bacterial ointment or alcohol (or what ever you first used to disinfect the wound).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using them for something like this and find yourself in high demand for vaseline, these are the way to go!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say much about vaseline because we all know what it is and what it may be used for, but this helped with my son&#x27;s severe eczema.</li>
            <li> One application lasts forever, and amount/jar is very cost</li>
            <li> Now we have so much vaseline</li>
            <li> Really works for all your needs.</li>
            <li> I tell you, three for under ten bucks (with free delivery) is unbeatable..</li>
            <li> Packaged very well.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really know the difference.</li>
            <li> Using this every time we change a diaper has really helped prevent diaper rash</li>
            <li> Far better than going to Wal-mart and purchasing them individually.</li>
            <li> And again, if there is no infection and the wound is kept clean, I have been told by numerous doctors that you do not need an antibacterial ointment.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;dirty and clean at the same time</li>
            <li> I use vaseline everyday as a barrier for my dry skin and it works great.</li>
            <li> I really like the new add on program.</li>
            <li> Most of my runs are less than one hour and most bike rides are less than two hours.</li>
            <li> I use tons of Vasoline for personal reasons, the bigger the jar the better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion:  I still like it, particularly as a mask after I&#x27;ve steamed my face, but it&#x27;s not going to be for everyone.</li>
            <li> Simple but essential, Vaseline  has so many uses.  </li>
            <li> Having it this (cute) smaller size is a total convenience in regards to portability.</li>
            <li> Skin moisturizer, first aide, treatment for eczema, lubricant for many, many things, art work, skin protection in cold weather while hiking and the list goes on.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for both product and price..</li>
            <li> Bought this here because of the price and 100% pure and natural with no additive and odors.  </li>
            <li> n rashes for my 6 month old baby!!</li>
            <li> It is specially too good for cold weather.</li>
            <li> and now I won&#x27;t have to panic for a few more years.  </li>
            <li> When he would occasionally get a rash we would Desitin and it would clear up extremely quickly.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin in winter and use it on my face and hands as a night cream sometimes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough for use on a daily basis too.  </li>
            <li> you know you have sensitive skin or need to use an antibacterial ointment for more than a few days</li>
            <li> It does seem to even out my skin and make it very, very soft.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to find a product that is used in so many homes for so many different things.  </li>
            <li> , first... this stuff has not encouraged hair to grow all over my face (as I&#x27;d initially feared).  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> so this is moch bigger and more long lasting</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m willing to pay a little extra (ok, a lot extra</li>
            <li> Pesky ants that bypass sprays and barriers such as diatomaceous-earth are repelled by Vaseline 100% Pure Petroleum Jelly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as I know people have been using it for years</li>
            <li> We use it on our 10-month old for moisturizing skin and chapped lips.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a problem unless I apply directly under/on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> /&gt;IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE WITH SENSITIVE SKIN:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some people with sensitive skin can be allergic to or develop an allergy to some of the ingredients in Neosporin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and so as my daughter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a 2 year old and an 8 month old.</li>
            <li> and I have baby soft skin.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> our old ones did not do that</li>
            <li> I use it on my twin boys&#x27; bums instead of diaper cream; the one has particularly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> , anyone can open a Vaseline bottle in the store or anywhere else and put anything they want in there, where it can go right into your open wound ... or on your baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> i seen her use it on scrapes, cuts, burns ,to smooth out her feet ,to tame her eyebrows literally everything you could imagine and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously NOT a fan of facial</li>
            <li> Keeping the skin clean and using plain Vaseline is just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as using it as a moisturizer on other parts of the body; at first I was hesitant, because it seemed so greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected -- a couple of tubs of Vaseline.  </li>
            <li> No surprises, nothing new; bought this just to replenish my prior stock.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And before you start having naughty thoughts, I should probably get right to</li>
            <li> All I know is, if I ever need vaseline, I have enough for my whole entire body and then some.</li>
            <li> you know you have sensitive skin, or allergies to Lanolin or wool products, you may want to avoid using Aquaphor or consult a medical professional for their opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my opinion no other product matches what this one does which is why I have continued using it.</li>
            <li> I sweat on parts of my face, which makes a kind of slick mess that gets on my pillows, etc.</li>
            <li> It will be good to add a little water to the cream or keep your body a little wet before applying the cream.</li>
            <li> And, an allergy to Lanolin can be developed over time if you have sensitive skin and use Lanoline products very often or use them and do not allow your skin to breathe (covered with bandages or tight clothes).&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The same high standard one has come to expect from Vaseline.  </li>
            <li> Aside from all the generally known uses of Vaseline 100% Pure Petroleum Jelly, I use it on a daily basis to make an impenetrable circle around the outside of water and food bowls for outside animals.</li>
            <li> Some people with sensitive skin can actually be allergic too Lanolin.</li>
            <li> I received the product fast with the only different is not the same brand.</li>
            <li> My dad 88 years old uses it to paint yellow plastic plates and places them on stakes in his vegetable garden.  </li>
            <li> I use this for all kinds of things, I live in the desert and have dry skin.so I use it for that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I also have to remind anyone reading this that although the information I stated regarding allergies and sensitivities was given to me by dermatologists, GPs, and surgeons, I am not a medical professional and I cannot give you medical advice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I also have to remind anyone reading this that although the information I stated regarding allergies and sensitivities was given to me by dermatologists, GPs, and surgeons, I am not a medical professional and I cannot give you medical advice.</li>
            <li> If you have any questions or concerns about any of the products mentioned above, or if you develop what you think might be an allergic reaction or infection, please see your medical professional immediately.</li>
            <li> When I wrote to Vaseline expressing my concern I received the typical computer-generated form letter response, promising a reply soon.</li>
            <li> few weeks ago I noticed that my jar of Vaseline was getting pretty low</li>
            <li> But they both do the same job as far as I can see so far, and Vaseline is half the price.</li>
            <li> ) Is considered unscented but has a distinct (if light) Petrol/Gas smell -- I find it a little disturbing at times.  </li>
            <li> If you have any questions or concerns about any of the products mentioned above, or if you develop what you think might be an allergic reaction or infection, please see your medical professional immediately.ch as rash, hives, itching, pain, burning, cracking, redness, peeling or other skin irritations.</li>
            <li> Since it is recommended by doctors to apply to an open wound after minor surgery, especially if there are stitches, it is considered a medicine.</li>
            <li> I recently competed in a triathlon, which led to some extreme chaffing of my nipples creating nipple fissures...which by the way if bad enough can bleed and most certainly produces pussing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it on several occassions now and thus far it&#x27;s worked well on runs or bike rides less than two hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming that means that they won&#x27;t be very durable, which is unfortunate since they are quite large</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no big deal if using for just dry skin and will stay on, but sometimes I have to use it on gums of teeth recommended by my dentist and overtime it</li>
            <li> Regular use keeps psoriasis/dermatitis symptoms (dry, cracked, red, raw skin) in check much better than the expensive prescription creams.</li>
            <li> and I will probably be using them for a long time.</li>
            <li> I use it to coat my toes before long walks to prevent blisters and it has worked well for the purpose.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> On said family cruise, the one I mentioned early as a failed attempt to make me forget that four short years earlier the closest girl to me&#x27;s life would so drastically end when a garbage truck rolled a stop sign and skidded right into her roadside, semi-gourmet Mexican food truck, I brought a small travel size of Vaseline to prevent chapped lips.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Allergic reactions to Lanolin or Neosporin can appear as symptoms on the skin such as rash, hives, itching, pain, burning, cracking, redness, peeling or other skin irritations.</li>
            <li> we currently live in Europe and you can only buy it behind the counter, 4 euro for a tiny tube.</li>
            <li> I USE IT FOR THE DRY SKIN ON MY MOTHER</li>
            <li> We use it every single day on baby diapers in lieu of diaper rash cream and they have never had a rash.</li>
            <li> I have very  dry skin on arms and legs, and this vaseline petroleum jelly helps with preventing dry, chapped skin.</li>
            <li> and this keeps it from getting dry and rough.</li>
            <li> I prefer to pay a little extra and buy a brand I&#x27;ve known and trusted since I was a child - Vaseline.</li>
            <li> Little extra at bed time.  </li>
            <li> The standard lubricating oil is too messy and drip all over and can get on the food while slicing.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s mixed with lanolin and other ingredients that make it a little thinner and smoother.</li>
            <li> That is why I am giving three start, I will keep and use the other petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> And I wouldn&#x27;t trust any other brand than Vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got this to stock up on some vaseline for our baby that is due any day now.  </li>
            <li> You can get this stuff for a buck at the doller store or any other drug store.........</li>
            <li> All these things are made for each other.</li>
            <li> Neosporin Ointment is made of three active ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with a lot things lately: dyslexia, identity theft, a family vacation with my dead fianc&amp;eacute;e&#x27;s family who gave me a sympathy cruise to forget the 4th anniversary of death, and early onset diabetes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wary of trying Vaseline on my skin ever since I read that Marilyn Monroe used the stuff, and it gave her a very fuzzy chin.  </li>
            <li> The only thing though is that my entire family thought I was taking crazy pills ordering 3 of these with the excuse that it was on sale.</li>
            <li> Less insecticide on his vegetables.</li>
            <li> We have tried every thing else with little to no success.</li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> Just a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> And, of course, the gypsy moth caterpillars were not happy to cross the black plastic bag rings on our oak trees the year I slathered them with a layer of Vaseline.</li>
            <li> A little heads up: jar has the size of a BOWL, not like average cosmetic container, or what you usually see in drugstore/walmart.</li>
            <li> That being said, petroleum jelly is seriously messy stuff.</li>
            <li> , you probably should not use Neosporin, but instead use plain Bacitracin.</li>
            <li> I put some on my hands before I went to bed because they were starting to crack and dry out from the cold.</li>
            <li> But I found that if you put on a thin layer and give it a few minutes to dry, it&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> We would fold a tissue in half then rip it in half to use to swipe some out of the jar and then apply it to his behind.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so hard to find it in Brazil - my mom has to send some over every few months.</li>
            <li> We would put some on his little behind at every diaper change to keep rash incidents down.</li>
            <li> As per my dermatologist and other doctors it can be used on cuts, scraps, and burns, even after getting a tattoo or after laser tattoo removal (and other laser procedures) in place of expensive anti-bacterial ointments (like Bacitracin or Neosporin).</li>
            <li> I used to have the small jars</li>
            <li> However the packaging that is used is not very good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only thing I find weird is the extremely long box Amazon.com sent it in...</li>
            <li> at least this hasn&#x27;t changed in a hundred years</li>
            <li> Even after today (it was a bone chilling day with a negative windchill)</li>
            <li> The secret?  </li>
            <li> This is NOT some offbeat &amp;#34;petroleum jelly&amp;#34; that quickly loses its consistency and protectiveness.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really go wrong with Vaseline</li>
            <li> YOU COULD NEVER GO WRONG WITH VASELINE AND FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li> No one can every go wrong with vaseline.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am crazy.</li>
            <li> Does not absorb like lotion, so it gets sticky, and is very difficult to wash off.  </li>
            <li> I got 3 of these bad boys</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>

    <ol>
            <li> First aid kit at a bargain basement price.  Keep with your first aid products.  Google it&#x27;s many uses</li>
            <li> Ordered these to use on my baby&#x27;s bum and they came in 2 days!! If you&#x27;re using them for something like this and find yourself in high demand for vaseline, these are the way to go! price-matched them at target and wal-mart and it is definitely cheaper to order online.</li>
            <li> very nice, as advertised</li>
            <li> Aside from all the generally known uses of Vaseline 100% Pure Petroleum Jelly, I use it on a daily basis to make an impenetrable circle around the outside of water and food bowls for outside animals. Pesky ants that bypass sprays and barriers such as diatomaceous-earth are repelled by Vaseline 100% Pure Petroleum Jelly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember salt circles for witches, petroleum jelly circles for ants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002SVW2QY Safest 100% Food-Grade Diatomaceous Earth :: Non-Toxic DE - 2 Gal]]</li>
            <li> This is my life saver! I have super dry skin in winter and use it on my face and hands as a night cream sometimes.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find a product that is used in so many homes for so many different things.  Skin moisturizer, first aide, treatment for eczema, lubricant for many, many things, art work, skin protection in cold weather while hiking and the list goes on.  I even use this on the wire holding my hummingbird feeders as it keep the ants out of the feeders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an emergency I have used it to remove rings that were stuck on my finger, stop squeaks in my car door, mixed with bacon bits it makes a great bait for mouse traps, removing chewing gum from hair (don&#x27;t ask how that happened), and lightly applied with a Q-Tip to the outer portion of the ear canal to halt itching and flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot imagine running a household without this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the price here is good if you get free shipping, although I must admit that you can buy it on sale and stash it away because it lasts for almost forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noted in a recent article that there was some concern in some of the European countries that this stuff might be toxic.  Who knows?  As far as I know people have been using it for years and I have  yet to read an obit that said cause of death was via Vaseline.  I suppose everything you touch, smell, eat, drink or in some cases, even look at, is toxic to some extent or in some way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the stuff and will just take my chances...its not like I am slathering it on my Big Macs or anything like that.</li>
            <li> I use tons of Vasoline for personal reasons, the bigger the jar the better.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say much about vaseline because we all know what it is and what it may be used for, but this helped with my son&#x27;s severe eczema. This along with Hydrolatum and Jojoba (?) oil.</li>
            <li> My grandma stocks a huge supply of vaseline and usees it for everything. i seen her use it on scrapes, cuts, burns ,to smooth out her feet ,to tame her eyebrows literally everything you could imagine and probably some things i dont want to imagine either LMAO! good thing to keep in your house..............just in case.</li>
            <li> The same high standard one has come to expect from Vaseline.  It goes on easily and is effective in relieving my dry skin conditions.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great for layering over moisturizer for extremely dry skin.  Rated low toxicity level on the Skin  Deep website. Economical in bulk.</li>
            <li> Nice packing. I was expecting the containers to be smaller but they were rather large and easy to open. It is a great value to get 3 of these at 1 low price. Far better than going to Wal-mart and purchasing them individually. The product is great too. I put some on my hands before I went to bed because they were starting to crack and dry out from the cold. when I woke up they were nice, smooth, and supple. Even after today (it was a bone chilling day with a negative windchill) they are still healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I find weird is the extremely long box Amazon.com sent it in... But hey, works fine for me since I purchased another product with this one to receive the free shipping! xD</li>
            <li> I like this. it is an old time favorite.</li>
            <li> Vaseline is much better some generic brand.  this is the perfect item for a single guy + 30% off retail price, no tax, fast shipping..........enuff said</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine.  However the packaging that is used is not very good. On arrival 2/3 of the tubs had lids that were either shattered or cracked.  I&#x27;m assuming that means that they won&#x27;t be very durable, which is unfortunate since they are quite large and I will probably be using them for a long time.</li>
            <li> There are so many uses for petroleum jelly that it boggles the mind.  For health care, we have always stayed with the name brand of Vaseline.  My babies&#x27; bums were protected with it,(the non-fragrant type) and it has been a mainstay for keeping our skin moist and healing chafed areas for 50+ years. People use it for many, many reasons. I have even used it to smear on a bird feeder baffle so that the squirrels would slide off before they could raid it. And, of course, the gypsy moth caterpillars were not happy to cross the black plastic bag rings on our oak trees the year I slathered them with a layer of Vaseline. It has been a trusted product over the years.</li>
            <li> There is a simple reason, make that two, that I will not buy Vaseline Brand Petroleum Jelly again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Since it is recommended by doctors to apply to an open wound after minor surgery, especially if there are stitches, it is considered a medicine. Vaseline has stopped using safety seals under their caps, yes that’s right, anyone can open a Vaseline bottle in the store or anywhere else and put anything they want in there, where it can go right into your open wound ... or on your baby&#x27;s skin. To save a fraction of one penny Vaseline is putting the health of millions of people at risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. When I wrote to Vaseline expressing my concern I received the typical computer-generated form letter response, promising a reply soon. That was over TWO months ago and instead Vaseline just chose to ignore me, hoping I would go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t go away, Vaseline … I wrote this fair, honest and truthful review. It’s what you deserve for compromising the health of your customers and then trying to sweep it under the carpet.</li>
            <li> Good price for this versatile and trusted product.</li>
            <li> A big tub of Vaseline....what else can you say?  Nice to have when the wind chill is in the negatives for the cheeks and hands.</li>
            <li> The best!  I&#x27;ve been using this since my baby has been born.  It&#x27;s light enough for use on a daily basis too.  We use it on our 10-month old for moisturizing skin and chapped lips.  It was a 3-pack STEAL from Amazon.  I was expecting the medium-sized bottles, but 3 GIGANTIC bottles of these arrived on my doorstep.  They&#x27;re huge and a great value here!!</li>
            <li> The top is now a hinge and the curved design of the plastic container makes it easier to use.  Top notch design, excellent product, very attractively priced by Amazon. Kudos to the desiger.  The iphone of vasoline :)</li>
            <li> My youthful ingredient, thank you.</li>
            <li> Honestly, how can you **** up Vaseline? You can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s just Vaseline lmao. I got 3 of these bad boys and they&#x27;re all fine and dandy. The only thing though is that my entire family thought I was taking crazy pills ordering 3 of these with the excuse that it was on sale. Maybe I am crazy. Or maybe I&#x27;m not. All I know is, if I ever need vaseline, I have enough for my whole entire body and then some. We&#x27;ll see who&#x27;s laughing then when the army of slugs take over this planet, and I am fully-immersed in my disguise as one of them as I spread the vaseline all over my naked body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wary of trying Vaseline on my skin ever since I read that Marilyn Monroe used the stuff, and it gave her a very fuzzy chin.  I&#x27;m seriously NOT a fan of facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for the perfect gentle but effective night cream, and I thought I might as well give it a try.  I have a great groupon for laser hair removal coming up anyway, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, first... this stuff has not encouraged hair to grow all over my face (as I&#x27;d initially feared).  It has made my skin soft and super smooth.  No pimples, no blackheads or whiteheads.  Just a warning though, the tubs sold on Amazon are just that--huge TUBS.  One of these jars is probably going to last me over a year or more, so I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do with three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, having used Vaseline basically like an overnight face mask for a couple weeks now, here are my conclusions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;1) It does seem to even out my skin and make it very, very soft.  I don&#x27;t know what it does for wrinkles, but I&#x27;ve heard good things from people who have used the product long term.&lt;br /&gt;2) Still no facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;3) My makeup lays smoother on my face in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;4) One application lasts forever, and amount/jar is very cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;5) Makes a GREAT eye make up remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD:&lt;br /&gt;1) Does not absorb like lotion, so it gets sticky, and is very difficult to wash off.  I feel like it leaves a sort of permanent film on my face all the time.&lt;br /&gt;2) Is considered unscented but has a distinct (if light) Petrol/Gas smell -- I find it a little disturbing at times.  It&#x27;s not a problem unless I apply directly under/on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;3) I sweat on parts of my face, which makes a kind of slick mess that gets on my pillows, etc. if i&#x27;m not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  I still like it, particularly as a mask after I&#x27;ve steamed my face, but it&#x27;s not going to be for everyone.</li>
            <li> Vaseline is one of the great perks of modern living, particularly if you have psoroasis.  It can be successfully applied in areas that no other starship has gone before and it works.  What greater endorsement can a product receive.  You are the best of one of a kind.</li>
            <li> I think a better deal for real vaseline than the generic version at the drugstore</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really go wrong with Vaseline - it&#x27;s so good for everything (chapped lips, diaper changes, etc.) So worth it for the price!</li>
            <li> These are the giant family sized jar so a great buy. I use it to coat my toes before long walks to prevent blisters and it has worked well for the purpose. That being said, petroleum jelly is seriously messy stuff.</li>
            <li> My mother&#x27;s in her 70&#x27;s.  She&#x27;s been using Vaseline for decades.  She looks much younger than her peers.  The secret?  Apply Vaseline to the level of obscene all over your face and neck at night.  Place a towel on your pillow to prevent your pillow from being saturated with Vaseline.</li>
            <li> After 30+ years of using Vaseline only to remove make up, I discovered it&#x27;s good for many other things. It&#x27;s a moisturizer (for any part of the body from your feet to your lips and more). As per my dermatologist and other doctors it can be used on cuts, scraps, and burns, even after getting a tattoo or after laser tattoo removal (and other laser procedures) in place of expensive anti-bacterial ointments (like Bacitracin or Neosporin). As long as you keep the wound clean and covered, and it&#x27;s not already infected, you don&#x27;t need anti-bacterial ointment after the first application of anti-bacterial ointment or alcohol (or what ever you first used to disinfect the wound). It also relieves symptoms of psoriasis/dermatitis. If it&#x27;s severe you can gob it on, cover the area with a bandage or cloth, and the next day it will feel so much better and will show signs of healing. Regular use keeps psoriasis/dermatitis symptoms (dry, cracked, red, raw skin) in check much better than the expensive prescription creams. It&#x27;s also great for rough, dry, cracked heals; I gob it on and then put on cotton socks before bedtime. One or two nights of that and my heals feel and look so much better. As far as using it as a moisturizer on other parts of the body; at first I was hesitant, because it seemed so greasy. But I found that if you put on a thin layer and give it a few minutes to dry, it&#x27;s not greasy at all. If you need more, add more, a little at a time. For those who feel it&#x27;s too thick, try Aquaphor* (great price at Amazon too). Works just as well and does all the same things but it&#x27;s mixed with lanolin and other ingredients that make it a little thinner and smoother. But they both do the same job as far as I can see so far, and Vaseline is half the price. I keep them both on hand. I believe every household should keep a jar of Vaseline on hand for any number of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people prefer to buy cheaper petroleum jelly, a generic brand. I use to do that until I read articles that talked about the impurities you can be getting in no-name brands. I prefer to pay a little extra and buy a brand I&#x27;ve known and trusted since I was a child - Vaseline. I get it here at Amazon using Subscribe &amp; Save, which is cheaper than my local CVS, drug store or supermarket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE WITH SENSITIVE SKIN:&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Aquaphor is made with Lanolin, which is derived from wool producing animals. Some people with sensitive skin can actually be allergic too Lanolin. And, an allergy to Lanolin can be developed over time if you have sensitive skin and use Lanoline products very often or use them and do not allow your skin to breathe (covered with bandages or tight clothes).&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Neosporin Ointment is made of three active ingredients. Some people with sensitive skin can be allergic to or develop an allergy to some of the ingredients in Neosporin. This can happen immediately or over time if you have sensitive skin and use Neosporin repeatedly (every day for more than a 7-14 days can be enough to trigger or cause an allergy). Regular use of Neosporin over your lifetime can also eventually lead to an allergy to it. It is not known for sure what causes the skin sensitivity when using Neosporin, but many doctors and medical researchers believe it is the analgesic pramoxine (a pain killer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know you have sensitive skin, or allergies to Lanolin or wool products, you may want to avoid using Aquaphor or consult a medical professional for their opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know you have sensitive skin or need to use an antibacterial ointment for more than a few days, you probably should not use Neosporin, but instead use plain Bacitracin. And again, if there is no infection and the wound is kept clean, I have been told by numerous doctors that you do not need an antibacterial ointment. Keeping the skin clean and using plain Vaseline is just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allergic reactions to Lanolin or Neosporin can appear as symptoms on the skin such as rash, hives, itching, pain, burning, cracking, redness, peeling or other skin irritations. Or allergic reactions can appear as difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue. If you experience any of these while using Aquaphor or Neosporin stop using it immediately and seek medical help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to remind anyone reading this that although the information I stated regarding allergies and sensitivities was given to me by dermatologists, GPs, and surgeons, I am not a medical professional and I cannot give you medical advice.

            <li> I have very  dry skin on arms and legs, and this vaseline petroleum jelly helps with preventing dry, chapped skin.</li>
            <li> I use vaseline everyday as a barrier for my dry skin and it works great. I have eczema and cannot use anything with perfume in it and my dr recommended this. Great after a nice hot bath or shower.</li>
            <li> Just Vaseline but cheaper than the phamacy around my neighborhood</li>
            <li> I received the product fast with the only different is not the same brand. That is why I am giving three start, I will keep and use the other petroleum jelly. It seem same quality as Vaseline Brand. However, I will like them not to mislead people by presenting one product and giving another one.</li>
            <li> A little heads up: jar has the size of a BOWL, not like average cosmetic container, or what you usually see in drugstore/walmart. 3 of them are more than 1 kilogram, I&#x27;ll be lucky if I can finish one in a year.</li>
            <li> Simple but essential, Vaseline  has so many uses.  Bought primarily for my baby.  The price is really great for 3 large tubs.. I really like the new add on program.</li>
            <li> My partner uses this to remove her  eye makeup.  Little did we know when we got this that it was a three pack.  I guess we should have read closer.  Now we have so much vaseline we don&#x27;t know what to use it for.  If you need a ton of Vaseline, go for this!</li>
            <li> I like this type of Vaseline Jar because the lid is attached .  That way I do not misplace the lid.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> The vaseline was great! I used it in my lip balm recipies and they worked perfectly! I used to have the small jars so this is moch bigger and more long lasting and it is a 3 pack! great for the price!</li>
            <li> I use it for a variety of purposes and try to keep a jar nearby just in case I have a use for some. Jar seals nice and tight so no leaks or unwanted spillage.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely the best product for head to toe moisturizing . I have been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> The package is huge! Really works for all your needs.</li>
            <li> Product exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I surfed the net for a good bargain on this product and nothing stood out then I came to amazon and was blown away.. I tell you, three for under ten bucks (with free delivery) is unbeatable.. This will definitely be my first choice when I&#x27;m ready to re-order. Highly recommended for both product and price.. Rapid delivery as the bonus. No damage.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product I would recommend this to everyone . Best skin care for me and my family. a  very effective product</li>
            <li> YOU COULD NEVER GO WRONG WITH VASELINE AND FOR THE PRICE I GOT IT FOR WAS PRETTY GOOD. I USE IT FOR THE DRY SKIN ON MY MOTHER FEET AND AFTER A WEEK HER FEET WHERE SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Arrives on time</li>
            <li> Vaseline is one of the best petroleum jelly in the market. It is specially too good for cold weather. I got cheapest prices on Amazon for a pack of 3 units which is the best value in the net.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have used this product with my skin care problems. I have sensitive skin and so as my daughter. At the peak of winter and summer, our skins would crack; especially in the lips. Petroleum jelly is the best remedy for these problems. And I wouldn&#x27;t trust any other brand than Vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think most are aware of the benefits of vaseline but I will say that the prices found on Amazon are great and thats the main reason I buy here.</li>
            <li> Bought this here because of the price and 100% pure and natural with no additive and odors.  I have a food slicer and use this to lubricate the wheel inside the blade after cleaning it.  It serves my purpose, works great, no touching my food, and not expensive at all.  The standard lubricating oil is too messy and drip all over and can get on the food while slicing.</li>
            <li> Best price I could find. Mix vaseline with dryer lint to create a firestarter.</li>
            <li> I got this to stock up on some vaseline for our baby that is due any day now.  It&#x27;s exactly what I expected -- a couple of tubs of Vaseline.  It was a good price and the Subscribe and Save discount made it even better.  The 3 pack was a good idea because I can have 1 by the diaper changing station, 1 in my diaper bag, and 1 in my husband&#x27;s diaper bag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s vaseline. We use it on everything and now we have three big jars of it in the house. What more can I say? Good deal on Subscribe and Save. We use it every single day on baby diapers in lieu of diaper rash cream and they have never had a rash. I&#x27;ve got a 2 year old and an 8 month old.</li>
            <li> cheap and great quality</li>
            <li> Vaseline is suitable for coating the heel, elbow, knee, too much moisture, and full of a large pot, very affordable! Particularly suitable for fall and winter dry skin.</li>
            <li> when I bought it, I thought that there was only 1 jar (I did not read headline properly though), however, it turned out to be 3 HUGH jars and they all had so very good quality. I use them for my lips and my hands and also my burns. Very satisfied with them :)</li>
            <li> Oh man these are so huge.  I didn&#x27;t realize how big they would be.  They&#x27;re like an 8x8x6 block.  So much Vaseline!  If you really go through it this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> You can get this stuff for a buck at the doller store or any other drug store.........the product  itself is good. I like making lip gloss with it.</li>
            <li> This is great when your hands are really dry.Perfect for dry hands in the winter....!</li>
            <li> Packaged very well. Great price!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never guess what I use Vaseline for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And before you start having naughty thoughts, I should probably get right to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my hair.  That&#x27;s right.  My hair.  I have been using it since waaay back in the day and it works wonderfully well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like after I wash it, I get about a gob about the size of a dime and goop it into my palms and then rub it in.  It gives body and adds a nice shine, as well as good hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago I noticed that my jar of Vaseline was getting pretty low and I almost had a panic attack about it.  So I bought three big jars of the stuff and now I won&#x27;t have to panic for a few more years.  It&#x27;s a great product and I love it!  No Jive!</li>
            <li> Good value for that much product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Rub it on your hands before you go to sleep to keep them soft.&lt;br /&gt;Also great for dry hands or lips.</li>
            <li> I purchased this 3 pack of Vaseline for a great price!  The product is nice and soft. I love the attached lid.</li>
            <li> Peanut butter and jelly. Chips and salsa. Babies and Vaseline. All these things are made for each other. If you have a baby, you&#x27;ll be slapping this on their rump and whatnot for quite some time. Bulk purchase so I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out. I&#x27;ve used all the local retail brands of petroleum jelly, but always return to Vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro Tip - Sharpie the top of the Vaseline as \\&quot;baby\\&quot; so as to not cross contaminate.</li>
            <li> Everyone knows how Vaseline works. Got a great deal. Pack of 3 for $14 buck. How awesome is that???? Purchase this product people.</li>
            <li> I love petroleum jelly. I apply it on my hands and feet every night and I have baby soft skin. Even my manicurist mentions that my skin is super soft. It does feel greasy but I don&#x27;t mind. I apply this on my hand after doing the dishes. I am a doctor and I have to wash my hands mutile times a day and this keeps it from getting dry and rough.</li>
            <li> I think everyone knows vaseline. And most everyone likes it. If you don&#x27;t, you shouldn&#x27;t even be thinking about this huge pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price you get on this pack here is better than anything I have seen at any kind of store.</li>
            <li> This is NOT some offbeat &amp;#34;petroleum jelly&amp;#34; that quickly loses its consistency and protectiveness. This is the Real Deal Vaseline in containers that will store it and keep it fresh indefinitely. Vaseline&#x27;s excellent health, household and field applications are too numerous to put in this review. This will definitely be a needed item WTSHTF.</li>
            <li> Always great always happy</li>
            <li> This was the best deal I&#x27;ve found for Vaseline, the 13.5 oz jars averaged $3.55 per jar including all expenses....WOW!  I did use Amazon&#x27;s shipping and ordered $25 worth to get the best deal since I wasn&#x27;t in a rush to receive it.</li>
            <li> Nothing to say except that this brand its always a safe and sure choice to make. We couldn&#x27;t find the original formula anywhere around here (this is Venezuela) so i got from here. Was a good idea.</li>
            <li> I grew up with Vaseline, and use it constantly on my baby - who has never had a rash!!!  I tried several other products, but this one is, by far, the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  Too bad it&#x27;s so hard to find it in Brazil - my mom has to send some over every few months. Love it!</li>
            <li> I thing I wish it has is can being absorb quickly to skin or stay on a layer even I rub it away.</li>
            <li> This is one product that works 100 percent. My sister and I have used this product for over 30 years and my aunt for over 60 plus years. In my opinion no other product matches what this one does which is why I have continued using it. I have recommended it for many years especially to new moms for the prevention of diaper rash.  Bukeytah</li>
            <li> i was in Arizona, it saved my skin. love it. now i move to florida, use it for my feet sometimes, good items.</li>
            <li> Bought the 13 ounce jars pack of 3. Great finds, really. Great savings too if you tend to get dry skin (or dry anything for that matter).</li>
            <li> Great deal! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I do alot of outdoor/indoor running and cycling. I recently competed in a triathlon, which led to some extreme chaffing of my nipples creating nipple fissures...which by the way if bad enough can bleed and most certainly produces pussing. It takes a week or two to heal nipple fissures, so preventative measures are recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read on many running sites that petroleum jelly when applied liberally can provided protection from chaffing during running and cycling. I&#x27;ve tried it on several occassions now and thus far it&#x27;s worked well on runs or bike rides less than two hours. Most of my runs are less than one hour and most bike rides are less than two hours. This is a quick and affordable way to protect the nipples. I also try to wear moisture wicking materials only as well. IF you don&#x27;t want to resort to nipguards...this may be your best option.</li>
            <li> No additive petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping our son&#x27;s skin soft.</li>
            <li> Vaseline is the only thing that keeps my son&#x27;s eczema in check. We have tried every thing else with little to no success.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Vaseline, all right. No surprises, nothing new; bought this just to replenish my prior stock. Good amount for the price. The easy open, easy close lid was a nice touch, though, better than the usual lids.</li>
            <li> I use this for all kinds of things, I live in the desert and have dry skin.so I use it for that.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin I used this item for years I grow up with this item  in my house hold</li>
            <li> We go through a bit of Vaseline with our baby. At the pharmacy here each jar is about $5... when amazon has them in stock, they&#x27;re as cheap as $9 for 3 pack.</li>
            <li> No one can every go wrong with vaseline. Brought it to use for my son&#x27;s diaper change. It&#x27;s oily but good for the skin given that it protects his butt from his pee and poop. Also, it&#x27;s natural so you never have to worry about the chemical that you are putting on your baby skin. Best of all, it&#x27;s not expensive at all.</li>
            <li> I compared this to the regular vaseline I bought from Target. The consistency of all three jars are much softer, meaning when they are in contact with body temperature they melt! It&#x27;s no big deal if using for just dry skin and will stay on, but sometimes I have to use it on gums of teeth recommended by my dentist and overtime it just seems to melt. Not fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I use the one from Target, it stays on.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really know the difference. They are the same type of jar, except the Target one is smaller of course.</li>
            <li> Item received on time and I see a change with my skin as I use this product. It will be good to add a little water to the cream or keep your body a little wet before applying the cream. This allows for easy spread around the body. Bye bye to ashy skin</li>
            <li> It is what it is.&lt;br /&gt;Great price.&lt;br /&gt;Great amount for that price.&lt;br /&gt;Got here very quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with a lot things lately: dyslexia, identity theft, a family vacation with my dead fianc&amp;eacute;e&#x27;s family who gave me a sympathy cruise to forget the 4th anniversary of death, and early onset diabetes.  However, I never through a health and beauty care product could so drastically change the course of one mans life for the better! On said family cruise, the one I mentioned early as a failed attempt to make me forget that four short years earlier the closest girl to me&#x27;s life would so drastically end when a garbage truck rolled a stop sign and skidded right into her roadside, semi-gourmet Mexican food truck, I brought a small travel size of Vaseline to prevent chapped lips.  But I met an estranged man who dressed well and keep his chest hair perfectly trimmed at 1/4 an inch length and decided: &amp;#34;if I don&#x27;t try now, will I ever?&amp;#34; And let&#x27;s just say-- after that night, I&#x27;ve never had chapped lips ever again! Wow this stuff is great!</li>
            <li> What can you say about petroleum jelly. Vaseline brand name at a very good price and fast shipping. I don&#x27;t know what you may use petroleum jelly for, but some of the uses I have found are water proofing spark plug wires. I have packed the spark plug boots with jelly. Petroleum is a die electric grease.  My dad 88 years old uses it to paint yellow plastic plates and places them on stakes in his vegetable garden.  The yellow draws bugs and the jelly kills them.  Less insecticide on his vegetables.</li>
            <li> Def pure! Helps for eczema itchiness n rashes for my 6 month old baby!! It used to reduce redness ..</li>
            <li> I use this for everything. we currently live in Europe and you can only buy it behind the counter, 4 euro for a tiny tube. So glad they ship to APO :-)</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! Exactly what we needed</li>
            <li> The product is awesome and always keeps my lips moistened, as well as my hands and body. Having it this (cute) smaller size is a total convenience in regards to portability. Not too many real complaints when it comes to this.</li>
            <li> Awesomely gigantic jar of Vaseline. We bought these in multi packs when my son was a baby. We would put some on his little behind at every diaper change to keep rash incidents down. It worked. When he would occasionally get a rash we would Desitin and it would clear up extremely quickly. This never irritated his skin. The jar opening is big so that you can easily get the Vaseline out. We would fold a tissue in half then rip it in half to use to swipe some out of the jar and then apply it to his behind. Just a little goes along way. We did this the entire time he was in regular diapers. Stopped when he went to pull-ups and potty training.</li>
            <li> at least this hasn&#x27;t changed in a hundred years</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t realize how big these containers actually are, we&#x27;re talking wholesale sized. guess its ok of you use a lot of it. otherwise it&#x27;s just vaseline.</li>
            <li> I love to use this product on toasted darkbreads.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on myself and feel&lt;br /&gt;dirty and clean at the same time</li>
            <li> Very good for my dry skin, smell is a little bit,,,,,</li>
            <li> A good price on a great staple product</li>
            <li> I buy in bulk, even though a dab will do, i use a lot of dab&#x27;s very frequent, good for lubrication, protection,etc.</li>
            <li> We use it every day on our baby and it is great. Purchasing this 3 pack is a great value. Using this every time we change a diaper has really helped prevent diaper rash</li>
            <li> We use this product alot and will buy more when needed.  I love how the lids just flip up...our old ones did not do that</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and was as described.</li>
            <li> I was going to get store-brand petroleum jelly, but I compared the two and I&#x27;m willing to pay a little extra (ok, a lot extra, there was a good dollar or more difference) for the simple convenience of a flip-top.  Having conceded I want Vaseline brand, I figured I may as well get it delivered so I don&#x27;t run out.  I use it on my twin boys&#x27; bums instead of diaper cream; the one has particularly sensitive skin.  I just slather some on each time I change them.  Little extra at bed time.  One tub this size lasts me about a month or so, give or take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably not as useful if you don&#x27;t use a LOT of petroleum jelly.</li>
    </ol>
