            <li>I think it&#x27;s even better than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile bar soap.</li>

            <li>This soap lathers well, has a nice order, and can give you that squeaky clean that some soaps do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Without question, my favorite cruelty free soap.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and natural and smells wonderful and does the job of getting you clean!</li>
            <li>I love this soap....great lather....and good for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Lathers easily and does not cause irritation.  </li>
            <li>My all-time favorite - fantastic fresh scent!</li>
            <li>This is, hands down, the best soap we&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>wondered if I could make liquid soap to have at the sink instead of a bar, so I finely grated one bar and melted into 1 gallon of boiling distilled water.  </li>
            <li>It started out great but just didn&#x27;t work out for me in the long term.</li>
            <li>I try to only use natural toiletries brand and for a bar of soap, this is one of the best ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean.</li>
            <li>It leave&#x27;s You Squeaky Clean</li>

            <li>They small good and all, but this stuff makes you feel amazing.</li>
            <li>Love it so much it is now in the laundryroom and shower.</li>
            <li>Made my own liquid Castille soap, I lost my grater, but used a knife and was able to shave nice thin pieces off bar easily.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quick.</li>
            <li>It is an adjustment to go from liquid soap to bar soap, but the difficulty in finding a great head-to-toe cleaner without the chemicals that are harsh on ethnic hair is worth the switch!</li>
            <li>If you use it for hair washing you will probably need a conditioner, but it is great for traveling to cut down on liquids.</li>
            <li>It is very mild and lathers very well.</li>
            <li>thanks for coming thru with this fine product....</li>
            <li>It has a fresh, clean scent; it lathers well; it seems gentle and non-drying.</li>
            <li>I gave this product a 3 star because I really had high hopes of a more thicker product.</li>
            <li>Good old fashioned basic soap.</li>
            <li>And it is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Very gentle.</li>
            <li>Actually, I use that laundry soap to clean cloth diapers and it does fantastic job.</li>
            <li>I used this in the shower tonight for my first time</li>
            <li>I have 2 more bars left</li>
            <li>I tried it on a whim after watching a documentary called Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soapbox.</li>
            <li>I grate one of these bars into hot water to make almost a gallon of liquid Castile soap.</li>
            <li>After doing some research I thought I&#x27;d give Kirk&#x27;s Natural Castile Soap (original) a try.  </li>
            <li>I was a little apprehensive at first, not knowing how well this soap works as a bath soap, but I feel more clean using it than any soap I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s strong enough to wash clothes wtith.</li>
            <li>so much so that I just bought a 12-pack of bars.  </li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I was worried that it might have a coconut smell, which I really don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>In fact it was really watery for a shampoo.</li>
            <li>It lathers up real well with a washcloth.</li>
            <li>it is only a smidgen more natural than Dr.</li>
            <li>It only has five ingredients, is made in the USA, and surprisingly, the shower seems to stay cleaner for longer periods of time than when we had other brands of soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone back the original formula of JR Liggett for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I like it too, feels clean, nothing left on skin</li>
            <li>I use it hand wash or spot clean my white clothes instead of bleach.</li>
            <li>I will continue to be a customer as long as I can find the current price I found, otherwise I&#x27;m going to start making my own soap.</li>
            <li>Not as easy to use as I expected.  </li>
            <li>It washes my makeup off very completely and gently.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no frou frou fragrance and it lasts maybe 20% more than the other natural soap brands.</li>
            <li>Seems to work ok but does not last long!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the future, but I think I will be purchasing it from Walgreens from now on since I can get it for half as much.</li>
            <li>My hair is softer and shinier than even the Liggetts left it, and that was pretty soft.  </li>
            <li>Rich, thick later, but rinses so clean without residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had been searching for a natural bar soap, and I purchased this on the review&#x27;s alone.</li>
            <li>I tried this soap on a whim after trying an all natural shampoo</li>
            <li>I just used an old foaming soap dispenser.  </li>
            <li>And no messy bar at the sink.  </li>
            <li>and I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I have been completely sold on this ....</li>
            <li>That said I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>this seems to be working so far.</li>
            <li>What a difference from my old bar soap.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it as a carpet cleaner, bubble bath, hand soap, laundry soap, and dishwasher detergent.</li>
            <li>It feels very creamy and doesn&#x27;t dry out his beard.</li>
            <li>The smell is clean, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I am only 35 and grew up on bar soap and then in my adult life I have been using shower gels.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m conscious enough to realize how expensive it is and decided to make my own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle smell, so it doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling one way or the other, and has cleared up some long-standing skin conditions.</li>
            <li>Love this soap, very hard to find in stores!</li>
            <li>Lathers up nicely in hard water and leaves my skin clean without feeling dry.</li>

            <li> The smell is clean, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I am only 35 and grew up on bar soap and then in my adult life I have been using shower gels.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m conscious enough to realize how expensive it is and decided to make my own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle smell, so it doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling one way or the other, and has cleared up some long-standing skin conditions.</li>
            <li> Love this soap, very hard to find in stores!</li>
            <li> Lathers up nicely in hard water and leaves my skin clean without feeling dry.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s mild scent and it cleans dirty laundry very well.</li>
            <li> Body odor stays away much longer and that &amp;#34;clean feeling stays a lot longer than with the usual national soaps.  </li>
            <li> My hair used to be coarse and never soft or shiny.</li>
            <li> It lasts long and it&#x27;s simple.</li>
            <li> It does last a fairly long time.</li>
            <li> Always use this soap; is terrific for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not natural.  </li>
            <li> I have been struggling for years with dry flaky skin.  </li>
            <li> I washed my hair with it also and it didn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it lathers as that was driving me crazy with other soaps.</li>
            <li> Not as expected left my skin feeling a little dry did not like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I never use soap that tries my skin.  </li>
            <li> I grate this into fluff for home-made laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t thicken up like I expected it too.</li>
            <li> Gentle, non irritating to my skin,  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is getting harder to find.....</li>
            <li> I would definitely not buy it here though, Vitacost and Walgreens (online) have it for less than half of the price you&#x27;ll pay here.</li>
            <li> I have thrown away all other soaps.  </li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t contain the fragrance that other soaps have.</li>
            <li> The price here is excessive as I purchase mine at the local grocery store for 2 bucks a bar.</li>
            <li> so have to be very careful what I use..  </li>
            <li> other reviewers say that they wash clothes with it - seems like it would be too harsh for skin of it</li>
            <li> At about $6 a bar, it gets a little pricey.  </li>
            <li> I do feel a little residue after showering.</li>
            <li> And it dried my skin</li>
            <li> I am a pretentious shaver and take my shaving seriously, but being a Minnesotan, I decided to spend the last 4 months of this year being a pretentious beardsman.</li>
            <li> It took very little time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying organic soaps for the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much more to say.</li>
            <li> I want to use for laundry soap making, and was hard to shred.  </li>
            <li> If you have hard water you need this soap.</li>
            <li> I thought I would smell a hint of coconut at least.</li>
            <li> Not a great value.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it irritating at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try Dr. Bronner&#x27;s eventually, but it is rather expensive.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but Wmart carries Kirk&#x27;s for $3.28 a 3 pack.    </li>
            <li> Would have given five stars, but the price is crazy.  </li>

            <li> Not as expected left my skin feeling a little dry did not like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> This bar soap lathers up nicely. We also use this to make our all natural homemade laundry soap, works great!</li>
            <li> Works well for making homemade laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> Nice packaging. Great product.</li>
            <li> I have heard nothing but great things about this soap but had no idea what I was in for. I initially got it for washing my beard. I am a pretentious shaver and take my shaving seriously, but being a Minnesotan, I decided to spend the last 4 months of this year being a pretentious beardsman. Using this soap I instantly got creamy pillows of lather as soon as I touched my beard. I was blown away. I decided that I would use it on the rest of my body. It has a smell that I can only explain as &amp;#34;what soap smells like&amp;#34;. I am only 35 and grew up on bar soap and then in my adult life I have been using shower gels. They small good and all, but this stuff makes you feel amazing. I will be buying more in the future, but I think I will be purchasing it from Walgreens from now on since I can get it for half as much.</li>
            <li> Great price and quality to make homemade laundry soap</li>
            <li> I grate it to make homemade laundry soap, love it. Actually, I use that laundry soap to clean cloth diapers and it does fantastic job. If that isn&#x27;t a testament to a good cleaning product then I don&#x27;t know what is!</li>
            <li> Super excited to find the Kirk&#x27;s Brand Castile soap. I had been searching for a natural bar soap, and I purchased this on the review&#x27;s alone. I&#x27;ve never even heard of this brand! It is an adjustment to go from liquid soap to bar soap, but the difficulty in finding a great head-to-toe cleaner without the chemicals that are harsh on ethnic hair is worth the switch! I haven&#x27;t used it in my hair, or my daughter&#x27;s hair yet, but the boys in the house all use it and it works great! I will be purchasing a case soon!</li>
            <li> I have been struggling for years with dry flaky skin.  I tried body washes, moisturizing soap, lotions...you name it!  I tried this soap on a whim after trying an all natural shampoo and I absolutely LOVE it.  My husband was dubious, but he tried it and now he loves it.  I have thrown away all other soaps.  This stuff is just amazing!  Rich, thick later, but rinses so clean without residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wondered if I could make liquid soap to have at the sink instead of a bar, so I finely grated one bar and melted into 1 gallon of boiling distilled water.  I now have a wonderful &amp;#34;foaming&amp;#34; hand soap at the sink.  I just used an old foaming soap dispenser.  Talk about lather!!!  And no messy bar at the sink.  I plan to try to make body wash soon.</li>
            <li> Without question, my favorite cruelty free soap. Has a great smell but not overpowering. And it is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Purchased this at a supermarket for under $2 a bar. I used this in the shower tonight for my first time and I like it so far. The smell is clean, not overwhelming. It lathers nicely and cleans well too. I washed my hair with it also and it didn&#x27;t dry it out. I will continue to be a customer as long as I can find the current price I found, otherwise I&#x27;m going to start making my own soap.</li>
            <li> Works great in my laundry soap</li>
            <li> I use this to make laundry soap, I used to use it to wash my hair and my kids but since they dont sell in in my area, and I have to order it online, I only use it for my clothes now. It rinses clean and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I started using bar shampoo about 18 months ago.  I used JR Liggett almost all of that time.  At about $6 a bar, it gets a little pricey.  After doing some research I thought I&#x27;d give Kirk&#x27;s Natural Castile Soap (original) a try.  After all, it was about a third of the price for a larger bar and the reviews were terrific.  I have been completely sold on this .... so much so that I just bought a 12-pack of bars.  My hair is softer and shinier than even the Liggetts left it, and that was pretty soft.  My hair used to be coarse and never soft or shiny. That all changed with bar shampoos.  I will never ever go back to all the chemicals that go into bottles of shampoo.  Nor will I ever use anything but Kirks.  One bar for body, face, and hair.  How much better could it get!  Sept 1, 2015.  I&#x27;ve gone back the original formula of JR Liggett for my hair.  Kirks is terrific for a body soap but not hair.  I was experiencing build up that I never get with Liggett.  Even apple cider vinegar rinse didn&#x27;t get all the build up off of my hair.  It started out great but just didn&#x27;t work out for me in the long term.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  Body odor stays away much longer and that &amp;#34;clean feeling stays a lot longer than with the usual national soaps.  Maybe that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t contain the fragrance that other soaps have.</li>
            <li> This bar of soap is perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> He liked it so I decided to purchase a bar for myself to try.  I like it too, feels clean, nothing left on skin</li>
            <li> Love this soap, very hard to find in stores!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying organic soaps for the past 10 years. I never use soap that tries my skin.  I saw, &amp;#34;coconut oil quote and thought oh I would like to try this soap. And it dried my skin And it feels crumby. I bought this &amp;#34;natural &amp;#34;soap with the intention that it is made with coconut oil, but sodium cocoate is not coconut oil. If you eat sodium cocoate you will die and if you eat coconut oil you will thrive. This soap has 0% coconut oil, and is made up mostly of sodium CO CO this soap has 0% coconut oil, and is made up mostly of sodium cocoate- that&#x27;s not natural.  That is the difference. This is Misbranded.</li>
            <li> I grate this into fluff for home-made laundry detergent. I like this soap for it&#x27;s mild scent and it cleans dirty laundry very well. I mix one grated bar with one cup Borax and one cup washing soda. I have not noticed a decline in the quality of the wash cylce since using home made and I like making my own supplies, so I&#x27;ve started buying the 3 packs. Good price here as well.</li>
            <li> Love the soap. Would have given five stars, but the price is crazy.  You can get the same size bar at Cracker Barrel for $1.49.</li>
            <li> My all-time favorite - fantastic fresh scent!</li>
            <li> I was worried that it might have a coconut smell, which I really don&#x27;t like.  That said I was pleasantly surprised.  This soap lathers well, has a nice order, and can give you that squeaky clean that some soaps do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite points...the price.</li>
            <li> This is my bar soap staple. I try to only use natural toiletries brand and for a bar of soap, this is one of the best ones I&#x27;ve used. It lasts long and it&#x27;s simple. There&#x27;s no frou frou fragrance and it lasts maybe 20% more than the other natural soap brands. I think it&#x27;s even better than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile bar soap. I am a re-purchaser of this soap.</li>
            <li> This is Castile soap as I remember it from childhood. It has a fresh, clean scent; it lathers well; it seems gentle and non-drying. I use both the bar soap and the liquid. Pricey but very nice. For a Castile soap, Kirk&#x27;s is the best.</li>
            <li> This soap definitely soaped up for what I needed to use it for. It didn&#x27;t thicken up like I expected it too. In fact it was really watery for a shampoo. I have 2 more bars left so I&#x27;ll see if something changes with that. I gave this product a 3 star because I really had high hopes of a more thicker product.</li>
            <li> Used many times before so smooth and good for skin.</li>
            <li> I love this soap....great lather....and good for my sensitive skin.  I recommend this soap to people all the time.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I have ever used. It is very mild and lathers very well. It rinses clean. It washes my makeup off very completely and gently. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Always use this soap; is terrific for dry skin.  we always keep it on hand and will order more as supply diminishes.</li>
            <li> Seems to work ok but does not last long! Only lasts 4-5 showers.  Lathers easily and does not cause irritation.  Ok but will probably not buy again.  Not a great value.  I read other reviewers say that they wash clothes with it - seems like it would be too harsh for skin of it&#x27;s strong enough to wash clothes wtith.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product.  Gentle, non irritating to my skin,  safe even for my grandchildren to use at bath time.</li>
            <li> Very good soup.  I do feel a little residue after showering.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  It is soap and therefore drying to my skin, but I can use it in warm weather.  Smell is not so nice.</li>
            <li> This is great soap - fantastic for washing hair and body. I would not recommend it for shaving, though, as it will irritate the skin if you get razor burn. The price here is excessive as I purchase mine at the local grocery store for 2 bucks a bar. If you use it for hair washing you will probably need a conditioner, but it is great for traveling to cut down on liquids.</li>
            <li> I use it hand wash or spot clean my white clothes instead of bleach. I love this soap.</li>
            <li> Love this! Can&#x27;t believe I never tried it till now.</li>
            <li> Not as easy to use as I expected.  I want to use for laundry soap making, and was hard to shred.  Also, after melting the soap in a solution of water, it hardened again.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap my husband will use.  It feels very creamy and doesn&#x27;t dry out his beard.</li>
            <li> Lathers up nicely in hard water and leaves my skin clean without feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap.  I have literally been using this for over 50 years.  It&#x27;s reasonably priced, make mountains of suds and smells great.  Not overly perfumed which I like.  If you have hard water you need this soap.</li>
            <li> I have copd so have to be very careful what I use..  Bought this to make homemade dishsoap.  Love it so much it is now in the laundryroom and shower.</li>
            <li> great,product...almost,2x,the,cost,than,in,the,store????????</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, the best soap we&#x27;ve ever used. It only has five ingredients, is made in the USA, and surprisingly, the shower seems to stay cleaner for longer periods of time than when we had other brands of soap. It&#x27;s a gentle smell, so it doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling one way or the other, and has cleared up some long-standing skin conditions. I would definitely not buy it here though, Vitacost and Walgreens (online) have it for less than half of the price you&#x27;ll pay here.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I tried it on a whim after watching a documentary called Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soapbox. You should check it out. Since Wmart doesn&#x27;t carry Dr. Bronner&#x27;s I saw they had Kirk&#x27;s Castile soap. I&#x27;ll try Dr. Bronner&#x27;s eventually, but it is rather expensive. I was a little apprehensive at first, not knowing how well this soap works as a bath soap, but I feel more clean using it than any soap I&#x27;ve tried. I didn&#x27;t find it irritating at all. Sorry, but Wmart carries Kirk&#x27;s for $3.28 a 3 pack.    Anyway, back to the soap. It does last a fairly long time. It lathers up real well with a washcloth. My wife described the scent as pesticide, but I don&#x27;t mind it at all. She&#x27;s gotten used to it. I just feel cleaner longer with this soap. There&#x27;s not much more to say.</li>
            <li> It leave&#x27;s You Squeaky Clean</li>
            <li> Using this in lots of things. Shipped quick.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it lathers as that was driving me crazy with other soaps. However, I don&#x27;t like the fact that it smells like nothing. I thought I would smell a hint of coconut at least. I find I want to follow-up with something that has a fragrance.</li>
            <li> Best all natural castile soap &amp;#34;out there&amp;#34;- it is only a smidgen more natural than Dr.Bronner&#x27;s but the price is good!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband he&#x27;s struggled with acne for a while this seems to be working so far.</li>
            <li> Made my own liquid Castille soap, I lost my grater, but used a knife and was able to shave nice thin pieces off bar easily.  It took very little time.</li>
            <li> This soap is safe for all skin types, even babies! It is gentle and natural and smells wonderful and does the job of getting you clean!</li>
            <li> I started with Kirks in 1973 when a friend gave me a bar.  I have used it ever since.  This is perfect for me to use a bath, shampoo and hand washing.&lt;br /&gt;It is getting harder to find.....thanks for coming thru with this fine product....</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful. What a difference from my old bar soap. It lathers well and feels great.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I loved using dr bronners years ago. Now I&#x27;m conscious enough to realize how expensive it is and decided to make my own. I grate one of these bars into hot water to make almost a gallon of liquid Castile soap. I add my doterra essential oils to make it whatever scent I want. So far I&#x27;ve used it as a carpet cleaner, bubble bath, hand soap, laundry soap, and dishwasher detergent. It&#x27;s an incredible cleaner and the most affordable of its kind. I&#x27;ll continue to buy again and again.</li>
            <li> Good old fashioned basic soap. Very gentle.</li>
