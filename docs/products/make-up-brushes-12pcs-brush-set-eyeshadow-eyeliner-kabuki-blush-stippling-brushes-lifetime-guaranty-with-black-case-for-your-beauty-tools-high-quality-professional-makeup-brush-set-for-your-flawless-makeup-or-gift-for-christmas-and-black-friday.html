            <li>Talking about tips on makeup and how to use your makeup brushes, you can find some really great information with videos and professional tips on Mezzeto&#x27;s webpage and FB</li>
            <li>it is compact and makes it easy to store.</li>
            <li>Great set of brushes with super soft feel.  </li>
            <li>There brushes are not tested on animals and are cruelty free.</li>
            <li>Also, there is so much variety in this set, you have contouring brush, foundation brush, blush brush, eye shadow, fanned (highlight) brush, eyeliner brush, eyebrown brush and so many more.</li>
            <li>This set came with a beautiful, elegant black leather case, which is really comfortable to carry these makeup brushes in my handbag.</li>
            <li>They came in a very nice case that snaps closed and looks like a stylish clutch.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so excited</li>

            <li>/&gt;Talking about materials, these brushes are Eco friendly and are made from synthetic fiber, which I like more than natural hair for many reasons.</li>
            <li>This set contains every brush to fit doing makeup effectively on every different parts on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mentioned before, after buying my makeup set, I got the follow-up letter with some useful information and very useful recommendations for makeup brushes maintenance, from Mozzeto right away.</li>
            <li>Cleaning them is also easy but you must not apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I have never had so many choices, but I can already tell that using the right brush for the right thing really makes a big difference in looking more professional.</li>
            <li>the brushes are soft and seem to be good quality (only used a handful of time since just got it..</li>
            <li>All that information is very useful, because I learned some new makeup brushes care tips.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this makeup brush set and for sure</li>
            <li>Clean up is easy and the brush hairs have remained soft ( washed the blush brush twice so far).</li>
            <li>My wife uses several of them on a daily basis and her comment was that they are easy to hold and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I have been using them for a few weeks now and they are very easy to keep clean and have not shed bristles.</li>
            <li>had many makeup brushes with natural hairs and synthetic, very expensive and quite cheap, so I know what to expect, but Mozzeto made really reliable and good working makeup brushes for a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li>The length of the brushes is pretty decent and sits very well in my hands and makes it easier to grip the brushes.</li>
            <li>sum up, I would like to say that for the price you pay, you get really high quality makeup brushes that will serve you right and you will really feel like a highly valued customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The case the brushes come in is very convenient-</li>

            <li>Brushes are really dense and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks Mozzeto</li>
            <li>My blush brush has really made a difference in softening my look and blending my blush upward.</li>
            <li>If you love applying make up then make up brushes are some thing you can not have less of.</li>
            <li>This set contains 12 high quality make up brushes that are in my go-to kit now.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The hair of the brushes are really soft and gentle on the skin and pick up a decent amount of product.</li>
            <li>Every makeup brush has something new to offer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been holding on to my very old luxury brand brushes and never took the time to find something new.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and do not harm the skin.</li>
            <li>I needed a new set of make up brush to replace my old Sephora 5 in 1 brush that they stopped making… but if I would pick the 5 brushes i needed at sephora i would end up with over $50…</li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft and do not fall out during makeup application.  </li>
            <li>Plus the hairs have not fallen out like my old blush brush.</li>
            <li>Multi-function Face Brush, Rouge brush, Angular Blush Brush, three Eyeshadow Brushes, Small Fan Brush, Angled Eyeliner Brush, Lip Brush, Ultra Fine Eyeliner Brush.&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li>I have owned several makeup brushes, some pick of too much of product and some barely pick any.</li>
            <li>you have just helped me score some major points with my wife!</li>
            <li>You can really feel the quality, because after my daily usage and multiple washes, they didn&#x27;t start shading and didn&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
            <li>I have spent a lot of money in the past on makeup brushes from top cosmetic companies, and wish I would have purchased this set earlier-</li>
            <li>I was long overdue to replace my old brushes.</li>

Also, there is so much variety in this set, you have contouring brush, foundation brush, blush brush, eye shadow, fanned (highlight) brush, eyeliner brush, eyebrown brush and so many more. The length of the brushes is pretty decent and sits very well in my hands and makes it easier to grip the brushes. There brushes are not tested on animals and are cruelty free. This is a big deal for me since, I do not tolerate cruelty to animals. It is very easy to clean the brushes. Just wash them with liquid soap or baby shampoo and let them dry. Although cleaning often is not needed. The set contains these brushes:&lt;br /&gt;Rouge brush, Angled blush brush, Flat face brush, lip brush, 3 eyeshadow brushes, eyebrow brush, fanned brush, smudge brush and eyeliner brush. All these come in a nice made leather bag!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would totally recommend these brushes. I received these during a promtion for my honest and unbiased review,</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:d6d12f4ac78231a59ecf941966535c9a]] I want to begin with saying, that I bought these wonderful beautybrush makeup brushes with a big discount, when the seller was making a sale. That was a great price for these high quality brushes, which I got. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so excited about!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that the support and information that this seller delivers to its customers is really perfect! After several follow-up letters, which I got after buying this 12 piece makeup brush set, I decided to spare some time and make a video review on this buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talking about the beautybrush makeup brush set, I have to mention, that they came in an elegant and stylish box. Delivery has been fast as always at Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I mentioned before, after buying my makeup set, I got the follow-up letter with some useful information and very useful recommendations for makeup brushes maintenance, from Mozzeto right away. In total I got four letters from this seller with various recommendations, maintenance and makeup tips. All that information is very useful, because I learned some new makeup brushes care tips. Talking about tips on makeup and how to use your makeup brushes, you can find some really great information with videos and professional tips on Mezzeto&#x27;s webpage and FB page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s time to look what&#x27;s inside the makeup brush set. This set came with a beautiful, elegant black leather case, which is really comfortable to carry these makeup brushes in my handbag. I have to mention, that Mozzeto did a great job assorting all the makeup brushes you need most for your makeup. You could think, why did they put even three Eyeshadow brushes, but these are the ones most often used, so three will do just fine! This set contains every brush to fit doing makeup effectively on every different parts on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talking about materials, these brushes are Eco friendly and are made from synthetic fiber, which I like more than natural hair for many reasons. Brushes are really dense and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had many makeup brushes with natural hairs and synthetic, very expensive and quite cheap, so I know what to expect, but Mozzeto made really reliable and good working makeup brushes for a very reasonable price! You can really feel the quality, because after my daily usage and multiple washes, they didn&#x27;t start shading and didn&#x27;t fall apart. I know that this is also the result of my proper care.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t know how to properly take care after your makeup brushes, Mozzetos follow-up emails will give you some tips how to do that, besides, Mozzeto gives a lifetime guaranty for beautybrush makeup brushes, which is really uncommon and also very great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, I would like to say that for the price you pay, you get really high quality makeup brushes that will serve you right and you will really feel like a highly valued customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this makeup brush set and for sure this seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lina Z.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes. I could not wait to try them out. They come in a very nice case&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are good quality. The brushes are really soft and easy to clean. I would highly recommend this set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free or really cheap for my honest opinion which I have given</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes with super soft feel.  Arrived in a beautiful case.  I have been using them for a few weeks now and they are very easy to keep clean and have not shed bristles.</li>
            <li> If you love applying make up then make up brushes are some thing you can not have less of. Every makeup brush has something new to offer. I like these make up brushes by Mozzato. They come in a  nice pouch which makes it very easy to store and enhances its portability.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 12 brushes-&lt;br /&gt;Flat Multi-function Face Brush, Rouge brush, Angular Blush Brush, three Eyeshadow Brushes, Small Fan Brush, Angled Eyeliner Brush, Lip Brush, Ultra Fine Eyeliner Brush.&lt;br /&gt;Each having its own function makes applying make up very easy. These brushes are eco friendly and made of synthetic material. The bristles are very soft and do not harm the skin. Cleaning them is also easy but you must not apply too much pressure. I was lucky to receive this for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> These brushes are beautiful and so soft! They came in a very nice case that snaps closed and looks like a stylish clutch. There is quite the variety of brushes which are perfect for all my makeup needs.</li>
            <li> I just got this make up brush set for my wife. Since I know nothing about make up I was a little nervous at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am delighted to find out she absolutely loves these brushes!! Thanks Mozzeto you have just helped me score some major points with my wife! Happy wife, happy life!</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes are excellent quality.  The variety of brushes makes it possible to find one for every type of makeup application.  Bristles are soft and do not fall out during makeup application.  The high quality bag and box that they come in would make this great gift for someone or for use for yourself.</li>
            <li> The brushes in this set are well made.  My wife uses several of them on a daily basis and her comment was that they are easy to hold and easy to clean.  Her only issue is that the storage case is very rigid and difficult to open and keep open.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I am really excited to use all the brushes, but there are so many choices! There are 3 different ones just for eye shadow alone. The brushes are of all sizes to work with different make up and to go on different parts of my face.  My blush brush has really made a difference in softening my look and blending my blush upward. I have never had so many choices, but I can already tell that using the right brush for the right thing really makes a big difference in looking more professional. Clean up is easy and the brush hairs have remained soft ( washed the blush brush twice so far). Plus the hairs have not fallen out like my old blush brush. So love the choices and love the quality and love the price. Good gift idea for friends,</li>
            <li> Nice brushes! Good selection.</li>
