    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>this jar is a great tool in cleaning brushes, scrubbing the dirt out and sinking it all to the bottom!</li>
            <li>This is the best brush cleaning system I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Great for cleaning make up brush</li>
            <li>I love the circular and netted pieces that were included in the container!</li>
            <li>Works amazingly.</li>
            <li>It was also packaged nicely.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cute too..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure customers would end up buying more of the cleaning solution</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier to clean my brushes with them!</li>
            <li>i would gently scrub the brush bristle against the sifter while cleaning it with some warm water and antibacterial cleaning liquid.  </li>
            <li>This product came quickly and it was exactly want I was looking for!</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s worth maybe $4-5 dollars.</li>
            <li>This is just an empty jar and the screen doesn&#x27;t fit across the top.</li>
            <li>I use this daily for spot cleaning my makeup brushes.. Love it</li>
            <li>I saw my MUA using this and knew i absolutely had to have it!</li>
            <li>after all that cleaning i just do a final rinse with my brushes on the palm of my hand with luke warm water and the water is clear.  </li>
            <li>Makes cleaning my makeup brushes much easier.</li>
            <li>I just wish the sifter didn&#x27;t move around to much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Very convenient tool.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if maybe a small bottle of the cleaning solution was included.</li>
            <li>It does a very thorough job of completely cleaning my makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>I did not realize how small it was though; I saw a beauty blogger on Youtube talking about how magical this way</li>
            <li>Use an old bowl.</li>
            <li>Works good as described, but don&#x27;t accidentally lose either one of those plastic pieces or else you would have purchased just an expensive jar.</li>

            <li> the shipping took such a long time.  </li>
            <li> It did not come with the actual parian cleaner only an empty container!</li>
            <li> note, if you buy this product, you are only buying the empty jar.</li>
            <li> I thought this was expensive, since I had to pay for shipping too, but it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money or the hype.</li>
            <li> i thought i would receive the shipment in as little as 3 days</li>
            <li> i find it ridiculous that it took so long since it&#x27;s from city, CA and ships to another city,CA.  </li>
            <li> i didnt expect the jar to be small</li>
            <li> Arrived broken.  </li>
            <li> The little sifter at the bottom helps get all the makeup off of your brushes without having to get your hands dirty!</li>

            <li> Definitely get this to use with Parian spirit</li>
            <li> This is just an empty jar and the screen doesn&#x27;t fit across the top. Not worth the money.  Use an old bowl.</li>
            <li> I use this daily for spot cleaning my makeup brushes.. Love it and it&#x27;s cute too..</li>
            <li> This product came quickly and it was exactly want I was looking for! It was also packaged nicely.  Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I thought this was expensive, since I had to pay for shipping too, but it was exactly what I wanted. I love the circular and netted pieces that were included in the container! It&#x27;s easier to clean my brushes with them!</li>
            <li> It did not come with the actual parian cleaner only an empty container!</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning make up brush</li>
            <li> Received item almost the next day! I did not realize how small it was though; I saw a beauty blogger on Youtube talking about how magical this way but I thought it was bigger. No biggie, still cant wait to try it out!!</li>
            <li> this product does what it&#x27;s meant to do.  the plastic sifter help get rid of the makeup build-up and residue left on the brush bristles.  i would gently scrub the brush bristle against the sifter while cleaning it with some warm water and antibacterial cleaning liquid.  it saves me time.  after all that cleaning i just do a final rinse with my brushes on the palm of my hand with luke warm water and the water is clear.  i didnt expect the jar to be small but it&#x27;s do-able.  i wish it was a bit bigger.  the shipping took such a long time.  i find it ridiculous that it took so long since it&#x27;s from city, CA and ships to another city,CA.  i thought i would receive the shipment in as little as 3 days but it took over a week.  i was tracking my shipment:  so it left CA and went to North Carolina, then went to Utah, then back to my CA shipping address.  im not a fan of Fedex nor UPS.  i wish the seller would consider using USPS for future shipments.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money or the hype. I feel it&#x27;s worth maybe $4-5 dollars. It&#x27;s just a glass jar with a plastic screen mat. Don&#x27;t notice a difference with the cleanliness of my brushes with or without this product.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as big as I thought it would be. But I like it</li>
            <li> Jar works as described, but you literally are just purchasing a jar with a couple of plastic things that sit at the bottom of the jar. Works good as described, but don&#x27;t accidentally lose either one of those plastic pieces or else you would have purchased just an expensive jar. It would have been nice if maybe a small bottle of the cleaning solution was included. I&#x27;m sure customers would end up buying more of the cleaning solution anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Just note, if you buy this product, you are only buying the empty jar. I did see some reviewers note this, but I took my chance and ordered it.</li>
            <li> I saw my MUA using this and knew i absolutely had to have it! The little sifter at the bottom helps get all the makeup off of your brushes without having to get your hands dirty! I use this with my Parian Spirit brush cleaner solution and it works like a charm. Will never use anything else again!</li>
            <li> Works amazingly. Glad I tried instead of assuming it was a waist of money. Makes cleaning my makeup brushes much easier.</li>
            <li> this jar is a great tool in cleaning brushes, scrubbing the dirt out and sinking it all to the bottom!</li>
            <li> Arrived broken.  Didn&#x27;t get to try it.</li>
            <li> Using the jar makes cleaning your brushes even faster. I just wish the sifter didn&#x27;t move around to much. I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is just smaller than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush cleaning system I&#x27;ve ever used. It does a very thorough job of completely cleaning my makeup brushes. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Makes brush classic a bit less stressful on the palms</li>
            <li> Very convenient tool.</li>
