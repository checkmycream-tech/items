            <li> It kept my tattoos moist and looking great it&#x27;s not greasy and fragrance free just a good quality lotion for new and existing tattoos!</li>
            <li> I used the small tube given to me by tattoo artist. My first tat healed quickly with no issues, pain, scabbing or infection! Healed beautifully!!&lt;br /&gt;So i ordered this tube to continue using as my daily mousturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I love it but noticed it smelled and the small sample tube did nnot. Not a real pleasant odor but not bad and it disappears.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> I have used pretty much every aftercare product - and this by far is the worst. It has a short shelf life - will turn to water in time - leaves your skin kinda sticky - and is really too water based to make a lasting impact on coloration. I got 2 full sleeves and side pieces - the only product i use is Cam&#x27;s Tat Wax - go with that and not this hipster doofus product. Waste of loot</li>
            <li> I love it.  It keeps my tats looking fresh. I give them to my friends as gifts.  They all like&#x27;em.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the cost and time in shipping.  I found it to be effective in maintaining art and nature of the tattoo!</li>

            <li> Very good product. It even made my 7 year old tattoo look like I just got it aonth ago.</li>
            <li> works great! it came right on time...no wait. i just wish they made it in a larger size....lots of ink</li>
            <li> this is an excellent product for when you get your tattoo.  this product doesn&#x27;t clog your pores like the other products.</li>
            <li> i use it on all my tattoos very good aftercare heals a lot faster, and is not oily like others</li>
            <li> I love tis product.  I have 14 tattoos and use this product all of the time. It keeps your body art looking fresh and shiny whenever you use it. I always have extra because I don&#x27;t ever want to run out of it.</li>
            <li> One of the best products for post care</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for new and older tattoos. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> 3rd bottle, love this stuff</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have sensitive skin and I prefer this over any other lotion for tattoo after care. Even better than aquaphor. Didn&#x27;t take long to receive the product.</li>
            <li> I have numerous tats on my chest and arms and neck, used this on MOST of them. The reason for that my first 2 tats i used a salve and when my artist recommended this i was reluctant. But I have to say i was sorry i didnt use it sooner when i did try it!!! OMG put it on after my huge chest piece and it cooled it off, soothed and healed it better than anything else i tried.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, helps a lot with retaining color.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best I have used it for many tattoos &amp;#60;3 Makes healing quicker I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Worked awesome! Didn&#x27;t pull any ink out and was super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have several tattoos, I use this to give them that eye popping effect.  It really brings your tattoos out.</li>
            <li> The best on the market is apply no smell not greasy does not stick to your clothes Best on the market</li>
