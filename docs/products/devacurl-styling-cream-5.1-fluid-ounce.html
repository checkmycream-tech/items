            <li>At any rate, when I was once again looking for a curly-hair product, I went in that day with not so great hair.</li>

            <li>An-gel after one condition has always worked great for me.</li>
            <li>Women stop me on the street to ask what I use to give me great curls.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t matter because the conditioner smells great.  </li>

            <li>This styling cream is amazing!</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have ever used, after trying and using hundreds for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>My hair has beautiful curls, ringlets, nicely separated and feels great.  </li>
            <li>This is the most wonderful curl cream I have used.</li>
            <li>it works wonders, with no gel needed, and beautiful defined curls (even more than with the gel!)</li>
            <li>And it smells great :)!</li>
            <li>The perfect solution for curly hair that is also fine.  </li>
            <li>This styling cream has a wonderful scent and a smooth, non-greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>I was using One Condition as a leave in and it was good but gave me breakouts.</li>
            <li>Good transaction.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Sulfate free product and is the best for your hair.</li>
            <li>Doesnt make my hair feel good.</li>
            <li>Now I just wish that the cleansing conditioner smelled this good</li>
            <li>Give hold, definition, and smells good.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>I have a good hair day if I leave it curly, maybe once a month.</li>
            <li>I have fairly curly/frizzy hair and this product works</li>
            <li>My hair is gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>I use a paper towel to get rid of the dripping water, or use my hands, then I immediately add in a good chunk of leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>my curls have never looked this good.  </li>
            <li>The creme smells good, feels good, and I even rubbed my hands on my face after running it through my hair.  </li>
            <li>but it looks great and has nice hold</li>
            <li>This cream is good</li>
            <li>My curls are defined and smells good too.  </li>
            <li>and I was good to go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having given it good ol&#x27; college try, I saw that I just wasn&#x27;t going to get used to it</li>
            <li>This DevaCurl Styling Cream layers on after gel for even more control and beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and good for your hair too!</li>
            <li>The bottles were sealed and in great shape -- just as I would have found them in the salon, but at a better price.</li>
            <li>Love this product makes my hair feel great</li>
            <li>DevaCurl Styling Cream is my very favorite styling product.  </li>
            <li>It smells really good, but there isn&#x27;t anything spectacular about it.</li>
            <li>It smells good, and the concept is good, but I think using the conditioner as a leave in works better.</li>
            <li>Works great on my natural curls and smells great!</li>
            <li>Prompt shipping, love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I really love their products!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it) and still looked pretty frizzy on days that weren&#x27;t perfect.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>

            <li>This ones a keeper and believe me I&#x27;ve been through a lot of products and most don&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I have had this for two days and am completely in love!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This trio has transformed my curls into something I love to show off now!</li>
            <li>Just wonderful, leaves hair smelling nice, offers good amount of control</li>
            <li>My curls look amazing too.</li>
            <li>Oyin products are amazing.  </li>
            <li>Oyin products are amazing.  </li>
            <li>Plus the smell is absolutely AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It also smells great and is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>and it still looks amazing</li>
            <li>My hair is well tamed and smells amazing too.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair look and feel amazing.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hold my hair as well as I would have liked</li>
            <li>Has a nice sort of fruity smell- not overpowering.</li>
            <li>but wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>it just dries with a nice sheen and defined curls.  </li>
            <li>Holds it together &amp; allows it to curl nicely.</li>
            <li>Wonderful in the summer, and an absolute MUST during the winter months.</li>
            <li>This product bundles my curls nicely and makes &#x27;em shine, while the gel adds protein and sets my curls in place.</li>
            <li>Kind of like the Mary Louise Parker</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a lot of nice things about the Deva Curl and you may not discover them until you play with it awhile.</li>
            <li>I will not order this again kind of pricey to not work.</li>
            <li>It defines your waves/curls quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell nice on my hair.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, but doesn&#x27;t provide all day hold and definition like OGX Argan Oil Defining cream.</li>
            <li>I just liked the smoothness of it and the ingredients that make up this product I will order from this seller again.</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>Smells so good too :)</li>
            <li>nice addition to the arcangel.  </li>
            <li>All the DevaCurl products are great -- my granddaughter has very curly hair, and these have worked great for her too.</li>
            <li>I read so many good reviews .</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell too.  </li>
            <li>I honestly cannot believe the difference it&#x27;s made in my curls.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect hair product for anyone with naturally curly hair!!!</li>
            <li>I also like redken curls, the original formula which is gone, and cat curls curling creme which is also great</li>
            <li>It smells nice too - not perfumy - just light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>The smell is great, and it&#x27;s super lightweight.</li>
            <li>wonderful creamy soft curls!  </li>
            <li>BEST Curly Hair Product on the market by far!  </li>
            <li>Together with SET IT FREE my hair never felt or looked so good.</li>
            <li>Perfect soft no-frizz curls</li>
            <li>My curls are perfectly defined and so soft.</li>
            <li>The BEST product ever for your natural curls.</li>
            <li>This product is perfectly suited for my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard great things about DevaCurl salons and products, but this probably just isn&#x27;t the right product for me.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try the line, and if gave it a good try</li>
            <li>The first thing you will notice is the great smell.</li>
            <li>Very smooth results.</li>
            <li>This product is for my wife, so I&#x27;m not exactly sure how it works, but he keeps her happy and that keeps me very happy.</li>
            <li>I decided to try it, though, since I&#x27;ve had good luck with most Deva curl products -- and it&#x27;s been working great on my fine, wavy hair -- turning my waves into botticelli curls and soft spirals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
            <li>but I love the product itself</li>
            <li>I have Wavy hair, and since the Styling Cream is targeted towards botticelli and corkscrew curls, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work for me.  </li>
            <li>I have been a user of Aveda&#x27;s Be Curly for many years now, but I thought I would give this product a try.</li>
            <li>I give it 3 stars; It is okay.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE  </li>
            <li>All the Deva products are fantastic!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, I consider myself a product junkie, I&#x27;ve been trying to find a product for my course frizzy curly hair</li>
            <li>If you want more hold, you should try this brand&#x27;s ultra defining gel.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I tried it when I got a haircut at a Deva inspired salon and fell in love.</li>
            <li>Smells like skittles :).</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>There is more shine-</li>
            <li>I love this product because it does what it promises to do.</li>
            <li>That combo works well most of the time.</li>
            <li>I love Deva Curl.  </li>
            <li>I used this at my sisters&#x27; house and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I am sure glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>I will buy more once I run out.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after reading the reviews, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Works better than most on my 3b curls.  </li>
            <li>In fact, my $3 drug store mousse is infinitely better at keeping frizz at bay than this cream.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Yes, LOVE it....</li>
            <li>Will buy more.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I decided that I would give it one more shot</li>
            <li>More often though, it just stops working like I expect.</li>
            <li>I told her what I need, and she started pointing out products that weren&#x27;t even appropriate.</li>
            <li>There are many ways to use it.</li>
            <li>We have tried so many products but this product is the winner of all of the styling creams.  </li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>but the amount i have to use to keep my hair under control is more</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE the Deva Products.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with this cream and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>love this cream.  </li>
            <li>love this cream.  </li>
            <li>I wash some of the conditioner out but leave most of it.</li>
            <li>Deva Products work well in my mostly curly hair</li>
            <li>and I like the smell much better.</li>
            <li>It is certainly better than most of the curl creams I have used</li>
            <li>Love every DevaCurl product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Tames my frizzy curls for sure.  </li>
            <li>Love this cream to keep my curly hair from frizzing.  </li>
            <li>but my hair looks hella cute</li>
            <li>Maybe if I didn&#x27;t use the one conditioner it would have worked better.</li>
            <li>I have really naturally curly hair, and this is not to crunchy, but gives my hair the perfect amount of volume and smells fabulous.</li>
            <li>I love this product in addition to the One Condition.</li>
            <li>I recently got a deva cut and when my hair was styled it looked the best that it has ever been!!!!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love this system.  </li>
            <li>still looks great even straight</li>
            <li>still looks great even straight</li>
            <li>and I must say I love ALL of the products!&lt;br /&gt;The styling cream</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an OK product for defining curls</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried way better products for styling my curly hair.</li>
            <li>I am going to apply this product underneath the hair, instead to the top of the hair and see if that will make a difference.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite Deva products, I use this and the DevaCare One Condition.</li>
            <li>love the product......would not use anything else on my hair</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Nothing else works better for curly hair.</li>
            <li>Scrunch some more in.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t run my fingers through my hair any more</li>
            <li>and my hair has never looked better, even in humid climates.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shoulder length or more and somewhat</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need to add more, just needed to touch up my hair</li>
            <li>I like biolage better, but can&#x27;t afford it.  </li>
            <li>But this is better than then the Nexxus products.  </li>
            <li>I like this cream better than gels because it doesn&#x27;t give my hair that crunch.</li>
            <li>Love this product line.</li>
            <li>Love, Love This styling cream.</li>
            <li>I like the devacurl foam much better.  </li>
            <li>and I am hopeful they will work better for me</li>
            <li>I even bought the Deva dryer as well in my attempt to seriously love my curly hair and discard the straighteners.  </li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t spend over $20 like at Ulta.</li>
            <li>it made my curls better defined...</li>
            <li>i love it when everyone ask what have you done to your curls they are Sexier than ever...</li>
            <li>I love all the Deva products and this is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried the Styling Cream on a whim and fell in love.</li>
            <li>Redken&#x27;s Curvaceous Shampoo and conditioner are way better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this styling cream.</li>
            <li>I have straight fine hair and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>This product does what it says and is a welcome addition to my normal hair routine.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, frizz-free and my wavy/curly hair looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had pretty good results with DevaCurl&#x27;s No-Poo and One Condition, but all of their styling products seem to promote the conditions I&#x27;m looking to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soft, shiny, beautiful wavy hair?</li>
            <li>The cream makes my curls soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>To my nose, it reminds me of bubblegum and is kind of sickly sweet.  </li>
            <li>To my nose, it reminds me of bubblegum and is kind of sickly sweet.  </li>
            <li>All well worth the money!!</li>
            <li>Smell is okay, kinda strong.</li>
            <li>It smells strongly like Starburst, which is not terrible but not a smell taken from nature, like fruit or citrus or herbs or coconut or anything.  </li>
            <li>Looks perfect in humid or dry weather.</li>
            <li>Nice addition to your routine if you are looking for a cream that will be smooth and light.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all it takes -- great, non-frizzy curls that feel soft.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great for naturally curly/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>But then when comparing prices I realized that DevaCurl was much, much more affordable and would still allow me to use sulfate free products.  </li>
            <li>Great for smoothing the frizzies out of your natural curls.</li>
            <li>I tried it on wet hair (after finger combing) and hoped for the best.</li>
            <li>I have very fickle curls that need a stronger hold to create and keep good curls going throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair silky and full of bounce!</li>
            <li>and I think that&#x27;s true!).</li>
            <li>It was so strong</li>
            <li>Looks like I&#x27;ll be sticking to my one true hair love, Bumble and Bumble.</li>
            <li>I loved the seller the product smells wonderfully but as a African American he did not do wonders for my hair</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I&#x27;ve found that defines curls and still has my hair feeling nice.</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE BEST HANDS DOWN.</li>
            <li>But then I went to a Deva certified stylist who not only gave me a fantastic haircut but showed me the right way to use all the Deva products to get the best results.</li>
            <li>My hair is full, soft, and has defined curls...looks very healthy because it is!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair but a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>I have ultra fine hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fine</li>
            <li>I just think its not going to work for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have friends with fine curly hair</li>
            <li>Did not work well on my fine permed hair.</li>
            <li>Packaging was fine.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying product after product to get my fine hair to behave.  </li>
            <li>I have fine color-treated curly hair and this combination helps to keep the frizz away.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very soft but has good hold.</li>
            <li>I was excited about finally have beautiful curls...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to find advice for my certain hair, from anyone who HAS this kind of hair.</li>
            <li>and I still love it as much as I first did!</li>
            <li>I use about the size of a quarter or a bit more and work it through my hair using a large tooth comb to be sure that all the hair is coated.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my curls looking good and conditioned and not stiff.  </li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;test run&amp;#34; fit the bill.</li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s great if I use in generously.</li>
            <li>This has been a fantastic upgrade for me.</li>
            <li>Again make my hair feel smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>So happy to have finally found a product that works wonders for my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>I also use the Lo Poo and Conditioner and Set it Free.  </li>
            <li>the Deva Curl makes the hair smooth and shiny</li>
            <li>Deva&#x27;s Set It Free.  </li>
            <li>It Free adds shine.  </li>
            <li>, I liberally apply the curl creme and then scrunch Set It Free into my hair, then continue to scrunch my hair with a Deva Curl towel.</li>
            <li>I add it to the Ang-gel and one conditioner and spread it thru my hair and it gives it a smooth polished look that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>is light but holds my curl definition and aids against the frizzies.  </li>
            <li>I have had fabulous</li>
            <li>&amp; the final curly styling looks great.  </li>
            <li>My curls looked fantastic at the end of each day and i was out and about quite a</li>
            <li>I mix it with the Deva Curl Angel Light Hold Defining Gel.</li>

            <li>far, I&#x27;m absolutely loving DevaCurl and can&#x27;t wait to try more products in the line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as Pillow Soft, by any stretch.</li>
            <li>DevaCurl Styling Cream - 5.1 Oz]] is anmazing for wonderful curls but no tacky stiff hair.</li>
            <li>I have very tight curls, and this cream is perfect</li>
            <li>The price of this is much better than the Wen styling cream and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I compared it to the original and not even the consistency</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed by the hold at all.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>If I leave some conditioner in her long curly hair and finish with the styling cream, my daughter&#x27;s hair looks great.</li>
            <li>Originally, I applied the two separately</li>
            <li>It is about $7.00 more than their styling gels and while most people will need to use a bit more gel to get similar results as this cream I don&#x27;t think it quite balances out.</li>
            <li>I love curling cremes though, which is why I was so thrilled when they finally came out with one.</li>
            <li>Nice, natural curls, not crunchy, smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>It Free spray - on those super humid days</li>
            <li>My hair always looks amazing when I use this, and the creme makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>has made good under their damaged in shipping policy, but I have to wonder why these bottles are so fragile in the first place to not be able to withstand a routine delivery.</li>
            <li>Amazing product line for naturally curly, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>I had great volume on both my first and second day hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have thick curly hair, this cream will be your best friend.</li>
            <li>Has a light lemon scent that I&#x27;m not crazy about</li>
            <li>All those commercials on TV are full of poo...</li>
            <li>I love the whole Deva line</li>
            <li>I love the whole Deva line</li>
            <li>This is more reasonably priced and easier to get.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t need much product to make my hair look great, even with thick hair, so the longevity on this seems good.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t need much product to make my hair look great, even with thick hair, so the longevity on this seems good.  </li>
            <li>With this Deva cream, I can actually go three days and look good...</li>
            <li>It made such a good lotion.  </li>
            <li>makes my hair feel soft and still keeps the curl nice.</li>
            <li>Love this cream for in between styling of my very curly hair.</li>
            <li>My curls are much softer and shines love these products</li>
            <li>Makes hair smell incredible and hold curls, it doesn&#x27;t make hair stiff and crunchy and keeps the frizz at bay.  </li>
            <li>I mix it with my Light Defining Gel right after No-pooing and One Conditioning.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d probably come back to it if I wasn&#x27;t finding anything else I liked better (since it&#x27;s pretty pricey).</li>
            <li>This might be for other people&#x27;s hair and I&#x27;m happy for them if it works</li>
            <li>This might be for other people&#x27;s hair and I&#x27;m happy for them if it works</li>
            <li>This product, in conjunction with DevaCurl One Condition, does a great job of enhancing my curl pattern without leaving my hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; like some other products do.</li>
            <li>Since it was spendier than other hair products I was thinking that this must be a really good strong product that they&#x27;re selling.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Deva products but this is my favorite thus far.</li>
            <li>I like that it does not have a super &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This really works good on my naturally waves to set them in.</li>
            <li>Set Me Up), but it rarely looks good enough to leave the house as 2nd-day-hair.  </li>
            <li>my hair super puffy</li>
            <li>This product kept my hair fairly soft and frizz free, but more wavy than curly.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was quick with Prime and on time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a super addition</li>
            <li>She says it makes her hair celebrity status worthy.</li>
            <li>It Free, you hair smells like a candy shop for a hot minute, but that quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li>I will buy this again, and I&#x27;m the kind of person who, as a general rule, will not</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much shampooguy!!</li>
            <li>This product really works!!</li>
            <li>It works super well with my curls (3c) and is very hydrating but light.</li>
            <li>I really like deva curl products, but they aren&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;friendly to baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>so it gives me voluminous yet a little beachy curls and during winter I scrunch and diffuse and its great.</li>
            <li>I am naturally curly-haired, I just need a little finesse to the curls them selves, this product should be used after towel drying but when hair is still damp for the best results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;that even experienced hair dressers have trouble working with it.  </li>
            <li>this is a great heavy moisture cream for curls.</li>
            <li>Deva has spent a great deal of effort and time to assure us that, after years of fighting curly hair, they have the styling products and the magic blow dryer that will at last give us the look we want</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>All the Deva Curl products are worth the money.  </li>
            <li>but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>it can&#x27;t look any worse than it does now!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her customer service skills were so impressive</li>
            <li>I will now wear my hair curly way more often than straight because this product really works.</li>
            <li>My own mother has switched to the complete line after seeing what my hair has become capable of.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fresh.</li>
            <li>I thought this product would leave my Curly hair nice and soft but its very sticky and would not recommend.</li>
            <li>I love how it smells but for 20 bucks I expected more.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the no-poo shampoo or conditioner - for my money</li>
            <li>and I saw a pretty quick reaction to the spring in my curls after running it through my hair.</li>
            <li>Her advice was that if I was going to only go with a cream (and not switch my shampoo or conditioner) I&#x27;d be better off going with Livingproof, but I was willing to do the whole system, she thought I&#x27;d like DevaCurl better.  </li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s right for my hair.</li>
            <li>I just need to put in the right amount, which tends to be two quarter size pumps.</li>
            <li>I got my hair cut by a Devachan-trained stylist for the first time last week, and he used this cream on my hair, giving amazing results...</li>
            <li>Love the cream, it cuts down on frizz and is much more moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li>I have been using Bumble and Bumble Curl Conscious Defining Creme for many years and LOVE IT, but they stopped making it in the liter bottle, so I thought I&#x27;d give something cheaper a try before I went out and bought the regular bottles in bulk.</li>
            <li>I am looking for a product that will enhance my natural curls and stop them becoming frizzy as the day goes on.  </li>
            <li>It is worth very penny!</li>
            <li>Have not been able to find it in the stores and love that I can order it on Amazon and save a little money along the way as well.</li>
            <li>this stuff is not great its not even good and to top it off the pump</li>
            <li>Great product to tame those curls!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s cool, but it&#x27;s what this conditioner does for my dry hair that I really love.  </li>
            <li>Great solution for very curly hair-keeps it relatively tame without the drying effects of gel.</li>
            <li>Very smooth results.h big rollers...can you believe it works???</li>
            <li>Perfect for towel dried curly hair, makes curly hair light without weighing it down!</li>
            <li>It never looks &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; and will just make your curls frizz free and soft.</li>
            <li>use daily and love it</li>
            <li>Absolutely will buy this again!</li>
            <li>day I was in an Ulta whose manager treats me like I have a communicable disease and shoplift; praying that the first person to offer help would not be her.</li>
            <li>The one thing that bothered her the most is how short her hair is when curly.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used this product</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what it did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many styling creams to find the &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; of products, and I have to say, this is definitely a holy grail product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks great for at least two days.</li>
            <li>It is sort of funny that between the Styling Cream and the Set</li>
            <li>I am SO glad that Deva Curl FINALLY came out with a curl creme!</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s starting to get more volume.</li>
            <li>I have just finished my first canister of this styling cream.</li>
            <li>A pump of this cream, shake my curls out a bit, and I&#x27;m ready for any type of weather!</li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t love about this styling cream is the smell.  </li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t love about this styling cream is the smell.  </li>
            <li>hair dresser first introduced me to this product.  </li>
            <li>I use the whole product line!</li>
            <li>Since I started using this product, my hair looks healthier and everybody comments how pretty my curls are.</li>
            <li>IF I put some coconut oil on first.</li>
            <li>and I have tried sooooo many different products designed for curly hair.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all simply advertising and nothing more.  </li>
            <li>Again, use very sparingly!</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft and frizz free, but also locks in curl.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with DevaCurl products.</li>
            <li>Makes hair so soft, I am very curly and love this new product.</li>
            <li>My waves were full and soft.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t get past the very strong sweet smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looked alot better than before, but the gel was making my hair dry.</li>
            <li>I use the styling cream after and blow dry it with a diffuser (much better curl definition than letting it air-dry).</li>
            <li>so I was hoping to find something (anything, please) that would make my hair looks defined and healthy in dry AZ and</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews, very surprised this did not work for my baby fine, naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little odd but curled my hair great !</li>
            <li>Imparts a nice shine.&lt;br /&gt;- Very moisturizing but does not weigh down the hair.</li>
            <li>and you have to have clean hands - no other products or lotions on them - for it to spread evenly.  </li>
            <li>so I was certain I would go through a 5 oz.</li>
            <li>I had heard great things about DevaCurl, but they are overpriced and don&#x27;t live up to the reputation, at least with this product.</li>
            <li>My hair dried quickly and my curls were more defined.  </li>
            <li>I usually purchase it at the salon for a significant amount more.</li>
            <li>Makes lovely loose curls!  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for shine.</li>
            <li>I really like that Deva now has a cream</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much rather use Aveda&#x27;s Be Curly product line.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
            <li>It tames it some -- but not as much as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>When I go get my hair cut, the stylists always want to try to use a diffuser on it, and my hair always ends up looking very clown-ish and they end up using a straightening iron.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe I got it so fast.  </li>
            <li>have found that DevaCurl Styling cream REALLY helps to ease the frizz.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it again on my whole head while my hair was damp.</li>
            <li>I really like this so far, and most likely will buy this again and again.</li>
            <li>It takes about 2 pumps for my whole head.  </li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t use too much) and run it through my hair.  </li>
            <li>Using too much will make my (3A curly) hair sticky and frizzy.</li>
            <li>Nothing - absolutely nothing - holds my curls as well as this.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t  need much to get a lot of results.</li>
            <li>Scrunch as your drying and it dries very curly.</li>
            <li>Gives my curls so much moisturize.</li>
            <li>I actually really like this cream underneath a gel for hold.</li>
            <li>While this cream does hold the curl, it does absolutely nothing for the frizz.</li>
            <li>really helps the curls come to life.</li>
            <li>This really helps keep my curls from being too frizzy in humid weather.  </li>
            <li>(Use VERY sparingly)</li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Works very well, just a bit sticky.</li>
            <li>This product smoothes my hair and really defines my curls.  </li>
            <li>It really helps define my curls.</li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve been trying to find a styling product for my very curly hair &amp; I&#x27;ve had no luck until now.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>This really controls frizz.  </li>
            <li>and I am not someone who wants to take any time with my hair.  </li>
            <li>Deva Curl Light Defining Gel (Formerly Angel) 32oz]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair dries fast and doesn&#x27;t feel slimey.  </li>
            <li>After 30 years of fighting my curly hair with everything from up dos to relaxers as well as Brazilian and Japanese straitening at the salon, I finally enjoy having curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I then follow with Devacurl Frizz Free Volumizing Foam to give my curls some extra hold.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do much for my frizzy, curly 2C/3A hair.</li>
            <li>have very processed hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>but I really hoped this would help my curly hair stay curly after it dries.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping so much that it would work.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>This styling cream looked so promising.</li>
            <li>I used to use the anGEL but didn&#x27;t like how &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; it would leave my hair with the gel casts and I felt that it was drying my hair out too much (might have just been me being paranoid).</li>
            <li>so I had to order her a whole bottle.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>(I was told it disrupts the curls too much</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and healthy and the wave definition is definitely on par with what I was getting from Livingproof.  </li>
            <li>you have curly hair and are constantly questing for new products, I highly recommend finding a Deva trained stylist in your area and going in at least once for the stylist to recommend products and how to use them best for your hair.</li>
            <li>While it is a better value if you think of it interms of cost per use (rather than cost per once) since you don&#x27;t need to use very much, I still think it is slightly overpriced.</li>
            <li>Nice and moist but still makes hair stiff</li>
            <li>Works best on wet (not dripping) hair when mixed with a little water first.</li>
            <li>I have curly long hair that tends to freeze easily.</li>
            <li>I have been walking around with frizzy, wilted curls and while other parts are more straight.</li>
            <li>Maybe their other products are better.  </li>
            <li>I would buy more, try some other of their products, and recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I was excited when Deva Concepts released this product but was put off by the price relative to the amount of product you get.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, dry, thinning and permed.</li>
            <li>I never knew it&#x27;s full potential.  </li>
            <li>The first two days I used this (first and second day hair) were very windy.</li>
            <li>It somehow manages to be both overly sweet and chemical at the same time.</li>
            <li>This one is for a more loose natural look with plenty of movement in the hair.</li>
            <li>I was able to get two applications for my long, medium density, 3c hair with enough left over for one application for my mother who has medium length fine 4a hair.</li>
            <li>I am in love with the Deva product and the fact that they do not weigh the hair down.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this!</li>
            <li>I had a gift certificate from Christmas and really needed some new hair products.  </li>
            <li>I really like this new curling cream from DevaCurl.  </li>
            <li>The less I use, the better.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find that I got the same results scrunching the product into dry hair as wet, something that I can&#x27;t really do with gel.</li>
            <li>It actually make it feel soft and smooth once it re-dried.</li>
            <li>and I used a decent amount of the product</li>
            <li>The Moroccan Oil brand is more expensive but it provides more moisture</li>
            <li>no seriously the path of 80% unused product bottles wraps around the globe, my tree hugging eco Portland ego is ashamed to admit.  </li>
            <li>My hair pulled into nice spirals, but...it was so ridiculously soft that it&lt;br /&gt;soon was stringy and limp.  </li>
            <li>I use two pumps for type 3a hair that is between hip and classic length.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly Botticelli-type curls and live in a high humidity area.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest the No-Poo and Conditioner as well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Start with a little bit and add more as needed.</li>
            <li>It is light enough to comb through and my hair always feels clean, no weighed down.</li>
            <li>Not heavy and really tames the curls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for a few months, and my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>Stuff is pricey (normal price) but I cannot deny that it works.</li>
            <li>I normally use it with the b&#x27;leave in conditioner and the ultra defining gel.</li>
            <li>For those oldsters out there: I went from Roseanne Rosannah Dannah to relatively normal looking hair.  </li>
            <li>Although I still have the occasionally &amp;#34;bad hair day,&amp;#34; pretty consistently these products in combination produce soft, shiny waves.  </li>
            <li>I prefer Catwalk Curl Cream, which is much more heavy and does the job well.</li>
            <li>Personally, I find it leaves my hair feeling kind of heavy, but as if there&#x27;s too much hair product on it.  </li>
            <li>Most products are too oily or too heavy resulting in a disaster on my head.  </li>
            <li>but I feel like for the price you can find similar products with nice Deva-like ingredients for less.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through at least 3 large bottles of the gel (light and firm) and liked the look-</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>and I have to live with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cannot live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>live in AZ and travel to CA often</li>
            <li>Just a light quick few sprays it enough and doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft and gives more hold, but I thought doing that made my hair feel heavy, but I did try it.  </li>
            <li>It also makes my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>makes my curls soft and springy!</li>
            <li>What I love about this over other mousse/gel is that you just put it in - no scrunching necessary!</li>
            <li>Previous shipments arrived fine, and the product performed satisfactorily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First thing I have found that actually keeps my curls under control all day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural life!</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product to use by itself or in conjunction with other DevaCurl products!  </li>
            <li>It did a great job, using relatively little product when compared to the handful of ArcAngel gel that I usually use.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and coarse so it easily supports the heaviness of the cream, but I can see if you used very much it would be too much-</li>
            <li>I have brown curly Caucasian hair, but it&#x27;s not very thick or textured.</li>
            <li>but my hair is mostly wavy and by mid day it weighs it down.</li>
            <li>She thought that maybe I had life problems and was very stressed out, but the truth was that nothing was different in my life except that I was trying and new shampoo and conditioner and style produce.</li>
            <li>I have always gotten complements on the health of my hair by my hair dresser, after a little over a month of using this produce she was very worried about me because my hair went from being healthy and manageable  to extremely dry and notted at the ends.</li>
            <li>The product isn&#x27;t too heavy for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I loved how it didn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy like other products can, nor did my hair look like it was wet all day long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long and can by very very frizzy.</li>
            <li>My hair is so very fine, so I tried using a non&lt;br /&gt;sulfate shampoo other than my regular low poo by Deva.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and not stiff when I use this</li>
            <li>Let me make it clear.</li>
            <li>Some clear liquid was all over it, inside cap, and you can see it floating inside at the bottom under the cream.</li>
            <li>The result is soft, defined</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t crispy and the curls are soft.</li>
            <li>BUT my curls stay cute for at least 3 days (got 5 days one time).</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is manageable and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly and frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>and I only use about two pumps for my whole head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had people ask if I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always gone natural...</li>
            <li>Unlike mousse, this product leaves your curls soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Then I take an old cotton t-shirt and scrunch the excess water out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My curls are soft &amp; holds all day.</li>
            <li>If you have naturally curly hair, you&#x27;ll want this before blow drying with a diffuser.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser suggested it because I get knots under the back of my hair since it&#x27;s very curly.  </li>
            <li>The product description says it &amp;#34;Provides natural hold, humidity resistance and leaves curls</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft, not crunchy.</li>
            <li>My curls look and feel soft.  </li>
            <li>and this helps control it and make it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair dries soft and my curls are bouncy.  </li>
            <li>It was way too soft.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A RELAXING MOISTURIZING FLUID and Davines OI / Oil Absolute Beautifying Potion and my hair</li>
            <li>THIS IS A RELAXING MOISTURIZING FLUID and Davines OI / Oil Absolute Beautifying Potion and my hair</li>
            <li>Leaves hair shiny with natural curls.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to all who have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>We use all DevaCurl products for my 17 year old with ringlet curls.</li>
            <li>My hair does not have a soft and silky texture after applying this product.</li>
            <li>Just scrunch it through the hair, throw it back and gently finger style.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and it locks the curls</li>
            <li>This product works well on my hair, leaves it soft and naturally curly without the frizz.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy/kinky hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m reviewing the 3 products as a whole system overall.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and when my sister the hair stylist recommended it to me</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before this, I was using Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft.</li>
            <li>This makes my curls look natural and soft.  </li>
            <li>My curls are soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>love this have thick wavy/curly hair</li>
            <li>I got this as a sample and figured maybe it would help my fine, barely wavy hair get a little oomph.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got big loose curls, that will quickly turn into Roseanne Roseannadanna hair if I touch it too much or don&#x27;t use enough product.  </li>
            <li>After gently towel drying my hair, I put a tiny dab (the first time, I used too much -- my hair felt heavy and sort of greasy</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s not typically tight curly  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product in conjunction with gel, especially if you are transitioning to natural.</li>
            <li>directions on the bottle are pretty vague, as they are on most Deva bottles:</li>
            <li>As I got older, I tried serums, gels, all the stuff you can get at the local monopolizing &amp;#34;Mart&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I still have to use something different the first day of washing hair but this product smooths out the frizzy the following day</li>
            <li>In the past I have had to be fairly heavy handed with curl creams to get good results</li>
            <li>I have extremely tight, curly hair; perhaps this would be better for those ladies who have loose curls or waves.  </li>
            <li>I apply it the same why that I applied the anGEL with my head down, coating the underside and then flipping my hair over while doing a light coat over the sides and scrunching.</li>
            <li>I dye it regularly and high heat wave, curl, or straighten depending on my mood.  </li>
            <li>For a long time I thought it didn&#x27;t like my hair wavy, but then realized it was only because I hadn&#x27;t found the right product to style it.</li>
            <li>I use it when my hair is wet and dry and it always makes a huge improvement on my frizz.</li>
            <li>Tries this after getting a diva cut at a local salon, and it makes such a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Then, I gently dab at my hair until it&#x27;s not dripping, which doesn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li>(I do this with pretty sopping wet hair).</li>
            <li>I use a gel over it for maximum frizz prevention (which I do with any curling creme I&#x27;ve ever used), but with this product, my curls do not end up weighted down as happens with many other products I have used (I have Botticelli curls).</li>
            <li>It will only see the light of day again if I run out of everything else and just have to have a little dollop of cream in my hair in an emergency.</li>
            <li>My red color hardly fades, and my waves are shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I recently got a much needed cut and the stylist used this product as well as the low poo shampoo and one conditioner</li>
            <li>DevaCurl is the only product I will put on my natural curly hair, and my daughter&#x27;s naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have thick curly blonde hair, and have written many a review on here for curly-girl products.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected thank you!</li>
            <li>this is my first time to use this styling cream based on other people&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li>My hair is very, very dry and very curly.</li>
            <li>I actually feel like it made my naturally curly hair frizzier.</li>
            <li>when I used a minimal to medium amount my hair was very frizzy</li>
            <li>That was because it was mostly unmanageable and frizzy, and would usually start looking strange and lose its bounce by the third week from the products I used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>about 1/2 the time to wear it straight and the rest of the time I scrunch it when wet to wear it wavy.  </li>
            <li>curl conscious defining cream, but B&amp;B seems to be the only product that keeps the frizz at bay all day.</li>
            <li>After years of blowdrying I finally decided to embrace my natural curl.  </li>
            <li>And, now, after 3 years of using it, even if I don&#x27;t dry it and let it air dry, with just a little bit of condition left in (I always leave the One Condition in), it dries curly and beautiful (just don&#x27;t usually have the volume, but after some scrunching, it&#x27;s fine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After I gently towel dry my hair with a regular towel (no rubbing!)</li>
            <li>its really right down the middle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s odd because the rest of the line has a pretty benign smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s odd because the rest of the line has a pretty benign smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped my hair hang on to the little bit of wave that it has, made it hold up a little better through the day.</li>
            <li>but I have to use with other products to really define my hair the way I like it.</li>
            <li>I then clip, add some of the new Spray Gel on my roots and ends, and dry.  </li>
            <li>many other reviewers have said, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>okay that was a bit dramatic</li>
            <li>But, in the end, it was like trying to smile at someone&#x27;s ugly baby, pretending that it&#x27;s cute.</li>
            <li>My daughter recently transitioned back to her naturally curly hair after years of straightening it.  </li>
            <li>The styling creme isn&#x27;t as creamy and thick as Aveda&#x27;s is; it feels much more watery than what I expected.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve managed to finally tame the beast with Deva-Curl products, and a few amazing haircuts at the Deva-style dry cut salons.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have all the bad stuff (sulfates and silicones) like other products made for curly hair and keeps hair healthy and strong.  </li>
            <li>Even the Folica forums are filled with people much younger than myself, with time to mess with their hair endlessly.</li>
            <li>I can blow dry my hair straight and it works, or just apply product and let my hair air dry.  </li>
            <li>It really helps keep the frizz down.  </li>
            <li>I think sometimes I get weighed down and becomes straight and oily.</li>
            <li>some of the ringlets at the bottom were more  defined than when I had used a minimal amount but the amount of frizz and dry hair throughout my head was just unbelievable</li>
            <li>This gives the right amount of definition without being either oily or crunchy, and it perks up the second (or even third) day with a little spritzer to bring curl back.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I put too much stock into the hyperbolic claims typical of product blurbs on Amazon</li>
            <li>This styling cream creates soft curls, it is not a sticky product, gives a soft hold without weighing curls down.</li>
            <li>This cream is nothing special and, for me, gel from even the least expensive sources does better to form and set curls.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m careful not to touch my hair too much, or I put a braid in my hair and wait for it to dry.</li>

            <li> how it works!s curly and beautiful</li>

            <li> My waves stay put all day and look beautifully defined.  </li>
            <li> The best part is the smell - it&#x27;s very lovely.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very glad I did!</li>
            <li> and it looks great.</li>

            <li> Devaconcepts DevaCurl styling cream is a great product and I will use and oder this again.  </li>
            <li> At any rate, when I was once again looking for a curly-hair product, I went in that day with not so great hair.</li>
            <li> and she said, \\&quot;They have great shampoo!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> She pulled out their gel, \\&quot;This is great gel!\\&quot; (BANG HEAD)</li>
            <li> She chirped happily, \\&quot;Oh</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s great cream!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> She is so happy when we use this</li>
            <li> She uses it with the spray gel and her hair looks great.</li>
            <li> Great product, have been using it for years</li>
            <li> this works great.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a great part of my styling routine.</li>
            <li> An-gel after one condition has always worked great for me.</li>
            <li> Women stop me on the street to ask what I use to give me great curls.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t matter because the conditioner smells great.  </li>
            <li> The creme hold stuff smells great too.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job of bringing out the curl too.  </li>

            <li> It smells amazing which is an added bonus!</li>
            <li> Curly girls and boys, this styling cream works amazingly well!</li>
            <li> This styling cream is amazing!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used, after trying and using hundreds for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> My hair has beautiful curls, ringlets, nicely separated and feels great.  </li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful curl cream I have used.</li>
            <li> it works wonders, with no gel needed, and beautiful defined curls (even more than with the gel!)</li>
            <li> And it smells great :)!</li>
            <li> The perfect solution for curly hair that is also fine.  </li>
            <li> This styling cream has a wonderful scent and a smooth, non-greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I was using One Condition as a leave in and it was good but gave me breakouts.</li>
            <li> Good transaction.  </li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Sulfate free product and is the best for your hair.</li>
            <li> Doesnt make my hair feel good.</li>
            <li> Now I just wish that the cleansing conditioner smelled this good</li>
            <li> Give hold, definition, and smells good.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> I have a good hair day if I leave it curly, maybe once a month.</li>
            <li> I have fairly curly/frizzy hair and this product works</li>
            <li> My hair is gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> I use a paper towel to get rid of the dripping water, or use my hands, then I immediately add in a good chunk of leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> my curls have never looked this good.  </li>
            <li> The creme smells good, feels good, and I even rubbed my hands on my face after running it through my hair.  </li>
            <li> but it looks great and has nice hold</li>
            <li> This cream is good</li>
            <li> My curls are defined and smells good too.  </li>
            <li> and I was good to go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having given it good ol&#x27; college try, I saw that I just wasn&#x27;t going to get used to it</li>
            <li> This DevaCurl Styling Cream layers on after gel for even more control and beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and good for your hair too!</li>
            <li> The bottles were sealed and in great shape -- just as I would have found them in the salon, but at a better price.</li>
            <li> Love this product makes my hair feel great</li>
            <li> DevaCurl Styling Cream is my very favorite styling product.  </li>
            <li> It smells really good, but there isn&#x27;t anything spectacular about it.</li>
            <li> It smells good, and the concept is good, but I think using the conditioner as a leave in works better.</li>
            <li> Works great on my natural curls and smells great!</li>
            <li> Prompt shipping, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I really love their products!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it) and still looked pretty frizzy on days that weren&#x27;t perfect.  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This ones a keeper and believe me I&#x27;ve been through a lot of products and most don&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I have had this for two days and am completely in love!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This trio has transformed my curls into something I love to show off now!</li>
            <li> Just wonderful, leaves hair smelling nice, offers good amount of control</li>
            <li> My curls look amazing too.</li>
            <li> Oyin products are amazing.  </li>
            <li> Oyin products are amazing.  </li>
            <li> Plus the smell is absolutely AMAZING.</li>
            <li> It also smells great and is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> and it still looks amazing</li>
            <li> My hair is well tamed and smells amazing too.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look and feel amazing.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hold my hair as well as I would have liked</li>
            <li> Has a nice sort of fruity smell- not overpowering.</li>
            <li> but wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> it just dries with a nice sheen and defined curls.  </li>
            <li> Holds it together &amp; allows it to curl nicely.</li>
            <li> Wonderful in the summer, and an absolute MUST during the winter months.</li>
            <li> This product bundles my curls nicely and makes &#x27;em shine, while the gel adds protein and sets my curls in place.</li>
            <li> Kind of like the Mary Louise Parker</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a lot of nice things about the Deva Curl and you may not discover them until you play with it awhile.</li>
            <li> I will not order this again kind of pricey to not work.</li>
            <li> It defines your waves/curls quite nicely.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell nice on my hair.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, but doesn&#x27;t provide all day hold and definition like OGX Argan Oil Defining cream.</li>
            <li> I just liked the smoothness of it and the ingredients that make up this product I will order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  </li>
            <li> Smells so good too :)</li>
            <li> nice addition to the arcangel.  </li>
            <li> All the DevaCurl products are great -- my granddaughter has very curly hair, and these have worked great for her too.</li>
            <li> I read so many good reviews .</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell too.  </li>
            <li> I honestly cannot believe the difference it&#x27;s made in my curls.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect hair product for anyone with naturally curly hair!!!</li>
            <li> I also like redken curls, the original formula which is gone, and cat curls curling creme which is also great</li>
            <li> It smells nice too - not perfumy - just light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> The smell is great, and it&#x27;s super lightweight.</li>
            <li> wonderful creamy soft curls!  </li>
            <li> BEST Curly Hair Product on the market by far!  </li>
            <li> Together with SET IT FREE my hair never felt or looked so good.</li>
            <li> Perfect soft no-frizz curls</li>
            <li> My curls are perfectly defined and so soft.</li>
            <li> The BEST product ever for your natural curls.</li>
            <li> This product is perfectly suited for my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about DevaCurl salons and products, but this probably just isn&#x27;t the right product for me.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try the line, and if gave it a good try</li>
            <li> The first thing you will notice is the great smell.</li>
            <li> Very smooth results.</li>
            <li> This product is for my wife, so I&#x27;m not exactly sure how it works, but he keeps her happy and that keeps me very happy.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it, though, since I&#x27;ve had good luck with most Deva curl products -- and it&#x27;s been working great on my fine, wavy hair -- turning my waves into botticelli curls and soft spirals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
            <li> but I love the product itself</li>
            <li> I have Wavy hair, and since the Styling Cream is targeted towards botticelli and corkscrew curls, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work for me.  </li>
            <li> I have been a user of Aveda&#x27;s Be Curly for many years now, but I thought I would give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars; It is okay.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE  </li>
            <li> All the Deva products are fantastic!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, I consider myself a product junkie, I&#x27;ve been trying to find a product for my course frizzy curly hair</li>
            <li> If you want more hold, you should try this brand&#x27;s ultra defining gel.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I tried it when I got a haircut at a Deva inspired salon and fell in love.</li>
            <li> Smells like skittles :).</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> There is more shine-</li>
            <li> I love this product because it does what it promises to do.</li>
            <li> That combo works well most of the time.</li>
            <li> I love Deva Curl.  </li>
            <li> I used this at my sisters&#x27; house and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I am sure glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> I will buy more once I run out.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading the reviews, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Works better than most on my 3b curls.  </li>
            <li> In fact, my $3 drug store mousse is infinitely better at keeping frizz at bay than this cream.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Yes, LOVE it....</li>
            <li> Will buy more.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I decided that I would give it one more shot</li>
            <li> More often though, it just stops working like I expect.</li>
            <li> I told her what I need, and she started pointing out products that weren&#x27;t even appropriate.</li>
            <li> There are many ways to use it.</li>
            <li> We have tried so many products but this product is the winner of all of the styling creams.  </li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> but the amount i have to use to keep my hair under control is more</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE the Deva Products.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with this cream and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> love this cream.  </li>
            <li> love this cream.  </li>
            <li> I wash some of the conditioner out but leave most of it.</li>
            <li> Deva Products work well in my mostly curly hair</li>
            <li> and I like the smell much better.</li>
            <li> It is certainly better than most of the curl creams I have used</li>
            <li> Love every DevaCurl product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Tames my frizzy curls for sure.  </li>
            <li> Love this cream to keep my curly hair from frizzing.  </li>
            <li> but my hair looks hella cute</li>
            <li> Maybe if I didn&#x27;t use the one conditioner it would have worked better.</li>
            <li> I have really naturally curly hair, and this is not to crunchy, but gives my hair the perfect amount of volume and smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> I love this product in addition to the One Condition.</li>
            <li> I recently got a deva cut and when my hair was styled it looked the best that it has ever been!!!!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love this system.  </li>
            <li> still looks great even straight</li>
            <li> still looks great even straight</li>
            <li> and I must say I love ALL of the products!&lt;br /&gt;The styling cream</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK product for defining curls</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried way better products for styling my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I am going to apply this product underneath the hair, instead to the top of the hair and see if that will make a difference.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite Deva products, I use this and the DevaCare One Condition.</li>
            <li> love the product......would not use anything else on my hair</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Nothing else works better for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Scrunch some more in.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t run my fingers through my hair any more</li>
            <li> and my hair has never looked better, even in humid climates.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shoulder length or more and somewhat</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need to add more, just needed to touch up my hair</li>
            <li> I like biolage better, but can&#x27;t afford it.  </li>
            <li> But this is better than then the Nexxus products.  </li>
            <li> I like this cream better than gels because it doesn&#x27;t give my hair that crunch.</li>
            <li> Love this product line.</li>
            <li> Love, Love This styling cream.</li>
            <li> I like the devacurl foam much better.  </li>
            <li> and I am hopeful they will work better for me</li>
            <li> I even bought the Deva dryer as well in my attempt to seriously love my curly hair and discard the straighteners.  </li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t spend over $20 like at Ulta.</li>
            <li> it made my curls better defined...</li>
            <li> i love it when everyone ask what have you done to your curls they are Sexier than ever...</li>
            <li> I love all the Deva products and this is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried the Styling Cream on a whim and fell in love.</li>
            <li> Redken&#x27;s Curvaceous Shampoo and conditioner are way better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this styling cream.</li>
            <li> I have straight fine hair and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says and is a welcome addition to my normal hair routine.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, frizz-free and my wavy/curly hair looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had pretty good results with DevaCurl&#x27;s No-Poo and One Condition, but all of their styling products seem to promote the conditions I&#x27;m looking to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soft, shiny, beautiful wavy hair?</li>
            <li> The cream makes my curls soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> To my nose, it reminds me of bubblegum and is kind of sickly sweet.  </li>
            <li> To my nose, it reminds me of bubblegum and is kind of sickly sweet.  </li>
            <li> All well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> Smell is okay, kinda strong.</li>
            <li> It smells strongly like Starburst, which is not terrible but not a smell taken from nature, like fruit or citrus or herbs or coconut or anything.  </li>
            <li> Looks perfect in humid or dry weather.</li>
            <li> Nice addition to your routine if you are looking for a cream that will be smooth and light.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all it takes -- great, non-frizzy curls that feel soft.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is great for naturally curly/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> But then when comparing prices I realized that DevaCurl was much, much more affordable and would still allow me to use sulfate free products.  </li>
            <li> Great for smoothing the frizzies out of your natural curls.</li>
            <li> I tried it on wet hair (after finger combing) and hoped for the best.</li>
            <li> I have very fickle curls that need a stronger hold to create and keep good curls going throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair silky and full of bounce!</li>
            <li> and I think that&#x27;s true!).</li>
            <li> It was so strong</li>
            <li> Looks like I&#x27;ll be sticking to my one true hair love, Bumble and Bumble.</li>
            <li> I loved the seller the product smells wonderfully but as a African American he did not do wonders for my hair</li>
            <li> This is the first product that I&#x27;ve found that defines curls and still has my hair feeling nice.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST HANDS DOWN.</li>
            <li> But then I went to a Deva certified stylist who not only gave me a fantastic haircut but showed me the right way to use all the Deva products to get the best results.</li>
            <li> My hair is full, soft, and has defined curls...looks very healthy because it is!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair but a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> I have ultra fine hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fine</li>
            <li> I just think its not going to work for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have friends with fine curly hair</li>
            <li> Did not work well on my fine permed hair.</li>
            <li> Packaging was fine.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying product after product to get my fine hair to behave.  </li>
            <li> I have fine color-treated curly hair and this combination helps to keep the frizz away.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very soft but has good hold.</li>
            <li> I was excited about finally have beautiful curls...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find advice for my certain hair, from anyone who HAS this kind of hair.</li>
            <li> and I still love it as much as I first did!</li>
            <li> I use about the size of a quarter or a bit more and work it through my hair using a large tooth comb to be sure that all the hair is coated.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my curls looking good and conditioned and not stiff.  </li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;test run&amp;#34; fit the bill.</li>
            <li> but overall it&#x27;s great if I use in generously.</li>
            <li> This has been a fantastic upgrade for me.</li>
            <li> Again make my hair feel smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> So happy to have finally found a product that works wonders for my curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Overall great product.</li>
            <li> I also use the Lo Poo and Conditioner and Set it Free.  </li>
            <li> the Deva Curl makes the hair smooth and shiny</li>
            <li> Deva&#x27;s Set It Free.  </li>
            <li> It Free adds shine.  </li>
            <li> , I liberally apply the curl creme and then scrunch Set It Free into my hair, then continue to scrunch my hair with a Deva Curl towel.</li>
            <li> I add it to the Ang-gel and one conditioner and spread it thru my hair and it gives it a smooth polished look that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> is light but holds my curl definition and aids against the frizzies.  </li>
            <li> I have had fabulous</li>
            <li> &amp; the final curly styling looks great.  </li>
            <li> My curls looked fantastic at the end of each day and i was out and about quite a</li>

            <li> far, I&#x27;m absolutely loving DevaCurl and can&#x27;t wait to try more products in the line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as Pillow Soft, by any stretch.</li>
            <li> DevaCurl Styling Cream - 5.1 Oz]] is anmazing for wonderful curls but no tacky stiff hair.</li>
            <li> I have very tight curls, and this cream is perfect</li>
            <li> The price of this is much better than the Wen styling cream and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I compared it to the original and not even the consistency</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed by the hold at all.</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> If I leave some conditioner in her long curly hair and finish with the styling cream, my daughter&#x27;s hair looks great.</li>
            <li> Originally, I applied the two separately</li>
            <li> It is about $7.00 more than their styling gels and while most people will need to use a bit more gel to get similar results as this cream I don&#x27;t think it quite balances out.</li>
            <li> I love curling cremes though, which is why I was so thrilled when they finally came out with one.</li>
            <li> Nice, natural curls, not crunchy, smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> It Free spray - on those super humid days</li>
            <li> My hair always looks amazing when I use this, and the creme makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> has made good under their damaged in shipping policy, but I have to wonder why these bottles are so fragile in the first place to not be able to withstand a routine delivery.</li>
            <li> Amazing product line for naturally curly, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I had great volume on both my first and second day hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have thick curly hair, this cream will be your best friend.</li>
            <li> Has a light lemon scent that I&#x27;m not crazy about</li>
            <li> All those commercials on TV are full of poo...</li>
            <li> I love the whole Deva line</li>
            <li> I love the whole Deva line</li>
            <li> This is more reasonably priced and easier to get.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t need much product to make my hair look great, even with thick hair, so the longevity on this seems good.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t need much product to make my hair look great, even with thick hair, so the longevity on this seems good.  </li>
            <li> With this Deva cream, I can actually go three days and look good...</li>
            <li> It made such a good lotion.  </li>
            <li> makes my hair feel soft and still keeps the curl nice.</li>
            <li> Love this cream for in between styling of my very curly hair.</li>
            <li> My curls are much softer and shines love these products</li>
            <li> Makes hair smell incredible and hold curls, it doesn&#x27;t make hair stiff and crunchy and keeps the frizz at bay.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with my Light Defining Gel right after No-pooing and One Conditioning.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d probably come back to it if I wasn&#x27;t finding anything else I liked better (since it&#x27;s pretty pricey).</li>
            <li> This might be for other people&#x27;s hair and I&#x27;m happy for them if it works</li>
            <li> This might be for other people&#x27;s hair and I&#x27;m happy for them if it works</li>
            <li> This product, in conjunction with DevaCurl One Condition, does a great job of enhancing my curl pattern without leaving my hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; like some other products do.</li>
            <li> Since it was spendier than other hair products I was thinking that this must be a really good strong product that they&#x27;re selling.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Deva products but this is my favorite thus far.</li>
            <li> I like that it does not have a super &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This really works good on my naturally waves to set them in.</li>
            <li> Set Me Up), but it rarely looks good enough to leave the house as 2nd-day-hair.  </li>
            <li> my hair super puffy</li>
            <li> This product kept my hair fairly soft and frizz free, but more wavy than curly.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was quick with Prime and on time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a super addition</li>
            <li> She says it makes her hair celebrity status worthy.</li>
            <li> It Free, you hair smells like a candy shop for a hot minute, but that quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li> I will buy this again, and I&#x27;m the kind of person who, as a general rule, will not</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you so much shampooguy!!</li>
            <li> This product really works!!</li>
            <li> It works super well with my curls (3c) and is very hydrating but light.</li>
            <li> I really like deva curl products, but they aren&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;friendly to baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> so it gives me voluminous yet a little beachy curls and during winter I scrunch and diffuse and its great.</li>
            <li> I am naturally curly-haired, I just need a little finesse to the curls them selves, this product should be used after towel drying but when hair is still damp for the best results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;that even experienced hair dressers have trouble working with it.  </li>
            <li> this is a great heavy moisture cream for curls.</li>
            <li> Deva has spent a great deal of effort and time to assure us that, after years of fighting curly hair, they have the styling products and the magic blow dryer that will at last give us the look we want</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> All the Deva Curl products are worth the money.  </li>
            <li> but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> it can&#x27;t look any worse than it does now!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her customer service skills were so impressive</li>
            <li> I will now wear my hair curly way more often than straight because this product really works.</li>
            <li> My own mother has switched to the complete line after seeing what my hair has become capable of.  </li>
            <li> The smell is fresh.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would leave my Curly hair nice and soft but its very sticky and would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I love how it smells but for 20 bucks I expected more.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the no-poo shampoo or conditioner - for my money</li>
            <li> and I saw a pretty quick reaction to the spring in my curls after running it through my hair.</li>
            <li> Her advice was that if I was going to only go with a cream (and not switch my shampoo or conditioner) I&#x27;d be better off going with Livingproof, but I was willing to do the whole system, she thought I&#x27;d like DevaCurl better.  </li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s right for my hair.</li>
            <li> I just need to put in the right amount, which tends to be two quarter size pumps.</li>
            <li> I got my hair cut by a Devachan-trained stylist for the first time last week, and he used this cream on my hair, giving amazing results...</li>
            <li> Love the cream, it cuts down on frizz and is much more moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bumble and Bumble Curl Conscious Defining Creme for many years and LOVE IT, but they stopped making it in the liter bottle, so I thought I&#x27;d give something cheaper a try before I went out and bought the regular bottles in bulk.</li>
            <li> I am looking for a product that will enhance my natural curls and stop them becoming frizzy as the day goes on.  </li>
            <li> It is worth very penny!</li>
            <li> Have not been able to find it in the stores and love that I can order it on Amazon and save a little money along the way as well.</li>
            <li> this stuff is not great its not even good and to top it off the pump</li>
            <li> Great product to tame those curls!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s cool, but it&#x27;s what this conditioner does for my dry hair that I really love.  </li>
            <li> Great solution for very curly hair-keeps it relatively tame without the drying effects of gel.</li>
            <li> Very smooth results.h big rollers...can you believe it works???</li>
            <li> Perfect for towel dried curly hair, makes curly hair light without weighing it down!</li>
            <li> It never looks &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; and will just make your curls frizz free and soft.</li>
            <li> use daily and love it</li>
            <li> Absolutely will buy this again!</li>
            <li> day I was in an Ulta whose manager treats me like I have a communicable disease and shoplift; praying that the first person to offer help would not be her.</li>
            <li> The one thing that bothered her the most is how short her hair is when curly.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used this product</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what it did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many styling creams to find the &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; of products, and I have to say, this is definitely a holy grail product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks great for at least two days.</li>
            <li> It is sort of funny that between the Styling Cream and the Set</li>
            <li> I am SO glad that Deva Curl FINALLY came out with a curl creme!</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s starting to get more volume.</li>
            <li> I have just finished my first canister of this styling cream.</li>
            <li> A pump of this cream, shake my curls out a bit, and I&#x27;m ready for any type of weather!</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t love about this styling cream is the smell.  </li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t love about this styling cream is the smell.  </li>
            <li> hair dresser first introduced me to this product.  </li>
            <li> I use the whole product line!</li>
            <li> Since I started using this product, my hair looks healthier and everybody comments how pretty my curls are.</li>
            <li> IF I put some coconut oil on first.</li>
            <li> and I have tried sooooo many different products designed for curly hair.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all simply advertising and nothing more.  </li>
            <li> Again, use very sparingly!</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft and frizz free, but also locks in curl.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with DevaCurl products.</li>
            <li> Makes hair so soft, I am very curly and love this new product.</li>
            <li> My waves were full and soft.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t get past the very strong sweet smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looked alot better than before, but the gel was making my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I use the styling cream after and blow dry it with a diffuser (much better curl definition than letting it air-dry).</li>
            <li> so I was hoping to find something (anything, please) that would make my hair looks defined and healthy in dry AZ and</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, very surprised this did not work for my baby fine, naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little odd but curled my hair great !</li>
            <li> Imparts a nice shine.&lt;br /&gt;- Very moisturizing but does not weigh down the hair.</li>
            <li> and you have to have clean hands - no other products or lotions on them - for it to spread evenly.  </li>
            <li> so I was certain I would go through a 5 oz.</li>
            <li> I had heard great things about DevaCurl, but they are overpriced and don&#x27;t live up to the reputation, at least with this product.</li>
            <li> My hair dried quickly and my curls were more defined.  </li>
            <li> I usually purchase it at the salon for a significant amount more.</li>
            <li> Makes lovely loose curls!  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for shine.</li>
            <li> I really like that Deva now has a cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much rather use Aveda&#x27;s Be Curly product line.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
            <li> It tames it some -- but not as much as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> When I go get my hair cut, the stylists always want to try to use a diffuser on it, and my hair always ends up looking very clown-ish and they end up using a straightening iron.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe I got it so fast.  </li>
            <li> have found that DevaCurl Styling cream REALLY helps to ease the frizz.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it again on my whole head while my hair was damp.</li>
            <li> I really like this so far, and most likely will buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> It takes about 2 pumps for my whole head.  </li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t use too much) and run it through my hair.  </li>
            <li> Using too much will make my (3A curly) hair sticky and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Nothing - absolutely nothing - holds my curls as well as this.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t  need much to get a lot of results.</li>
            <li> Scrunch as your drying and it dries very curly.</li>
            <li> Gives my curls so much moisturize.</li>
            <li> I actually really like this cream underneath a gel for hold.</li>
            <li> While this cream does hold the curl, it does absolutely nothing for the frizz.</li>
            <li> really helps the curls come to life.</li>
            <li> This really helps keep my curls from being too frizzy in humid weather.  </li>
            <li> (Use VERY sparingly)</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Works very well, just a bit sticky.</li>
            <li> This product smoothes my hair and really defines my curls.  </li>
            <li> It really helps define my curls.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been trying to find a styling product for my very curly hair &amp; I&#x27;ve had no luck until now.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> This really controls frizz.  </li>
            <li> and I am not someone who wants to take any time with my hair.  </li>
            <li> Deva Curl Light Defining Gel (Formerly Angel) 32oz]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair dries fast and doesn&#x27;t feel slimey.  </li>
            <li> After 30 years of fighting my curly hair with everything from up dos to relaxers as well as Brazilian and Japanese straitening at the salon, I finally enjoy having curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then follow with Devacurl Frizz Free Volumizing Foam to give my curls some extra hold.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much for my frizzy, curly 2C/3A hair.</li>
            <li> have very processed hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> but I really hoped this would help my curly hair stay curly after it dries.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping so much that it would work.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> This styling cream looked so promising.</li>
            <li> I used to use the anGEL but didn&#x27;t like how &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; it would leave my hair with the gel casts and I felt that it was drying my hair out too much (might have just been me being paranoid).</li>
            <li> so I had to order her a whole bottle.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> (I was told it disrupts the curls too much</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and healthy and the wave definition is definitely on par with what I was getting from Livingproof.  </li>
            <li> you have curly hair and are constantly questing for new products, I highly recommend finding a Deva trained stylist in your area and going in at least once for the stylist to recommend products and how to use them best for your hair.</li>
            <li> While it is a better value if you think of it interms of cost per use (rather than cost per once) since you don&#x27;t need to use very much, I still think it is slightly overpriced.</li>
            <li> Nice and moist but still makes hair stiff</li>
            <li> Works best on wet (not dripping) hair when mixed with a little water first.</li>
            <li> I have curly long hair that tends to freeze easily.</li>
            <li> I have been walking around with frizzy, wilted curls and while other parts are more straight.</li>
            <li> Maybe their other products are better.  </li>
            <li> I would buy more, try some other of their products, and recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was excited when Deva Concepts released this product but was put off by the price relative to the amount of product you get.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, dry, thinning and permed.</li>
            <li> I never knew it&#x27;s full potential.  </li>
            <li> The first two days I used this (first and second day hair) were very windy.</li>
            <li> It somehow manages to be both overly sweet and chemical at the same time.</li>
            <li> This one is for a more loose natural look with plenty of movement in the hair.</li>
            <li> I was able to get two applications for my long, medium density, 3c hair with enough left over for one application for my mother who has medium length fine 4a hair.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the Deva product and the fact that they do not weigh the hair down.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this!</li>
            <li> I had a gift certificate from Christmas and really needed some new hair products.  </li>
            <li> I really like this new curling cream from DevaCurl.  </li>
            <li> The less I use, the better.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find that I got the same results scrunching the product into dry hair as wet, something that I can&#x27;t really do with gel.</li>
            <li> It actually make it feel soft and smooth once it re-dried.</li>
            <li> and I used a decent amount of the product</li>
            <li> The Moroccan Oil brand is more expensive but it provides more moisture</li>
            <li> no seriously the path of 80% unused product bottles wraps around the globe, my tree hugging eco Portland ego is ashamed to admit.  </li>
            <li> My hair pulled into nice spirals, but...it was so ridiculously soft that it&lt;br /&gt;soon was stringy and limp.  </li>
            <li> I use two pumps for type 3a hair that is between hip and classic length.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly Botticelli-type curls and live in a high humidity area.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest the No-Poo and Conditioner as well.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Start with a little bit and add more as needed.</li>
            <li> It is light enough to comb through and my hair always feels clean, no weighed down.</li>
            <li> Not heavy and really tames the curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for a few months, and my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Stuff is pricey (normal price) but I cannot deny that it works.</li>
            <li> I normally use it with the b&#x27;leave in conditioner and the ultra defining gel.</li>
            <li> For those oldsters out there: I went from Roseanne Rosannah Dannah to relatively normal looking hair.  </li>
            <li> Although I still have the occasionally &amp;#34;bad hair day,&amp;#34; pretty consistently these products in combination produce soft, shiny waves.  </li>
            <li> I prefer Catwalk Curl Cream, which is much more heavy and does the job well.</li>
            <li> Personally, I find it leaves my hair feeling kind of heavy, but as if there&#x27;s too much hair product on it.  </li>
            <li> Most products are too oily or too heavy resulting in a disaster on my head.  </li>
            <li> but I feel like for the price you can find similar products with nice Deva-like ingredients for less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through at least 3 large bottles of the gel (light and firm) and liked the look-</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> and I have to live with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cannot live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> live in AZ and travel to CA often</li>
            <li> Just a light quick few sprays it enough and doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft and gives more hold, but I thought doing that made my hair feel heavy, but I did try it.  </li>
            <li> It also makes my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> makes my curls soft and springy!</li>
            <li> What I love about this over other mousse/gel is that you just put it in - no scrunching necessary!</li>
            <li> Previous shipments arrived fine, and the product performed satisfactorily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First thing I have found that actually keeps my curls under control all day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural life!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product to use by itself or in conjunction with other DevaCurl products!  </li>
            <li> It did a great job, using relatively little product when compared to the handful of ArcAngel gel that I usually use.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and coarse so it easily supports the heaviness of the cream, but I can see if you used very much it would be too much-</li>
            <li> I have brown curly Caucasian hair, but it&#x27;s not very thick or textured.</li>
            <li> but my hair is mostly wavy and by mid day it weighs it down.</li>
            <li> She thought that maybe I had life problems and was very stressed out, but the truth was that nothing was different in my life except that I was trying and new shampoo and conditioner and style produce.</li>
            <li> I have always gotten complements on the health of my hair by my hair dresser, after a little over a month of using this produce she was very worried about me because my hair went from being healthy and manageable  to extremely dry and notted at the ends.</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t too heavy for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I loved how it didn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy like other products can, nor did my hair look like it was wet all day long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long and can by very very frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair is so very fine, so I tried using a non&lt;br /&gt;sulfate shampoo other than my regular low poo by Deva.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and not stiff when I use this</li>
            <li> Let me make it clear.</li>
            <li> Some clear liquid was all over it, inside cap, and you can see it floating inside at the bottom under the cream.</li>
            <li> The result is soft, defined</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t crispy and the curls are soft.</li>
            <li> BUT my curls stay cute for at least 3 days (got 5 days one time).</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is manageable and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly and frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> and I only use about two pumps for my whole head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had people ask if I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always gone natural...</li>
            <li> Unlike mousse, this product leaves your curls soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Then I take an old cotton t-shirt and scrunch the excess water out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My curls are soft &amp; holds all day.</li>
            <li> If you have naturally curly hair, you&#x27;ll want this before blow drying with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested it because I get knots under the back of my hair since it&#x27;s very curly.  </li>
            <li> The product description says it &amp;#34;Provides natural hold, humidity resistance and leaves curls</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft, not crunchy.</li>
            <li> My curls look and feel soft.  </li>
            <li> and this helps control it and make it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair dries soft and my curls are bouncy.  </li>
            <li> It was way too soft.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A RELAXING MOISTURIZING FLUID and Davines OI / Oil Absolute Beautifying Potion and my hair</li>
            <li> THIS IS A RELAXING MOISTURIZING FLUID and Davines OI / Oil Absolute Beautifying Potion and my hair</li>
            <li> Leaves hair shiny with natural curls.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to all who have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> We use all DevaCurl products for my 17 year old with ringlet curls.</li>
            <li> My hair does not have a soft and silky texture after applying this product.</li>
            <li> Just scrunch it through the hair, throw it back and gently finger style.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and it locks the curls</li>
            <li> This product works well on my hair, leaves it soft and naturally curly without the frizz.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy/kinky hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing the 3 products as a whole system overall.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and when my sister the hair stylist recommended it to me</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before this, I was using Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft.</li>
            <li> This makes my curls look natural and soft.  </li>
            <li> My curls are soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> love this have thick wavy/curly hair</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample and figured maybe it would help my fine, barely wavy hair get a little oomph.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got big loose curls, that will quickly turn into Roseanne Roseannadanna hair if I touch it too much or don&#x27;t use enough product.  </li>
            <li> After gently towel drying my hair, I put a tiny dab (the first time, I used too much -- my hair felt heavy and sort of greasy</li>
            <li> Itâ€™s not typically tight curly  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product in conjunction with gel, especially if you are transitioning to natural.</li>
            <li> directions on the bottle are pretty vague, as they are on most Deva bottles:</li>
            <li> As I got older, I tried serums, gels, all the stuff you can get at the local monopolizing &amp;#34;Mart&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I still have to use something different the first day of washing hair but this product smooths out the frizzy the following day</li>
            <li> In the past I have had to be fairly heavy handed with curl creams to get good results</li>
            <li> I have extremely tight, curly hair; perhaps this would be better for those ladies who have loose curls or waves.  </li>
            <li> I apply it the same why that I applied the anGEL with my head down, coating the underside and then flipping my hair over while doing a light coat over the sides and scrunching.</li>
            <li> I dye it regularly and high heat wave, curl, or straighten depending on my mood.  </li>
            <li> For a long time I thought it didn&#x27;t like my hair wavy, but then realized it was only because I hadn&#x27;t found the right product to style it.</li>
            <li> I use it when my hair is wet and dry and it always makes a huge improvement on my frizz.</li>
            <li> Tries this after getting a diva cut at a local salon, and it makes such a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Then, I gently dab at my hair until it&#x27;s not dripping, which doesn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li> (I do this with pretty sopping wet hair).</li>
            <li> I use a gel over it for maximum frizz prevention (which I do with any curling creme I&#x27;ve ever used), but with this product, my curls do not end up weighted down as happens with many other products I have used (I have Botticelli curls).</li>
            <li> It will only see the light of day again if I run out of everything else and just have to have a little dollop of cream in my hair in an emergency.</li>
            <li> My red color hardly fades, and my waves are shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I recently got a much needed cut and the stylist used this product as well as the low poo shampoo and one conditioner</li>
            <li> DevaCurl is the only product I will put on my natural curly hair, and my daughter&#x27;s naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly blonde hair, and have written many a review on here for curly-girl products.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected thank you!</li>
            <li> this is my first time to use this styling cream based on other people&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li> My hair is very, very dry and very curly.</li>
            <li> I actually feel like it made my naturally curly hair frizzier.</li>
            <li> when I used a minimal to medium amount my hair was very frizzy</li>
            <li> That was because it was mostly unmanageable and frizzy, and would usually start looking strange and lose its bounce by the third week from the products I used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> about 1/2 the time to wear it straight and the rest of the time I scrunch it when wet to wear it wavy.  </li>
            <li> curl conscious defining cream, but B&amp;B seems to be the only product that keeps the frizz at bay all day.</li>
            <li> After years of blowdrying I finally decided to embrace my natural curl.  </li>
            <li> And, now, after 3 years of using it, even if I don&#x27;t dry it and let it air dry, with just a little bit of condition left in (I always leave the One Condition in), it dries curly and beautiful (just don&#x27;t usually have the volume, but after some scrunching, it&#x27;s fine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I gently towel dry my hair with a regular towel (no rubbing!)</li>
            <li> its really right down the middle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odd because the rest of the line has a pretty benign smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odd because the rest of the line has a pretty benign smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped my hair hang on to the little bit of wave that it has, made it hold up a little better through the day.</li>
            <li> but I have to use with other products to really define my hair the way I like it.</li>
            <li> I then clip, add some of the new Spray Gel on my roots and ends, and dry.  </li>
            <li> many other reviewers have said, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> okay that was a bit dramatic</li>
            <li> But, in the end, it was like trying to smile at someone&#x27;s ugly baby, pretending that it&#x27;s cute.</li>
            <li> My daughter recently transitioned back to her naturally curly hair after years of straightening it.  </li>
            <li> The styling creme isn&#x27;t as creamy and thick as Aveda&#x27;s is; it feels much more watery than what I expected.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve managed to finally tame the beast with Deva-Curl products, and a few amazing haircuts at the Deva-style dry cut salons.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have all the bad stuff (sulfates and silicones) like other products made for curly hair and keeps hair healthy and strong.  </li>
            <li> Even the Folica forums are filled with people much younger than myself, with time to mess with their hair endlessly.</li>
            <li> I can blow dry my hair straight and it works, or just apply product and let my hair air dry.  </li>
            <li> It really helps keep the frizz down.  </li>
            <li> I think sometimes I get weighed down and becomes straight and oily.</li>
            <li> some of the ringlets at the bottom were more  defined than when I had used a minimal amount but the amount of frizz and dry hair throughout my head was just unbelievable</li>
            <li> This gives the right amount of definition without being either oily or crunchy, and it perks up the second (or even third) day with a little spritzer to bring curl back.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I put too much stock into the hyperbolic claims typical of product blurbs on Amazon</li>
            <li> This styling cream creates soft curls, it is not a sticky product, gives a soft hold without weighing curls down.</li>
            <li> This cream is nothing special and, for me, gel from even the least expensive sources does better to form and set curls.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m careful not to touch my hair too much, or I put a braid in my hair and wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to put too much hard gel in her hair, and the DevaCurl Styling Cream is just right.</li>
            <li> I normally just put this in my hair when it is wet and let it air dry - even being in humid Florida</li>
            <li> She specializes in curly hair cuts and uses dry hair cuts for curls ( you can find a dry cut specialist in you area by googling \\&quot;natural curly website\\&quot; and using the \\&quot;find a local salon\\&quot; tab.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey considering how much you get, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have rather short hair at this time and it is now grown out just long enough to go back to curling it without looking like a clown with a hangover.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had to use a lot of product so it not working when I use minimal product didn&#x27;t completely shut me down as far as optimism.</li>
            <li> While it does reduce frizz overall, you may still need serum/something else to tame the frizz at your crown in the new england summer!</li>
            <li> (3B) curls the past few years using Kinky Curly Curling Custard and a cheap gel (Herbal Essences</li>
            <li> this is finally something that does what it says (as long as you follow the ENTIRE plan).  </li>
            <li> Using too much of this will result in a slightly greasy look, so be careful.</li>
            <li> can* use too much, but after my hair dries the frizz has decreased, and my hair looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if what I got is counterfeit or real</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried the No-Poo Cleanser and Conditioner on the days I flat iron my hair along with my Davines</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried the No-Poo Cleanser and Conditioner on the days I flat iron my hair along with my Davines</li>
            <li> Especially since my curls are so flat at times after a long while of straightening my hair every day.  </li>
            <li> This product holds my thick, coarse hair into very well-behaved curls and lasts an entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one drawback, however, is that you can&#x27;t &amp;#34;scrunch&amp;#34; your curls to break up the product once your hair dries like you can with the gel.</li>
            <li> I hate the look of wet curls, so I search often on a good product for a natural look.  </li>
            <li> i doubt this amount will last very long.</li>
            <li> It actually felt a lot dry after using the product.</li>
            <li> Let me caution you about using it as a final touch up on dry or mostly dry hair: you may look like you didn&#x27;t wash your hair recently.</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian and have extremely dry, coarse, poofy, curly hair</li>
            <li> so I think at least the shampoo and conditioner are versatile enough to use on straight and wavy days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I think at least the shampoo and conditioner are versatile enough to use on straight and wavy days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can rinse it and then towel dry your hair and put a bit back in to stay.  </li>
            <li> I have been putting in on my hair once it is almost dry (after using a bit of gel and/or deva curl foam) and it provides the final touch.  </li>
            <li> I was using DevaCurl gel and it took a long time for my hair to dry, and after using DevaCurl styling cream it was a big difference.  </li>
            <li> Very concentrated; you only need a very small amount to get optimal results.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> will say a little goes far.  </li>
            <li> guess these could have failed after high altitude air cargo transport, but being winter, I doubt these containers saw too much internal pressure from high ambient temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon</li>
            <li> I first tried this on a very small section of my hair while dry.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m transitioning it makes my hair really soft and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down!</li>

            <li> You work the conditioner through and leave it on as long as you need it.  </li>

            <li> This and the [[ASIN:B006K25ZYI Deva Curl Spray Gel 8oz]] are the two newest products in the Deva lineup, and I picked both up the other day at my local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> I started following the Curly Girl method a little over a year ago, I actually used other brands, before finally trying out the Deva line.</li>
            <li> The product is white and it leaves little clumps of white in your hair.  </li>
            <li> It does work well just not for very long days.</li>
            <li> In NY; during summer I scrunch and go (let it air dry)</li>
            <li> it took all day to air dry.</li>
            <li> So, she proceeded to dry it, scrunched it and</li>

            <li> I find that if I just use the gel alone, my hair becomes dry and frizzy.</li>

            <li> I have ALWAYS wrapped my hair in towel after showering and then put styling products in after it was just a tad dry.</li>
            <li> Also, if you don&#x27;t distribute it well enough, you get white dried lumps in your hair.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, thick and coarse hair and this product enhances my natural waves, tames frizz, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy.</li>
            <li> (She has very very thin, fine hair made bone white, black, and pink, and plastered to her skull....</li>
            <li> and it helps weight my hair down enough in the dry months.</li>
            <li> , not happy that I paid this much for a product and can not use!</li>
            <li> If your hair starts to dry before getting it all over, wet your hands and run it through the dry areas.</li>
            <li> It weighted my hair down and left it with a greasy type film.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy this product again</li>
            <li> While I very much appreciate the pump mechanism; it allows for ALL the product to be used, It is a bit difficult pumping the product out without anchoring against my body for that extra strength.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (When we all know that if I didn&#x27;t &#x27;do&#x27; my hair I would look like Krusty the Clown)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my second bottle of the Deva Curl, and the price on Amazon is way less than Ulta.</li>
            <li> Scrunched it into my wet hair and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> it was very dry</li>
            <li> to keep my very dry course hair from frizzing.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry</li>
            <li> It give me frizzier hair and it made my hair look and feel very dry.</li>
            <li> It does help the curls form a little tighter and stick together, but it doesn&#x27;t supply enough moisture for my hair.</li>
            <li> The outer box that they arrived in was not damaged except for scuffing, and the bottles themselves were surrounded by those little plastic air pillow things that separated the bottles from an unrelated product in the same order.  </li>
            <li> The next day (I don&#x27;t wash every day) a little water on my hands and ran my fingers through my hair</li>
            <li> I gave up flat ironing about a year and a half ago, and started using Deva Curl products in hopes of reclaiming 7 hours a week, and losing the frizz at the slightest sign of humidity.  </li>
            <li> Other styling solutions seem to dry out my hair and eventually the frizz is all you see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t stop making this product....must have for all of us curly girls.</li>
            <li> I remember liking No Poo and One Conditioner, but I bought, tried and returned every single other product from the line at Ulta.  </li>
            <li> My hair would feel rough</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT a real DevaConcepts product.  </li>
            <li> Be careful of knock offs....</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t working so after doing that my hair was slightly limp during the drying process (from allot of product)  but STILL to my surprise my hair (especially) around the top and around the roots was crazy frizzy when it dried.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not STRAIGHT</li>
            <li> then i expected.</li>
            <li> Now I just wet it a bit and put this styling cream in and</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want to wet it.  </li>
            <li> This MUST be used on wet hair</li>
            <li> so everyday washing is no longer necessary!</li>
            <li> â€¦you know what I am talking aboutâ€¦the crispy crunchy invisible coating that god forbid someone tries to run their hands through your hair they would end up with lacerated knuckles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I scrunch it on when my hair is wet</li>
            <li> if you mix it together with heaven in hair conditioner by devacurl while you are in the shower (AKA hair soaking wet after washing it)</li>
            <li> Packaged well and product as described and expected.</li>
            <li> I use it on wet hair.</li>
            <li> For my hair, my stylist told me to finish in the shower but apply the products while my hair is sopping wet IN the shower.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, somewhat coarse, hair that is also color treated blonde.  </li>
            <li> so my hair is not completely like a black person&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> I just use a little pea-sized amount, rub it through my hair when wet, and let air dry</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way or it will get sticky and greasy.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> 3 pumps, rubbed in hands, placed on newly washed and fairly wet curly, thin hair.....</li>
            <li> However, the road to finding the right products has been long and disappointing at times.  </li>
            <li> I would straighten it all the time because if I let it air dry, it was frizzy (but not because of unruly curls, but that&#x27;s just what happens to thick, wavy, coarse hair).  </li>
            <li> I use the Deva gloves (or a cheese/flour cloth in a pinch) to dry it (as a regular towels loops are too thick and will cause the curls to separate and frizz).  </li>
            <li> (just enough curl past wavy).</li>
            <li> and then all other times I use all no-silicon conditioners) which helps too.</li>
            <li> If you work around anyone who has a juvenile mindset, expect to hear about the white things in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> look like other products.</li>
            <li> For the past several years I had been straightening my curly hair even though I prefer the curls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely Deva Curl quality, but I&#x27;m not sure yet</li>
            <li> I do like the other DevaCurl gel product.</li>
            <li> I used a couple other products in the Deva Curl line years ago, before they reformulated...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but this one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> I have used other DevaCurl products but this is my go-to.</li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> like to put in one squirt (my hair is past shoulder length) and use it as a blowdry cream until my hair is about 3/4 dry, and then squish in another squirt into the ends and shafts, scrunch it in, and let it air dry, for lots of curls.</li>
            <li> In on very wet hair.</li>
            <li> but it made my hair sooooo dry, snarled, and if I even touched my hair it&#x27;d break off!!!  </li>
            <li> I have always hated my curly hair but after I started using Davaconcepts DevaCurl Stying Cream, I love my curly hair!</li>
            <li> Tossed out my flat iron and no more straightening marathons.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy with dry and frizzy hair that I have been trying to tame ever since I grew my hair out two years ago.</li>
            <li> All these commercials for certain brands seemed to stack wax in my hair and it just made it difficult to work with my hair.  </li>
            <li> Just a small amount on my hands smoothed down the length of my hair, wet or dry, gives me the soft,spiraly curls I&#x27;ve always wanted.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I ran out quickly within a few weeks, (my hair is mid back length) Too expensive.</li>
            <li> Just use a little on the tips of damp hair when it is dry or when your hair needs a little patting down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Currently I have it color treated a dark color, and am growing it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle, but it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Still no success with it.  </li>
            <li> If you have dark hair, don&#x27;t buy it.  </li>
            <li> stuff blows your average department store products away.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is on the thin side</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, curly, frizzy hair and this not only tames the beast but smells divine!</li>
            <li> Literally a few pumps worked into WET hair</li>
            <li> More importantly, I hate the smell.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> Defines the curls without weighing them down.  </li>
            <li> Does not weigh my curls down.</li>
            <li> I mix about 2 pumps of this with DevaCurl AnGel and scrunch it in my hair upside down</li>
            <li> so I have to use something that won&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> The Deva products all have a lot of glycerin, which for fine&lt;br /&gt;hair will weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair</li>
            <li> it keeps the frizz away, but doesn&#x27;t weight them down or make them feel greasy.</li>
            <li> : doesn&#x27;t weigh them down, no greasy/sticky feel.  </li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down or sticky and</li>
            <li> Along with a few other products, this stuff gives me no-frizz curls,</li>
            <li> Just a spritz with water and maybe half a pump for the ends of my curls</li>
            <li> I have to keep reminding myself to use less than I think I need.</li>
            <li> So instead of $26 and Cruella DeVille, I can order this for less from the comfort of my home, sitting with my \\&quot;couldn&#x27;t be worse\\&quot; hair :--)</li>
            <li> I typically switch to the foam in the winter.</li>
            <li> I have looked EVERYWHERE for something to help my half-Asian hair (now post-menopausally slightly wavy) look styled.</li>
            <li> slightly humid, beachy CA.</li>
            <li> This stuff turns my frizzy mess into ringlets</li>
            <li> What a mess.  </li>
            <li> Bottle is simple, plain, not gimicky, if you know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> My hair is versatile and not weighed down by a heavy curl product.  </li>
            <li> I am Caucasian and have moderately tight, spiral curls.</li>
            <li> Might require a little product to touch up stubborn frizzy spots though.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little pricier than drugstore</li>
            <li> I also use a little when my hair gets frizzy</li>
            <li> does leave hair a little gummy though</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavier since it&#x27;s a cream</li>
            <li> I started out by putting a little bit in my hair working it through the curls with my fingers with towel dried hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, felt a little heavy in my hair.</li>
            <li> I had very thick, coarse &amp;#34;wavy&amp;#34; hair.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t put harsh chemicals on my curls anymore.  </li>
            <li> Hair clips, round brush, and an up</li>
            <li> My hair type is natural curly, mix of corkscrews and waves, thin hair, but lots of it!</li>
            <li> I read some reviews saying this was too heavy for their hair.  </li>
            <li> It lets me go curly without my hair being sticky, heavy, or crunchy.</li>
            <li> that I had a few breakouts around my forehead and hairline.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy and is not sticky.</li>
            <li> and I have gone from the droopy frizzy lame semi curls to soft spiral loopy curls.  </li>
            <li> I then applied a few pumps of believe in,  4 pumps of the&lt;br /&gt;the curling cream, and  a few pumps of the gel.  </li>
            <li> hair was limp from it.</li>
            <li> Without it the hair starts frizzing within a few hour.</li>
            <li> This product does set your curls, but I find that it leaves a heavy film to the hair.</li>
            <li> When my hair dried there were defined waves</li>
            <li> So, I flip my hair forward and apply a few pumps of the Deva Curl B&#x27;Leave In.</li>
            <li> usually don&#x27;t use gels or products that make my hair feel unnatural, and when I was told to use all these products I was worried it might weigh my curls down or feel gunky, but it doesn&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li> Yep, they&#x27;re a bit stiff to feel, but they look great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have also tried Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s Texture cream, but I prefer the DevaCurl cream as it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stiff and crunchy.</li>
            <li> This seems to keep it under control and does not make it look and feel stiff.  </li>
            <li> but since I was also annoyed that they discontinued their largest size (having thick, long-ish hair, I&#x27;m all about buying in bulk), I decided to keep my options open.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a looonnng way!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this styling cream turns my hair into a fluffy, frizzy, dry, undefined mess.</li>
            <li> A little thick for my taste.  </li>
            <li> It also seems a little too thick and not as lightweight as I would prefer.</li>
            <li> Either they are to heavy or to sticky or make my hair look matte and dull</li>
            <li> sucks don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy again,</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of my usual DevaCurl ArcAngel gel to give it a try.</li>
            <li> (just don&#x27;t usually have the volume, but after some scrunching, it&#x27;s fine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually follow up with the Living Proof Humidity Shield spray as a finishing touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was the change in product or not.</li>
            <li> have not started this bottle yet but have used it in the past.</li>
            <li> Four stars instead of five, only because I wish one product did it all and because these products are expensive.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure why this cream smells the way it does.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure why this cream smells the way it does.  </li>
            <li> For my, slightly past shoulder length, hair I was told to use 2 pumps .</li>
            <li> I usually do this twice.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair curly, and moisturized, with a small amount of the product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend the extra money on the Deva products and the expensive hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> the first cut, I told her I hate putting product in my hair</li>
            <li> If you have tight, corkscrew curls, however,  or if you prefer not to make people nauseated every time the breeze blows through your locks, I&#x27;d save my money.  </li>
            <li> The bubblegum scent hits me hard when I apply it, but over time it seems to go</li>
            <li> The bubblegum scent hits me hard when I apply it, but over time it seems to go</li>
            <li> only some of the curls came out defined and in ringlets the rest was like a crazy cat ladies hair...</li>
            <li> Thankfully, this isn&#x27;t a hair product where the scent lingers, at least when used with the rest of the system.  </li>

            <li> Unfortunately, It did not really do anything  for my hair.</li>
            <li> It takes about 8 pumps of the gel for my thick shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> This styling cream is thick and coats my curls.  </li>

            <li> I have thick, wavy &amp;#34;2b&amp;#34; hair and use this product together with</li>
            <li> If you have thick curly hair, I don&#x27;t recommend it; on my hair, it feels like glue.</li>
            <li> A failure has kept us from using the product inside.</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s not as expensive as other products!</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this product, I hated it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cloying and overpowering, it&#x27;s enough to make you sick.</li>
            <li> I have curly ringlets medium course very thick medium length hair.</li>
            <li> the cantainor was broken.</li>
            <li> or if you had thin hair, or tenuous curls it is probably not the product for you.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so frustrating.</li>
            <li> Instead, it left my hair with this terrible aroma and styled in a droopy, waxy coif.  </li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> #fail.</li>
            <li> #fail.</li>
            <li> Is there something I&#x27;m doing wrong with this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Amazon doesn&#x27;t do returns of health and beauty, so I will try to endure it</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> Eventually, you can&#x27;t keep up the fake grin</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> I told her it was hard to find stuff that worked, and she said: (brace for it) \\&quot;Well</li>
            <li> so my hair was going to be a crazy mix.  </li>
            <li> Thank you thank you Deva Concepts for a product that works on my weird hair!</li>
            <li> Bad</li>
            <li> so i was obviously frustrated.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed as the product does not do what it claims to.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed because I wanted to like the line.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream in conjunction with the Devacurl shampoo and conditioner (which I like) and have found this product to be VERY disappointing.</li>
            <li> I hate paying $30 for Bumble and Bumble</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, this product smells awful.  </li>
            <li> This stuff was terrible on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I also use DevaCare defining gel to help keep the frizz at bay and prevent fly-aways, but it&#x27;s the styling cream that helps my curls from turning into a terrible 90s afro.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using DevaCurl products from over a year now and I ordered this in placed of the Volumizing Foam. I haven&#x27;t gone back. Love the cream, it cuts down on frizz and is much more moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Defines curls. Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. Doesn&#x27;t do much for shine.</li>
            <li> Prompt shipping, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> when I got the product it was opened and it spilled on the box. the cantainor was broken. but I love the product itself</li>
            <li> My family of Curly Girls loves DevaCurl products. Since we have four people using a lot of hair product, I looked to Amazon to see if I could find pricing that&#x27;s easier on my wallet. This &amp;#34;test run&amp;#34; fit the bill. The bottles were sealed and in great shape -- just as I would have found them in the salon, but at a better price.</li>
            <li> This styling cream has a wonderful scent and a smooth, non-greasy feeling.  It helps with setting my waves without the crunchy, greasy look of a gel.  It also makes my hair very soft.  Very happy I gave it a try!</li>
            <li> I really like that Deva now has a cream but I do not like that it only lasts for a short period of time compared to the cost. It didn&#x27;t hold my hair as well as I would have liked but overall it&#x27;s great if I use in generously. Unfortunately I ran out quickly within a few weeks, (my hair is mid back length) Too expensive.</li>
            <li> If you have thick curly hair, this cream will be your best friend. It never looks &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; and will just make your curls frizz free and soft.</li>
            <li> makes my curls soft and springy!</li>
            <li> This and the [[ASIN:B006K25ZYI Deva Curl Spray Gel 8oz]] are the two newest products in the Deva lineup, and I picked both up the other day at my local beauty supply store. I have Wavy hair, and since the Styling Cream is targeted towards botticelli and corkscrew curls, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work for me.  I decided to try it, though, since I&#x27;ve had good luck with most Deva curl products -- and it&#x27;s been working great on my fine, wavy hair -- turning my waves into botticelli curls and soft spirals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions on the bottle are pretty vague, as they are on most Deva bottles: \\&quot;For added definition and lift, follow with DevaCurl Spray Gel to roots and crown.\\&quot; Since this is pretty moisturizing and since on their Facebook page Deva said you could use this in lieu of One Condition as a leave-in, I&#x27;ve been using about three pumps on my hair (which is about three inches past my shoulders), and then have been topping it with AnGel.  I then clip, add some of the new Spray Gel on my roots and ends, and dry.  The result is soft, defined curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started following the Curly Girl method a little over a year ago, I actually used other brands, before finally trying out the Deva line. I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for a few months, and my hair has never looked better. My red color hardly fades, and my waves are shiny and healthy. I really love their products!</li>
            <li> This stuff is alright. It smells good, and the concept is good, but I think using the conditioner as a leave in works better.</li>
            <li> I have been a user of Aveda&#x27;s Be Curly for many years now, but I thought I would give this product a try. I give it 3 stars; It is okay. It smells really good, but there isn&#x27;t anything spectacular about it. I actually feel like it made my naturally curly hair frizzier. I&#x27;d much rather use Aveda&#x27;s Be Curly product line. The styling creme isn&#x27;t as creamy and thick as Aveda&#x27;s is; it feels much more watery than what I expected.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE  all the Deva Curl products.  I won&#x27;t put harsh chemicals on my curls anymore.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Best thing in the world for curly hair. All the Deva products are fantastic!</li>
            <li> wonderful creamy soft curls!  use daily and love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, I consider myself a product junkie, I&#x27;ve been trying to find a product for my course frizzy curly hair and I think I finally found the products that gets the job done! Since I&#x27;m transitioning it makes my hair really soft and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down! It smells amazing which is an added bonus!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair. My hair is curly with the tendency to be overly frizzy. It tames it some -- but not as much as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I have curly/wavy hair (just enough curl past wavy). It&#x27;s long and can by very very frizzy. When I go get my hair cut, the stylists always want to try to use a diffuser on it, and my hair always ends up looking very clown-ish and they end up using a straightening iron. This cream is the best stuff I have ever used. I switched to no shampoo (only very occasional no-silicon shampoo close to the scalp and then all other times I use all no-silicon conditioners) which helps too. No-poo and low-poo methods are recommended by DevaCurl. But this cream is AWESOME. I just use a little pea-sized amount, rub it through my hair when wet, and let air dry and it looks great. Has a nice sort of fruity smell- not overpowering. You *can* use too much, but after my hair dries the frizz has decreased, and my hair looks very natural. It isn&#x27;t crispy and the curls are soft. If you want more hold, you should try this brand&#x27;s ultra defining gel. This one is for a more loose natural look with plenty of movement in the hair. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The perfect solution for curly hair that is also fine.  Defines the curls without weighing them down.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time.  It really helps keep the frizz down.  I usually purchase it at the salon for a significant amount more.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on June 18th, and received in June 20th.  I couldn&#x27;t believe I got it so fast.  Then when I opened the package - there were gifts!!  Hair clips, round brush, and an up do thingy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, unruly curly hair.  Everything will come in handy, and I didn&#x27;t have to go with \\&quot;ugly hair\\&quot; waiting for my product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that DevaCurl Styling cream REALLY helps to ease the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much shampooguy!!</li>
            <li> Love this! I tried it when I got a haircut at a Deva inspired salon and fell in love. It smells like Skittles to me and gives me solid curls for 3-4 days. I was using One Condition as a leave in and it was good but gave me breakouts. This has been a fantastic upgrade for me. I think it is a bit pricey BUT my curls stay cute for at least 3 days (got 5 days one time). Absolutely will buy this again!</li>
            <li> Good transaction.  Product was as advertised.  Good price.</li>
            <li> I first tried this on a very small section of my hair while dry. It actually make it feel soft and smooth once it re-dried. I used it again on my whole head while my hair was damp. Again make my hair feel smooth and moisturized. I really like this so far, and most likely will buy this again and again. No crunch, no build up. Smells like skittles :). Stuff is pricey (normal price) but I cannot deny that it works.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Keeps my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Works well to control curls without frizz.</li>
            <li> Just wonderful, leaves hair smelling nice, offers good amount of control</li>
            <li> BEST Curly Hair Product on the market by far!  I have tried everything, and nothing ever worked.  So happy to have finally found a product that works wonders for my curly hair.  I highly suggest the No-Poo and Conditioner as well.  My hair type is natural curly, mix of corkscrews and waves, thin hair, but lots of it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got big loose curls, that will quickly turn into Roseanne Roseannadanna hair if I touch it too much or don&#x27;t use enough product.  I gave up flat ironing about a year and a half ago, and started using Deva Curl products in hopes of reclaiming 7 hours a week, and losing the frizz at the slightest sign of humidity.  I&#x27;ve gone through at least 3 large bottles of the gel (light and firm) and liked the look- but wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it.  My hair would feel rough (I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it) and still looked pretty frizzy on days that weren&#x27;t perfect.  It takes about 8 pumps of the gel for my thick shoulder length hair.  I started using this Styling cream a couple months ago.  I feel like it makes my hair look like I want it to.  There is more shine- and it&#x27;s softer.  It takes about 2 pumps for my whole head.  It doesn&#x27;t create the gel cast- it just dries with a nice sheen and defined curls.  I will also use it between washes.  Just a spritz with water and maybe half a pump for the ends of my curls does the trick.  I read some reviews saying this was too heavy for their hair.  My hair is thick and coarse so it easily supports the heaviness of the cream, but I can see if you used very much it would be too much- or if you had thin hair, or tenuous curls it is probably not the product for you.  But for me... I love it!</li>
            <li> I like the definition and moisture this gives to my curls.  I use a gel over it for maximum frizz prevention (which I do with any curling creme I&#x27;ve ever used), but with this product, my curls do not end up weighted down as happens with many other products I have used (I have Botticelli curls).</li>
            <li> The Deva styling cream is the best leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried.  After gently towel drying my hair, I put a tiny dab (the first time, I used too much -- my hair felt heavy and sort of greasy so don&#x27;t use too much) and run it through my hair.  That&#x27;s all it takes -- great, non-frizzy curls that feel soft.  It&#x27;s really a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> sucks don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> My hair is full, soft, and has defined curls...looks very healthy because it is! Sulfate free product and is the best for your hair. Has a light lemon scent that I&#x27;m not crazy about but my hair looks so great, so I still use it.</li>
            <li> Works well on my hair. Holds it together &amp; allows it to curl nicely.</li>
            <li> Overall great product. I have to keep reminding myself to use less than I think I need. Using too much will make my (3A curly) hair sticky and frizzy. The less I use, the better. Works best on wet (not dripping) hair when mixed with a little water first. Reactivates well for no-shower days. Might require a little product to touch up stubborn frizzy spots though.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it does what it promises to do. My hair is manageable and soft to the touch. My curls look amazing too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cream as it says. Smell is okay, kinda strong. What I don&#x27;t like about it is how greasy it makes my hair by itself. I normally use it with the b&#x27;leave in conditioner and the ultra defining gel. That combo works well most of the time. Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly and frizzy hair.  Living in the humid state of LA doesn&#x27;t help.  This product does help, a lot.  I can blow dry my hair straight and it works, or just apply product and let my hair air dry.  This product works great.</li>
            <li> The cream does help to defines curls, my hair was not soft and bouncy. It actually felt a lot dry after using the product.</li>
            <li> I love Deva Curl.  This styling cream is thick and coats my curls.  When I scrunch my hair it stays curly and reduces the frizz.  I also use the Lo Poo and Conditioner and Set it Free.  All the Deva Curl products are worth the money.  I&#x27;m not sure if what I got is counterfeit or real but it works anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to anyone with curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I used this at my sisters&#x27; house and fell in love with it. My hair feels soft and not stiff when I use this and there is no frizz!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for towel dried curly hair, makes curly hair light without weighing it down!</li>
            <li> A little thick for my taste.  Doesnt make my hair feel good.</li>
            <li> I am sure glad I found this product. Together with SET IT FREE my hair never felt or looked so good.</li>
            <li> Nothing - absolutely nothing - holds my curls as well as this.  DevaCurl is the bomb!  Especially since my curls are so flat at times after a long while of straightening my hair every day.  The best part is the smell - it&#x27;s very lovely.  You don&#x27;t  need much to get a lot of results.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly blonde hair, and have written many a review on here for curly-girl products.  I think I&#x27;ve managed to finally tame the beast with Deva-Curl products, and a few amazing haircuts at the Deva-style dry cut salons.  1) never shampoo, 2) use your fingers to comb through with conditioner, never use a comb or brush, 3) flip hair over and apply styling cream to hold curl and maintain moisture, 4) coat curls in silicone-free gel, 5) remove excess moisture with a cotton t-shirt.  Voila! Perfect soft no-frizz curls</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used, after trying and using hundreds for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Does what it says and it is not sticky or leave a film. Just 2 pumps for my long hair. Scrunch as your drying and it dries very curly. I have straight fine hair and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> ALWAYS A GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Let me make it clear. THIS IS THE BEST HANDS DOWN. I was recommended this brand by my hairdresser who also has curly hair. I wanted the va-va-voom hair without the witch-frizz. This is it! Yes, it is a little pricier than drugstore but it is so worth it. I have long hair and I only use about two pumps for my whole head. In NY; during summer I scrunch and go (let it air dry) so it gives me voluminous yet a little beachy curls and during winter I scrunch and diffuse and its great. Also, it smells like heaven. I will buy more once I run out.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use it when my hair is wet and dry and it always makes a huge improvement on my frizz.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Gives my curls so much moisturize. Wonderful in the summer, and an absolute MUST during the winter months.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful.  It smells great and works great.  Makes hair smell incredible and hold curls, it doesn&#x27;t make hair stiff and crunchy and keeps the frizz at bay.  Now I just wish that the cleansing conditioner smelled this good and maybe I could use it.  The price of this is much better than the Wen styling cream and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> When I initially converted to CG, I used only gel. I had curl, but my hair was so damaged that I wasn&#x27;t getting the curls I remembered having when I was younger. I bought this product after reading the reviews, and I LOVE it. After scrunching out the excess water with a tee shirt, I apply a moderate amount of this then follow up with a generous amount of gel. Using too much of this will result in a slightly greasy look, so be careful. This product bundles my curls nicely and makes &#x27;em shine, while the gel adds protein and sets my curls in place. (For gel, I either use the Angel or Aussie Instant Freeze, if I need a harder hold.) I highly recommend this product in conjunction with gel, especially if you are transitioning to natural.</li>
            <li> I have always hated my curly hair but after I started using Davaconcepts DevaCurl Stying Cream, I love my curly hair!</li>
            <li> This product is a must-have in my bathroom cabinet. I can&#x27;t live without it. After showering and towel drying my hair, I put 1-2 pumps in my hands and scrunch it through my hair. It leaves my hair soft, frizz-free and my wavy/curly hair looks beautiful. I can&#x27;t find a product like this one. No comparison!</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT a real DevaConcepts product.  I compared it to the original and not even the consistency was the same.  Be careful of knock offs....</li>
            <li> Works better than most on my 3b curls.  Give hold, definition, and smells good.</li>
            <li> I actually really like this cream underneath a gel for hold. The smell is great, and it&#x27;s super lightweight. Not sure if I would buy again, but I&#x27;d probably come back to it if I wasn&#x27;t finding anything else I liked better (since it&#x27;s pretty pricey).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream in conjunction with the Devacurl shampoo and conditioner (which I like) and have found this product to be VERY disappointing. I am Caucasian and have moderately tight, spiral curls. While this cream does hold the curl, it does absolutely nothing for the frizz. In fact, my $3 drug store mousse is infinitely better at keeping frizz at bay than this cream. I am extremely disappointed as the product does not do what it claims to.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I was using Deva styling gel and switched to the cream. It gives my curls definition and a softness. Wouldn&#x27;t ever want to run out. I also use it with Deva Condition One. Great combination for nourishing curls.</li>
            <li> Yes, LOVE it....3 pumps, rubbed in hands, placed on newly washed and fairly wet curly, thin hair.....I wind up with curls that don&#x27;t get frizzed out looking.</li>
            <li> Finally I have found the product of my dreams!  Run, dont walk, to get this cream.  My hair has beautiful curls, ringlets, nicely separated and feels great.  Took me years but I finally found the dream product!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Bumble and Bumble Curl Conscious Defining Creme for many years and LOVE IT, but they stopped making it in the liter bottle, so I thought I&#x27;d give something cheaper a try before I went out and bought the regular bottles in bulk. I have a friend with curly hair who loves DevaCurl products and I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  Bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this product smells awful.  It reminds me of something a tween girl would spray all over herself before going to the movies.  And the product itself didn&#x27;t define my curls or fight frizz at all.  Instead, it left my hair with this terrible aroma and styled in a droopy, waxy coif.  I have extremely tight, curly hair; perhaps this would be better for those ladies who have loose curls or waves.  If you have tight, corkscrew curls, however,  or if you prefer not to make people nauseated every time the breeze blows through your locks, I&#x27;d save my money.  Looks like I&#x27;ll be sticking to my one true hair love, Bumble and Bumble.</li>
            <li> This is the one and only product that works for my frizzy,curly, unruly hair. Just a small amount on my hands smoothed down the length of my hair, wet or dry, gives me the soft,spiraly curls I&#x27;ve always wanted. I&#x27;m on my second package of this product and I still love it as much as I first did! I recommend and will continue using!</li>
            <li> really helps the curls come to life. you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
            <li> This really helps keep my curls from being too frizzy in humid weather.  I use it every day.  Will buy more.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Does not weigh my curls down.</li>
            <li> Devaconcepts DevaCurl styling cream is a great product and I will use and oder this again.  I was using DevaCurl gel and it took a long time for my hair to dry, and after using DevaCurl styling cream it was a big difference.  My hair dried quickly and my curls were more defined.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product makes my hair feel great</li>
            <li> This stuff was terrible on my hair.  I have curly ringlets medium course very thick medium length hair. I&#x27;m bi racial so my hair is not completely like a black person&#x27;s hair but it&#x27;s also not like a white person&#x27;s hair either.. its really right down the middle. I started out by putting a little bit in my hair working it through the curls with my fingers with towel dried hair.  Since it was spendier than other hair products I was thinking that this must be a really good strong product that they&#x27;re selling. I had seen people on their website and on their Instagram page with different ethnicities so I was thinking that they knew how to cater to curly hair on all different types of heads. Wrong. when I used a minimal to medium amount my hair was very frizzy it was very dry only some of the curls came out defined and in ringlets the rest was like a crazy cat ladies hair...so i was obviously frustrated. I decided that I would give it one more shot and I used a decent amount of the product which I&#x27;m used to  because my hair is so thick. I&#x27;ve always had to use a lot of product so it not working when I use minimal product didn&#x27;t completely shut me down as far as optimism. I went ahead and I used almost a third of the container which is obviously a lot of product but again I&#x27;ve always had to use a lot of product in my hair and using a smaller amount of this product wasn&#x27;t working so after doing that my hair was slightly limp during the drying process (from allot of product)  but STILL to my surprise my hair (especially) around the top and around the roots was crazy frizzy when it dried.  it was embarrassing....it took all day to air dry. some of the ringlets at the bottom were more  defined than when I had used a minimal amount but the amount of frizz and dry hair throughout my head was just unbelievable this stuff is not great its not even good and to top it off the pump broke so I returned it to Amazon which I was going to do anyways because of the product not working and the price. This might be for other people&#x27;s hair and I&#x27;m happy for them if it works but this is not for my type of hair and I&#x27;m really disappointed. also the product made my face break out from I&#x27;m assuming the product on my pillow case from when I&#x27;m sleeping. #fail. ******product search update******  Oyin products are amazing.  I just started using them but they&#x27;re cheapest on Target&#x27;s websitehe price.

            <li> Got this as a sample from Sephora and loved it!  Have not been able to find it in the stores and love that I can order it on Amazon and save a little money along the way as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fighting my coarse, curly hair for decades. Every once in awhile I&#x27;ll find something I like, and then it&#x27;s discontinued. More often though, it just stops working like I expect. Is it because companies reformulate? That is always possible. It&#x27;s also possible that the hair I had in my teens, 20&#x27;s, and 30&#x27;s isn&#x27;t the same from decade to decade and I have to live with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently I have it color treated a dark color, and am growing it out. Kind of like the Mary Louise Parker look (only not with short shorts). I have a good hair day if I leave it curly, maybe once a month. It&#x27;s so frustrating. I can&#x27;t seem to find advice for my certain hair, from anyone who HAS this kind of hair. Even the Folica forums are filled with people much younger than myself, with time to mess with their hair endlessly. That&#x27;s not me. I just need something to put on it and use minimum effort, to ENHANCE and CONTROL what I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I was in an Ulta whose manager treats me like I have a communicable disease and shoplift; praying that the first person to offer help would not be her. At any rate, when I was once again looking for a curly-hair product, I went in that day with not so great hair. You would think this would be the perfect time for someone to see just what they need to work with and make a good recommendation! So here comes MisManager, looking all over at my purse, hands, etc. as she asks me if she can help me? I told her what I need, and she started pointing out products that weren&#x27;t even appropriate. (She has very very thin, fine hair made bone white, black, and pink, and plastered to her skull....so she showed me products that would work for her). Finally we came to the Deva Curl section and she said, \\&quot;They have great shampoo!\\&quot; But I&#x27;m not looking for shampoo, I need a STYLING CREAM. She pulled out their gel, \\&quot;This is great gel!\\&quot; (BANG HEAD) Finally I found the styling cream. She chirped happily, \\&quot;Oh that&#x27;s great cream!\\&quot; I told her it was hard to find stuff that worked, and she said: (brace for it) \\&quot;Well it can&#x27;t look any worse than it does now!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her customer service skills were so impressive, that I bought it on the spot. Actually I knew if I did not like it, I could return it (which I expected).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of nice things about the Deva Curl and you may not discover them until you play with it awhile. There are many ways to use it. Let me caution you about using it as a final touch up on dry or mostly dry hair: you may look like you didn&#x27;t wash your hair recently. (Use VERY sparingly) Also, if you don&#x27;t distribute it well enough, you get white dried lumps in your hair. If you work around anyone who has a juvenile mindset, expect to hear about the white things in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to put in one squirt (my hair is past shoulder length) and use it as a blowdry cream until my hair is about 3/4 dry, and then squish in another squirt into the ends and shafts, scrunch it in, and let it air dry, for lots of curls. You can do some finger spirals and such to shape them how you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like to put in two squirts and distribute that, and blowdry my hair until finished (with some Milk Shake serum also) with my hands (no brushes, just fingers). the Deva Curl makes the hair smooth and shiny, it&#x27;s not STRAIGHT But there is just enough shine and definition and wave to look like you didn&#x27;t even do your hair. (When we all know that if I didn&#x27;t &#x27;do&#x27; my hair I would look like Krusty the Clown)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my second bottle of the Deva Curl, and the price on Amazon is way less than Ulta. So instead of $26 and Cruella DeVille, I can order this for less from the comfort of my home, sitting with my \\&quot;couldn&#x27;t be worse\\&quot; hair :--) With use several times a week, I got about 3 months out of this bottle. Realistically, I probably get closer to 2 months now that I&#x27;m learning how to work with it more.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I put this (one squirt) into my hair and used it as a setting lotion with big rollers...can you believe it works??? Very smooth results.h big rollers...can you believe it works??? Very smooth results.</li>
            <li> DevaCurl Styling Cream is my very favorite styling product.  It alleviates dryness!  I&#x27;ve had people ask if I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always gone natural...have 3b curls.  I was excited to try the line, and if gave it a good try but it made my hair sooooo dry, snarled, and if I even touched my hair it&#x27;d break off!!!  This never happened before. I&#x27;m disappointed because I wanted to like the line.</li>
            <li> Tried a sample of this for 2 days (provided by another company). Scrunched it into my wet hair and let it air dry. I loved how it didn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy like other products can, nor did my hair look like it was wet all day long. My waves were full and soft. HOWEVER, I couldn&#x27;t handle the overpowering scent. It was so strong I felt I could taste it. I had to toss the remainder of the sample. I won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> My daughter recently transitioned back to her naturally curly hair after years of straightening it.  The one thing that bothered her the most is how short her hair is when curly.  We have tried so many products but this product is the winner of all of the styling creams.  It elongates her curls while keeping them intact.  She is so happy when we use this, this is now the only product for us.  Great price too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to think I must be doing something wrong since so many reviewers praise this product. I&#x27;ve had pretty good results with DevaCurl&#x27;s No-Poo and One Condition, but all of their styling products seem to promote the conditions I&#x27;m looking to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy with dry and frizzy hair that I have been trying to tame ever since I grew my hair out two years ago. I&#x27;ve gone to Sephora and tried every brand that they carry, including Devacurl. Unfortunately, this styling cream turns my hair into a fluffy, frizzy, dry, undefined mess.</li>
            <li> Curly girls and boys, this styling cream works amazingly well! It&#x27;s a small bottle, but it goes a long way. I have thick corkscrew and botticelli curls that have too much volume sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine consists of smoothing 2-3 pumps of this over my hair immediately after I turn off the water in the shower. I also use DevaCare defining gel to help keep the frizz at bay and prevent fly-aways, but it&#x27;s the styling cream that helps my curls from turning into a terrible 90s afro.</li>
            <li> Great product! My daughter absolutely loves it. She uses it with the spray gel and her hair looks great. She also loves the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I have fairly curly/frizzy hair and this product works ok. but the amount i have to use to keep my hair under control is more then i expected. i doubt this amount will last very long. I like that it does not have a super &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look like other products.</li>
            <li> Works very well, just a bit sticky.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE the Deva Products.  This product smoothes my hair and really defines my curls.  Great feel and wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> It styles my hair without the stiffness.  I prefer it to the gels.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used this product and I love it.  It really helps define my curls.</li>
            <li> Great product, have been using it for years</li>
            <li> This product is for my wife, so I&#x27;m not exactly sure how it works, but he keeps her happy and that keeps me very happy.</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample and figured maybe it would help my fine, barely wavy hair get a little oomph. That&#x27;s exactly what it did. It&#x27;s helped my hair hang on to the little bit of wave that it has, made it hold up a little better through the day. So though I&#x27;m no curly-head, I&#x27;m a convert.</li>
            <li> Great product for curly hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of my usual DevaCurl ArcAngel gel to give it a try. I was not disappointed by the hold at all. It did a great job, using relatively little product when compared to the handful of ArcAngel gel that I usually use. I was happy to find that I got the same results scrunching the product into dry hair as wet, something that I can&#x27;t really do with gel. This product holds my thick, coarse hair into very well-behaved curls and lasts an entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one drawback, however, is that you can&#x27;t &amp;#34;scrunch&amp;#34; your curls to break up the product once your hair dries like you can with the gel. So my hair does look like it has product in it. If that&#x27;s a concern for you, I&#x27;d stick with the gel.</li>
            <li> Great product to tame those curls! It gave my wavy hair a curlier look and no frizz at all! Unlike mousse, this product leaves your curls soft and shiny. I will not go back to my mousse anymore.</li>
            <li> Makes hair feel manageable. Does not keep hair from being frizzy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many styling creams to find the &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; of products, and I have to say, this is definitely a holy grail product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many other reviewers have said, a little goes a long way. I mix about 2 pumps of this with DevaCurl AnGel and scrunch it in my hair upside down (I do this with pretty sopping wet hair). Then I take an old cotton t-shirt and scrunch the excess water out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m careful not to touch my hair too much, or I put a braid in my hair and wait for it to dry. I always come out with shiny. bouncy curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with this cream and will continue to buy it. Plus the smell is absolutely AMAZING. Definitely would recommend this to any of my curly haired girls.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is on the thin side so I have to use something that won&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  This is a great product - it enhances my curls perfectly.  I normally just put this in my hair when it is wet and let it air dry - even being in humid Florida this works great.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended I purchase the various DevaCurl products and I&#x27;m very glad I did! This is great if you have kinky curls. My curls start out as beautiful ringlets but start to fall after a couple of days. Now I just wet it a bit and put this styling cream in and voila! Reshaped! It also smells great and is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Love this product! My curls are soft &amp; holds all day.</li>
            <li> I have brown curly Caucasian hair, but it&#x27;s not very thick or textured. This gives the right amount of definition without being either oily or crunchy, and it perks up the second (or even third) day with a little spritzer to bring curl back. I will buy another bottle when this runs out.</li>
            <li> This product really works!! Finally! For years I&#x27;ve been trying to find a styling product for my very curly hair &amp; I&#x27;ve had no luck until now. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy or frizzy. Those were my two biggest problems with all the styling products out there. You have to watch the utube video on how to use it correctly. Just google Lorraine Massey Devacurl products &amp; she has utube videos on how to use her products. I will now wear my hair curly way more often than straight because this product really works.</li>
            <li> I have ALWAYS had an issue putting products in my hair.  I never knew it&#x27;s full potential.  I had very thick, coarse &amp;#34;wavy&amp;#34; hair.  I have a mix of middle-eastern and Cherokee Indian in me so my hair was going to be a crazy mix.  I would straighten it all the time because if I let it air dry, it was frizzy (but not because of unruly curls, but that&#x27;s just what happens to thick, wavy, coarse hair).  As I got older, I tried serums, gels, all the stuff you can get at the local monopolizing &amp;#34;Mart&amp;#34;.  All these commercials for certain brands seemed to stack wax in my hair and it just made it difficult to work with my hair.  I met a Deva stylist through teaching Zumba and she offered to help with my hair.  WOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first cut, I told her I hate putting product in my hair and she promised it wouldn&#x27;t feel that way...as I watched her add...EEK - gel! GASP! Then some of this.  I said, &amp;#34;WHAT ARE YOU DOING?&amp;#34; and she said to trust her.  So, she proceeded to dry it, scrunched it and whoa.  Soft, shiny, beautiful wavy hair? Really? After all she just put in? I was hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after I wash (or co-wash on my days off of washing it), I mix this with the Arc Angel gel (or now Ultra-Defining is what they call it).  I scrunch it in, dry it and then scrunch to remove the cast.  I am in love with the Deva product and the fact that they do not weigh the hair down.  All those commercials on TV are full of poo...this is finally something that does what it says (as long as you follow the ENTIRE plan).  I use the Deva gloves (or a cheese/flour cloth in a pinch) to dry it (as a regular towels loops are too thick and will cause the curls to separate and frizz).  My hair is gorgeous.  My own mother has switched to the complete line after seeing what my hair has become capable of.  And, now, after 3 years of using it, even if I don&#x27;t dry it and let it air dry, with just a little bit of condition left in (I always leave the One Condition in), it dries curly and beautiful (just don&#x27;t usually have the volume, but after some scrunching, it&#x27;s fine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this cream.  I love the whole Deva line and I&#x27;m really happy with how it works!s curly and beautiful (just don&#x27;t usually have the volume, but after some scrunching, it&#x27;s fine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this cream.  I love the whole Deva line and I&#x27;m really happy with how it works!</li>
            <li> It is the perfect hair product for anyone with naturally curly hair!!! I hate the look of wet curls, so I search often on a good product for a natural look.  This is the PERFECT product!!! Worth the money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so-so but I feel like for the price you can find similar products with nice Deva-like ingredients for less.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! If you have naturally curly hair, you&#x27;ll want this before blow drying with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> For the past several years I had been straightening my curly hair even though I prefer the curls. That was because it was mostly unmanageable and frizzy, and would usually start looking strange and lose its bounce by the third week from the products I used.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try the DevaCurl line, and started with the One Conditioner and the Angel gel. It looked alot better than before, but the gel was making my hair dry. I was advised to switch to the leave-in and the styling cream instead of the gel.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it now for several months, and it&#x27;s looking healthier and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair with the low poo, then add the conditioner. I wash some of the conditioner out but leave most of it. I use a paper towel to get rid of the dripping water, or use my hands, then I immediately add in a good chunk of leave-in conditioner. I use the styling cream after and blow dry it with a diffuser (much better curl definition than letting it air-dry). Looks great for at least two days. I sometimes use the mister to put some bounce back into it on the 2nd or 3rd day.&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t use gels or products that make my hair feel unnatural, and when I was told to use all these products I was worried it might weigh my curls down or feel gunky, but it doesn&#x27;t at all. Hope this review helps.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It lets me go curly without my hair being sticky, heavy, or crunchy. It is light enough to comb through and my hair always feels clean, no weighed down.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, dry, thinning and permed. Along with a few other products, this stuff gives me no-frizz curls,</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested it because I get knots under the back of my hair since it&#x27;s very curly.  I think it helps.  I also use a little when my hair gets frizzy but I don&#x27;t want to wet it.  It soaks in after a while and tames it, not greasy.</li>
            <li> This really works good on my naturally waves to set them in.</li>
            <li> I like the concept, it does do a great job with some scrunching but my hair is mostly wavy and by mid day it weighs it down. The smell is fresh. I think sometimes I get weighed down and becomes straight and oily. It does work well just not for very long days. This is all because my personal hair style.</li>
            <li> Great product for curly hair. Nice addition to your routine if you are looking for a cream that will be smooth and light.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this!</li>
            <li> Deva Products work well in my mostly curly hair</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian and have extremely dry, coarse, poofy, curly hair and I have been looking for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; curling cream for a couple years now. After reading the reviews on this Deva Curl Styling Cream, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5-6 weeks now and it just hasn&#x27;t worked for me. It does help the curls form a little tighter and stick together, but it doesn&#x27;t supply enough moisture for my hair. The product description says it &amp;#34;Provides natural hold, humidity resistance and leaves curls moisturized and frizz free.&amp;#34; It does help with humidity but my hair is still poofy, frizzy and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have dry hair it might work for you. At least it&#x27;s not as expensive as other products! I think I&#x27;ll be switching back to the Moroccan Oil Curling Cream after I finish this bottle.  The Moroccan Oil brand is more expensive but it provides more moisture and I like the smell much better.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my kiddo (and me). I didn&#x27;t want to put too much hard gel in her hair, and the DevaCurl Styling Cream is just right. It has a great smell and a lighter, smoother hold. If I leave some conditioner in her long curly hair and finish with the styling cream, my daughter&#x27;s hair looks great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and has made my 3A curls awesome. A little bit goes a long way or it will get sticky and greasy. Start with a little bit and add more as needed. I usually follow up with the Living Proof Humidity Shield spray as a finishing touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice after I started using this that I had a few breakouts around my forehead and hairline. Not sure if it was the change in product or not. They have cleared up but we will see if they come back.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for controlling the frizz of curly hair. Leaves hair soft, not crunchy.</li>
            <li> have not started this bottle yet but have used it in the past. It is certainly better than most of the curl creams I have used but I still prefer the Morrocian Oil curl cream. This is more reasonably priced and easier to get.</li>
            <li> This really controls frizz.  For those oldsters out there: I went from Roseanne Rosannah Dannah to relatively normal looking hair.  My curls look and feel soft.  It smells nice too - not perfumy - just light and pleasant.  This MUST be used on wet hair and you have to have clean hands - no other products or lotions on them - for it to spread evenly.  The 2nd day you can tell that there is some product on your hair, but it&#x27;s not like when you wet your hair that the water rolls off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this is in the summer and the gel in the winter.</li>
            <li> Great product for summer curly hair!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for my hair.  I am looking for a product that will enhance my natural curls and stop them becoming frizzy as the day goes on.  I will not order this again kind of pricey to not work.</li>
            <li> I like this product for day 2 or 3. I still have to use something different the first day of washing hair but this product smooths out the frizzy the following day so everyday washing is no longer necessary!</li>
            <li> Love every DevaCurl product I&#x27;ve tried.  This DevaCurl Styling Cream layers on after gel for even more control and beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful curl cream I have used. It&#x27;s pricey considering how much you get, but a little goes a long way. I have thick, wavy, curly, frizzy hair and this not only tames the beast but smells divine! Literally a few pumps worked into WET hair is all you need.</li>
            <li> Tames my frizzy curls for sure.  Doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy and is not sticky. This ones a keeper and believe me I&#x27;ve been through a lot of products and most don&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> I have frizzy curly hair and this helps control it and make it soft and manageable. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for curly hair</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this cream to keep my curly hair from frizzing.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So I donâ€™t write reviews on hereâ€¦BUTâ€¦I had to this time.  I have fine hair but a lot of it.  Itâ€™s not typically tight curly  BUT my hair has curl; just not all overâ€¦yes itâ€™s strange.  I prefer it to be curly as itâ€™s simply easier to take care of and I am not someone who wants to take any time with my hair.  I have rather short hair at this time and it is now grown out just long enough to go back to curling it without looking like a clown with a hangover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried about 14 zillion curling productsâ€¦no seriously the path of 80% unused product bottles wraps around the globe, my tree hugging eco Portland ego is ashamed to admit.  Either they are to heavy or to sticky or make my hair look matte and dull or I end up with that crunchâ€¦you know what I am talking aboutâ€¦the crispy crunchy invisible coating that god forbid someone tries to run their hands through your hair they would end up with lacerated knuckles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a whim I asked my hairdresser for a recommendation and I ended up walking out with Deva Curl Cream and it has changed my lifeâ€¦okay that was a bit dramatic but my hair looks hella cute and I have gone from the droopy frizzy lame semi curls to soft spiral loopy curls.  No crunch, no sticky waxy feeling.  My hair feels like hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say a little goes far.  I have found that it works best if you rub it in your hands really good before applying.  I simply scrunch it in from roots to ends and I am done. My hair dries soft and my curls are bouncy.  Happy customer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely Deva Curl quality, but I&#x27;m not sure yet if it&#x27;s right for my hair. I have ultra fine hair. It&#x27;s so fine&lt;br /&gt;that even experienced hair dressers have trouble working with it.  Also, the climate I live in is usually humid.&lt;br /&gt;I used low poo, then one conditioner, and believe in, and then the styling cream. It may be that I need to use&lt;br /&gt;it in a different way than I did last time.  My hair pulled into nice spirals, but...it was so ridiculously soft that it&lt;br /&gt;soon was stringy and limp.  Maybe if I didn&#x27;t use the one conditioner it would have worked better. Just not&lt;br /&gt;sure yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my last review, I tried this product again.  Still no success with it.  My hair is so very fine, so I tried using a non&lt;br /&gt;sulfate shampoo other than my regular low poo by Deva. The Deva products all have a lot of glycerin, which for fine&lt;br /&gt;hair will weigh it down.  Also, I did not use any conditioner at all. I then applied a few pumps of believe in,  4 pumps of the&lt;br /&gt;the curling cream, and  a few pumps of the gel.  The curling cream has a lot of  glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was limp from it. It was way too soft. I have used the curling cream on day two when I don&#x27;t want to wash.&lt;br /&gt;It worked well for that. I just think its not going to work for my fine hair. I really like deva curl products, but they aren&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;friendly to baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have really naturally curly hair, and this is not to crunchy, but gives my hair the perfect amount of volume and smells fabulous. Try it!</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy &amp;#34;2b&amp;#34; hair and use this product together with Deva&#x27;s Set It Free.  The Styling Cream provides hold while the Set It Free adds shine.  Originally, I applied the two separately but now I pre-mix them together in the ratio that is perfect for my hair type.  I scrunch it on when my hair is wet and then literally don&#x27;t touch my hair for the rest of the day (key for fighting frizz).  Although I still have the occasionally &amp;#34;bad hair day,&amp;#34; pretty consistently these products in combination produce soft, shiny waves.  It is sort of funny that between the Styling Cream and the Set It Free, you hair smells like a candy shop for a hot minute, but that quickly dissipates. Four stars instead of five, only because I wish one product did it all and because these products are expensive. That said, Amazon is offering this cream at well below drug store prices and I will repurchase here.</li>
            <li> Make my curls look great.</li>
            <li> I am SO glad that Deva Curl FINALLY came out with a curl creme! I use Deva Curl&#x27;s No Poo and One Condition, but am picky about my styling products and tend not to like gel. I love curling cremes though, which is why I was so thrilled when they finally came out with one. After I gently towel dry my hair with a regular towel (no rubbing!), I liberally apply the curl creme and then scrunch Set It Free into my hair, then continue to scrunch my hair with a Deva Curl towel. My hair always looks amazing when I use this, and the creme makes my hair so soft! And it smells great :)!</li>
            <li> I love this product in addition to the One Condition. I recently got a deva cut and when my hair was styled it looked the best that it has ever been!!!! I went ahead and purchased the products for home use. I&#x27;m on second day hair and it still looks amazing but now it&#x27;s starting to get more volume. My hair is well tamed and smells amazing too. My curls are perfectly defined and so soft. I have a mixture of 3c and 4a hair.</li>
            <li> If you have thick curly hair, I don&#x27;t recommend it; on my hair, it feels like glue. I have friends with fine curly hair and they swear by it.</li>
            <li> Products came in time and were as described.</li>
            <li> I have just finished my first canister of this styling cream. It works wonders on my hair! I am a 3b (with 3c tendencies) / multicultural corkscrew. I use this cream in conjunction with the Deva Curl Angell. I find that if I just use the gel alone, my hair becomes dry and frizzy. The cream makes my curls soft and beautiful. I also use it when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair. A pump of this cream, shake my curls out a bit, and I&#x27;m ready for any type of weather! It&#x27;s great. I would recommend anyone to try it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for naturally curly/wavy hair.  What I love about this over other mousse/gel is that you just put it in - no scrunching necessary! It defines your waves/curls quite nicely.  The one caveat is that it&#x27;s not a replacement for frizz-reducer.  While it does reduce frizz overall, you may still need serum/something else to tame the frizz at your crown in the new england summer!</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, somewhat coarse, hair that is also color treated blonde.  I blow dry and flatiron my hair about 1/2 the time to wear it straight and the rest of the time I scrunch it when wet to wear it wavy.  For a long time I thought it didn&#x27;t like my hair wavy, but then realized it was only because I hadn&#x27;t found the right product to style it. Up until recently I was using (and loved)a Livingproof No Friz product for curly/wavy hair, but then they seemed to have discontinued the one I was using.  I thought about switching to something else in their line but since I was also annoyed that they discontinued their largest size (having thick, long-ish hair, I&#x27;m all about buying in bulk), I decided to keep my options open.  I discussed it with an employee at Sephora who also had wavy hair.  Her advice was that if I was going to only go with a cream (and not switch my shampoo or conditioner) I&#x27;d be better off going with Livingproof, but I was willing to do the whole system, she thought I&#x27;d like DevaCurl better.  Initially I wasn&#x27;t keen on switching my shampoo and conditioner since I&#x27;d finally found a system that worked (I&#x27;ve been using Kevin Murphy Blonde Angel 2x a week to counteract brassiness, and Davines Oi the rest of the time for moisture).  But then when comparing prices I realized that DevaCurl was much, much more affordable and would still allow me to use sulfate free products.  So I figured, \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot;  If it didn&#x27;t work out, I could always return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ended up purchasing the [[ASIN:B000NE6QP6 DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser, 945 ml / 32 oz]], [[ASIN:B000HJ4IPW Deva Devacurl One Condition Conditioner, 12 Ounce]], this styling cream, and [[ASIN:B003E0Z3JQ Deva Curl Light Defining Gel (Formerly Angel) 32oz]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using them for a week and I absolutely love this system.  My hair feels soft and healthy and the wave definition is definitely on par with what I was getting from Livingproof.  My waves stay put all day and look beautifully defined.  I also don&#x27;t need much product to make my hair look great, even with thick hair, so the longevity on this seems good.  I&#x27;ve also tried the No-Poo Cleanser and Conditioner on the days I flat iron my hair along with my Davines THIS IS A RELAXING MOISTURIZING FLUID and Davines OI / Oil Absolute Beautifying Potion and my hair still looks great even straight so I think at least the shampoo and conditioner are versatile enough to use on straight and wavy days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t love about this styling cream is the smell.  To my nose, it reminds me of bubblegum and is kind of sickly sweet.  It&#x27;s odd because the rest of the line has a pretty benign smell so I&#x27;m not sure why this cream smells the way it does.  Thankfully, this isn&#x27;t a hair product where the scent lingers, at least when used with the rest of the system.  The bubblegum scent hits me hard when I apply it, but over time it seems to go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m absolutely loving DevaCurl and can&#x27;t wait to try more products in the line.defined.

            <li> Nice and moist but still makes hair stiff</li>
            <li> This is a lightweight conditioning creme that helps fight the frizz.  I have boticelli curls that are shoulder length and it gives the conditioning without the weight of a leave in conditioner.  Hair dries fast and doesn&#x27;t feel slimey.  You can also use it if straightening hair as well.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, very surprised this did not work for my baby fine, naturally wavy hair. After shampooing, I use 2-3 pumps, work it through, and scrunch with a towel. When my hair dries, it&#x27;s totally frizzed. Is there something I&#x27;m doing wrong with this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m bummed. I hate paying $30 for Bumble and Bumble curl conscious defining cream, but B&amp;B seems to be the only product that keeps the frizz at bay all day.</li>
            <li> to keep my very dry course hair from frizzing. I add it to the Ang-gel and one conditioner and spread it thru my hair and it gives it a smooth polished look that lasts all day. Without it the hair starts frizzing within a few hour.</li>
            <li> Works great on my natural curls and smells great! Doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair and I saw a pretty quick reaction to the spring in my curls after running it through my hair. If your hair starts to dry before getting it all over, wet your hands and run it through the dry areas.</li>
            <li> After 30 years of fighting my curly hair with everything from up dos to relaxers as well as Brazilian and Japanese straitening at the salon, I finally enjoy having curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair dresser first introduced me to this product.  She specializes in curly hair cuts and uses dry hair cuts for curls ( you can find a dry cut specialist in you area by googling \\&quot;natural curly website\\&quot; and using the \\&quot;find a local salon\\&quot; tab. For my, slightly past shoulder length, hair I was told to use 2 pumps . I then follow with Devacurl Frizz Free Volumizing Foam to give my curls some extra hold. Between those two products I would say the styling cream is the miracle I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> this is my first time to use this styling cream based on other people&#x27;s reviews. it did all it said. make my hair hair, styling, non-frizz.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough about this styling cream!  I use the whole product line! The no poo cleanser and conditioner!  All well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> Great for smoothing the frizzies out of your natural curls. Leaves hair shiny with natural curls. I recommend this product to all who have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair you know you need product to bring out the bestf of your curls.  DevaCurl Styling Cream is a must have for curly girls.  I have a Boteccili curl type of hair and this product brings out the boing in my curl.  I part my hair in 4 sections and use 1 pump for each section... I either dry with a diffuser or air dry... I get compliments every time!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work the best for curls and the biggest drawback is that it smells like teriyaki. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn&#x27;t do returns of health and beauty, so I will try to endure it but I think I may just toss it. Sad. I do like the other DevaCurl gel product.</li>
            <li> I recently got a much needed cut and the stylist used this product as well as the low poo shampoo and one conditioner and I must say I love ALL of the products!&lt;br /&gt;The styling cream is light but holds my curl definition and aids against the frizzies.  LOVE!</li>
            <li> The BEST product ever for your natural curls.</li>
            <li> I am naturally curly-haired, I just need a little finesse to the curls them selves, this product should be used after towel drying but when hair is still damp for the best results.  I have tried to apply this product when the hair is dry which is what the directions tell you to do, but it just came out sticky.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would leave my Curly hair nice and soft but its very sticky and would not recommend. Maybe their other products are better.  I will not purchase any to find out though.</li>
            <li> If you have dark hair, don&#x27;t buy it.  The product is white and it leaves little clumps of white in your hair.  No matter how I apply the product, and I have tried several different ways, I get white clumps every time.</li>
            <li> I have tried it all and this is the best. I also like redken curls, the original formula which is gone, and cat curls curling creme which is also great but this is the best of all of them.  I used it with the deva diffuser and I had corkscrew curls all over which I never had before. This Deva brand is perfection, so happy I found it on amazonðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> I used a couple other products in the Deva Curl line years ago, before they reformulated... I remember liking No Poo and One Conditioner, but I bought, tried and returned every single other product from the line at Ulta.  I got my hair cut by a Devachan-trained stylist for the first time last week, and he used this cream on my hair, giving amazing results... even overnight!  So, I bought it.  I have had fabulous (3B) curls the past few years using Kinky Curly Curling Custard and a cheap gel (Herbal Essences Set Me Up), but it rarely looks good enough to leave the house as 2nd-day-hair.  With this Deva cream, I can actually go three days and look good... I can run my fingers through my hair and no frizz, just voluminous, clumpy curls... what?!  LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This product has been a godsend. It works super well with my curls (3c) and is very hydrating but light. My hair is versatile and not weighed down by a heavy curl product.  I am a huge fan of Deva products but this is my favorite thus far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot  of products for curly hair that haven&#x27;t worked. DevaCurl  styling cream is the best!  It  moisturizes as it holds your curls and lasts for 2 to 3 days when using lavender water to refresh curls in the morning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK product for defining curls but I can&#x27;t get past the very strong sweet smell.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell nice on my hair. I&#x27;ve tried way better products for styling my curly hair.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and undamaged.</li>
            <li> I have curly dry mature caucasian hair and this product does help tame frizz but I find it leaves a bit of a gummy feel to my hair.</li>
            <li> We use all DevaCurl products for my 17 year old with ringlet curls. Her hair looks, feels and smells so goood - the styling cream and gel help to finish her style!</li>
            <li> hair had no curl sticky</li>
            <li> Horrible&lt;br /&gt;Made my hair super puffy</li>
            <li> Very nice styling cream for curly hair</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! if you mix it together with heaven in hair conditioner by devacurl while you are in the shower (AKA hair soaking wet after washing it) it works wonders, with no gel needed, and beautiful defined curls (even more than with the gel!)</li>
            <li> this is a great heavy moisture cream for curls. it keeps the frizz away, but doesn&#x27;t weight them down or make them feel greasy. a little goes a looonnng way!</li>
            <li> This product does set your curls, but I find that it leaves a heavy film to the hair. My hair does not have a soft and silky texture after applying this product. I am going to apply this product underneath the hair, instead to the top of the hair and see if that will make a difference. I would not buy this again in the future.</li>
            <li> This product, in conjunction with DevaCurl One Condition, does a great job of enhancing my curl pattern without leaving my hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; like some other products do. It&#x27;s a great part of my styling routine.</li>
            <li> Did not work well on my fine permed hair. It weighted my hair down and left it with a greasy type film.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy this product again, not happy that I paid this much for a product and can not use!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and cannot begin my day without this product. It helps my hair hold the curls without getting frizzy. Just scrunch it through the hair, throw it back and gently finger style.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much for my frizzy, curly 2C/3A hair. Nice smell, but doesn&#x27;t provide all day hold and definition like OGX Argan Oil Defining cream. I had heard great things about DevaCurl, but they are overpriced and don&#x27;t live up to the reputation, at least with this product.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite Deva products, I use this and the DevaCare One Condition. Amazing product line for naturally curly, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about DevaCurl salons and products, but this probably just isn&#x27;t the right product for me.  I have very fickle curls that need a stronger hold to create and keep good curls going throughout the day.  This product kept my hair fairly soft and frizz free, but more wavy than curly.  I prefer Catwalk Curl Cream, which is much more heavy and does the job well.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!! I can not get enough of it. I have curly long hair that tends to freeze easily. Since I started using this product, my hair looks healthier and everybody comments how pretty my curls are. It has helped me embrace my curly hair. It also moisturizers it. It is worth very penny!</li>
            <li> I loved the seller the product smells wonderfully but as a African American he did not do wonders for my hair I just liked the smoothness of it and the ingredients that make up this product I will order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> My curlygirl stylist uses it with deva an-gel, but there it takes time, the hair dryer, etc! &amp; the final curly styling looks great.  Personally, I find it leaves my hair feeling kind of heavy, but as if there&#x27;s too much hair product on it.  Dom&#x27;t see a need to re- buy--An-gel after one condition has always worked great for me.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Had good results!</li>
            <li> love the product......would not use anything else on my hair I have naturally curly hair and it locks the curls</li>
            <li> Makes hair so soft, I am very curly and love this new product. I. Use it all the time now combined with my angel gel.</li>
            <li> Packaged well and product as described and expected.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have very tight curls, and this cream is perfect: doesn&#x27;t weigh them down, no greasy/sticky feel.  Makes my hair look and feel amazing.  And it smells great, too!</li>
            <li> This product works well on my hair, leaves it soft and naturally curly without the frizz. I just need to put in the right amount, which tends to be two quarter size pumps. (I have short hair). Smells so good too :)</li>
            <li> This stuff turns my frizzy mess into ringlets IF I put some coconut oil on first. I use it on wet hair. My hair is very dry so I need the coconut oil to moisturize. If I try to go without, the styling cream doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without this stuff. Taken me from hair despair to hair envy. Women stop me on the street to ask what I use to give me great curls. Tossed out my flat iron and no more straightening marathons.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy/kinky hair and this stuff give me corkscrew curls.  I use with the the \\&quot;No Poo\\&quot; and conditioning cream - my curls have never looked this good.  LOVE this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Nothing else works better for curly hair. Would recommend this to anyone with frizzy or curly hair. Thank you</li>
            <li> The first thing you will notice is the great smell. The product isn&#x27;t too heavy for fine hair. Keeps frizzies away and helps define curls.</li>
            <li> Calling all curly girls. I&#x27;ve been in a love-hate relationship with my curly hair for 54 years and I have tried sooooo many different products designed for curly hair.  Deva Curl (drama queen alert) seems to be the product I&#x27;ve been searching for!  And this leave-in conditioner is specifically the product I&#x27;ve always wanted to find.&lt;br /&gt;I use this before my gel and do the Deva scrunch-in-the-shower technique.  That&#x27;s cool, but it&#x27;s what this conditioner does for my dry hair that I really love.  Just back from the gym?  Scrunch some in.  Second, third, even fourth-day hair?  Scrunch some more in.  It gives me twirly springy curls. Yep, they&#x27;re a bit stiff to feel, but they look great.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t run my fingers through my hair any more and I only shampoo once or twice a week and my hair has never looked better, even in humid climates.  Yee haw!</li>
            <li> I had a gift certificate from Christmas and really needed some new hair products.  I bought this, the conditioner to it, and the curl holding creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very processed hair.  I dye it regularly and high heat wave, curl, or straighten depending on my mood.  It&#x27;s shoulder length or more and somewhat thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo does not lather.  It&#x27;s not supposed to.  It&#x27;s cleansing your hair.  If I didn&#x27;t know this ahead of time, I&#x27;d  probably have freaked out and sent it back.  You work it through your hair and rinse.  I usually do this twice.  I don&#x27;t care for the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t matter because the conditioner smells great.  You work the conditioner through and leave it on as long as you need it.  A minute or ten, doesn&#x27;t matter, it just depends on how deep you want or need your conditioning.  You can rinse it and then towel dry your hair and put a bit back in to stay.  It makes your hair soft and gives more hold, but I thought doing that made my hair feel heavy, but I did try it.  The creme hold stuff smells great too.  The hold is &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;.  That&#x27;s why the 4 stars and not 5.  I&#x27;m reviewing the 3 products as a whole system overall.  The creme smells good, feels good, and I even rubbed my hands on my face after running it through my hair.  It made such a good lotion.  I found that my curls needed the occasional touch up if I were going out, or had something going on in the evening.  I didn&#x27;t need to add more, just needed to touch up my hair a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff blows your average department store products away.  I like biolage better, but can&#x27;t afford it.  But this is better than then the Nexxus products.  The shipping was quick with Prime and on time.  Packaging was fine.  Bottle is simple, plain, not gimicky, if you know what I mean.  I would buy more, try some other of their products, and recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The construction of the bottle needs work.  A failure has kept us from using the product inside. Previous shipments arrived fine, and the product performed satisfactorily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three of these 5.1 Oz bottles arrived with the dispenser heads cracked away from the container. What a mess.  The outer box that they arrived in was not damaged except for scuffing, and the bottles themselves were surrounded by those little plastic air pillow things that separated the bottles from an unrelated product in the same order.  The unrelated product did not weigh anything to have bumped against all three bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess these could have failed after high altitude air cargo transport, but being winter, I doubt these containers saw too much internal pressure from high ambient temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has made good under their damaged in shipping policy, but I have to wonder why these bottles are so fragile in the first place to not be able to withstand a routine delivery.</li>
            <li> I have curly frizzy hair. It frizzie&#x27;s if I do nothing but curls when I use a curling produce.  I have always gotten complements on the health of my hair by my hair dresser, after a little over a month of using this produce she was very worried about me because my hair went from being healthy and manageable  to extremely dry and notted at the ends. She thought that maybe I had life problems and was very stressed out, but the truth was that nothing was different in my life except that I was trying and new shampoo and conditioner and style produce.</li>
            <li> I really like this new curling cream from DevaCurl.  After years of blowdrying I finally decided to embrace my natural curl.  However, the road to finding the right products has been long and disappointing at times.  I use this after spraying in a leave in conditioner.  I use about the size of a quarter or a bit more and work it through my hair using a large tooth comb to be sure that all the hair is coated.  I then dry with the diffuser.  I like this cream better than gels because it doesn&#x27;t give my hair that crunch.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  I use two pumps for type 3a hair that is between hip and classic length.  It does a great job of bringing out the curl too.  I was skeptical at first, but this one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Love this product line. This is the first product that I&#x27;ve found that defines curls and still has my hair feeling nice.</li>
            <li> nice addition to the arcangel.  does leave hair a little gummy though but it looks great and has nice hold</li>
            <li> Great solution for very curly hair-keeps it relatively tame without the drying effects of gel.</li>
            <li> Love, Love This styling cream. First thing I have found that actually keeps my curls under control all day. Other styling solutions seem to dry out my hair and eventually the frizz is all you see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t stop making this product....must have for all of us curly girls.</li>
            <li> This cream is good but I have to use with other products to really define my hair the way I like it.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B006K26D9E DevaCurl Styling Cream - 5.1 Oz]] is anmazing for wonderful curls but no tacky stiff hair. Easy to use and good for your hair too!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair curly, and moisturized, with a small amount of the product. All the DevaCurl products are great -- my granddaughter has very curly hair, and these have worked great for her too.</li>
            <li> I have very curly Botticelli-type curls and live in a high humidity area. This product does control frizz and smells divine. I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says and is a welcome addition to my normal hair routine. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It seems to keep my hair from frizzing.</li>
            <li> Perfect product for curly hair during the summer. It&#x27;s a little heavier since it&#x27;s a cream and it helps weight my hair down enough in the dry months. I typically switch to the foam in the winter.</li>
            <li> Tries this after getting a diva cut at a local salon, and it makes such a huge difference. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down or sticky and the curl is even throughout. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Does not work for my curls.  I like the devacurl foam much better.  I have very curly hair.  Just didn&#x27;t define or hold up to humidity like the foam does.  Also, felt a little heavy in my hair.</li>
            <li> DevaCurl is the only product I will put on my natural curly hair, and my daughter&#x27;s naturally curly hair.  Doesn&#x27;t have all the bad stuff (sulfates and silicones) like other products made for curly hair and keeps hair healthy and strong.  My curls are defined and smells good too.  I love it!</li>
            <li> The smell is a little odd but curled my hair great !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for weeks now. I have naturally curly hair and when my sister the hair stylist recommended it to me I was excited about finally have beautiful curls...I was disappointed. My hair is still frizzing up and it doesn&#x27;t define my curls well. I love how it smells but for 20 bucks I expected more. I recently purchased their ultra defining gel and their shampoo and conditioner. I plan to give those products a try and I am hopeful they will work better for me</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product to use by itself or in conjunction with other DevaCurl products!  Leaves my hair silky and full of bounce!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I have wavy, thick and coarse hair and this product enhances my natural waves, tames frizz, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy. I have also tried Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s Texture cream, but I prefer the DevaCurl cream as it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stiff and crunchy.</li>
            <li> Works GREAT for my hair.. curl definition, no frizz or crunchy hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> Perhaps I put too much stock into the hyperbolic claims typical of product blurbs on Amazon but I really hoped this would help my curly hair stay curly after it dries.  I even bought the Deva dryer as well in my attempt to seriously love my curly hair and discard the straighteners.  Neither product came close to the claims made in the product description.  This cream is nothing special and, for me, gel from even the least expensive sources does better to form and set curls.  Deva has spent a great deal of effort and time to assure us that, after years of fighting curly hair, they have the styling products and the magic blow dryer that will at last give us the look we want and it&#x27;s all simply advertising and nothing more.  Don&#x27;t spend the extra money on the Deva products and the expensive hair dryer.  I did and I regret it.</li>
            <li> Nice, natural curls, not crunchy, smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> It smells strongly like Starburst, which is not terrible but not a smell taken from nature, like fruit or citrus or herbs or coconut or anything.  It also seems a little too thick and not as lightweight as I would prefer.</li>
            <li> I have had this for two days and am completely in love! Perfect corkscrew curls. I will buy this again, and I&#x27;m the kind of person who, as a general rule, will not but the same product twice in a row.</li>
            <li> Makes lovely loose curls!  I love it!</li>
            <li> love this have thick wavy/curly hair</li>
            <li> I read so many good reviews . I was hoping so much that it would work. Unfortunately, It did not really do anything  for my hair. I would say the results were Meh. Would not buy again. Glad I didn&#x27;t spend over $20 like at Ulta. Might work wonders for others did nothing for me. I did like the smell though. It was like pepperminty,</li>
            <li> I have looked EVERYWHERE for something to help my half-Asian hair (now post-menopausally slightly wavy) look styled. I have been walking around with frizzy, wilted curls and while other parts are more straight. Ugh. I tried Kerastase Oleo Relax (not strong enough though I love the brand), B&amp;B Surf Spray (made my curls look poofy and weird and dry not at all like my hair looks when I&#x27;ve been sailing), Moroccan Oil, argan oil, and others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in AZ and travel to CA often so I was hoping to find something (anything, please) that would make my hair looks defined and healthy in dry AZ and slightly humid, beachy CA. I have course hair and I like that just-out-of-bed look without the frizz and that&#x27;s what I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is the bomb! I tried it on wet hair (after finger combing) and hoped for the best. When my hair dried there were defined waves and I was stunned (and happy). The next day (I don&#x27;t wash every day) a little water on my hands and ran my fingers through my hair and I was good to go. Thank you thank you Deva Concepts for a product that works on my weird hair!</li>
            <li> Another Deva product that is wonderful on my hair...it made my curls better defined...i love it when everyone ask what have you done to your curls they are Sexier than ever... ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜†</li>
            <li> GREAT product. Delivered on time and not left where dog could get to it before me.</li>
            <li> Some clear liquid was all over it, inside cap, and you can see it floating inside at the bottom under the cream.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and this produt works well. makes my hair feel soft and still keeps the curl nice. shipping was quit and product came as decribed</li>
            <li> Adds that extra moisture my hair so craves!  I mix it with my Light Defining Gel right after No-pooing and One Conditioning. Great product for my Botticelli/Corkicelli curls!&lt;br /&gt;A comment on the packaging: While I very much appreciate the pump mechanism; it allows for ALL the product to be used, It is a bit difficult pumping the product out without anchoring against my body for that extra strength.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this and all Deva Curl products.  My hair has changed and come to it&#x27;s natural life!</li>
            <li> This styling cream is amazing! I was excited when Deva Concepts released this product but was put off by the price relative to the amount of product you get. In the past I have had to be fairly heavy handed with curl creams to get good results so I was certain I would go through a 5 oz. bottle of this in a week. I finally got a chance to try the cream this week because I received a sample. I was (am) blown away. A little of this product goes a very long way. I was able to get two applications for my long, medium density, 3c hair with enough left over for one application for my mother who has medium length fine 4a hair. Here are the pros and cons of this cream:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Very concentrated; you only need a very small amount to get optimal results.&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves hair very soft but has good hold. The first two days I used this (first and second day hair) were very windy. My curls looked fantastic at the end of each day and i was out and about quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;- Imparts a nice shine.&lt;br /&gt;- Very moisturizing but does not weigh down the hair. I had great volume on both my first and second day hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The price. While it is a better value if you think of it interms of cost per use (rather than cost per once) since you don&#x27;t need to use very much, I still think it is slightly overpriced. It is about $7.00 more than their styling gels and while most people will need to use a bit more gel to get similar results as this cream I don&#x27;t think it quite balances out.</li>
            <li> This styling cream looked so promising. And, I tried. But, in the end, it was like trying to smile at someone&#x27;s ugly baby, pretending that it&#x27;s cute. Eventually, you can&#x27;t keep up the fake grin any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this, I was using Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft. It works well, but when I saw that the tube was almost finished, I decided that I wanted to try something different, just for a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DevaCurl works on my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t work that well. It&#x27;s not as good as Pillow Soft, by any stretch. More importantly, I hate the smell. It somehow manages to be both overly sweet and chemical at the same time. It&#x27;s so cloying and overpowering, it&#x27;s enough to make you sick. I&#x27;m nauseous whenever I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having given it good ol&#x27; college try, I saw that I just wasn&#x27;t going to get used to it and I ordered something else. I got a sample size of Potion 9 by Sebastian and I&#x27;m very happy with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DevaCurl is going to the very back of the closet. It will only see the light of day again if I run out of everything else and just have to have a little dollop of cream in my hair in an emergency.</li>
            <li> I love all the Deva products and this is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a super addition and it smells terrific too!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length corkscrew curls and this product works wonders for my hair! I used to use the anGEL but didn&#x27;t like how &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; it would leave my hair with the gel casts and I felt that it was drying my hair out too much (might have just been me being paranoid). I tried the Styling Cream on a whim and fell in love. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair have the &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; feel and keeps my frizz at bay for hours (I&#x27;m a nurse in the ICU and I don&#x27;t have frizz after a twelve hour shift). I apply it the same why that I applied the anGEL with my head down, coating the underside and then flipping my hair over while doing a light coat over the sides and scrunching. I also use the spray gel on my roots just to keep it from looking too big and 80&#x27;s style. Just a light quick few sprays it enough and doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; feel either.</li>
            <li> No Poo, One Condition, then the stylin cream.  This trio has transformed my curls into something I love to show off now!</li>
            <li> Just use a little on the tips of damp hair when it is dry or when your hair needs a little patting down.</li>
            <li> Love this cream for in between styling of my very curly hair. Turns frizz into curl; the curl lasts a long time. Looks perfect in humid or dry weather.</li>
            <li> I like this product as well.  It truly does define curls!  My only reservation is that sometimes it makes my hair &amp;#34;too curly&amp;#34; and you need to use sparingly.  It does bring the curl out and hold it.  I have been putting in on my hair once it is almost dry (after using a bit of gel and/or deva curl foam) and it provides the final touch.  Again, use very sparingly!</li>
            <li> My curls are much softer and shines love these products</li>
            <li> I have used other DevaCurl products but this is my go-to. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy and retains the curl and it looks like the curl of my teenage years (i&#x27;m 50 now). Not crazy about the no-poo shampoo or conditioner - for my money Redken&#x27;s Curvaceous Shampoo and conditioner are way better. Plus I have learned us girl haired girls should not be washing every day. I am now only washing 1x per week, but I condition every day. I used to use a lot of products but now it&#x27;s just the Redken Conditioner and this DevaCurl cream.</li>
            <li> I have been trying product after product to get my fine hair to behave.  Most products are too oily or too heavy resulting in a disaster on my head.  This works great! Keeps the curls together, no frizz, shiny, and looks great</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Not heavy and really tames the curls.</li>
            <li> Looooooooooooove this product.  I like a softer hold than the deva curl gel, and this is perfect.  Keeps my hair soft and frizz free, but also locks in curl.  I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
            <li> Keeps my curls looking good and conditioned and not stiff.  It has a nice smell too.  My hair is permed and sometimes looks dry and frizzy.  This seems to keep it under control and does not make it look and feel stiff.  I am not fond of gel because it sometimes makes my hair look glued and sticky.  This makes my curls look natural and soft.  That is what I wanted from the product and that is what I am getting.  Overall I am pleased with DevaCurl products.</li>
            <li> Love this styling cream. I mix it with the Deva Curl Angel Light Hold Defining Gel. I have fine color-treated curly hair and this combination helps to keep the frizz away.</li>
            <li> This styling cream creates soft curls, it is not a sticky product, gives a soft hold without weighing curls down.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this product and decided to order it.  It works well for my curly hair and maintains shape and frizz.</li>
            <li> She says it makes her hair celebrity status worthy. And I think she looks great too! Try it and you will see!</li>
            <li> Works great on my curly hair!</li>
            <li> This product is perfectly suited for my naturally curly hair.  It helps eliminate frizz while enhancing the curls.  It also smells delicious.</li>
            <li> I sent my sister a sample of this and she LOVES it so I had to order her a whole bottle.&lt;br /&gt;She has very beautiful curly hair and she thinks it makes her curls perfect.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this product, I hated it. But then I went to a Deva certified stylist who not only gave me a fantastic haircut but showed me the right way to use all the Deva products to get the best results. My hair is very, very dry and very curly. I have ALWAYS wrapped my hair in towel after showering and then put styling products in after it was just a tad dry. WRONG. For my hair, my stylist told me to finish in the shower but apply the products while my hair is sopping wet IN the shower. So, I flip my hair forward and apply a few pumps of the Deva Curl B&#x27;Leave In. It&#x27;s called a &amp;#34;Curl Booster and Volumizer&amp;#34; which scared me, but I use it as a leave in moisturizer. I apply it by scrunching it into my hair, trying not to separate the strand of curls. Then I use THIS product, the Styling Cream. Same way, in the shower after B&#x27;Leave In on very wet hair. I use 2 pumps of this and it&#x27;s plenty. Then, I gently dab at my hair until it&#x27;s not dripping, which doesn&#x27;t take long. I do not wrap it in a towel anymore (I was told it disrupts the curls too much and I think that&#x27;s true!). I honestly cannot believe the difference it&#x27;s made in my curls. I never have crunchy curls. My curls are soft and shiny. Once in a while, I use the Set It Free spray - on those super humid days mostly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have curly hair and are constantly questing for new products, I highly recommend finding a Deva trained stylist in your area and going in at least once for the stylist to recommend products and how to use them best for your hair. My daughter has curly hair too and uses completely different Deva products. Once you know what and how to use them, you&#x27;ll be a fan.</li>
            <li> This product did not work well for me. It give me frizzier hair and it made my hair look and feel very dry.</li>
