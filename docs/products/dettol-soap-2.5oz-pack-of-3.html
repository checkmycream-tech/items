            <li>best 24 months before 2008).</li>
            <li>Best antiseptic soap on the market.</li>
            <li>Dettol soaps manufactured in Indonesia and Dubai are excellent products</li>
            <li>It is that good!</li>
            <li>Great product to use when there&#x27;s lots of grease or disinfecting to be done.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>but I think if you are an athlete it is good to keep afew of these around.</li>
            <li>I read Dettol was good for acne</li>
            <li>good for washing hands in the kitchen its a sanitizes</li>
            <li>Very nice to have handy.</li>
            <li>Great soap, top choice for home use to help prevent or alleviate acne, or for those at risk for infections including MRSA.  </li>
            <li>If it does, I&#x27;m going to continue buying this soap because I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>love this soap and the Antiseptic quality cant be beat!</li>
            <li>For maximum effectiveness, wash with this soap for one minute or longer, followed by a thorough rinse in warm, running water.  </li>
            <li>The soap is JUST ok, nothing spectacular in my opinion.</li>
            <li>and as he is a normally healthy child, it began to concern us that he kept coming home from school with a lot of coughs and colds.</li>
            <li>We went to the school meetings and watched the TV News as they discussed more and more outbreaks of this MRSA and also Meningitis.</li>
            <li>100% sure with Dettol.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells fresh and good as well</li>
            <li>OK... depends from which merchant you get this from.</li>
            <li>so be sure to moisturize after shower, bath, etc.</li>
            <li>I like Zest better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it cleans well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I love this product and it prevented acne from reappearing on my shoulders.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, not thte best small</li>
            <li>I bought this soap because I have 2 wrestling boys and skin diseases are easily passed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I can&#x27;t handle the strong, industrial, jet engine degreaser smell this product has.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not completely gone yet, but the reduction of acne I have experienced is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>This soap is great, especially during the summer months.</li>
            <li>The blocked subaceous glands were primarily on my buttocks and in my underarms.  </li>
            <li>Great for minor cuts and abrasions.</li>
            <li>I feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I like the scent as it makes me smell clean.</li>
            <li>I was going to have surgury and wanted to clean my stiches with this after the surgery to prevent infection.</li>
            <li>Also, when I need to clean wonds of my kids</li>
            <li>a quick nightly bath with a scrub of dettol soap kept the bites infection free and the bacteria to a minimum.</li>
            <li>Better than Triclosan and gentle on hands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never heard of Dettol soap, but on Amazon it sounded antiseptic and more gentle than what you can buy in big-box stores.  </li>
            <li>(where I suppose there are more health regulations), but I&#x27;m very grateful for the benefits I got from Dettol.</li>
            <li>There are more economical choices per ounce offered here if you can use larger bars.  </li>
            <li>While not everyone needs to regularly use an antibacterial product, this is a good choice for those who are at special risk for infection, such as diabetics.  </li>
            <li>To obtain greater germicidal effect, it would be necessary to use a surgical-quality scrub like Hibiclens or povidone-iodine.</li>
            <li>buy more again in future.</li>
            <li>but it smells very antiseptic and medicine like so getting them to use it is a match in itself!</li>
            <li>And to top it, such inflated prices....</li>
            <li>Will keep your skin really clean and clear.</li>
            <li>For use on the whole body.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On converting Rs. 61 (which is its cost in INR), turns out to be around $1, for which the manufacturer is costing $5.80, which is just a straight loot.</li>
            <li>No issues, really.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>/&gt; thanks</li>
            <li>I bought this soap for my boyfriend because he has had a couple bouts with MRSA, and this seemed like a better soap to use when it comes to preventing MRSA and other skin problems/germs.</li>
            <li>My acne is clearing up so quickly, unlike it does with my current face wash.</li>
            <li>This soap would also be very effective in daily use against underarm or other body odor if you cannot or choose not to use standard deodorant products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The liquid is great too for cleaning your home to using as an Antiseptic to putting small amount (less than 10 drops) into 8 oz glass of water and gargle with it to kill germs and also gets rid of coughing.</li>
            <li>This Dettol soap and liquid are top sellers in India where they usually have very clear complexions.</li>
            <li>Since my skin tends to be dry and sensitive, I have for years been using mild oatmeal-based soap, which wasn&#x27;t helping the new problem.  </li>
            <li>It bears no resemblance (other than the label) to the product I am accustomed to, which is made in Indonesia: this is a soft, emollient, light yellow soap with a gentle fragrance.</li>
            <li>Getting a new puppy is exciting for many, but for germ phobes like me, it can be quite uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>It has a potent chemical odor, is brown, hard, and does not form lather.</li>
            <li>(slash)&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if this is even legal to sell such products manufactured for Indian markets directly in US markets.</li>
            <li>so no harsh results from using this soap.</li>
            <li>This stiff works, it kills odors, and you can feel that stuff if clean.</li>
            <li>the USA we usually depend on Antibacterial ingredient Triclosan but it has been found to harm our Eco system and has developed resistant baterial strains with use making it less effective than DETTOl.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the USA we usually depend on Antibacterial ingredient Triclosan but it has been found to harm our Eco system and has developed resistant baterial strains with use making it less effective than DETTOl.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been one week so far, so</li>
            <li>Why, because the bars seems better quality and larger, at least the ones I just got, and the bars are yellow in color, not orange like the ones made in India.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on our poodle who suffers from chronic bacterial infections, and it worked better than any pet shampoo or medication from the vet!</li>
            <li>Dettol leaves the good bacteria and only kills the bad bacteria</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Amazon should filter such products, and maintain its standard, not let it fall down this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An image of the cost of product as printed on the cover.&lt;br /&gt;http</li>
            <li> Allow bar to drain and dry between uses.</li>
            <li> Does not leave your skin too dry or with a sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li> We often employ handwashing products with the same active ingredient in lab settings.  </li>
            <li> (If you get some odd-smelling or ugly brown bars, return them right off as they are not the real thing.)  </li>
            <li> One of our young son&#x27;s started to school this past September</li>
            <li> and I recommend them highly; particularly to prevent skin infection, and for sensitive or difficult skin.</li>
            <li> with this in mind, and 4 months with this cough not getting better my Wife began searching for other hand cleaners on the market to use with our son in school and DETTOL is the one name that kept coming on over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;Dettol Soap and also the liquid has an ingredient in it that kills this MRSA Bug and other BAD bacterias in as little as 15 seconds of use with water... probably as long as your child will actually wash his hands for.</li>
            <li> For three months this Summer and Fall, I suffered from a brand new skin problem of unknown origin--blocked subaceous  glands (some of which became seriously infected, had to be lanced and required that I take oral antibiotics).  </li>
            <li> We also took our child to his Doctor who just told us it was normal for our child to get sick when he first started to school.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I realized it was expired, threw it away, and decided that I would never buy soap or perhaps any other product from amazon again.</li>
            <li> I have four teens and they can leave quite a mess.</li>
            <li> With this soap you should have no more or less problems with skin issues as it has an antibacterial ingredient in it that protects the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the fact that Amazon includes it as an Add on Item, makes the whole thing sad!</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have cut off a small chunk of this soap and put in a small container that fits in our child&#x27;s pocket so he can take it to school and use there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in this soap, and it concerns me that it comes from India and not the U.S.</li>
            <li> Was not really impressed with the overall smell I thought it would be overwellming</li>
            <li> Size is way small not average size soap at all a little disappointed but the product works.</li>
            <li> Mrsa is not nice!</li>
            <li> (Also has a high-quality bar soap base.)</li>
            <li> Dettol soap I bought from Amazon is a horrible product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> All the products I have used, have worked to my fullest satisfaction. I have four teens and they can leave quite a mess. This stiff works, it kills odors, and you can feel that stuff if clean.Even in the air.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, not thte best small but I think if you are an athlete it is good to keep afew of these around. Mrsa is not nice!</li>
            <li> I bought this soap for my boyfriend because he has had a couple bouts with MRSA, and this seemed like a better soap to use when it comes to preventing MRSA and other skin problems/germs. Since the pack came with 3, I kept one for myself. I read Dettol was good for acne so I figured I would give it a shot. I have a stubborn spot on my cheek that doesn&#x27;t want to stay away. I&#x27;ve tried masques, various cleansers, but nothing ever solved the problem. However, I have been using this soap on my face twice daily, and I&#x27;m amazed. My acne is clearing up so quickly, unlike it does with my current face wash. It&#x27;s not completely gone yet, but the reduction of acne I have experienced is phenomenal. It&#x27;s only been one week so far, so I hope the progress continues. If it does, I&#x27;m going to continue buying this soap because I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Getting a new puppy is exciting for many, but for germ phobes like me, it can be quite uncomfortable. I use this daily in shower. I feel clean and refreshed. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin too much. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I like it and don&#x27;t mind the smell. I gave one bar to a friend who was going to be traveling and staying in RV camp grounds and she was worried about using the public showers.</li>
            <li> Great soap, top choice for home use to help prevent or alleviate acne, or for those at risk for infections including MRSA.  (Also has a high-quality bar soap base.) As a university microbiologist who has suffered two instances of personal MERSA infection in private life, one involving a limb-threatening hospitalization, I trust this product to deal with abrasions or cuts and before trimming my nails.  We often employ handwashing products with the same active ingredient in lab settings.  To obtain greater germicidal effect, it would be necessary to use a surgical-quality scrub like Hibiclens or povidone-iodine. While not everyone needs to regularly use an antibacterial product, this is a good choice for those who are at special risk for infection, such as diabetics.  This soap would also be very effective in daily use against underarm or other body odor if you cannot or choose not to use standard deodorant products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Realize these are smaller, personal-sized bars.  There are more economical choices per ounce offered here if you can use larger bars.  (If you get some odd-smelling or ugly brown bars, return them right off as they are not the real thing.)  For maximum effectiveness, wash with this soap for one minute or longer, followed by a thorough rinse in warm, running water.  Allow bar to drain and dry between uses.</li>
            <li> After about 2-3 weeks of using the Dettol soap I one day decided to read the lable, and to my surprise I saw the phrase (mgf:best 24 months before 2008). Then I realized it was expired, threw it away, and decided that I would never buy soap or perhaps any other product from amazon again.</li>
            <li> One of our young son&#x27;s started to school this past September and as he is a normally healthy child, it began to concern us that he kept coming home from school with a lot of coughs and colds. Then the school began sending notices home to all the parents about MRSA or superbugs that are resistant to antibiotics. We went to the school meetings and watched the TV News as they discussed more and more outbreaks of this MRSA and also Meningitis. We also took our child to his Doctor who just told us it was normal for our child to get sick when he first started to school.&lt;br /&gt;So with this in mind, and 4 months with this cough not getting better my Wife began searching for other hand cleaners on the market to use with our son in school and DETTOL is the one name that kept coming on over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;Dettol Soap and also the liquid has an ingredient in it that kills this MRSA Bug and other BAD bacterias in as little as 15 seconds of use with water... probably as long as your child will actually wash his hands for. Dettol leaves the good bacteria and only kills the bad bacteria so no harsh results from using this soap. This Dettol soap and liquid are top sellers in India where they usually have very clear complexions. With this soap you should have no more or less problems with skin issues as it has an antibacterial ingredient in it that protects the skin.&lt;br /&gt;We have cut off a small chunk of this soap and put in a small container that fits in our child&#x27;s pocket so he can take it to school and use there and we know he is now washing his hands and not so worried any longer now we have this as it kills the MRSA bug in 15 seconds with it&#x27;s Chloroxylenol ingredient. Better than Triclosan and gentle on hands. For use on the whole body.&lt;br /&gt;Be 100% sure with Dettol.&lt;br /&gt;We love this soap and the Antiseptic quality cant be beat! The liquid is great too for cleaning your home to using as an Antiseptic to putting small amount (less than 10 drops) into 8 oz glass of water and gargle with it to kill germs and also gets rid of coughing. DO NOT SWALLOW only rinse and spit out! Follow with water rinse thoroughly and you are set.&lt;br /&gt;In the USA we usually depend on Antibacterial ingredient Triclosan but it has been found to harm our Eco system and has developed resistant baterial strains with use making it less effective than DETTOl.&lt;br /&gt;Dettol is the number 1 selling soap and antiseptic in India.&lt;br /&gt;There is no wonder why Once you use this product you wont go back to anything else ~! It is that good!kill germs and also gets rid of coughing. DO NOT SWALLOW only rinse and spit out! Follow with water rinse thoroughly and you are set.  In the USA we usually depend on Antibacterial ingredient Triclosan but it has been found to harm our Eco system and has developed resistant baterial strains with use making it less effective than DETTOl.  Dettol is the number 1 selling soap and antiseptic in India.   There is no wonder why Once you use this product you wont go back to anything else ~! It is that good!</li>
            <li> Recommend this for anyone who regularly cuts or scrapes themselves. Straight-forward solution to prevent infection or irritation. Bars are smallish compared to others.</li>
            <li> Great product to use when there&#x27;s lots of grease or disinfecting to be done.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more again in future.</li>
            <li> good for washing hands in the kitchen its a sanitizes</li>
            <li> Best antiseptic soap on the market.</li>
            <li> Same as I used in Europe. I like the scent as it makes me smell clean.</li>
            <li> Received on time. As advertised</li>
            <li> I was going to have surgury and wanted to clean my stiches with this after the surgery to prevent infection. Also, when I need to clean wonds of my kids I wash my hands with dettel soap to makesure no germs to cause of infection. Very nice to have handy.</li>
            <li> Great for minor cuts and abrasions. I used this over the summer when the kids would have bug bites that they inevitably scratch.&lt;br /&gt;My son likes to pick at bits and often causes a local infection, a quick nightly bath with a scrub of dettol soap kept the bites infection free and the bacteria to a minimum.</li>
            <li> Daughter with skin problems has found this to ease her irritations....we will continue to order.  Smells fresh and good as well</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because I have 2 wrestling boys and skin diseases are easily passed.  I think it prevents germs but it smells very antiseptic and medicine like so getting them to use it is a match in itself!</li>
            <li> This is a product manufactured in India and has Indian Rupees printed on it. On converting Rs. 61 (which is its cost in INR), turns out to be around $1, for which the manufacturer is costing $5.80, which is just a straight loot. And the fact that Amazon includes it as an Add on Item, makes the whole thing sad! I do buy Indian things in US, but not paying at max thrice the amount! This is just close to 6 times the price. Amazon should filter such products, and maintain its standard, not let it fall down this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An image of the cost of product as printed on the cover.&lt;br /&gt;http (colon) (slash) (slash) postimg.org (slash) image (slash) jtlra0dsj (slash)&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if this is even legal to sell such products manufactured for Indian markets directly in US markets. I didn&#x27;t see any signs of import duties paid and stuff. And to top it, such inflated prices....</li>
            <li> OK... depends from which merchant you get this from. I like the soap bars from - Intellilabs.  Why, because the bars seems better quality and larger, at least the ones I just got, and the bars are yellow in color, not orange like the ones made in India.  So look closely.  Does not leave your skin too dry or with a sticky feeling.  I use it in the summer time after working outside in the garden or mowing the lawn.  This costs about 40 cents per bar in India...but the quality is inferior.  So, ask seller the color and country of manufacturing.</li>
            <li> My daughter, who works in radiation oncology, told me this product cleared up her skin. I tried it on our poodle who suffers from chronic bacterial infections, and it worked better than any pet shampoo or medication from the vet!</li>
            <li> This soap is great, especially during the summer months. It can be a bit drying so be sure to moisturize after shower, bath, etc. Will keep your skin really clean and clear.</li>
            <li> Size is way small not average size soap at all a little disappointed but the product works.</li>
            <li> The soap is JUST ok, nothing spectacular in my opinion. I was expecting the smell of the liquid Dettol which I diluted into a spray bottle to bathe with my regular soap. I think I will just stick to that method instead. No issues, really. Just not my preference.</li>
            <li> In May of 2012, I had a wring worm on my foot. After reading how I might have contracted this fungus, and the fact that it was infected,I immediately thought of detail antiseptic soap and liquid. Back in the Caribbean we use this product to keep things like fungus and bacteria off of our skin. It really works. This is the only product I use both in my shower and bath.</li>
            <li> Finally, a cure, showering with Dettol bar soap.  For three months this Summer and Fall, I suffered from a brand new skin problem of unknown origin--blocked subaceous  glands (some of which became seriously infected, had to be lanced and required that I take oral antibiotics).  The blocked subaceous glands were primarily on my buttocks and in my underarms.  Since my skin tends to be dry and sensitive, I have for years been using mild oatmeal-based soap, which wasn&#x27;t helping the new problem.  On-line, I read that antiseptic soaps might help.  But I worried about their harshness.  I&#x27;d never heard of Dettol soap, but on Amazon it sounded antiseptic and more gentle than what you can buy in big-box stores.  I got some, and within a couple of weeks, with showering using Dettol, the blocked subaceous glands (including reddened ones) were gone!  I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in this soap, and it concerns me that it comes from India and not the U.S. (where I suppose there are more health regulations), but I&#x27;m very grateful for the benefits I got from Dettol.</li>
            <li> I think this soap works, but I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> The formula of Dettol bar soap varies with country of manufacture. The country of manufacture should therefore be indicated in the Amazon product description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dettol soap I bought from Amazon is a horrible product. It has a potent chemical odor, is brown, hard, and does not form lather. It bears no resemblance (other than the label) to the product I am accustomed to, which is made in Indonesia: this is a soft, emollient, light yellow soap with a gentle fragrance. The soap purchased from Amazon is made in India.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dettol soaps manufactured in Indonesia and Dubai are excellent products and I recommend them highly; particularly to prevent skin infection, and for sensitive or difficult skin.</li>
            <li> Was not really impressed with the overall smell I thought it would be overwellming but it fdid not last.I like Zest better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it cleans well.&lt;br /&gt;However, I can&#x27;t handle the strong, industrial, jet engine degreaser smell this product has.&lt;br /&gt;Now maybe it smells different on your skin after you wash and rinse, but the ordor  from the product that comes through the wrapper, is not  anything I want to smell like .</li>
            <li> Dettol Soap a must  have ,for babies and kids  and keeps bugs away .&lt;br /&gt;excellent product..................... will buy again&lt;br /&gt; thanks</li>
            <li> Very small worth the price</li>
            <li> Been using for years and will continue to, not a fan of any soap smell so I love this product and it prevented acne from reappearing on my shoulders.</li>
