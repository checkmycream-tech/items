            <li>the price, this is an awesome product.  </li>
            <li>While this may not be the best eye product I have ever used</li>
            <li>This stuff is great!  </li>
            <li>And who&#x27;s the genius that thought it&#x27;s a good idea to add perfume in an eye cream???!!!???</li>
            <li>This eye firming treatment is excellent if used as directed.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li>All were excellent..</li>
            <li>Also package was perfectly packed.  </li>
            <li>Very impressed, and I&#x27;m never giving this stuff up!</li>
            <li>This product line is wonderful; carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries!  </li>

            <li>What a great product!</li>
            <li>Works great for me!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m 25 and found this product wonderful.</li>
            <li>So in love with Y2B!!!</li>
            <li>That was pleasant!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very good cream for the price point, though.</li>
            <li>Great product, best price!</li>
            <li>I am quite happy with it.</li>
            <li>Under my eyes look great, so....five stars.</li>
            <li>I though it would work great on me.  </li>
            <li>She was happy.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t smell great.</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be great, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference yet.</li>
            <li>Without exception, I consider each one a great buy and deliver what they promise.  </li>
            <li>Great product again from YES TO......</li>
            <li>Smells great, not fruity as the name may suggest, almost floral like.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>I purchased this because it was recommended by the book bellies beautiful as being safer for pregnancy and because the Environmental Working Group SkinDeep database gave it a good safety rating.</li>
            <li>It works nice!</li>
            <li>I thought it was pleasant.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant, though a bit heavier than I prefer.</li>
            <li>Very nice and smooth, made my eyes feel great!</li>
            <li>Secondly, it is a fairly dense cream, but absorbs well, and feels pleasant, without any stinging in the eye area (</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product for a drug store item.  </li>
            <li>This eye cream feels really good.  </li>
            <li>reside in S. Florida for a good part of the year so to say that I am overexposed even with floppy hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen is not understating it.</li>
            <li>It felt good and that is about it.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good eye cream at a good price.</li>
            <li>Wonderful smooth cream, goes on well before makeup.</li>
            <li>for a wonderful product and quick postage from Amazan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it has some great benefits with dedicated use, but here&#x27;s the problem:  </li>
            <li>I love this eye treatment!</li>
            <li>Fabulous!!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>and I love tomatoes!</li>
            <li>I follow the EWG&#x27;s standards and besides the fragrance, the ingredients are completely safe!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It has a nice feel, dispenses well, absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I haven&#x27;t found any eye cream to be a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>The smell is also very strong.</li>
            <li>Best, all natural, eye cream I can find!  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice natural product and would be good for someone in their twenties.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It applies very smoothly and disappears quickly.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>I love that it is made from blueberries and helps with firming your eyes.</li>
            <li>so I need something that&#x27;s more intensive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it is a better review.</li>
            <li>I have used many under eye moisturizers and this one is my fave.</li>
            <li>I love 90% of the</li>
            <li>I love Yes to Products which is why I am giving it a 5 star.</li>
            <li>but i just don&#x27;t need to apply one more thing at night.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Within a week&#x27;s time my eye area looked fresher and felt better to the touch.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Yes</li>
            <li>so the lines under my eyes magically appeared what felt like over night.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Perhaps you may or may not  have a better outcome</li>
            <li>I love this line of products.</li>
            <li>Its just magical.</li>
            <li>My favorite to date.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this product keeps away many wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It smells like plastic more than blueberries.  </li>
            <li>, I love carrots</li>
            <li>I am glad this as well is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>I will make a better comment after allergy season</li>
            <li>Love all the Blueberry products.  </li>
            <li>This product works better than products that I have used that cost 5 times more.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>Which was such a great deal!</li>
            <li>$20 product for free!  </li>
            <li>I have used many products that my Aesthetician had recommended and I&#x27;ve gotta say</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m look forward to trying more products from this company.</li>
            <li>I have two kids under 4, so I am asleep deprived, and I use wrinkle cream to make my eyes look more refreshed after a night of NO sleep.</li>
            <li>I think the skin under my eyes looks much better than it did before I used this product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>So if you are looking for a more intensive firming product, then this is probably not it.</li>
            <li>Smells lovely, a bit sweet/ floral.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the product and now use everywhere on my face that I used to use regular face cream...</li>
            <li>I was pleased with its results and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li>crows feet around my eyes are somewhat diminished, but more importantly to me,</li>
            <li>where their eyes are concerned, but I can say, without a doubt, that this product is effective, and, if it doesn&#x27;t work immediately for you, give it time, because it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>So far, it seems like a good buy :)</li>
            <li>Just okay, nothing special, didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li>I also like the applicator- very easy to get the right amount.</li>
            <li>I am 51 and have some fine lines and this serum works for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 32 and the fine lines/</li>
            <li>how well it reduces fine lines.</li>
            <li>Works to diminish those fine lines around eyes.</li>
            <li>I ran out for a month and noticed a huge difference with my fine lines under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Works amazingly well on my fine lines/wrinkles and is very conditioning.</li>
            <li>I love the Yes line, and I&#x27;ve had great success with it, but this was definitely not a product for me.</li>
            <li>Feels fantastic on my eyes.  </li>
            <li>This is the best cream to firm your eyes.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>however, family members came home and each one at separate times said my skin looks so healthy and how fresh I appeared.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a light fragrant smell that doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, smells pleasant, and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m pretty thrilled with this right</li>
            <li>Will update if I notice any significant changes to the under eye.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get results.</li>
            <li>I originally received this product as a sample w/ an order from the Yes</li>
            <li>Sure, lasted awhile, but since I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan I didn&#x27;t really want it to.</li>
            <li>I get all right results with respect to fine lines and puffiness&lt;</li>
            <li>but you can see the full list in the product</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find this product nice-smelling and of a nice consistency.</li>
            <li>This was a gift to my mom and she really loved it because she could actually feel the difference in a matter of weeks.</li>
            <li>It makes it look like I slept a full night even when I&#x27;m dragging my butt to the nearest caffeine dispenser.</li>
            <li>This applied very minimal to these parts of the eyes and eureka all gone and makes a great improvement.</li>
            <li>this is a good product for someone who is young and doesn&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I love new products, and often can see a quick difference.  </li>
            <li>, this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used very long yet but seems to be as good as anything else</li>
            <li>The scent is not too strong, and the consistency makes me feel like I&#x27;m really moisturizing my eye area.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t speak to the eye firming capabilities, but overall a good product.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother, noticeably fresh and brighter.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s paraben free, cruelty free, and mostly natural.</li>
            <li>I love that the ingredients are all natural.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel to my face once dry.</li>
            <li>The texture is perfect, a little goes a LONG way, and I&#x27;m seeing a difference in the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have used so many creams and this one actually reduced my eye lines and made my eyes brighter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only just started using this, but I love how it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the first bottle for well over a month.</li>
            <li>However, after using this for 3+ weeks consistently, I see no difference in my crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li>Does smell funny.</li>
            <li>Definitely feel and see the area around my eyes look more radiant.</li>
            <li>It provides great moisture which prevents delicate eye area from drying out.</li>
            <li>After my first go at it, I didn&#x27;t expect to see any changes</li>
            <li>First try too....</li>
            <li>After applying this cream for the first time I felt tightening sensation under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin so this gets an A+ from me for actually being good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I cannot really comment to the firming because right now I am fighing allergies so in the morning</li>
            <li>it made my puffy eyes look better immediately and only got better with long term use.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product but didn&#x27;t get that far.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave a waxy buildup that so many of these products do and it absorbs quickly into the skin which tells me it is going somewhere other than my pillow</li>
            <li>I think It works pretty well, although I haven&#x27;t used it as much as I should.</li>
            <li>I wonder if it actually dyes your skin, or if my extremely fair skin has some strange reaction to it?</li>
            <li>It certainly wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>And if your only issues are fine lines and/or puffiness, this may be all you need.  </li>
            <li>No issues whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a big difference in how suple the eye area has become, and as a result the fine lines are deminished.</li>
            <li>Retin A the only clinically proven product for smoothing fine lines.</li>
            <li>nothing much works if you are over a certain age.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t hurt to try it, but I think it&#x27;s better to spend your money on a different product or something completely natural and cheaper- like a pure oil.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to all cosmetics, but this one is very pure and gentle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-irritating and it&#x27;s very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>But for something under twenty dollars, this really can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>Been using this product for over a month now, and haven&#x27;t really seen any results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for this eye cream.</li>
            <li>but I gave it to my sister and she absolutely loves it and has continued to buy this brand since.</li>
            <li>This product is very plant based and WORKS..</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t use this 2x per day, just in the mornings so perhaps that is the reason why i&#x27;m not seeing much change</li>
            <li>It really does help with the undereye lines.  </li>
            <li>just so I would be ready for when I did run out.</li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t see much of a change.</li>
            <li>Maybe results aren&#x27;t noticed until the whole bottle is used?</li>
            <li>Maybe there&#x27;s nothing that really does anything for them besides injections, but I am hoping otherwise.</li>
            <li>I really like this whole line</li>
            <li>but if you use too much it takes a bit to rub it in.  </li>
            <li>I really like the texture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been really carried away by an eye cream</li>
            <li>Was very oily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not certain how this is working, perhaps it is just firming up the skin so that the it holds in the lower eye puff better, but either way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an active outdoors person with fair skin, and have gotten a fair bit of sun damage unfortunately.</li>
            <li>On repeat applications it was less noticeable, but after using this treatment for several weeks I see a fair reduction in my under-eye bags.</li>
            <li>Not here - evidently, this is too natural to do anything.</li>
            <li>This in my new night cream for life!</li>
            <li>ingredients list on the main page gets cut off before it is finished</li>
            <li>Yes, I have used much more expensive products that perform somewhat better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent product, like the feel of the cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced after a month of use that it does much for fine lines or any other eye area skin issues, but will continue to use and see.</li>
            <li>I would say it is a high quality eye cream compared to its price.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I bought this eye cream because it does not contain any parabens, is all-natural, and came highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I gave it four stars though because it is almost completely natural and better for you than other products you can buy.</li>
            <li>I really like that this product IS all natural and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I was completely amazed that an $80 eye serum couldn&#x27;t do anything for me, but this worked in such a short amount of time for a much better price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have normal skin</li>
            <li>And thirdly, I think it actually is reducing fine wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it works just fine, dispels dark circles and minimizes lines.</li>
            <li>The good news is that it does not cause my sensitive skin to react badly, and is free from animal testing.</li>
            <li>I love this eye cream and have been using it day and night for the past two years.  </li>
            <li>I still have not finished my first bottle of this, but I picked up a second</li>
            <li>The price I got on Amazon was significantly cheaper than any other store I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely sold on ytb.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough for twice-daily use&lt;</li>
            <li>Ingredients are generally natural and there&#x27;s no animal testing</li>
            <li>This product arrived at my house early.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin or allergies, this may  not be for you.</li>
            <li>I think it is the product that requires continued use to really see the difference, but I like it enough to have bought if twice</li>
            <li>Like an old person or unwashed body.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell It didn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li>I was about to give up until I came by this product in my local Whole Foods and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes feels soft and moist throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>May 2014: I wanted to come back and update now that I have been using this product for a few more months.</li>
            <li>The other thing I did not like about this was that the product seemed to clump and kind of build up on my skin, so that I would feel little bits of it and have to brush it away.</li>
            <li>I usually break out in rashes, itch, or get irritated easily however this didn&#x27;t do that for me.</li>
            <li>the ONLY product I&#x27;ve found that works well for older women is roc retinol correxion crème.</li>
            <li>I am also happy with how long it has lasted considering how expensive it is.</li>
            <li>I had tried high end products to get rid of them, such as department store brands and the Philosophy brand, and none of them helped me.</li>
            <li>I use jojoba oil at night and that usually helps hydrate over night, but during the day I needed a light cream that can go under makeup.</li>
            <li>I try to keep my beauty routine as &#x27;natural&#x27; as possible avoiding the really chemically full eye creams is hard.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t too thick, absorbs quickly, skin looks better after only a few uses.</li>
            <li>First of all, it does not have an overpowering smell (I know other</li>
            <li>So, I was disappointed when my Whole Foods stopped carrying it, but very happy to find it on Amazon for much less!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as well as some other brands I&#x27;ve used, but this is the best eye cream I&#x27;ve found without all of the bad chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>To brand in general.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li>I am 23 years old and while I actually don&#x27;t have haggard skin, wrinkles, or any signs of aging..</li>
            <li>So far it is the only eye cream I have tried</li>
            <li>However, if you have dark circles under your eyes as well (I recently developed these, probably from not getting enough sleep), this product hasn&#x27;t really helped with that issue.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could find something that has more dramatic effects with the crows</li>
            <li>I have often been upset by certain under eye lines passed down to me via hereditary.</li>
            <li>but I am a skin care junkie for sure and can see a difference in just a few days, I&#x27;e been putting in all over my face, not just my eyes, I am in my mid-thirties have small lines here and there, nothing major.  </li>
            <li>however it&#x27;s nothing special because it has not helped with darkness or puffiness which are my other issues and at this price not worth a purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This doesn&#x27;t do much for my dark circles.  </li>
            <li>Odd that this review requires a certain number of words.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say its sooo much worse than other eye creams I&#x27;ve used, it seems pretty typical and I will say it seems moisturizing (although how many moisturizers are not somewhat moisturizing?)</li>
            <li>Even with the small sample, I noticed enough of a difference right away to order an entire bottle.</li>
            <li>I bought it mainly to help with dark circles.  </li>
            <li>It does take a few minutes to absorb into the skin but it certainly doe not have consistency like butter.</li>
            <li>I feel like this actually made my fine lines worse.</li>

            <li> I am quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> Under my eyes look great, so....five stars.</li>
            <li> I though it would work great on me.  </li>
            <li> She was happy.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t smell great.</li>
            <li> Great price.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be great, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference yet.</li>
            <li> Without exception, I consider each one a great buy and deliver what they promise.  </li>
            <li> Great product again from YES TO......</li>
            <li> Smells great, not fruity as the name may suggest, almost floral like.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was recommended by the book bellies beautiful as being safer for pregnancy and because the Environmental Working Group SkinDeep database gave it a good safety rating.</li>
            <li> It works nice!</li>
            <li> I thought it was pleasant.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant, though a bit heavier than I prefer.</li>
            <li> Very nice and smooth, made my eyes feel great!</li>
            <li> Secondly, it is a fairly dense cream, but absorbs well, and feels pleasant, without any stinging in the eye area (</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product for a drug store item.  </li>
            <li> This eye cream feels really good.  </li>
            <li> reside in S. Florida for a good part of the year so to say that I am overexposed even with floppy hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen is not understating it.</li>
            <li> It felt good and that is about it.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good eye cream at a good price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smooth cream, goes on well before makeup.</li>
            <li> for a wonderful product and quick postage from Amazan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it has some great benefits with dedicated use, but here&#x27;s the problem:  </li>
            <li> I love this eye treatment!</li>
            <li> Fabulous!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> and I love tomatoes!</li>
            <li> I follow the EWG&#x27;s standards and besides the fragrance, the ingredients are completely safe!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> It has a nice feel, dispenses well, absorbs well.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I haven&#x27;t found any eye cream to be a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> The smell is also very strong.</li>
            <li> Best, all natural, eye cream I can find!  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice natural product and would be good for someone in their twenties.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It applies very smoothly and disappears quickly.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> I love that it is made from blueberries and helps with firming your eyes.</li>
            <li> so I need something that&#x27;s more intensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it is a better review.</li>
            <li> I have used many under eye moisturizers and this one is my fave.</li>
            <li> I love 90% of the</li>
            <li> I love Yes to Products which is why I am giving it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> but i just don&#x27;t need to apply one more thing at night.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Within a week&#x27;s time my eye area looked fresher and felt better to the touch.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Yes</li>
            <li> so the lines under my eyes magically appeared what felt like over night.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Perhaps you may or may not  have a better outcome</li>
            <li> I love this line of products.</li>
            <li> Its just magical.</li>
            <li> My favorite to date.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product keeps away many wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It smells like plastic more than blueberries.  </li>
            <li> , I love carrots</li>
            <li> I am glad this as well is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I will make a better comment after allergy season</li>
            <li> Love all the Blueberry products.  </li>
            <li> This product works better than products that I have used that cost 5 times more.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Which was such a great deal!</li>
            <li> $20 product for free!  </li>
            <li> I have used many products that my Aesthetician had recommended and I&#x27;ve gotta say</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m look forward to trying more products from this company.</li>
            <li> I have two kids under 4, so I am asleep deprived, and I use wrinkle cream to make my eyes look more refreshed after a night of NO sleep.</li>
            <li> I think the skin under my eyes looks much better than it did before I used this product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> It was okay.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> So if you are looking for a more intensive firming product, then this is probably not it.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, a bit sweet/ floral.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product and now use everywhere on my face that I used to use regular face cream...</li>
            <li> I was pleased with its results and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> crows feet around my eyes are somewhat diminished, but more importantly to me,</li>
            <li> where their eyes are concerned, but I can say, without a doubt, that this product is effective, and, if it doesn&#x27;t work immediately for you, give it time, because it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> So far, it seems like a good buy :)</li>
            <li> Just okay, nothing special, didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> I also like the applicator- very easy to get the right amount.</li>
            <li> I am 51 and have some fine lines and this serum works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 and the fine lines/</li>
            <li> how well it reduces fine lines.</li>
            <li> Works to diminish those fine lines around eyes.</li>
            <li> I ran out for a month and noticed a huge difference with my fine lines under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Works amazingly well on my fine lines/wrinkles and is very conditioning.</li>
            <li> I love the Yes line, and I&#x27;ve had great success with it, but this was definitely not a product for me.</li>
            <li> Feels fantastic on my eyes.  </li>
            <li> This is the best cream to firm your eyes.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly</li>
            <li> however, family members came home and each one at separate times said my skin looks so healthy and how fresh I appeared.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a light fragrant smell that doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, smells pleasant, and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m pretty thrilled with this right</li>
            <li> Will update if I notice any significant changes to the under eye.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get results.</li>
            <li> I originally received this product as a sample w/ an order from the Yes</li>
            <li> Sure, lasted awhile, but since I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan I didn&#x27;t really want it to.</li>
            <li> I get all right results with respect to fine lines and puffiness&lt;</li>
            <li> but you can see the full list in the product</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find this product nice-smelling and of a nice consistency.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my mom and she really loved it because she could actually feel the difference in a matter of weeks.</li>
            <li> It makes it look like I slept a full night even when I&#x27;m dragging my butt to the nearest caffeine dispenser.</li>
            <li> This applied very minimal to these parts of the eyes and eureka all gone and makes a great improvement.</li>
            <li> this is a good product for someone who is young and doesn&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I love new products, and often can see a quick difference.  </li>
            <li> , this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used very long yet but seems to be as good as anything else</li>
            <li> The scent is not too strong, and the consistency makes me feel like I&#x27;m really moisturizing my eye area.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t speak to the eye firming capabilities, but overall a good product.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, noticeably fresh and brighter.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s paraben free, cruelty free, and mostly natural.</li>
            <li> I love that the ingredients are all natural.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel to my face once dry.</li>
            <li> The texture is perfect, a little goes a LONG way, and I&#x27;m seeing a difference in the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have used so many creams and this one actually reduced my eye lines and made my eyes brighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just started using this, but I love how it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the first bottle for well over a month.</li>
            <li> However, after using this for 3+ weeks consistently, I see no difference in my crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> Does smell funny.</li>
            <li> Definitely feel and see the area around my eyes look more radiant.</li>
            <li> It provides great moisture which prevents delicate eye area from drying out.</li>
            <li> After my first go at it, I didn&#x27;t expect to see any changes</li>
            <li> First try too....</li>
            <li> After applying this cream for the first time I felt tightening sensation under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin so this gets an A+ from me for actually being good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I cannot really comment to the firming because right now I am fighing allergies so in the morning</li>
            <li> it made my puffy eyes look better immediately and only got better with long term use.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product but didn&#x27;t get that far.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave a waxy buildup that so many of these products do and it absorbs quickly into the skin which tells me it is going somewhere other than my pillow</li>
            <li> I think It works pretty well, although I haven&#x27;t used it as much as I should.</li>
            <li> I wonder if it actually dyes your skin, or if my extremely fair skin has some strange reaction to it?</li>
            <li> It certainly wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> And if your only issues are fine lines and/or puffiness, this may be all you need.  </li>
            <li> No issues whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a big difference in how suple the eye area has become, and as a result the fine lines are deminished.</li>
            <li> Retin A the only clinically proven product for smoothing fine lines.</li>
            <li> nothing much works if you are over a certain age.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t hurt to try it, but I think it&#x27;s better to spend your money on a different product or something completely natural and cheaper- like a pure oil.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to all cosmetics, but this one is very pure and gentle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-irritating and it&#x27;s very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> But for something under twenty dollars, this really can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over a month now, and haven&#x27;t really seen any results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for this eye cream.</li>
            <li> but I gave it to my sister and she absolutely loves it and has continued to buy this brand since.</li>
            <li> This product is very plant based and WORKS..</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t use this 2x per day, just in the mornings so perhaps that is the reason why i&#x27;m not seeing much change</li>
            <li> It really does help with the undereye lines.  </li>
            <li> just so I would be ready for when I did run out.</li>
            <li> but I really didn&#x27;t see much of a change.</li>
            <li> Maybe results aren&#x27;t noticed until the whole bottle is used?</li>
            <li> Maybe there&#x27;s nothing that really does anything for them besides injections, but I am hoping otherwise.</li>
            <li> I really like this whole line</li>
            <li> but if you use too much it takes a bit to rub it in.  </li>
            <li> I really like the texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been really carried away by an eye cream</li>
            <li> Was very oily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain how this is working, perhaps it is just firming up the skin so that the it holds in the lower eye puff better, but either way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an active outdoors person with fair skin, and have gotten a fair bit of sun damage unfortunately.</li>
            <li> On repeat applications it was less noticeable, but after using this treatment for several weeks I see a fair reduction in my under-eye bags.</li>
            <li> Not here - evidently, this is too natural to do anything.</li>
            <li> This in my new night cream for life!</li>
            <li> ingredients list on the main page gets cut off before it is finished</li>
            <li> Yes, I have used much more expensive products that perform somewhat better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product, like the feel of the cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced after a month of use that it does much for fine lines or any other eye area skin issues, but will continue to use and see.</li>
            <li> I would say it is a high quality eye cream compared to its price.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I bought this eye cream because it does not contain any parabens, is all-natural, and came highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I gave it four stars though because it is almost completely natural and better for you than other products you can buy.</li>
            <li> I really like that this product IS all natural and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I was completely amazed that an $80 eye serum couldn&#x27;t do anything for me, but this worked in such a short amount of time for a much better price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have normal skin</li>
            <li> And thirdly, I think it actually is reducing fine wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it works just fine, dispels dark circles and minimizes lines.</li>
            <li> The good news is that it does not cause my sensitive skin to react badly, and is free from animal testing.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream and have been using it day and night for the past two years.  </li>
            <li> I still have not finished my first bottle of this, but I picked up a second</li>
            <li> The price I got on Amazon was significantly cheaper than any other store I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely sold on ytb.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough for twice-daily use&lt;</li>
            <li> Ingredients are generally natural and there&#x27;s no animal testing</li>
            <li> This product arrived at my house early.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin or allergies, this may  not be for you.</li>
            <li> I think it is the product that requires continued use to really see the difference, but I like it enough to have bought if twice</li>
            <li> Like an old person or unwashed body.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell It didn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> I was about to give up until I came by this product in my local Whole Foods and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes feels soft and moist throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> May 2014: I wanted to come back and update now that I have been using this product for a few more months.</li>
            <li> The other thing I did not like about this was that the product seemed to clump and kind of build up on my skin, so that I would feel little bits of it and have to brush it away.</li>
            <li> I usually break out in rashes, itch, or get irritated easily however this didn&#x27;t do that for me.</li>
            <li> the ONLY product I&#x27;ve found that works well for older women is roc retinol correxion crème.</li>
            <li> I am also happy with how long it has lasted considering how expensive it is.</li>
            <li> I had tried high end products to get rid of them, such as department store brands and the Philosophy brand, and none of them helped me.</li>
            <li> I use jojoba oil at night and that usually helps hydrate over night, but during the day I needed a light cream that can go under makeup.</li>
            <li> I try to keep my beauty routine as &#x27;natural&#x27; as possible avoiding the really chemically full eye creams is hard.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t too thick, absorbs quickly, skin looks better after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> First of all, it does not have an overpowering smell (I know other</li>
            <li> So, I was disappointed when my Whole Foods stopped carrying it, but very happy to find it on Amazon for much less!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as some other brands I&#x27;ve used, but this is the best eye cream I&#x27;ve found without all of the bad chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> To brand in general.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li> I am 23 years old and while I actually don&#x27;t have haggard skin, wrinkles, or any signs of aging..</li>
            <li> So far it is the only eye cream I have tried</li>
            <li> However, if you have dark circles under your eyes as well (I recently developed these, probably from not getting enough sleep), this product hasn&#x27;t really helped with that issue.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could find something that has more dramatic effects with the crows</li>
            <li> I have often been upset by certain under eye lines passed down to me via hereditary.</li>
            <li> but I am a skin care junkie for sure and can see a difference in just a few days, I&#x27;e been putting in all over my face, not just my eyes, I am in my mid-thirties have small lines here and there, nothing major.  </li>
            <li> however it&#x27;s nothing special because it has not helped with darkness or puffiness which are my other issues and at this price not worth a purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t do much for my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Odd that this review requires a certain number of words.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say its sooo much worse than other eye creams I&#x27;ve used, it seems pretty typical and I will say it seems moisturizing (although how many moisturizers are not somewhat moisturizing?)</li>
            <li> Even with the small sample, I noticed enough of a difference right away to order an entire bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought it mainly to help with dark circles.  </li>
            <li> It does take a few minutes to absorb into the skin but it certainly doe not have consistency like butter.</li>
            <li> I feel like this actually made my fine lines worse.</li>
            <li> I use it every other night as a alternative to Retin A eye creams (which I have used all of my adult life)</li>
            <li> It is paraben free and have had trouble with eye cream burning my eye and making them water - this one does not - I use it along with Almay mascara and no more eye problems.  </li>
            <li> I have celiac disease and very sensitive skin, and this has been the only undereye cream I have been able to use without having a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I see a difference after using this product, but then again I don&#x27;t look very closely.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use a lot so one container will last a long time&lt;br /&gt;(3)</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m in my late twenties and have worked hard to take care of my skin, so maybe some folks have more issues than sleep-deprivation</li>
            <li> Neither cheap nor expensive, used sparingly this product goes a long way when it comes to both firming and hydrating the skin around the eye that has been overexposed to the sun and elements.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it actually does make the wrinkles around my eyes appear less noticeable, and without the burning that I&#x27;ve found with other much more expensive products.</li>
            <li> Other creams seem to cause a red, allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> I need that with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I probably haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if my dark circles are going away (hence the 3 star rating).</li>
            <li> The product itself had no kind of seal to indicate to me that it was in fact new and never used.</li>
            <li> But, mostly a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really seeing this &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> You only need to use a very small amount, one pump was enough product for both my eyes.</li>
            <li> little goes a LONG way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 19-year old who suffers from very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference while using it, except small pimples where the upper cheeks meets the eye area, so I guess this is clogging me.</li>
            <li> Disappointed I cannot use this product because I love the yes to brand</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Yes to...\\&quot; products have had reviews written about the smell, and there is an odor to the other face cream I purchased from this line).  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d notice that sometimes the makeup would separate after a few hours, making my under eye look dry and wrinkled.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels very soft and my eyes look less tired and irritated already.</li>
            <li> so was hard to put on make up, as others said, and I could feel it when I went to wash my face in the shower the next morning.</li>
            <li> My eyes still have dark circles and bags under them.</li>
            <li> I was out of this product for a few weeks and  expected my skin to suffer.</li>
            <li> the dark circles below my eyes look much less dark.</li>
            <li> Yes To Blueberries Eye Firming Treatment,  Was a let down.</li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes feels softer, and the skin seems less dark, but I do not see a reduction in the number of lines.</li>
            <li> have large, round eyes, and unfortunately inherited dark circles.</li>
            <li> Usually I get those products and the skin around my eyes raw and red, not this one.  </li>
            <li> There seems to be less wrinkles, and the skin is less dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 and starting to think seriously about anti-aging skincare and treatments.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me, but at least it wasn&#x27;t irritating.</li>
            <li> Whenever I put this under my eyes at night, I wake up with slightly darker skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I put a little bit on my hand to test the consistency, and it smelled like a can of Raid.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this - and really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The box that the product was in (not the shipping box) had water damage and looked a little beat up.  </li>
            <li> I am prone to getting under-eye bags for no significant reason.</li>
            <li> My eyes look younger and less tired.</li>
            <li> and I can see it keeps my eyes firm for the days around the times I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin around my eyes and even expensive eye creams will sting that delicate area.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount all around the eye lid and under the eye before bed.  </li>
            <li> I typically think that \\&quot;will improve wrinkles in X days!\\&quot; claims are ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> So when I got the package, well, I&#x27;d forgotten how small the bottle was, but as soon as I put it on the skin around my eyes, I remembered why I&#x27;d ever put out the money on it.</li>
            <li> Expensive product, Murad, actually caused me to develop dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have never had a bad reaction to any of the products of this company.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Since I can&#x27;t stand to use the rest of the line, I&#x27;ll be steering away from this, too -- at least for now.</li>
            <li> I was shocked because I have used a few  YES products such as yes to carrots body butter</li>
            <li> I do try to put it on at least 10 minutes before applying makeup.</li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick and hydrates the eye area well.</li>
            <li> Absorbs well, not overly thick or greasy.</li>
            <li> Have bought several times and am too afraid to use anything else!</li>
            <li> In fact I thought it was too thin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also kinda thick and has a weird chemical smell almost like sniffing a bottle of rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> I can see a difference in eyes not looking as tired as they did before I started using this cream.</li>
            <li> It seemed to make them worse.  </li>
            <li> and I like this product simply as a moisturizer, but doubtful about the firming properties.</li>
            <li> After diligent Use, the difference was startling.</li>
            <li> I seriously hate writing a bad review but for me personally the product did not do anything at all.</li>
            <li> some eye creams or moisturizers make my eyes water or feel uncomfortable).  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am at the end of the bottle, and will not buy again</li>
            <li> And that is EXPENSIVE stuff.</li>
            <li> Roller ball does not work-it is very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that the smell is bad or overpowering, it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Maybe I had a bad bottle?</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell bad like the rest of the line, although I&#x27;m not of the opinion that it smells like blueberries, either.  </li>
            <li> (FDA does not make companies release what is in their fragrances, therefore they can contain up to hundreds of additional, bad ingredients.)  </li>
            <li> It made me sick to my stomach.</li>
            <li> So I look like I&#x27;m sick without makeup.</li>
            <li> but I was a bit disappointed in this eye firming cream.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> I was absolutely disgusted.</li>
            <li> When the skin under my eyes dries out it feel horrible and this cream does the trick for me!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I (the lady of the house) bought this because I have always had puffy eyes. I have been using this nightly for about three weeks all around my eyes and have noticed the skin under my eyes in particular is firmer and actually is less puffy. I&#x27;m not certain how this is working, perhaps it is just firming up the skin so that the it holds in the lower eye puff better, but either way. I can see a difference. I&#x27;m completely sold on ytb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 and starting to think seriously about anti-aging skincare and treatments.  I stay out of the sun and wear sunscreen, but I&#x27;m up to trying just about anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this eye cream:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) It&#x27;s gentle enough for twice-daily use&lt;br /&gt;(2) You don&#x27;t need to use a lot so one container will last a long time&lt;br /&gt;(3) It&#x27;s inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;(4) I get all right results with respect to fine lines and puffiness&lt;br /&gt;(5) Ingredients are generally natural and there&#x27;s no animal testing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m not sold on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t do much for my dark circles.  I&#x27;m not really seeing this &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; effect, even after two weeks of twice-daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients list on the main page gets cut off before it is finished but you can see the full list in the product images.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this is an awesome product.  It&#x27;s non-irritating and it&#x27;s very moisturizing.  And if your only issues are fine lines and/or puffiness, this may be all you need.  Yes, I have used much more expensive products that perform somewhat better.  But for something under twenty dollars, this really can&#x27;t be beat.  However, if you have dark circles under your eyes as well (I recently developed these, probably from not getting enough sleep), this product hasn&#x27;t really helped with that issue.  Because this contains alpha hydroxy acids, you&#x27;ll want to use it in conjunction with a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom for mothers day.  She has been applying it as directed on the box and we all have noticed a difference in her eye area.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream and have been using it day and night for the past two years.  Other creams seem to cause a red, allergic reaction.  So, I was disappointed when my Whole Foods stopped carrying it, but very happy to find it on Amazon for much less!</li>
            <li> stings your eyes. Really?</li>
            <li> This product arrived at my house early. I love that it is made from blueberries and helps with firming your eyes.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over a month now, and haven&#x27;t really seen any results. My eyes still have dark circles and bags under them. The only thing that kept this from being 1 star is the fact that it does seem to moisturize well. But, mostly a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> While this may not be the best eye product I have ever used I am quite happy with it. It does take a few minutes to absorb into the skin but it certainly doe not have consistency like butter. I don&#x27;t feel that the smell is bad or overpowering, it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I am 51 and have some fine lines and this serum works for me. I really like that this product IS all natural and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product, like the feel of the cream. It&#x27;s not too thick and hydrates the eye area well. I&#x27;m not convinced after a month of use that it does much for fine lines or any other eye area skin issues, but will continue to use and see. Will update if I notice any significant changes to the under eye.</li>
            <li> I took this back immediately after purchase. I put a little bit on my hand to test the consistency, and it smelled like a can of Raid. I was absolutely disgusted. It made me sick to my stomach. Maybe I had a bad bottle?</li>
            <li> I did not find this to be greasy at all.  In fact I thought it was too thin.  I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s so I need something that&#x27;s more intensive.  This is a very nice natural product and would be good for someone in their twenties.  I didn&#x27;t mind the scent, I think it&#x27;s the paracress flower extract.  I thought it was pleasant.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin or allergies, this may  not be for you. It certainly wasn&#x27;t for me. It burned and giant welts came up on my cheeks and forehead and my eyes swelled (and yes, I used it properly). I love the Yes line, and I&#x27;ve had great success with it, but this was definitely not a product for me.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this - and really disappointed.  I love new products, and often can see a quick difference.  Not here - evidently, this is too natural to do anything.</li>
            <li> Under my eyes look great, so....five stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I see a difference after using this product, but then again I don&#x27;t look very closely. Still I like the Yes to... brand so...I suppose I recommend this</li>
            <li> I like it that the product came up among the lowest toxicity score on Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Cosmetics Database. It works nice!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for this eye cream. Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference while using it, except small pimples where the upper cheeks meets the eye area, so I guess this is clogging me. It&#x27;s also kinda thick and has a weird chemical smell almost like sniffing a bottle of rubbing alcohol. Can&#x27;t say its sooo much worse than other eye creams I&#x27;ve used, it seems pretty typical and I will say it seems moisturizing (although how many moisturizers are not somewhat moisturizing?) however it&#x27;s nothing special because it has not helped with darkness or puffiness which are my other issues and at this price not worth a purchase.</li>
            <li> I think It works pretty well, although I haven&#x27;t used it as much as I should. I think it is the product that requires continued use to really see the difference, but I like it enough to have bought if twice, I think I may have actually written another review for this product. I&#x27;m sure it is a better review. Read that one instead</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  Isn&#x27;t too thick, absorbs quickly, skin looks better after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year, and I like it.  The scent is not too strong, and the consistency makes me feel like I&#x27;m really moisturizing my eye area.  I really can&#x27;t speak to the eye firming capabilities, but overall a good product.</li>
            <li> It is too greasy. Like if I am trying to rub in a chunk of butter. Will not sink in for hours of application. Did I mention the SMELL? Like an old person or unwashed body. And who&#x27;s the genius that thought it&#x27;s a good idea to add perfume in an eye cream???!!!???</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually allergic to this cream but I gave it to my sister and she absolutely loves it and has continued to buy this brand since.</li>
            <li> After diligent Use, the difference was startling. I have used many under eye moisturizers and this one is my fave. My skin is smoother, noticeably fresh and brighter. I was out of this product for a few weeks and  expected my skin to suffer. However, the texture of my skin has actually improved! I LOVELOVELOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Feels fantastic on my eyes.  I can see a difference in eyes not looking as tired as they did before I started using this cream.</li>
            <li> It is nourishing, but I didn&#x27;t notice any obvious changes in the look of my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this eye treatment! The texture is perfect, a little goes a LONG way, and I&#x27;m seeing a difference in the skin around my eyes. I love 90% of the Yes To products I&#x27;ve tried and this one is another winner.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a few weeks, so I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement yet. The smell is nice and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel to my face once dry. I love Yes to Products which is why I am giving it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> I purchased the entire moisturizing portion of this line yesterday morning, including the serum, the eye cream, the eye roller, the day cream, and the night cream.  I started using the line as soon as I got it home.  I&#x27;m sure it has some great benefits with dedicated use, but here&#x27;s the problem:  I can&#x27;t stand to keep using it!  The eye cream is the only thing I might consider using again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell bad like the rest of the line, although I&#x27;m not of the opinion that it smells like blueberries, either.  It has a nice feel, dispenses well, absorbs well.  I have not noticed any results, but then I&#x27;ve only used it once.  That said, it doesn&#x27;t save the line, and I tend to like to use products in the same family so I know they&#x27;ll play well together.  Since I can&#x27;t stand to use the rest of the line, I&#x27;ll be steering away from this, too -- at least for now.</li>
            <li> I try to keep my beauty routine as &#x27;natural&#x27; as possible avoiding the really chemically full eye creams is hard. This product is very plant based and WORKS.. I have used so many creams and this one actually reduced my eye lines and made my eyes brighter. Fabulous!! My test - when my sisters agree my lines have reduced, the product has worked. Simply put. Must buy at affordable price.</li>
            <li> After all of the rave reviews on this product I though it would work great on me.  No such luck.  As far as I can tell It didn&#x27;t work at all.  Very disappointed</li>
            <li> This was a gift for sister. She was happy.</li>
            <li> Roller ball does not work-it is very frustrating. Got to to work once or twice, which is not enough to actually review the product. Disappointed I cannot use this product because I love the yes to brand</li>
            <li> Very nice and smooth, made my eyes feel great! You only need to use a very small amount, one pump was enough product for both my eyes.</li>
            <li> The bottle seems a lot smaller than it does in the picture. It also doesn&#x27;t smell great. But I&#x27;ve only used it once so far and my skin feels very soft and my eyes look less tired and irritated already. So far, it seems like a good buy :)</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t use this 2x per day, just in the mornings so perhaps that is the reason why i&#x27;m not seeing much change but i just don&#x27;t need to apply one more thing at night. i do like the result after application in the morning but like everything else this won&#x27;t get rid of wrinkles. it&#x27;s a good product for a drug store item.  **update review. nothing much works if you are over a certain age. this is a good product for someone who is young and doesn&#x27;t need much. the ONLY product I&#x27;ve found that works well for older women is roc retinol correxion crème. it made my puffy eyes look better immediately and only got better with long term use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just started using this, but I love how it feels on my skin.  It&#x27;s soft, smells pleasant, and absorbs quickly.  I look forward to its treatment.</li>
            <li> Great price. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream to firm your eyes.  I ran out for a month and noticed a huge difference with my fine lines under my eyes.  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This eye cream feels really good.  I can sometimes still feel it in the morning when I wash my face which I like.</li>
            <li> This eye firming treatment is excellent if used as directed.  Just a small amount all around the eye lid and under the eye before bed.  I am very sensitive to all cosmetics, but this one is very pure and gentle. No issues whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a big difference in how suple the eye area has become, and as a result the fine lines are deminished.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It really does help with the undereye lines.  I have celiac disease and very sensitive skin, and this has been the only undereye cream I have been able to use without having a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> I still have not finished my first bottle of this, but I picked up a second just so I would be ready for when I did run out. I&#x27;ve had the first bottle for well over a month. You do not need a lot of this product when using it. I am 23 years old and while I actually don&#x27;t have haggard skin, wrinkles, or any signs of aging.. I have often been upset by certain under eye lines passed down to me via hereditary. I had tried high end products to get rid of them, such as department store brands and the Philosophy brand, and none of them helped me. I was about to give up until I came by this product in my local Whole Foods and decided to give it a try. It did not work in seven days as advertised on the box, but I did begin to see results in two weeks and I continue to see my lines softening and getting smaller. I was completely amazed that an $80 eye serum couldn&#x27;t do anything for me, but this worked in such a short amount of time for a much better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do not discontinue this, ever!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product.  It didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me, but at least it wasn&#x27;t irritating.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as some other brands I&#x27;ve used, but this is the best eye cream I&#x27;ve found without all of the bad chemicals in it. If you care about what you&#x27;re putting on your face, this is your product.</li>
            <li> Neither cheap nor expensive, used sparingly this product goes a long way when it comes to both firming and hydrating the skin around the eye that has been overexposed to the sun and elements. I already had been using the cucumber eye gel for when my eyes seemed puffy so when a drugstore sale on the product line offered a hefty discount i decided to give this a try. It was a purchase that exceded my expectations. Within a week&#x27;s time my eye area looked fresher and felt better to the touch. It does not leave a waxy buildup that so many of these products do and it absorbs quickly into the skin which tells me it is going somewhere other than my pillow case.&lt;br /&gt;I reside in S. Florida for a good part of the year so to say that I am overexposed even with floppy hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen is not understating it. This takes the dryness out of the equation.</li>
            <li> I like the way the product feels but I really didn&#x27;t see much of a change. I gave it four stars though because it is almost completely natural and better for you than other products you can buy.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Yes To brand, but I was a bit disappointed in this eye firming cream. I just turned 30 so the lines under my eyes magically appeared what felt like over night. I thought this would be great, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference yet. I started using it about 2-3 weeks ago. Maybe results aren&#x27;t noticed until the whole bottle is used? Meh...</li>
            <li> Really makes my skin feel and look refreshed and firm. Have bought several times and am too afraid to use anything else! I love it.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find this product nice-smelling and of a nice consistency. I was excited to get results. However, after using this for 3+ weeks consistently, I see no difference in my crow&#x27;s feet. Maybe there&#x27;s nothing that really does anything for them besides injections, but I am hoping otherwise. The other thing I did not like about this was that the product seemed to clump and kind of build up on my skin, so that I would feel little bits of it and have to brush it away. The price I got on Amazon was significantly cheaper than any other store I&#x27;ve seen. I paid $11.99 and it was $19.99+ everywhere else. Thank you Amazon for that!</li>
            <li> Yes To Blueberries Eye Firming Treatment,  Was a let down. I used the product daily until it was gone. I was shocked because I have used a few  YES products such as yes to carrots body butter etc All were excellent.. I did not see any difference around my eyes at all. I seriously hate writing a bad review but for me personally the product did not do anything at all. Perhaps you may or may not  have a better outcome then I did.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to moisturize my face, especially the drier skin around my eyes and forehead.  I typically think that \\&quot;will improve wrinkles in X days!\\&quot; claims are ridiculous.  This product was reviewed well, so I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about five days.  First of all, it does not have an overpowering smell (I know other \\&quot;Yes to...\\&quot; products have had reviews written about the smell, and there is an odor to the other face cream I purchased from this line).  Secondly, it is a fairly dense cream, but absorbs well, and feels pleasant, without any stinging in the eye area (some eye creams or moisturizers make my eyes water or feel uncomfortable).  And thirdly, I think it actually is reducing fine wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.5 stars, would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this line of products. Unfortunately I am at the end of the bottle, and will not buy again</li>
            <li> Just okay, nothing special, didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my mom and she really loved it because she could actually feel the difference in a matter of weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Yes To Blueberries Eye Firming Treatment for about a month and have seen a noticeable difference. I&#x27;m 32 and the fine lines/crows feet around my eyes are somewhat diminished, but more importantly to me, the dark circles below my eyes look much less dark. My eyes look younger and less tired. I originally received this product as a sample w/ an order from the Yes To website. Even with the small sample, I noticed enough of a difference right away to order an entire bottle.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I had undereye bags and wrinkly lids. This applied very minimal to these parts of the eyes and eureka all gone and makes a great improvement. I look refreshed and younger.&lt;br /&gt;Thankyou for a wonderful product and quick postage from Amazan. Also package was perfectly packed.  Its just magical.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this at my local pharmacy before, and had been without it for a while. So when I got the package, well, I&#x27;d forgotten how small the bottle was, but as soon as I put it on the skin around my eyes, I remembered why I&#x27;d ever put out the money on it. This stuff WORKS!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;No lie, I saw the difference immediately. Now, I&#x27;m in my late twenties and have worked hard to take care of my skin, so maybe some folks have more issues than sleep-deprivation where their eyes are concerned, but I can say, without a doubt, that this product is effective, and, if it doesn&#x27;t work immediately for you, give it time, because it&#x27;s totally worth it. It makes it look like I slept a full night even when I&#x27;m dragging my butt to the nearest caffeine dispenser. Very impressed, and I&#x27;m never giving this stuff up!</li>
            <li> Whenever I put this under my eyes at night, I wake up with slightly darker skin under my eyes. Of course, that defeats the point. I wonder if it actually dyes your skin, or if my extremely fair skin has some strange reaction to it? The smell is also very strong. It can&#x27;t hurt to try it, but I think it&#x27;s better to spend your money on a different product or something completely natural and cheaper- like a pure oil.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used very long yet but seems to be as good as anything else</li>
            <li> This product line is wonderful; carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries!  Without exception, I consider each one a great buy and deliver what they promise.  Yes To Blueberries Eye Firming Treatment is the cream of the crop!  I notice a difference around the eye almost immediately. Brighter, smoother and yes, &amp;#34;firmer&amp;#34;. I have very sensitive skin and have never had a bad reaction to any of the products of this company.  This eye cream is a keeper. My favorite to date.</li>
            <li> I did not like this eye cream.  I bought it mainly to help with dark circles.  It seemed to make them worse.  It felt good and that is about it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product keeps away many wrinkles.  It smells like plastic more than blueberries.  But it does moisturize and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or eyes, plus it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  I&#x27;ll very likely repurchase when this bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> I like this eye cream.  It is paraben free and have had trouble with eye cream burning my eye and making them water - this one does not - I use it along with Almay mascara and no more eye problems.  I really like this whole line, I love carrots and I love tomatoes!</li>
            <li> Great product! I am glad this as well is not tested on animals. Odd that this review requires a certain number of words.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way! Goes on smoothly but if you use too much it takes a bit to rub it in.  I see noticeable improvement of the skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Best, all natural, eye cream I can find!  I follow the EWG&#x27;s standards and besides the fragrance, the ingredients are completely safe! (FDA does not make companies release what is in their fragrances, therefore they can contain up to hundreds of additional, bad ingredients.)  Works amazingly well on my fine lines/wrinkles and is very conditioning. Great product, best price!</li>
            <li> I like the Yes To brand in general. I like that it&#x27;s paraben free, cruelty free, and mostly natural. This is my second bottle of this eye cream. I like it a lot. I think it&#x27;s a good eye cream at a good price. The scent is pleasant, though a bit heavier than I prefer. I really like the texture. I do try to put it on at least 10 minutes before applying makeup. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s overly greasy--it absorbs well while being sufficiently moisturizing. It doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes. The skin around my eyes feels soft and moist throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t found it to be a miracle worker, though. Honestly, I haven&#x27;t found any eye cream to be a miracle worker. I&#x27;m an active outdoors person with fair skin, and have gotten a fair bit of sun damage unfortunately. I wish I could find something that has more dramatic effects with the crows feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good cream for the price point, though.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin so this gets an A+ from me for actually being good for sensitive skin.  Usually I get those products and the skin around my eyes raw and red, not this one.  I cannot really comment to the firming because right now I am fighing allergies so in the morning no matter what I wake up with puffy eyes.  But I can say that I notice it is firmer so it bounces back from the puffy night a lot quicker.  I will make a better comment after allergy season but I am glad I purchsed this one and even though it is a small bottle, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Love all the Blueberry products.  This product works better than products that I have used that cost 5 times more.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my friend and worked with my eye skin well. I would say it is a high quality eye cream compared to its price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 19-year old who suffers from very sensitive skin. I appy it under my eyes every time after removing my makeup and before going to sleep. It has never irritated my skin and I can see it keeps my eyes firm for the days around the times I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smooth cream, goes on well before makeup.</li>
            <li> WOW! What a great product! I am in love with this product. I used the wipes &amp;#34;Yes to blueberry&amp;#34; from this company currently. Target had the wipes and the eye firming treatment together in a buy one/try one package. Which was such a great deal! $20 product for free!  I&#x27;d never used this cream before but I am a skin care junkie for sure and can see a difference in just a few days, I&#x27;e been putting in all over my face, not just my eyes, I am in my mid-thirties have small lines here and there, nothing major.  I have used many products that my Aesthetician had recommended and I&#x27;ve gotta say, this is my new favorite. I&#x27;m look forward to trying more products from this company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been really carried away by an eye cream and this didn&#x27;t turn around my opinion of the category but it works just fine, dispels dark circles and minimizes lines.</li>
            <li> So in love with Y2B!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 weeks &amp; can already see a difference. Great product again from YES TO......</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product but didn&#x27;t get that far.  The box that the product was in (not the shipping box) had water damage and looked a little beat up.  The product itself had no kind of seal to indicate to me that it was in fact new and never used.</li>
            <li> I feel like this actually made my fine lines worse. I don&#x27;t actually have a lot of wrinkles. I have two kids under 4, so I am asleep deprived, and I use wrinkle cream to make my eyes look more refreshed after a night of NO sleep. This didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now. The skin under my eyes feels softer, and the skin seems less dark, but I do not see a reduction in the number of lines. I might simply be a lost cause, as I have battled with severe eczema around my eyes for years, and the skin might simply be permanently damaged. It might also simply be too soon to judge how well it reduces fine lines. The good news is that it does not cause my sensitive skin to react badly, and is free from animal testing. So far it is the only eye cream I have tried so I have nothing to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit May 2014: I wanted to come back and update now that I have been using this product for a few more months. I think the skin under my eyes looks much better than it did before I used this product. There seems to be less wrinkles, and the skin is less dark. I am also happy with how long it has lasted considering how expensive it is. I use it morning and night.</li>
            <li> Works to diminish those fine lines around eyes. I use it daily to brighten my skin, and I get compliments on looking younger than I am.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin around my eyes and even expensive eye creams will sting that delicate area. I love that the ingredients are all natural. I probably haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if my dark circles are going away (hence the 3 star rating). I love the smell.</li>
            <li> It was okay. Was very oily so was hard to put on make up, as others said, and I could feel it when I went to wash my face in the shower the next morning. Sure, lasted awhile, but since I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan I didn&#x27;t really want it to. Didn&#x27;t notice any change in the skin or wrinkles. Does smell funny. Chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Learned of this product on the Environmental Working Group website and I love it. Definitely feel and see the area around my eyes look more radiant. I also like the applicator- very easy to get the right amount.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin and I like this product simply as a moisturizer, but doubtful about the firming properties. So if you are looking for a more intensive firming product, then this is probably not it. Absorbs well, not overly thick or greasy. Smells lovely, a bit sweet/ floral.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be without this eye cream...it keeps your eyes moist all day. I need that with my dry skin. When the skin under my eyes dries out it feel horrible and this cream does the trick for me! Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Works great for me!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was recommended by the book bellies beautiful as being safer for pregnancy and because the Environmental Working Group SkinDeep database gave it a good safety rating. I am very happy with the product and now use everywhere on my face that I used to use regular face cream...even though its supposed to be for eyes.  It seems to make my skin smoother. I have not noticed an odor.  I use it every night but in the day I use a product with sunblock. This in my new night cream for life!</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it actually does make the wrinkles around my eyes appear less noticeable, and without the burning that I&#x27;ve found with other much more expensive products.</li>
            <li> Smells great, not fruity as the name may suggest, almost floral like. It provides great moisture which prevents delicate eye area from drying out. I use it every other night as a alternative to Retin A eye creams (which I have used all of my adult life) Retin A the only clinically proven product for smoothing fine lines. Another valuable tip, sleep on your back with your head elevated. Side sleeping and stomach sleeping promotes lines and wrinkles in your face. Just sayin!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have large, round eyes, and unfortunately inherited dark circles. So I look like I&#x27;m sick without makeup. I&#x27;ve relied on under eye concealer to brighten up the area and I&#x27;d notice that sometimes the makeup would separate after a few hours, making my under eye look dry and wrinkled. I use jojoba oil at night and that usually helps hydrate over night, but during the day I needed a light cream that can go under makeup. This did it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 25 and found this product wonderful. After my first go at it, I didn&#x27;t expect to see any changes so I didn&#x27;t bother constantly looking to see if wrinkles reduced etc etc. however, family members came home and each one at separate times said my skin looks so healthy and how fresh I appeared. That was pleasant! First try too....seriously??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin. I usually break out in rashes, itch, or get irritated easily however this didn&#x27;t do that for me. Expensive product, Murad, actually caused me to develop dermatitis. Google it. It sucks. And that is EXPENSIVE stuff. So I&#x27;m pretty thrilled with this right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light fragrant smell that doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;It applies very smoothly and disappears quickly.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a LONG way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I bought this eye cream because it does not contain any parabens, is all-natural, and came highly recommended.  I was pleased with its results and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I am prone to getting under-eye bags for no significant reason. After applying this cream for the first time I felt tightening sensation under my eyes. On repeat applications it was less noticeable, but after using this treatment for several weeks I see a fair reduction in my under-eye bags.</li>
