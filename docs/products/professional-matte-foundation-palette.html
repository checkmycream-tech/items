            <li>Good for HD too.</li>
            <li>Very light weight!</li>
            <li>One of my print models asked what beautiful foundation I used bc it looked so natural and made her skin perfect.</li>
            <li>Great shades to mix and match most skin color.</li>
            <li>Warm tones, good for tropical countries like mine.</li>
            <li>Frankly, very beautiful and wonderful and enjoy luxury and five-star worthy&lt;br /&gt;Athvona and always something new to you</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love It!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>The product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Great under light and on stage.</li>
            <li>Great coverage and smooth application.</li>
            <li>The palette I purchased gave me a nice representation for the skin tones  I have been working on.</li>
            <li>By far the best cream palette!</li>
            <li>Best professional make up, as I make up artist</li>
            <li>This is by far the best matte foundation I have used to date.</li>
            <li>I very good but natural coverage.</li>
            <li>The seller sent the palette I purchased in time for a fashion event I ordered it for, and I was satisfied so I will purchase again thru them.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This foundation is full coverage and the range of colors allows you to mix to find your appropriate color that you need.</li>
            <li>It went on beautiful and felt like I had no makeup on but after a couple of hours it gave off a flat greyish cast....</li>
            <li>So happy with this product, I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li>Smooth coverage.</li>
            <li>so of course I was excited to use it.</li>
            <li>The product is very fine, good cover without looking heavy on skin.</li>
            <li>and luckily we found it on amazon.  </li>
            <li>stays on nicely on the different skin types, and age ranges.under runway lights and photographers lights there was no melting.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it for the size of each foundation, variety of color and amount of coverage.</li>
            <li>I used it on myself first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s pretty reasonable.</li>
            <li>I can scoop out with a palette knife different tones from each removable button of foundation  and blend for the precise match to the client&#x27;s skin tone .</li>
            <li>I can contour really well with this pallette.</li>
            <li>I used with moisturizer and primers appropriate to models&#x27; skin concerns, and fixed with Laura Merceir translucent powder and urban decay makeup fixative so that may have helped as well.</li>
            <li>But then I used it on a client with normal skin and the product lasted all day.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to any professional makeup artist!</li>
            <li>but clearly I will get a lot of uses from it.</li>
            <li>Did not make one of the models with sensitive skin itch.</li>
            <li>I am a light skinned African American female and I tried to blend this palette to no end!</li>
            <li>Minimal creasing, I onlyI had to retouch smile lines after hours of model smiling for pics.</li>
            <li>Oh and I have dry to normal skin!</li>

            <li> Not a good look....</li>

            <li> My daughter just became a certified makeup artist.  The foundation palette she received with her training was getting low.  She saw this one online and luckily we found it on amazon.  The product is amazing.  She tried it on herself and her face looked flawless.</li>
            <li> Best professional make up, as I make up artist I have always like to use the best!&lt;br /&gt;Gives I very good but natural coverage.</li>
            <li> My husband got me this palette as a surprise so of course I was excited to use it. I used it on myself first (i have an oily t-zone) it felt great! Very light weight! But by the end of the day around my nose and cheeks the product was gone. Used both primer and a setting spray. But then I used it on a client with normal skin and the product lasted all day. In all its a great foundation! :)</li>
            <li> This foundation is full coverage and the range of colors allows you to mix to find your appropriate color that you need.</li>

            <li> This palette is absolutely amazing! So easy to use and blend for the perfect shade. If you don&#x27;t have a spatula I would get one to mix it to prevent wasting product. I recommend this to any professional makeup artist!</li>
            <li> Great coverage and smooth application. Great shades to mix and match most skin color. Also great packaging. Don&#x27;t forget to prep your skin before applying.</li>
