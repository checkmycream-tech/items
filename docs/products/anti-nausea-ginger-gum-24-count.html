            <li>The product  is good and it does what it says it will do help stop the nausea.</li>
            <li>and I am good for the longest flight with no feeling of nausea at all.  </li>
            <li>We tried the seabands which work good but by day 2 kids don&#x27;t want to wear them...</li>
            <li>and she loved it.</li>
            <li>the more you chew, it subdues a bit and is really good!</li>
            <li>Flavor is pungent pleasant and effective but I would prefer it to be sugarless.</li>
            <li>We just love them!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now and have come to love the ginger flavor!</li>
            <li>I just ordered more!</li>
            <li>this was the PERFECT necessity to get over that first day at sea.  </li>
            <li>Tummy Drops are much better!</li>
            <li>I love this gum!</li>
            <li>First off, this works great and tastes great.</li>
            <li>This works great, very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing and helps control my nausea.</li>
            <li>and it has a nice flavor.  </li>
            <li>and it worked really fast, made the cruise so great!!!!</li>
            <li>I went through 10 pieces, but I had a good time on the 5 hr trip and caught almost a dozen fish, most of which got let go.  </li>
            <li>Even shared it with a couple friends who also found it to be effective.</li>
            <li>I wish they made a migraine medication as effective as this gum is for the nausea.</li>
            <li>Handy to have in the glove boc</li>
            <li>This stuff is FAST and effective!!  </li>
            <li>The ginger gum tastes great but looses it&#x27;s flavor rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>and yes initially it is very strong tasting, but than the taste subsides but it works quite well.</li>
            <li>It has a  Very, Very strong ginger taste.  </li>
            <li>Veeeeery strong ginger taste, burned my tongue!</li>
            <li>But more studies are needed to know whether ginger is safe or effective for heart disease.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it does make the tummy feel better.  </li>
            <li>Within minutes I start feeling better.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to help with pregnancy morning (more like all day) sickness.  </li>
            <li>Meklazine works better for me.</li>
            <li>I cannot understand the many glowing reviews.</li>
            <li>If it DOES work, you&#x27;re free from car sickness once and for all!</li>
            <li>Whenever I feel quesiness this gum seems to make me feel a bit better.</li>
            <li>It tasted ok</li>
            <li>gum is okay.  </li>
            <li>I was SURE I was going to vomit in the parking lot because I was feeling</li>
            <li>and I started to chew it, and when it lost its flavor I chewed another piece, and after that I felt like I could probably drive home (8 minute drive), instead of feeling like I&#x27;d better stay bent over by the bushes.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a lot more enjoyable than just swallowing a capsule.  </li>
            <li>purchase more as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>Love this gum</li>
            <li>Definitely one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever purchased!!!</li>
            <li>I love the taste of ginger...</li>
            <li>He enjoyed the taste, however.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and it worked better than the medication the doctor gave her.</li>
            <li>I still have to take Zofran for the nausea, but this gum helps make it more bearable while waiting for the Zofran to kick in.</li>
            <li>I wish I had bought more.</li>
            <li>studies -- but not all -- suggest that ginger may work better than placebo in reducing some symptoms of motion sickness.</li>
            <li>More studies are needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More research is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Osteoarthritis</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this but was wiling to try and so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Pickles still work better when I can tolerate them.</li>
            <li>My daughter in law is pleased with the stomach settling the Ginger Gum</li>
            <li>This an ok product for stomach upset.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to go soon because we still have a lot of snow and ice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helpful in a pinch, but I&#x27;ll stick to my ginger tea when I&#x27;m able.</li>
            <li>Kids love this as well.  </li>
            <li>I used this along with my ginger trips for a nausea free adventure!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off taking ginger capsules.</li>
            <li>It tastes great,  and really helped with motion sickness.</li>
            <li>prefer Preggie Pop Drops more than anything else.  </li>
            <li>IMO it would be a very good choice for children, as they seem to be more sensitive to strong flavors.</li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Super handy to keep in a purse or pocket</li>
            <li>I love the taste, and the texture is fine too.</li>
            <li>It was a nice strong ginger flavor, but does lose it&#x27;s flavor quickly.</li>
            <li>Maybe this product would be better as prophylaxis for light nausea if you&#x27;re going on a boat or something.  </li>
            <li>Good product really helps with nausea.</li>
            <li>it could be a bit strong for someone sensitive to the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; flavor; but if not, it works great for nausea.</li>
            <li>It has a strong taste</li>
            <li>The ginger is a bit strong, so she drinks water with it.</li>
            <li>I will admit the flavor is a bit strong...</li>
            <li>Strong ginger taste</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it cuts my nausea in half, at best.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I would say this gum is effective, but it is more suitable for those that don&#x27;t like strong flavor.  </li>
            <li>I tried it, and for me the flavor was fine.  </li>
            <li>This gum was actually almost pleasant to chew and most importantly did what it advertised.</li>
            <li>but she has grown to actually enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but according to these reviews it seems to work for more people than not, so it might be worth a try for you.  </li>
            <li>so you need to like ginger which fortunately I do&#x27;</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;d be better off buying some ginger cookies or ginger candy or even fresh ginger for them to nibble on or steep in tea.</li>
            <li>Just pop two in your mouth as you are getting on the boat and chew and enjoy.</li>
            <li>This works great for mild nausea for me but not for anthing major.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a first!!</li>
            <li>I liked it very much and will be ordering more very soon.  </li>
            <li>for me, just need more than 1 each time (quite possible its just me that would feel the need for more than 1 piece, most important thing is that THEY WORK)</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been sailing either, but it&#x27;s pretty tasty stuff. :)</li>
            <li>The product was well shipped and came in originally packaging.</li>
            <li>Ok so the flavor is a strong burst and then fades quickly, but it gets you through intense moments of nausea.  </li>
            <li>I can see a noticeable benefit from it, and it seems like there is a good chance that it would work better for some other people.</li>
            <li>This gum is spicy and odd-tasting at first, but after a minute or two your nausea is so diminished that you would happily chew an entire box just to feel the relief.</li>
            <li>I recommend it full heartedly.</li>
            <li>Tasty spicy not too sweet.  </li>
            <li>I personally tried it because I heard ginger was good for vertigo.</li>
            <li>but it works so that is good enough for me!!  </li>
            <li>I was ok the whole cruise.</li>
            <li>Not bad taste - per her.</li>
            <li>The gum had a really strong taste when you first chewed into it, after about 10 minutes</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, I get seasick and it has helped tremendously with preventing that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Item as promised quickly shipped.  </li>
            <li>My nausea with this pregnancy has ranged from mild to severe</li>
            <li>It is also used as a digestive aid for mild stomach upset, to reduce pain of osteoarthritis, and may even be used in heart disease or cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, they work...but have a tissue or something nearby so you can spit it out quickly before you get gagged on it.  </li>
            <li>I am pregnant</li>
            <li>and they work quickly and without any side effects.</li>
            <li>This gum will provide some mild relief from pregnancy induced nausea.  </li>
            <li>More importantly, it did not work, while ginger normally works very well for me.</li>
            <li>but was only on the surface, could probably be made to work better!</li>
            <li>Ginger products can often come with a bold bite, but this gum is just right.</li>
            <li>This gum has made it so I can fly in any sort of turbulence in any visibility with little to no nausea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, if they have advanced cancer like my mother did, I don&#x27;t think any gum will help that much.</li>
            <li>This stuff works both to stop nausea and to calm indigestion.</li>
            <li>The gum not only tasted amazing</li>
            <li>Pills and natural remedies do not work well alone, but with this gum, I felt great on the airplane this last trip.</li>
            <li>It was fun and pleasure for a change.</li>
            <li>I never review products, but I feel this is worth raving about if you deal with persistent nausea.</li>
            <li>It was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re struggling with nausea, it&#x27;s worth giving this a try.  </li>
            <li>It was a much better trip than others I&#x27;ve had where I spent most of my time hanging over the rail.</li>
            <li>Driving the autobahn at 120mph is not a lot of fun coming of Dramamine.  </li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t always have fresh ginger on hand, so I bought this gum a month ago to keep by the bed.</li>
            <li>He states that this is the only product he finds to be truly effective in managing his nausea.  </li>
            <li>Any natural product in my mind is better than a drug.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price when you are in need.</li>
            <li>so one tablet per use, but totally is worth it.</li>
            <li>I do think the product is worth a try.</li>
            <li>During my first trimester, I kept this gum on hand for a quick fix when feeling nauseous.</li>
            <li>she has something to help her right there with her.</li>
            <li>If you suffer from sea sickness, morning sickness, car sickness or just nausea in general, it&#x27;d be worthwhile to give this product a try.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it really worked or not, but they tasted good and kept my mouth hydrated in a very dry environment.</li>
            <li>initially, the taste is super strong, so be ready for a ginger punch!!</li>
            <li>As other reviewers said, it&#x27;s very spicy ... not in a pleasant way.  </li>
            <li>While it tasted good (it has a slightly \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; flavor)</li>
            <li>However, I did not expect the taste when I first tried it.</li>
            <li>This is my first week of trying it</li>
            <li>I have been using this gum ever since and it has never failed me once.  </li>
            <li>Sea-Band&#x27;s gum is somewhat on the mid side in flavor, and it lasts longer than most I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing it off Amazon.</li>
            <li>but great for a back up, especially when out and about, very convenient.</li>
            <li>I ordered this during my first trimester to help with morning sickness and nausea.  </li>
            <li>It worked, but making hot tea isn&#x27;t always convenient.  </li>
            <li>Went on my first cruise and this gum was all I needed.</li>
            <li>I am currently on my 2nd cycle of chemotherapy and still completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Similar results were found in a study with healthy volunteers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Several studies have found that ginger is better than placebo in relieving morning sickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More research is needed toknow if ginger would have the same effect in humans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not my first choice though.  </li>
            <li>The gum seemed to work pretty well to address the nausea my wife had during pregnancy, but we were able to find a lot of regular gum that did the job just as well and at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>This gum was a life saver during my first trimester.  </li>
            <li>Really made a difference on the nausea and general stomach feeling better.</li>
            <li>We were on a nice boat, 49 feet, but weather was rough for the first two days</li>
            <li>I thought the taste was similar to cinnamon and enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>First, let me just say that this gum has a bit spicy element to it from the ginger.  </li>
            <li>Pregnant women should ask their doctor before taking ginger, and should be careful not take more than 1g per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Buy 2+ packs as soon as you get your positive test and thank me later. :)</li>
            <li>It is not Wrigley&#x27;s, but the flavor is tolerable according to a modeately moody pregnant woman with whom I live.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Human studies suggests that 1g daily of ginger may be effective for nausea and vomiting in pregnant women when used for short periods (no longer than 4 days).</li>
            <li>This gum is fine--I&#x27;m not in love with it, because when I&#x27;m nauseated the last thing in the world I want is sugar, and although this isn&#x27;t sickly sweet, there&#x27;s still a fair dose of it.</li>
            <li>find the flavor pretty strong at the beginning, but it only lasts 5-10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>the flavor was pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>They chew on one of these and feel better which is a relief because we travel long distances.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it worked or not, but the flavor is really good</li>
            <li>helped but taste got old QUICK</li>
            <li>Not a 100% cure, but certainly helps for me.</li>
            <li>It certainly works for motion sickness.  </li>
            <li>This order came very quickly and seemed to work well, though to be honest, I only used it one day for just a little while.  </li>
            <li>but I have yet to vomit in large park thanks to this gum.</li>
            <li>but the price is just way to high and the gum thins out causing you to use two pieces which in reality makes the price even higher.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s fast, easy, much less sweet than candied ginger, doesn&#x27;t require swallowing anything (which can be a problem when I&#x27;m feeling really crappy), and seems to help some.</li>
            <li>there it was, ready to help.  </li>
            <li>Did not work very well for me.</li>
            <li>Ive been on over 30 cruises and always use this, its great and doesnt make you tired like medicines.</li>
            <li>really helped on the cruise</li>
            <li>I absolutely could not stand it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re suffering from intense nausea during pregnancy, go to the hospital.</li>
            <li>(it seems they are no longer available locally) and decided to give them a try.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was just me, but I didn&#x27;t think the gum really worked.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really drink it.  </li>
            <li>These really work.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this remedy!</li>
            <li>Package looked as described and if the need arises again, I will order much sooner.</li>
            <li>It works very well for her.  </li>
            <li>I know that for some people this really helps with nausea, but for me it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Took this along on a boat day trip and found it very helpful to settle an upset stomach.  </li>
            <li>This gum is really a lifesaver for me.  </li>
            <li>This gum really works.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised, but anyone who has issues with motion sickness knows that if it works, it&#x27;s worth just about anything.</li>
            <li>I am a nurse as well as like being on the water sailing and had years ago found that antinausea wristband are very helpful.</li>
            <li>however, the flavor is gone really fast.</li>
            <li>Really helped.  </li>
            <li>THIS GUM REALLY WORKS.  </li>
            <li>IT WORKS IN A VERY QUCIK MANNER.</li>
            <li>This gum really helps me.</li>
            <li>This really helps with my nausea.</li>
            <li>However, it did work very well for a lady that I sat by.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>She prefers real ginger ale, but she takes the ginger gum to work.</li>
            <li>I even used the gum during a sporting event with a bunch of very smelly food that was turning my stomach.</li>
            <li>a small study of 30 pregnant women with severe vomiting, those who took 1 gram of ginger every day for 4 days reported more relief from vomiting than those who took placebo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure these would work better for others, unfortunately they weren&#x27;t very helpful for my husband.</li>
            <li>I had my pressure point wristbands on as usual and chewed the ginger gum for most of the ride, and I was good - not reading in the car or anything crazy like that, but OK.</li>
            <li>I bought a single packet of this first to test it, and I just came back to buy three more packs.  </li>
            <li>Been a huge help for her near constant motion sickness!</li>
            <li>and you typically need to chew more than one at a time.  </li>
            <li>I am here online to buy more because I just chewed my last two pieces and our local Wal-mart isn&#x27;t carrying it anymore.</li>
            <li>Some lose their flavor quickly, others last.  </li>
            <li>This anti-nausea gum has allowed me to enjoy deep sea water fishing and helped fight off frequent nausea spells.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the flavor.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I had it for a cruise and recently purchased for a friend going sailing for the first time!</li>
            <li>Tastes ok, and helps a little with nausea...</li>
            <li>However, the gum shell is kind of hard</li>
            <li>The ginger flavor was not as strong in this gum as it was with other candies</li>
            <li>Works very well for my 13 year old.</li>
            <li>Taste doesn&#x27;t last long but as long as you get the ginger out of it, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>In just a few minutes my stomach felt much better and it seems to lasts for an hour or so.</li>
            <li>I think it works, but maybe not a huge amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that it was better to just get anti-emetic non-prescription medication.</li>
            <li>However, it did seem to calm the stomach and if that is what you would buy it for, it should help calm your stomach down.</li>
            <li>It is very satisfying to be able to have an impact on the suffering of someone who is so sick.</li>
            <li>Tastes good, but very soft, not a great consistency.</li>
            <li>I had nausea from a new medication I was taking.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like crystalized ginger which I have purchased from Whole Foods during the last pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>I do not think it kept me from being car sick, but it was a nice refreshing taste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that helped me, not silly remedies like this.</li>
            <li>bought for my wife &amp; 4 year old, IT WORKS !</li>
            <li>I would recommend the gum just based on recommendations I got from a few very close friends that have used it successfully in the past (which is why I ordered it too).  </li>
            <li>It is always better to be safe than sorry when you think you may be facing motion sickness, and I do not like the doped up feeling of dramamine!</li>
            <li>I used this recently before my first flight in 15+ years.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, the ginger is to strong for me, so I break it up into little pieces</li>
            <li>The pieces of gum are so small that it doesn&#x27;t really make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong, spicy flavor, (having some water at hand helps) but it goes away in a few minutes of chewing.</li>
            <li>I was pregnant for my second baby, and my nausea/vomiting was so severe and constant</li>
            <li>I would recommend other pregnant women give it a try.</li>
            <li>Its hard to find in drug stores, glad i can get it on amazon</li>
            <li>/&gt;  - natural sugar&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;  - natural ginger oil&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my first trimester of pregnancy, and I&#x27;ve been having a lot of problems with morning sickness (nausea, not vomiting, that lasts all day long).  </li>
            <li>I like it so far</li>
            <li>I was on a snorkeling boat and felt nauseous which went away completely as soon as I started chewing this gum.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to find something natural that didn&#x27;t add yet another chemical to my body.  </li>
            <li>This gum can be taken anywhere, and it relieves my nausia completely within 2-3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>chewing a piece of this gum completely stopped</li>
            <li>I like it because it is an all natural product.</li>
            <li>but did have me drinking my water quite frequently during that time.  </li>
            <li>The first few chews are quite hot (like pepper).</li>
            <li>Not to sweet or sour.  </li>
            <li>Some are very strong tasting, others weak.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I ran across this product a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>They work just as well if you can take the heat, and no mess.</li>
            <li>Still, I think it&#x27;s worth having to chew between doses of other sea-sickness medication.</li>
            <li>This carried a little more spice to it than black pepper but not too much.  </li>
            <li>If you are currently being treated with any of the following medications, you should not use ginger without first talking to your health care</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for people who gets bouts of nausea (mine were related to vasovagal episodes which induced nausea rather than fainting).</li>
            <li>There are other nits I could pick, like it being too sweet, or the unwelcome menthol flavor, but those are personal preference.</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s not nearly as effective as chewing on a fresh piece of raw ginger, but it&#x27;s far better than not using it at all.</li>
            <li>In a larger study of 70 pregnant women with nausea and vomiting, those who received a similar dosage of ginger felt less nauseous and did not vomit as much as those who received placebo.</li>
            <li>Did not help with my motion or morning sickness and loses flavor very quickly.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to find a convenient alternative to fresh ginger or ginger tea to help with nausea, but this has less ginger taste than a ginger snap cookie.</li>
            <li>An individual piece of this gum is so tiny that chewing it doesn&#x27;t really move your jaws or pop your ears.  </li>
            <li>to help with the major nausea as this gum does not do the trick at all.</li>
            <li>In general, I really don&#x27;t like ginger, and have been unable to tolerate ginger chews, but this was ok -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I needed it but better safe than sorry.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I tried the gum during a cruise trip and loved the flavor and it really helped with the sea sick.</li>
            <li>To make a long story short, I purchased this product, as well as the bio-band, and lastly the bionine tablets for my very first cruise last week.  </li>
            <li>Very favorable, and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered from motion sickness as far back as I can remember.</li>
            <li>My local supermarket used to carry it in their all natural section but no longer does.</li>
            <li>Thank you Sea-Band for providing a natural alternative to prescription medications that actually works!</li>
            <li>After using the gum I was able to focus on the game instead of the nausea.</li>
            <li>People sometimes look down their nose at natural remedies but in reality there are some out there that are really helpful.</li>
            <li>I feel this product works better than any other products I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>only downside is that it&#x27;s a little pricey, but it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>As far as the ginger, yes, the gum is better than airplane ginger ale that uses fake ginger flavoring.  </li>
            <li>Kind of a cruel trick for those of us with nausea :)</li>
            <li>Works better than peppermint (helped a little) and antacids (barely helped, and not great for long-term use anyway) for me, and is really convenient to keep with you when you need it.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the ginger is very strong and they do not like the &#x27;burning&#x27; sensation.  </li>
            <li>I had constant morning sickness during my third pregnancy and was skeptical of this product but am SO glad I tried it!</li>
            <li>My body was having such problems getting used to flying, which was extremely frustrating as becoming a pilot is my dream and nausea was preventing me from achieving it.  </li>
            <li>I have an easily irritated stomach to begin with, and I am on a number of prescription meds that make it even worse.  </li>
            <li>i get nauseated easily and a family member suggested ginger.</li>
            <li>However, the spicy effect only lasted a few minutes from when you first start chewing it</li>
            <li>But not for serious n/v already in full force.</li>
            <li>I found it to help a little bit, but didn&#x27;t really like the ginger flavor.  </li>
            <li>it really did little for the vertigo.  </li>

            <li> and she loved it.</li>
            <li> the more you chew, it subdues a bit and is really good!</li>

            <li> We just love them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now and have come to love the ginger flavor!</li>
            <li> I just ordered more!</li>
            <li> this was the PERFECT necessity to get over that first day at sea.  </li>
            <li> Tummy Drops are much better!</li>
            <li> I love this gum!</li>
            <li> First off, this works great and tastes great.</li>
            <li> This works great, very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is amazing and helps control my nausea.</li>
            <li> and it has a nice flavor.  </li>
            <li> and it worked really fast, made the cruise so great!!!!</li>
            <li> I went through 10 pieces, but I had a good time on the 5 hr trip and caught almost a dozen fish, most of which got let go.  </li>
            <li> Even shared it with a couple friends who also found it to be effective.</li>
            <li> I wish they made a migraine medication as effective as this gum is for the nausea.</li>
            <li> Handy to have in the glove boc</li>
            <li> This stuff is FAST and effective!!  </li>
            <li> The ginger gum tastes great but looses it&#x27;s flavor rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> and yes initially it is very strong tasting, but than the taste subsides but it works quite well.</li>
            <li> It has a  Very, Very strong ginger taste.  </li>
            <li> Veeeeery strong ginger taste, burned my tongue!</li>
            <li> But more studies are needed to know whether ginger is safe or effective for heart disease.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it does make the tummy feel better.  </li>
            <li> Within minutes I start feeling better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help with pregnancy morning (more like all day) sickness.  </li>
            <li> Meklazine works better for me.</li>
            <li> I cannot understand the many glowing reviews.</li>
            <li> If it DOES work, you&#x27;re free from car sickness once and for all!</li>
            <li> Whenever I feel quesiness this gum seems to make me feel a bit better.</li>
            <li> It tasted ok</li>
            <li> gum is okay.  </li>
            <li> I was SURE I was going to vomit in the parking lot because I was feeling</li>
            <li> and I started to chew it, and when it lost its flavor I chewed another piece, and after that I felt like I could probably drive home (8 minute drive), instead of feeling like I&#x27;d better stay bent over by the bushes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a lot more enjoyable than just swallowing a capsule.  </li>
            <li> purchase more as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Love this gum</li>
            <li> Definitely one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever purchased!!!</li>
            <li> I love the taste of ginger...</li>
            <li> He enjoyed the taste, however.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and it worked better than the medication the doctor gave her.</li>
            <li> I still have to take Zofran for the nausea, but this gum helps make it more bearable while waiting for the Zofran to kick in.</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought more.</li>
            <li> studies -- but not all -- suggest that ginger may work better than placebo in reducing some symptoms of motion sickness.</li>
            <li> More studies are needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More research is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Osteoarthritis</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this but was wiling to try and so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Pickles still work better when I can tolerate them.</li>
            <li> My daughter in law is pleased with the stomach settling the Ginger Gum</li>
            <li> This an ok product for stomach upset.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to go soon because we still have a lot of snow and ice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helpful in a pinch, but I&#x27;ll stick to my ginger tea when I&#x27;m able.</li>
            <li> Kids love this as well.  </li>
            <li> I used this along with my ginger trips for a nausea free adventure!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off taking ginger capsules.</li>
            <li> It tastes great,  and really helped with motion sickness.</li>
            <li> prefer Preggie Pop Drops more than anything else.  </li>
            <li> IMO it would be a very good choice for children, as they seem to be more sensitive to strong flavors.</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Super handy to keep in a purse or pocket</li>
            <li> I love the taste, and the texture is fine too.</li>
            <li> It was a nice strong ginger flavor, but does lose it&#x27;s flavor quickly.</li>
            <li> Maybe this product would be better as prophylaxis for light nausea if you&#x27;re going on a boat or something.  </li>
            <li> Good product really helps with nausea.</li>
            <li> it could be a bit strong for someone sensitive to the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; flavor; but if not, it works great for nausea.</li>
            <li> It has a strong taste</li>
            <li> The ginger is a bit strong, so she drinks water with it.</li>
            <li> I will admit the flavor is a bit strong...</li>
            <li> Strong ginger taste</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it cuts my nausea in half, at best.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I would say this gum is effective, but it is more suitable for those that don&#x27;t like strong flavor.  </li>
            <li> I tried it, and for me the flavor was fine.  </li>
            <li> This gum was actually almost pleasant to chew and most importantly did what it advertised.</li>
            <li> but she has grown to actually enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but according to these reviews it seems to work for more people than not, so it might be worth a try for you.  </li>
            <li> so you need to like ginger which fortunately I do&#x27;</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;d be better off buying some ginger cookies or ginger candy or even fresh ginger for them to nibble on or steep in tea.</li>
            <li> Just pop two in your mouth as you are getting on the boat and chew and enjoy.</li>
            <li> This works great for mild nausea for me but not for anthing major.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a first!!</li>
            <li> I liked it very much and will be ordering more very soon.  </li>
            <li> for me, just need more than 1 each time (quite possible its just me that would feel the need for more than 1 piece, most important thing is that THEY WORK)</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been sailing either, but it&#x27;s pretty tasty stuff. :)</li>
            <li> The product was well shipped and came in originally packaging.</li>
            <li> Ok so the flavor is a strong burst and then fades quickly, but it gets you through intense moments of nausea.  </li>
            <li> I can see a noticeable benefit from it, and it seems like there is a good chance that it would work better for some other people.</li>
            <li> This gum is spicy and odd-tasting at first, but after a minute or two your nausea is so diminished that you would happily chew an entire box just to feel the relief.</li>
            <li> I recommend it full heartedly.</li>
            <li> Tasty spicy not too sweet.  </li>
            <li> I personally tried it because I heard ginger was good for vertigo.</li>
            <li> but it works so that is good enough for me!!  </li>
            <li> I was ok the whole cruise.</li>
            <li> Not bad taste - per her.</li>
            <li> The gum had a really strong taste when you first chewed into it, after about 10 minutes</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, I get seasick and it has helped tremendously with preventing that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Item as promised quickly shipped.  </li>
            <li> My nausea with this pregnancy has ranged from mild to severe</li>
            <li> It is also used as a digestive aid for mild stomach upset, to reduce pain of osteoarthritis, and may even be used in heart disease or cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, they work...but have a tissue or something nearby so you can spit it out quickly before you get gagged on it.  </li>
            <li> I am pregnant</li>
            <li> and they work quickly and without any side effects.</li>
            <li> This gum will provide some mild relief from pregnancy induced nausea.  </li>
            <li> More importantly, it did not work, while ginger normally works very well for me.</li>
            <li> but was only on the surface, could probably be made to work better!</li>
            <li> Ginger products can often come with a bold bite, but this gum is just right.</li>
            <li> This gum has made it so I can fly in any sort of turbulence in any visibility with little to no nausea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, if they have advanced cancer like my mother did, I don&#x27;t think any gum will help that much.</li>
            <li> This stuff works both to stop nausea and to calm indigestion.</li>
            <li> The gum not only tasted amazing</li>
            <li> Pills and natural remedies do not work well alone, but with this gum, I felt great on the airplane this last trip.</li>
            <li> It was fun and pleasure for a change.</li>
            <li> I never review products, but I feel this is worth raving about if you deal with persistent nausea.</li>
            <li> It was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re struggling with nausea, it&#x27;s worth giving this a try.  </li>
            <li> It was a much better trip than others I&#x27;ve had where I spent most of my time hanging over the rail.</li>
            <li> Driving the autobahn at 120mph is not a lot of fun coming of Dramamine.  </li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t always have fresh ginger on hand, so I bought this gum a month ago to keep by the bed.</li>
            <li> He states that this is the only product he finds to be truly effective in managing his nausea.  </li>
            <li> Any natural product in my mind is better than a drug.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the price when you are in need.</li>
            <li> so one tablet per use, but totally is worth it.</li>
            <li> I do think the product is worth a try.</li>
            <li> During my first trimester, I kept this gum on hand for a quick fix when feeling nauseous.</li>
            <li> she has something to help her right there with her.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from sea sickness, morning sickness, car sickness or just nausea in general, it&#x27;d be worthwhile to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it really worked or not, but they tasted good and kept my mouth hydrated in a very dry environment.</li>
            <li> initially, the taste is super strong, so be ready for a ginger punch!!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers said, it&#x27;s very spicy ... not in a pleasant way.  </li>
            <li> While it tasted good (it has a slightly \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; flavor)</li>
            <li> However, I did not expect the taste when I first tried it.</li>
            <li> This is my first week of trying it</li>
            <li> I have been using this gum ever since and it has never failed me once.  </li>
            <li> Sea-Band&#x27;s gum is somewhat on the mid side in flavor, and it lasts longer than most I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing it off Amazon.</li>
            <li> but great for a back up, especially when out and about, very convenient.</li>
            <li> I ordered this during my first trimester to help with morning sickness and nausea.  </li>
            <li> It worked, but making hot tea isn&#x27;t always convenient.  </li>
            <li> Went on my first cruise and this gum was all I needed.</li>
            <li> I am currently on my 2nd cycle of chemotherapy and still completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Similar results were found in a study with healthy volunteers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Several studies have found that ginger is better than placebo in relieving morning sickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More research is needed toknow if ginger would have the same effect in humans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not my first choice though.  </li>
            <li> The gum seemed to work pretty well to address the nausea my wife had during pregnancy, but we were able to find a lot of regular gum that did the job just as well and at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> This gum was a life saver during my first trimester.  </li>
            <li> Really made a difference on the nausea and general stomach feeling better.</li>
            <li> We were on a nice boat, 49 feet, but weather was rough for the first two days</li>
            <li> I thought the taste was similar to cinnamon and enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> First, let me just say that this gum has a bit spicy element to it from the ginger.  </li>
            <li> Pregnant women should ask their doctor before taking ginger, and should be careful not take more than 1g per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Buy 2+ packs as soon as you get your positive test and thank me later. :)</li>
            <li> It is not Wrigley&#x27;s, but the flavor is tolerable according to a modeately moody pregnant woman with whom I live.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Human studies suggests that 1g daily of ginger may be effective for nausea and vomiting in pregnant women when used for short periods (no longer than 4 days).</li>
            <li> This gum is fine--I&#x27;m not in love with it, because when I&#x27;m nauseated the last thing in the world I want is sugar, and although this isn&#x27;t sickly sweet, there&#x27;s still a fair dose of it.</li>
            <li> find the flavor pretty strong at the beginning, but it only lasts 5-10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> the flavor was pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> They chew on one of these and feel better which is a relief because we travel long distances.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it worked or not, but the flavor is really good</li>
            <li> helped but taste got old QUICK</li>
            <li> Not a 100% cure, but certainly helps for me.</li>
            <li> It certainly works for motion sickness.  </li>
            <li> This order came very quickly and seemed to work well, though to be honest, I only used it one day for just a little while.  </li>
            <li> but I have yet to vomit in large park thanks to this gum.</li>
            <li> but the price is just way to high and the gum thins out causing you to use two pieces which in reality makes the price even higher.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s fast, easy, much less sweet than candied ginger, doesn&#x27;t require swallowing anything (which can be a problem when I&#x27;m feeling really crappy), and seems to help some.</li>
            <li> there it was, ready to help.  </li>
            <li> Did not work very well for me.</li>
            <li> Ive been on over 30 cruises and always use this, its great and doesnt make you tired like medicines.</li>
            <li> really helped on the cruise</li>
            <li> I absolutely could not stand it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re suffering from intense nausea during pregnancy, go to the hospital.</li>
            <li> (it seems they are no longer available locally) and decided to give them a try.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was just me, but I didn&#x27;t think the gum really worked.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really drink it.  </li>
            <li> These really work.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this remedy!</li>
            <li> Package looked as described and if the need arises again, I will order much sooner.</li>
            <li> It works very well for her.  </li>
            <li> I know that for some people this really helps with nausea, but for me it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Took this along on a boat day trip and found it very helpful to settle an upset stomach.  </li>
            <li> This gum is really a lifesaver for me.  </li>
            <li> This gum really works.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised, but anyone who has issues with motion sickness knows that if it works, it&#x27;s worth just about anything.</li>
            <li> I am a nurse as well as like being on the water sailing and had years ago found that antinausea wristband are very helpful.</li>
            <li> however, the flavor is gone really fast.</li>
            <li> Really helped.  </li>
            <li> THIS GUM REALLY WORKS.  </li>
            <li> IT WORKS IN A VERY QUCIK MANNER.</li>
            <li> This gum really helps me.</li>
            <li> This really helps with my nausea.</li>
            <li> However, it did work very well for a lady that I sat by.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more than I expected.  </li>
            <li> She prefers real ginger ale, but she takes the ginger gum to work.</li>
            <li> I even used the gum during a sporting event with a bunch of very smelly food that was turning my stomach.</li>
            <li> a small study of 30 pregnant women with severe vomiting, those who took 1 gram of ginger every day for 4 days reported more relief from vomiting than those who took placebo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure these would work better for others, unfortunately they weren&#x27;t very helpful for my husband.</li>
            <li> I had my pressure point wristbands on as usual and chewed the ginger gum for most of the ride, and I was good - not reading in the car or anything crazy like that, but OK.</li>
            <li> I bought a single packet of this first to test it, and I just came back to buy three more packs.  </li>
            <li> Been a huge help for her near constant motion sickness!</li>
            <li> and you typically need to chew more than one at a time.  </li>
            <li> I am here online to buy more because I just chewed my last two pieces and our local Wal-mart isn&#x27;t carrying it anymore.</li>
            <li> Some lose their flavor quickly, others last.  </li>
            <li> This anti-nausea gum has allowed me to enjoy deep sea water fishing and helped fight off frequent nausea spells.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the flavor.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had it for a cruise and recently purchased for a friend going sailing for the first time!</li>
            <li> Tastes ok, and helps a little with nausea...</li>
            <li> However, the gum shell is kind of hard</li>
            <li> The ginger flavor was not as strong in this gum as it was with other candies</li>
            <li> Works very well for my 13 year old.</li>
            <li> Taste doesn&#x27;t last long but as long as you get the ginger out of it, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> In just a few minutes my stomach felt much better and it seems to lasts for an hour or so.</li>
            <li> I think it works, but maybe not a huge amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that it was better to just get anti-emetic non-prescription medication.</li>
            <li> However, it did seem to calm the stomach and if that is what you would buy it for, it should help calm your stomach down.</li>
            <li> It is very satisfying to be able to have an impact on the suffering of someone who is so sick.</li>
            <li> Tastes good, but very soft, not a great consistency.</li>
            <li> I had nausea from a new medication I was taking.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like crystalized ginger which I have purchased from Whole Foods during the last pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> I do not think it kept me from being car sick, but it was a nice refreshing taste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that helped me, not silly remedies like this.</li>
            <li> bought for my wife &amp; 4 year old, IT WORKS !</li>
            <li> I would recommend the gum just based on recommendations I got from a few very close friends that have used it successfully in the past (which is why I ordered it too).  </li>
            <li> It is always better to be safe than sorry when you think you may be facing motion sickness, and I do not like the doped up feeling of dramamine!</li>
            <li> I used this recently before my first flight in 15+ years.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, the ginger is to strong for me, so I break it up into little pieces</li>
            <li> The pieces of gum are so small that it doesn&#x27;t really make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong, spicy flavor, (having some water at hand helps) but it goes away in a few minutes of chewing.</li>
            <li> I was pregnant for my second baby, and my nausea/vomiting was so severe and constant</li>
            <li> I would recommend other pregnant women give it a try.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find in drug stores, glad i can get it on amazon</li>
            <li> /&gt;  - natural sugar&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;  - natural ginger oil&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my first trimester of pregnancy, and I&#x27;ve been having a lot of problems with morning sickness (nausea, not vomiting, that lasts all day long).  </li>
            <li> I like it so far</li>
            <li> I was on a snorkeling boat and felt nauseous which went away completely as soon as I started chewing this gum.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to find something natural that didn&#x27;t add yet another chemical to my body.  </li>
            <li> This gum can be taken anywhere, and it relieves my nausia completely within 2-3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> chewing a piece of this gum completely stopped</li>
            <li> I like it because it is an all natural product.</li>
            <li> but did have me drinking my water quite frequently during that time.  </li>
            <li> The first few chews are quite hot (like pepper).</li>
            <li> Not to sweet or sour.  </li>
            <li> Some are very strong tasting, others weak.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I ran across this product a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> They work just as well if you can take the heat, and no mess.</li>
            <li> Still, I think it&#x27;s worth having to chew between doses of other sea-sickness medication.</li>
            <li> This carried a little more spice to it than black pepper but not too much.  </li>
            <li> If you are currently being treated with any of the following medications, you should not use ginger without first talking to your health care</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for people who gets bouts of nausea (mine were related to vasovagal episodes which induced nausea rather than fainting).</li>
            <li> There are other nits I could pick, like it being too sweet, or the unwelcome menthol flavor, but those are personal preference.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s not nearly as effective as chewing on a fresh piece of raw ginger, but it&#x27;s far better than not using it at all.</li>
            <li> In a larger study of 70 pregnant women with nausea and vomiting, those who received a similar dosage of ginger felt less nauseous and did not vomit as much as those who received placebo.</li>
            <li> Did not help with my motion or morning sickness and loses flavor very quickly.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find a convenient alternative to fresh ginger or ginger tea to help with nausea, but this has less ginger taste than a ginger snap cookie.</li>
            <li> An individual piece of this gum is so tiny that chewing it doesn&#x27;t really move your jaws or pop your ears.  </li>
            <li> to help with the major nausea as this gum does not do the trick at all.</li>
            <li> In general, I really don&#x27;t like ginger, and have been unable to tolerate ginger chews, but this was ok -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I needed it but better safe than sorry.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I tried the gum during a cruise trip and loved the flavor and it really helped with the sea sick.</li>
            <li> To make a long story short, I purchased this product, as well as the bio-band, and lastly the bionine tablets for my very first cruise last week.  </li>
            <li> Very favorable, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from motion sickness as far back as I can remember.</li>
            <li> My local supermarket used to carry it in their all natural section but no longer does.</li>
            <li> Thank you Sea-Band for providing a natural alternative to prescription medications that actually works!</li>
            <li> After using the gum I was able to focus on the game instead of the nausea.</li>
            <li> People sometimes look down their nose at natural remedies but in reality there are some out there that are really helpful.</li>
            <li> I feel this product works better than any other products I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> only downside is that it&#x27;s a little pricey, but it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> As far as the ginger, yes, the gum is better than airplane ginger ale that uses fake ginger flavoring.  </li>
            <li> Kind of a cruel trick for those of us with nausea :)</li>
            <li> Works better than peppermint (helped a little) and antacids (barely helped, and not great for long-term use anyway) for me, and is really convenient to keep with you when you need it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the ginger is very strong and they do not like the &#x27;burning&#x27; sensation.  </li>
            <li> I had constant morning sickness during my third pregnancy and was skeptical of this product but am SO glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> My body was having such problems getting used to flying, which was extremely frustrating as becoming a pilot is my dream and nausea was preventing me from achieving it.  </li>
            <li> I have an easily irritated stomach to begin with, and I am on a number of prescription meds that make it even worse.  </li>
            <li> i get nauseated easily and a family member suggested ginger.</li>
            <li> However, the spicy effect only lasted a few minutes from when you first start chewing it</li>
            <li> But not for serious n/v already in full force.</li>
            <li> I found it to help a little bit, but didn&#x27;t really like the ginger flavor.  </li>
            <li> it really did little for the vertigo.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes cheap out and take one instead of two, but usually within a half hour any nausea has subsided.</li>
            <li> Along with other homeopathic support including the wrist band this product helped keep both my wife and myself in the pink for the whole cruise.</li>
            <li> It may or may not have worked -- hard to tell -- but as a friend said, it&#x27;s certainly the tastiest placebo he&#x27;s ever had!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ginger extract has long been used in traditional medical practices to reduce inflammation.</li>
            <li> Only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t last long, so I was chewing it quite often, but between the gum and the ginger candies</li>
            <li> The gum doesn&#x27;t last that long</li>
            <li> The fix didn&#x27;t last long, but long enough until I could eat something to alleviate the sickness.</li>
            <li> I could definitely see how some kids might find it too strong, but my 10 yr old nephew tried it when he felt sick on a ferry recently, and he asked for it again before we got on the boat on the way back.</li>
            <li> I recently tried this ginger gum for nausea, which I unfortunately have most of the time, due to anxiety that never leaves me.  </li>
            <li> I am 6 months pregnant and still nauseated though...</li>
            <li> I thought they would be at least a little sweet</li>
            <li> they are really small though and for it to seem like a normal piece of gum, you&#x27;d have to chew 2-3.</li>
            <li> so be mindful of how long you have been chewing or it starts to fall apart in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I keep this in the car for long trips if the kids or others gets queenly traveling.</li>
            <li> It is not the fault of the product, but I have low tolerance to smells and tastes due to miscellaneous health problems.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t chew it for very long though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rather than chew the gum, I let it sit in my mouth and alleviate dry mouth and some nausea.  </li>
            <li> I have a history of motion sickness made much worse recently by some medications I&#x27;m taking, and I was facing a 10 hr car ride with much trepidation.</li>
            <li> Conventional prescription and over-the-counter medicines that decrease nausea may also have side effects, such as dry mouth and drowsiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I bought the 3 pack one as well after trying the single pack.</li>
            <li> On a recent trip driving across country, I chewed anti-nausea ginger gum most of the way, and never once did I feel car sick.</li>
            <li> I have chronic nausea that tends to get worse when I&#x27;m stressed out, and since there isn&#x27;t usually a clear physical cause, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different things.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my pregnant girlfriend in her first trimester when she had terrible nausea nearly every day.</li>
            <li> In one small study, participants were given either fresh root or powdered ginger, scopolamine, a medication commonly prescribed for motion sickness, or placebo.</li>
            <li> In a study of 261 people with OA of the knee, those who took a ginger extract twice daily had less pain and needed fewer pain-killing medications than those who received placebo.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but decided to purchase a pack of this gum anyway before an overseas trip, as I&#x27;ve been experiencing isolated, seemingly random bouts of mild nausea which I believe is related to motion sickness.  </li>
            <li> I was very sick the first month or two of being pregnant with my third baby.</li>
            <li> In all honesty, the mess was so offputting initially that I ended up using another product</li>
            <li> Just pop a piece of gum when you start to feel a little nauseous and it totally does the trick immediately.  </li>
            <li> On the few occasions that I have felt a little queasy on a cruise ship, I have chewed the gum and it works very fast and no more upset stomach.  </li>
            <li> Really worked while I was on a cruise--anytime I felt the least little bit nauseous</li>
            <li> Roughly three minutes every two pieces.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t work, you&#x27;re only out a few bucks.</li>
            <li> One of only a few things that did.</li>
            <li> So it isn&#x27;t really feasible for her to use that medication every time she feels nauseated.</li>
            <li> but she could only chew for a few minutes</li>
            <li> We actually skirted by a hurricane which caused some rather choppy days at sea</li>
            <li> I was extremely sick the entire first trimester of my pregnancy and could barely eat or drink.</li>
            <li> It almost made me more sick.</li>
            <li> We were able to go on a 3 day boat trip in Halong Bay, Vietnam without getting sick.  </li>
            <li> My only negative is that the gum will break down faster than standard gum</li>
            <li> Not sure if there&#x27;s enough ginger to affect your tummy.    </li>
            <li> My wife has problems with chronic nausea due to some diseases she has.</li>
            <li> I am 1000% extremely susceptible to motion sickness.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, other studies have found that ginger does not work as well as medications in reducing symptoms of motion sickness.</li>
            <li> But other studies have found that ginger didn&#x27; t help reduce nausea.</li>
            <li> I tried this gum as it was recommended to help with vertigo due to the ginger in it.  </li>
            <li> Flavor lasts for hours, doesn&#x27;t stick to teeth like other chiclet style gum.  </li>
            <li> I hate the prescription anti-nausea medications, and I find that this gum does a better job than anything I can get at the pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> and I even slept with it in a few rough nights when nothing else would do!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought ginger chews and find they have quite a bit of sugar and this gum has way less sugar.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps soothe the queasiness, but oddly enough, I found it difficult to chew.</li>
            <li> Chewed two pieces of gum and in less than 5 minutes the nausea was gone.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of spicy foods and black pepper is about as spicy as I can handle.  </li>
            <li> When we moved to the mountains in 2005, I started feeling carsick all the time, so much so that when we&#x27;d finally get home I&#x27;d have to lie down for 30 minutes or so until the sick feeling passed.</li>
            <li> I was pretty desperate to find a solution</li>
            <li> After chewing for just a little while my symptoms were much less.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this and the other 2 items to anyone worried about going on their first cruise and looking for something to help them combat that AWFUL feeling!</li>
            <li> It helps a little</li>
            <li> and the ginger flavor just seems a little bit off.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t work, not even a little bit.</li>
            <li> She said it helped a little bit with the nausea</li>
            <li> When she started using this, she said it helped her nausea a little bit during the day, but not noticeable in the evening.</li>
            <li> I think the gum does help a little.</li>
            <li> and she suddenly feels nauseated</li>
            <li> few studies suggest that ginger reduces the severity and duration of nausea -- but not vomiting -- during chemotherapy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*A few preliminary studies suggest that ginger may lower cholesterol and help prevent blood from clotting.</li>
            <li> However, people taking medications that thin the blood should use ginger only under the supervision of a health care provider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drug</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has less ginger oil than food coloring!</li>
            <li> In one trial of 80 new sailors who were prone to motion sickness, those who took powdered ginger had less vomiting and cold sweating compared to those who took placebo.</li>
            <li> She has been given a prescription medication to treat it from her doctor but it has unpleasant side effects (primarily headache and feeling extremely tired).</li>
            <li> Its pretty expensive, but I would pay any price not to be nauseated.</li>
            <li> The taste was horrible and it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li> Which is not to say that I only have nausea half the time, just that if I&#x27;m really feeling VERY sick, sometimes I chew this</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you get the sea sickness pretty bad but someone like me that if you catch it in tie you can keep sea sickness from occurring this stuff</li>
            <li> I also sent it to my niece who was having pretty bad morning sickness</li>
            <li> but you might as well put a raw price of ginger in your mouth instead.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of ginger in its raw form</li>
            <li> My kids suffer badly from motion sickness in the car, I am not sure if it is real or placebo</li>
            <li> Sorry, but it didn&#x27;t work and tasted BEYOND GROSS.  </li>
            <li> The pieces are quite small.  </li>
            <li> Well, the feeling came on a few times during my trip and chewing 2 pieces of this gum made it disappear within about 2 minutes!  </li>
            <li> the 1 was so small</li>
            <li> I usually give them crystallized ginger.</li>
            <li> But another study found that ginger was no better than ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or placebo in reducing symptoms of OA.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m home, I usually drink ginger tea.</li>
            <li> No more gallon freezer bags in the car for those moments.</li>
            <li> I got very car sick this weekend and the gum did nothing to help.  </li>
            <li> My doctor was prescribing anti-nausea meds to take with the stuff that makes me sick, but it makes me REALLY drowsy.  </li>
            <li> I can suffer from nausea in all kinds of motion-related situations, and I was quite nervous about my 10 day cruise (who wants to be sick for 10 days voluntarily?  </li>
            <li> Hard to know if ginger helps the nausea</li>
            <li> I suffer with vertigo and while it has improved over the years, the nausea can be hard to bear.</li>
            <li> However, one of the studies used ginger in combination with another anti-nausea drug, so it&#x27; s hard to say whether ginger had any effect.</li>
            <li> Ginger gum is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Also, my younger child suffers from motion sickness.</li>
            <li> She has had zero negative effects from using this product and she loves the taste.</li>
            <li> The candies seem to work for at least 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> I could hardly stand to chew this gum since the flavor was so weird in comparison to other gum.  </li>
            <li> and it makes me feel only pretty sick instead of VERY sick.  </li>
            <li> So for those of you who have terrible nausea for whatever the reason may be it may be worth a shot.</li>
            <li> But I also knew it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try, so the next time I felt sick in the car, I tried it.  </li>
            <li> I can become motion sick following my mouse pointer between two computer screens.  </li>
            <li> The last time I stepped on a boat while docked, I became instantly sick and had to get off.  </li>
            <li> I had terrible morning sickness for the first 6 months of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re nauseated, trying to chew this gum will MAKE you vomit.  </li>
            <li> I take meds in the am that can sometimes give me nausea also having pain can make me nauseated.</li>
            <li> My daughter gets extremely nauseated from flying</li>
            <li> It is ridiculously sticky- don&#x27;t put it on anything and expect it to be useable again!-</li>
            <li> Works well, and even on my worst days, knocks impending doom back to being at least manageable.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad batch, but it actually stuck to my teeth. :(</li>
            <li> My wife used this on her sea voyage to Antactica, while crossing the infamous Drake Passage.  </li>
            <li> She might eat it like candy if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Finally brought some relief to awful nausea associated with an SSRI prescription, and the effect is rapid.</li>
            <li> I shook my head sadly when my husband bought me this gum, thinking it would never work.</li>
            <li> I would pop a piece of this gum in and instantly it would curb that awful feeling!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been training to become a pilot and one thing that had been difficult to get over</li>
            <li> I currently take methotrexate, &amp; often have terrible chemo nausea from it.</li>
            <li> I get airsick, seasick, car sick and any other motion sick.</li>
            <li> But, lo and behold, after just a few minutes, the sick feeling was gone!  </li>
            <li> anytime my family feels sick or nauseated we take these</li>
            <li> This is not some over sweetened artificial gum for the masses.   </li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t want me to drink ginger ale because of all of the artificial ingredients and corn syrup, etc, so this seems to accomplish that purpose, I guess.  </li>
            <li> Not a magic cure, but not the worst.</li>
            <li> It sticks to everything and is very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> My husband gets really bad sea sickness</li>
            <li> I still chew the gum when I am at  work and it helps me cope with the in between meal sick feeling</li>
            <li> I would recommend it if you are sick to your stomach alot.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel sick all over.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t know I would get so sick.  </li>
            <li> and I did not get sick while on my cruise.</li>
            <li> SO sick morning.  </li>
            <li> I also should add that both of us used this product on our cruise when we had some issues with feeling sea sick.</li>
            <li> you will feel motion sick again -</li>
            <li> I keep these on hand and use them whenever I feel sick.</li>
            <li> I know will make me sick, and that way I don&#x27;t get queasy at all.  </li>
            <li> Had to take a road trip this summer and had 3 people who get car sick.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t feel sick at all.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and son get car sick.</li>
            <li> I get air sick</li>
            <li> Helped me get through a 4 hour boat tour without feeling sea sick once.</li>
            <li> still sea sick gum worthless</li>
            <li> This stuff is worthless.</li>
            <li> &gt;  - gum base</li>
            <li> She wasn&#x27;t sea sick!</li>
            <li> Well she absolutely hated this one.</li>
            <li> It tasted horrible and it didn&#x27;t get rid of the nausea.</li>
            <li> and I boiled some of it to make a sort of tea, but it was so disgusting</li>
            <li> The flavor and texture is a bit nasty, but it does just what it says.</li>
            <li> I have terrible terrible morning sickness to the point that I will just about ANYTHING to help ease my symptoms.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t horrible but it was still palatable.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product worked as advertised!</li>
            <li> Works great for nausea. Only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long. Roughly three minutes every two pieces. Nausea immediately goes away.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I bought this gum to help with occasional nausea. However, I did not expect the taste when I first tried it. The first few chews are quite hot (like pepper). It does work, though. I am a repeat purchaser.  Highly recommend for people who gets bouts of nausea (mine were related to vasovagal episodes which induced nausea rather than fainting).</li>
            <li> Helps alot! Will keep ordering.</li>
            <li> Wife has used and feels good after. Not bad taste - per her. Not to sweet or sour.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Works well on the short term. It stopped my morning sickness for about an hour or so. I keep it in my purse in case I get a case of nausea when I&#x27;m out and about.</li>
            <li> We tried this gum on our recent cruise vacation.  The taste is great...and it does make the tummy feel better.  I was happy just having it in my purse, knowing that should a situation arise that it was needed.....there it was, ready to help.  And it did.  Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> This gum has been so helpful. I have been having car-sickness recently, and this gum has been a life saver. Within minutes I start feeling better. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re nauseated, trying to chew this gum will MAKE you vomit.  Sorry, but it didn&#x27;t work and tasted BEYOND GROSS.  I was pregnant for my second baby, and my nausea/vomiting was so severe and constant it required around the clock prescription medication.  Maybe this product would be better as prophylaxis for light nausea if you&#x27;re going on a boat or something.  But not for serious n/v already in full force.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help with pregnancy morning (more like all day) sickness.  It helps a little but I can&#x27;t say it was the cure for me.  I eventually contacted my doctor for a prescription.  I still chew the gum when I am at  work and it helps me cope with the in between meal sick feeling and it has a nice flavor.  I would recommend other pregnant women give it a try.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this gum at a local pharmacy.  It is the ONLY product that has prevented me from getting motion sickness, without getting drowsy.  I recently ran out (I just got Halo 3), however after looking at 6 local pharmacy, they apparantly do not stock it anymore.  I knew I could count on Amazon!</li>
            <li> My wife used this on her sea voyage to Antactica, while crossing the infamous Drake Passage.  She wasn&#x27;t sea sick!</li>
            <li> I recently tried this ginger gum for nausea, which I unfortunately have most of the time, due to anxiety that never leaves me.  So I tried this and yes initially it is very strong tasting, but than the taste subsides but it works quite well. This is my first week of trying it and I like the results.    I would recommend it if you are sick to your stomach alot.</li>
            <li> I have stomach upset periodically and I find this gum to be helpful. I&#x27;ve bought ginger chews and find they have quite a bit of sugar and this gum has way less sugar. Taste doesn&#x27;t last long but as long as you get the ginger out of it, you&#x27;re good to go. Great product, highly recommend. Carry it with me all the time.</li>
            <li> Did not work very well for me. Meklazine works better for me.</li>
            <li> My fiance uses it for motion sickness. It has a strong taste but she has grown to actually enjoy it. She might eat it like candy if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. She says it does help with nausea.</li>
            <li> Works very well for my 13 year old.</li>
            <li> Ive been on over 30 cruises and always use this, its great and doesnt make you tired like medicines. Its hard to find in drug stores, glad i can get it on amazon</li>
            <li> good tasting.  Hard to know if ginger helps the nausea</li>
            <li> I get airsick, seasick, car sick and any other motion sick. It makes me feel sick all over. Pills and natural remedies do not work well alone, but with this gum, I felt great on the airplane this last trip. It was fun and pleasure for a change. I am buying a bulk quantity to have on hand for when I travel anywhere. I love the taste, and the texture is fine too. I recommend it full heartedly.</li>
            <li> Finally brought some relief to awful nausea associated with an SSRI prescription, and the effect is rapid. Works better than peppermint (helped a little) and antacids (barely helped, and not great for long-term use anyway) for me, and is really convenient to keep with you when you need it.  I never review products, but I feel this is worth raving about if you deal with persistent nausea.</li>
            <li> great morning sickness gum</li>
            <li> We just love them! My husband and I tried the gum during a cruise trip and loved the flavor and it really helped with the sea sick.</li>
            <li> Delicious!!!  This gum has captured the essence of what makes ginger scrumtulescent.  This is not some over sweetened artificial gum for the masses.   This is for those who dare to take their taste buds on an journey.  Tasty spicy not too sweet.  2 piece minimum.</li>
            <li> This works great for mild nausea for me but not for anthing major.  I got very car sick this weekend and the gum did nothing to help.  Maybe if I would have eaten a piece before it may have helped but I didn&#x27;t know I would get so sick.  I am going to make a Dr. appt. to help with the major nausea as this gum does not do the trick at all.</li>
            <li> really helped on the cruise</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me.  It tasted horrible and it didn&#x27;t get rid of the nausea.</li>
            <li> This stuff is worthless. I was hoping to find a convenient alternative to fresh ginger or ginger tea to help with nausea, but this has less ginger taste than a ginger snap cookie. Here are the ingredients listed on the package:&lt;br /&gt;  - gum base&lt;br /&gt;  - corn syrup&lt;br /&gt;  - natural sugar&lt;br /&gt;  - soy lecithin&lt;br /&gt;  - menthol&lt;br /&gt;  - color (titanium dioxide)&lt;br /&gt;  - glazing agent&lt;br /&gt;  - carnauba wax&lt;br /&gt;  - natural ginger oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has less ginger oil than food coloring! There are other nits I could pick, like it being too sweet, or the unwelcome menthol flavor, but those are personal preference. More importantly, it did not work, while ginger normally works very well for me. I cannot understand the many glowing reviews.</li>
            <li> When we moved to the mountains in 2005, I started feeling carsick all the time, so much so that when we&#x27;d finally get home I&#x27;d have to lie down for 30 minutes or so until the sick feeling passed. I shook my head sadly when my husband bought me this gum, thinking it would never work. But I also knew it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try, so the next time I felt sick in the car, I tried it.  As other reviewers said, it&#x27;s very spicy ... not in a pleasant way.  But, lo and behold, after just a few minutes, the sick feeling was gone!  I have been using this gum ever since and it has never failed me once.  I don&#x27;t take it before a car ride because I&#x27;m not always carsick. I just leave it in the car and take it whenever I feel the sickness coming on, and literally, within just a minute or two, it passes and does not return. I am here online to buy more because I just chewed my last two pieces and our local Wal-mart isn&#x27;t carrying it anymore. I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but according to these reviews it seems to work for more people than not, so it might be worth a try for you.  If it doesn&#x27;t work, you&#x27;re only out a few bucks. If it DOES work, you&#x27;re free from car sickness once and for all!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I ran across this product a few years ago.  I have used it for after surgery as well as motion sickness.  It is a great product.</li>
            <li> Great! Something that finally worked! One of only a few things that did. This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered it.</li>
            <li> This seems to help with my \\&quot;morning\\&quot; sickness. Whenever I feel quesiness this gum seems to make me feel a bit better. Not a 100% cure, but certainly helps for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent! I haven&#x27;t been seasick since I tried this ginger gum. Haven&#x27;t been sailing either, but it&#x27;s pretty tasty stuff. :)</li>
            <li> I was extremely sick the entire first trimester of my pregnancy and could barely eat or drink. I was looking for nausea relief since I vomited all the time and tried this ginger gum. I absolutely could not stand it. The taste was horrible and it&#x27;s very strong. If you&#x27;re suffering from intense nausea during pregnancy, go to the hospital. It&#x27;s the only thing that helped me, not silly remedies like this.</li>
            <li> I had terrible morning sickness for the first 6 months of my pregnancy. This definitely helped soothe the &amp;#34;water mouth&amp;#34; as I call it</li>
            <li> Nausea is a side effect of some medications I take and this product was recommended to me. I wish I could say it worked like a charm but it didn&#x27;t. It tasted ok and I suppose distracted me somewhat, but it didn&#x27;t touch my nausea.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it worked or not, but the flavor is really good and I did not get sick while on my cruise. So, I guess it worked!</li>
            <li> I bought this gum thinking it would kill two birds with one stone:  that the chewing would help my ears pop during flights and that the ginger would minimize the chance of air sickness.    An individual piece of this gum is so tiny that chewing it doesn&#x27;t really move your jaws or pop your ears.  Either chew two or three pieces simultaneously, or just buy a pack of Bubblicious at the grocery store before your flight instead.    As far as the ginger, yes, the gum is better than airplane ginger ale that uses fake ginger flavoring.  However, the gum shell is kind of hard and the ginger flavor just seems a little bit off.  Not sure if there&#x27;s enough ginger to affect your tummy.    Fyi--this is actually the identical product as the Sea-band anti-nausea gum that&#x27;s sold under a couple different names via Amazon (same packaging and everything).    It was worth a shot.  I&#x27;ll finish the package.  But I doubt I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Product as described. I found it helpful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from motion sickness as far back as I can remember. For years I have taken ginger root capsules before any trip longer than 20 min if someone else is driving. I saw these in a pharmacy last year (it seems they are no longer available locally) and decided to give them a try. They work for me. Also, my younger child suffers from motion sickness. He can&#x27;t swallow capsules yet, but this gum works for him. It does have a strong, spicy flavor, (having some water at hand helps) but it goes away in a few minutes of chewing. My son asks for it because it works.</li>
            <li> Perfect for morning sickness!  As soon as I felt my nausea start I would pop a piece of this gum in and instantly it would curb that awful feeling!</li>
            <li> Maybe it was just me, but I didn&#x27;t think the gum really worked. I am 6 months pregnant and still nauseated though...The gum had a really strong taste when you first chewed into it, after about 10 minutes the flavor was pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my first trimester of pregnancy, and I&#x27;ve been having a lot of problems with morning sickness (nausea, not vomiting, that lasts all day long).  So, I bought this and SeaBands bracelets to try, because I&#x27;ve used the bracelets for motion sickness before.  I&#x27;ve been using them separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gum is okay.  I&#x27;d say it cuts my nausea in half, at best.  Which is not to say that I only have nausea half the time, just that if I&#x27;m really feeling VERY sick, sometimes I chew this and it makes me feel only pretty sick instead of VERY sick.  Usually it only reduces my nausea about 20-30%.  One time I had a meeting at work, and by the time I left my meeting I was SURE I was going to vomit in the parking lot because I was feeling SO SO sick morning.  I had some of this in my purse and I started to chew it, and when it lost its flavor I chewed another piece, and after that I felt like I could probably drive home (8 minute drive), instead of feeling like I&#x27;d better stay bent over by the bushes. So, I was grateful that I had it with me then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the flavor pretty strong at the beginning, but it only lasts 5-10 minutes.  The pieces are quite small.  My husband doesn&#x27;t want me to drink ginger ale because of all of the artificial ingredients and corn syrup, etc, so this seems to accomplish that purpose, I guess.  I also bought actual ginger root and I boiled some of it to make a sort of tea, but it was so disgusting I couldn&#x27;t really drink it.  The gum is tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re struggling with nausea, it&#x27;s worth giving this a try.  I can see a noticeable benefit from it, and it seems like there is a good chance that it would work better for some other people.</li>
            <li> I personally tried it because I heard ginger was good for vertigo. It&#x27;s also good for mentrual cramps as well as nausea. I like it so far and it seems to help but the price is just way to high and the gum thins out causing you to use two pieces which in reality makes the price even higher.</li>
            <li> Great product and for a great price. Always getting stuff from Amazon is a great relief on the wallet and you can find everything!!!!!! Awesome medicine and it worked really fast, made the cruise so great!!!!</li>
            <li> These really work. In just a few minutes my stomach felt much better and it seems to lasts for an hour or so.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but decided to purchase a pack of this gum anyway before an overseas trip, as I&#x27;ve been experiencing isolated, seemingly random bouts of mild nausea which I believe is related to motion sickness.  Well, the feeling came on a few times during my trip and chewing 2 pieces of this gum made it disappear within about 2 minutes!  My husband and I also got a touch of traveler&#x27;s diarrhea with its accompanying nausea and the gum helped relieve that, too.  I highly recommend this remedy!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the product because it didn&#x27;t arrive in time for my trip. Package looked as described and if the need arises again, I will order much sooner.</li>
            <li> Tastes good and works good.</li>
            <li> I suffer with vertigo and while it has improved over the years, the nausea can be hard to bear. This gum is spicy and odd-tasting at first, but after a minute or two your nausea is so diminished that you would happily chew an entire box just to feel the relief. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now and have come to love the ginger flavor! I carry it with me everywhere!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from motion sickness all my life. I discovered this on a recent trip, and found that it worked well - and almost instantly - riding on a bus, in a car, and an airplane. There was a lot of turbulence on my final air descent, and I found that the gum wasn&#x27;t quite enough in that instance. Since it was a lifesaver, literally, six or seven times before that, though, I&#x27;m going to keep using it!</li>
            <li> I bought a box of this gum to help combat morning sickness. It definitely helps soothe the queasiness, but oddly enough, I found it difficult to chew. Maybe I just got a bad batch, but it actually stuck to my teeth. :(</li>
            <li> Four plane trips; no problems. Did this gum help? Who knows! I&#x27;ll buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;O yes--VERY tasty!</li>
            <li> First off, this works great and tastes great. I highly recommend it. But don&#x27;t make the mistake of trying to remove the chewed piece from your mouth with your fingers. It sticks to everything and is very difficult to remove. Simple solution: spit it into a tissue to throw it away. In all honesty, the mess was so offputting initially that I ended up using another product (ginger chews by Gin-Gin). They work just as well if you can take the heat, and no mess.</li>
            <li> Daughter doesn&#x27;t do trip with out it anymore.  Been a huge help for her near constant motion sickness!</li>
            <li> Good product really helps with nausea. Have already ordered a second time.</li>
            <li> I take several medications that make me nauseous.  I have found ginger products are a very good supplement to the anti-nausea meds I take.  I take ginger via gum, and have tried several brands, as I like the tate of ginger and it&#x27;s a lot more enjoyable than just swallowing a capsule.  Some are very strong tasting, others weak. Some lose their flavor quickly, others last.  Sea-Band&#x27;s gum is somewhat on the mid side in flavor, and it lasts longer than most I&#x27;ve tried.  Overall, I would say this gum is effective, but it is more suitable for those that don&#x27;t like strong flavor.  IMO it would be a very good choice for children, as they seem to be more sensitive to strong flavors.</li>
            <li> Gum only last for about 2 minutes before it starts to fall apart.</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my grandson who has motion sickness. He uses it when he is on the team bus going to games. It works for him along with the bracelet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase more as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> My mom has cancer and uses this gum.  It works very well for her.  The ginger is a bit strong, so she drinks water with it.</li>
            <li> I was very sick the first month or two of being pregnant with my third baby. I was pretty desperate to find a solution so I bought these overpriced pieces of gum. They didn&#x27;t work, not even a little bit. I eventually did figure out how to relieve my morning sickness, but this gum was not part of that solution.</li>
            <li> I purchased the gum for someone who will be having Chemo so I cannot comment on it&#x27;s effectiveness at this time.</li>
            <li> Zingy and relief from nausea! Love this gum</li>
            <li> Took this on a cruise to the Med this Spring - didnt work at all.  Had to rely on the seasick &amp;#34;patch&amp;#34; I took &#x27;just in case.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt; YMMV.</li>
            <li> still sea sick gum worthless</li>
            <li> It seems to be a very good product. It is not the fault of the product, but I have low tolerance to smells and tastes due to miscellaneous health problems. Therefore, the ginger is to strong for me, so I break it up into little pieces so I can put it to good use. That is just me, should not affect the use of this product for anyone else.</li>
            <li> I will admit the flavor is a bit strong...but it works so that is good enough for me!!  T</li>
            <li> I know that for some people this really helps with nausea, but for me it didn&#x27;t.  I could hardly stand to chew this gum since the flavor was so weird in comparison to other gum.  It almost made me more sick.</li>
            <li> These are gross......spicy would be the word.  I thought they would be at least a little sweet but you might as well put a raw price of ginger in your mouth instead. .....yuck and would not recommend.</li>
            <li> My husband gets really bad sea sickness and this is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; product when we&#x27;re traveling.  Just pop a piece of gum when you start to feel a little nauseous and it totally does the trick immediately.  We were able to go on a 3 day boat trip in Halong Bay, Vietnam without getting sick.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Good tasting ginger gum that relieves my nausea!  THANK YOU!!!  I just ordered more!</li>
            <li> I bought this for the kids, who are susceptible to motion sickness.  Unfortunately, the ginger is very strong and they do not like the &#x27;burning&#x27; sensation.  Therefore, they won&#x27;t use it.  I tried it, and for me the flavor was fine.  I can&#x27;t speak to the effectiveness for motion sickness, though.</li>
            <li> I heard that ginger gum helps with altitude sickness. Next month I will put this to the test. The product was well shipped and came in originally packaging.</li>
            <li> I have actually been using this product for about 3 years now. My local supermarket used to carry it in their all natural section but no longer does. This was my first time purchasing it off Amazon. My wife has problems with chronic nausea due to some diseases she has. She has been given a prescription medication to treat it from her doctor but it has unpleasant side effects (primarily headache and feeling extremely tired). So it isn&#x27;t really feasible for her to use that medication every time she feels nauseated. People sometimes look down their nose at natural remedies but in reality there are some out there that are really helpful. Sea-Band&#x27;s Anti-Nausea Ginger Gum is one of them! My wife has commented on numerous occasions how it takes the edge off her nausea. She has also said that it is sometimes what prevents her from actually throwing up. She carries it in her purse wherever she goes. If she&#x27;s at the store picking up groceries and she suddenly feels nauseated she has something to help her right there with her. She has had zero negative effects from using this product and she loves the taste. I also should add that both of us used this product on our cruise when we had some issues with feeling sea sick. It helped with that as well. We are faithful customers of Sea-Band and will continue to purchase this item whenever we run out. Thank you Sea-Band for providing a natural alternative to prescription medications that actually works!</li>
            <li> Took this along on a boat day trip and found it very helpful to settle an upset stomach.  Strong ginger taste so you need to like ginger which fortunately I do&#x27;</li>
            <li> Was on a 5 day ocean fishing trip out of San Diego and was worried about sea sickness.  This gum worked well in conjunction with OTC medication.  Very favorable, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I took it on my cruise and had no sickness problems.</li>
            <li> I got this for the obvious reasons. I think it works, but maybe not a huge amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that it was better to just get anti-emetic non-prescription medication. It&#x27;s also a lot cheaper, too.</li>
            <li> this gum is great for motion sickness.  I was on a snorkeling boat and felt nauseous which went away completely as soon as I started chewing this gum.  The minute you take it out you will feel motion sick again - so KEEP chewing it while you&#x27;re still in motion, even if the flavor is gone.</li>
            <li> Not my go to product- but great for a back up, especially when out and about, very convenient. Flavor is pungent pleasant and effective but I would prefer it to be sugarless.</li>
            <li> I ordered this during my first trimester to help with morning sickness and nausea.  I found it to help a little bit, but didn&#x27;t really like the ginger flavor.  If you are like me and on the fence with ginger flavoring, I would suggest trying something different.</li>
            <li> I keep these on hand and use them whenever I feel sick. I sometimes cheap out and take one instead of two, but usually within a half hour any nausea has subsided.</li>
            <li> This gum is really a lifesaver for me.  I&#x27;ve been training to become a pilot and one thing that had been difficult to get over was airsickness in turbulence and low visibility flights.  My body was having such problems getting used to flying, which was extremely frustrating as becoming a pilot is my dream and nausea was preventing me from achieving it.  This gum has made it so I can fly in any sort of turbulence in any visibility with little to no nausea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I get seasick and it has helped tremendously with preventing that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it&#x27;s a little pricey, but it is well worth it.  Definitely one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever purchased!!!</li>
            <li> The flavor goes away after a minute or so and it didn&#x27;t help with my pregnancy nausea at all. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> I love the taste of ginger...it could be a bit strong for someone sensitive to the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; flavor; but if not, it works great for nausea.</li>
            <li> This gum really works.  Will not cruise without it.  On the few occasions that I have felt a little queasy on a cruise ship, I have chewed the gum and it works very fast and no more upset stomach.  Will not cruise without it.</li>
            <li> I bought the ginger gum because I get seasick and I was going on a fishing trip. I went through 10 pieces, but I had a good time on the 5 hr trip and caught almost a dozen fish, most of which got let go.  It was a much better trip than others I&#x27;ve had where I spent most of my time hanging over the rail.</li>
            <li> I bought this gum for my Mom last year. She had uterine cancer. She said it helped a little bit with the nausea but she could only chew for a few minutes and then she spit out. She had dentures. I never thought about that so I wanted to just warn everyone if you are buying this for an elderly person and they have dentures don&#x27;t. Also, if they have advanced cancer like my mother did, I don&#x27;t think any gum will help that much. I think you&#x27;d be better off buying some ginger cookies or ginger candy or even fresh ginger for them to nibble on or steep in tea.</li>
            <li> It certainly works for motion sickness.  I had it for a cruise and recently purchased for a friend going sailing for the first time!</li>
            <li> I am 1000% extremely susceptible to motion sickness.  You name it and I&#x27;ve probably been affected by the side effects.  I can become motion sick following my mouse pointer between two computer screens.  To make a long story short, I purchased this product, as well as the bio-band, and lastly the bionine tablets for my very first cruise last week.  The last time I stepped on a boat while docked, I became instantly sick and had to get off.  I was able to do this cruise w/ the greatest of ease!  I highly recommend this and the other 2 items to anyone worried about going on their first cruise and looking for something to help them combat that AWFUL feeling!</li>
            <li> Did not help with my motion or morning sickness and loses flavor very quickly.</li>
            <li> Really worked while I was on a cruise--anytime I felt the least little bit nauseous I chewed a piece and it settled me, doesn&#x27;t last long, so I was chewing it quite often, but between the gum and the ginger candies I was ok the whole cruise.</li>
            <li> This works great, very quickly.  Super handy to keep in a purse or pocket</li>
            <li> Tastes YUK! Veeeeery strong ginger taste, burned my tongue!</li>
            <li> The product description is somewhat misleading.  This gum does not prevent nausea, it reduces the recovery time and severity of nausea after it occurs.</li>
            <li> I used this for motion sickness on a trip to Alaska. It seemed to give me almost instant relief with none of the side effects of the &amp;#34;patch&amp;#34; or dramamine.</li>
            <li> I bought a single packet of this first to test it, and I just came back to buy three more packs.  This stuff is FAST and effective!!  I have an easily irritated stomach to begin with, and I am on a number of prescription meds that make it even worse.  My doctor was prescribing anti-nausea meds to take with the stuff that makes me sick, but it makes me REALLY drowsy.  I wanted to find something natural that didn&#x27;t add yet another chemical to my body.  A friend suggested ginger tea with an additional 1/4 teaspoon of powdered ginger.  It worked, but making hot tea isn&#x27;t always convenient.  This gum can be taken anywhere, and it relieves my nausia completely within 2-3 minutes.  I have started to chew it a minute or two before I take the meds I know will make me sick, and that way I don&#x27;t get queasy at all.  This gum is a life-saver!!  Its pretty expensive, but I would pay any price not to be nauseated.</li>
            <li> Through suffering with gastroparesis and altitude sickness, this gum is a life-saver!  I hate the prescription anti-nausea medications, and I find that this gum does a better job than anything I can get at the pharmacy.  Can&#x27;t recommend enough.</li>
            <li> The Anti-Nausea  Ginger Gum was good and helped with nausea. It is pleasant tasting but it sticks to your teeth. The product  is good and it does what it says it will do help stop the nausea.</li>
            <li> My father claims it is helping his bouts of nausea.</li>
            <li> On a recent trip driving across country, I chewed anti-nausea ginger gum most of the way, and never once did I feel car sick. I feel this product works better than any other products I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure these would work better for others, unfortunately they weren&#x27;t very helpful for my husband. He enjoyed the taste, however.</li>
            <li> These are AMAZING !!&lt;br /&gt;they work so well - I carry a pack with me everywhere I go !!&lt;br /&gt;have them at work, home &amp; have given a pack to everyone in the family !!&lt;br /&gt;Great item to have on ya at all times !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really impressed with the ginger gum. I have a history of motion sickness made much worse recently by some medications I&#x27;m taking, and I was facing a 10 hr car ride with much trepidation. My doctor prescribed an Rx for nausea relief, but I ended up not even needing it. I had my pressure point wristbands on as usual and chewed the ginger gum for most of the ride, and I was good - not reading in the car or anything crazy like that, but OK. In general, I really don&#x27;t like ginger, and have been unable to tolerate ginger chews, but this was ok - I even started to like it, and now I chew it every time I get in the car. I actually wish the flavor would last longer. I could definitely see how some kids might find it too strong, but my 10 yr old nephew tried it when he felt sick on a ferry recently, and he asked for it again before we got on the boat on the way back. I was surprised, but anyone who has issues with motion sickness knows that if it works, it&#x27;s worth just about anything.</li>
            <li> I am a nurse as well as like being on the water sailing and had years ago found that antinausea wristband are very helpful.</li>
            <li> I have had motion sickness issues all my life.  I have used all of the over the counter drugs, which work, but leave you hung over afterwards.  Driving the autobahn at 120mph is not a lot of fun coming of Dramamine.  One pieces of  ginger gum and I am good for the longest flight with no feeling of nausea at all.  I forget I ever had any motion sickness issues.</li>
            <li> i get nauseated easily and a family member suggested ginger. i found these and decided to try them. initially, the taste is super strong, so be ready for a ginger punch!! the more you chew, it subdues a bit and is really good! they are really small though and for it to seem like a normal piece of gum, you&#x27;d have to chew 2-3. the 1 was so small, i felt like it was getting lost in my mouth. however, they do work and i would buy them again. for me, just need more than 1 each time (quite possible its just me that would feel the need for more than 1 piece, most important thing is that THEY WORK)</li>
            <li> Had to take a road trip this summer and had 3 people who get car sick.  We tried the seabands which work good but by day 2 kids don&#x27;t want to wear them...so I purchased the Ginger Gum and it worked great.  I even got a bit nauseous and it worked for me also.</li>
            <li> Along with other homeopathic support including the wrist band this product helped keep both my wife and myself in the pink for the whole cruise. We actually skirted by a hurricane which caused some rather choppy days at sea yet we experienced no seasickness whatsoever. This gum was actually almost pleasant to chew and most importantly did what it advertised.</li>
            <li> we went on a cruise and although we did not need the medication for sea illness ... this was the PERFECT necessity to get over that first day at sea.  chewing a piece of this gum completely stopped any motion illness felt.  :)</li>
            <li> Just pop two in your mouth as you are getting on the boat and chew and enjoy. Never thought I could take a boat ride until this gum.  My cousin used it for Kimo sickness and it worked better than the medication the doctor gave her.</li>
            <li> I currently take methotrexate, &amp; often have terrible chemo nausea from it. I have found that ginger is one of the only things that immediately starts to help the nausea. But I don&#x27;t always have fresh ginger on hand, so I bought this gum a month ago to keep by the bed. For me, it&#x27;s not nearly as effective as chewing on a fresh piece of raw ginger, but it&#x27;s far better than not using it at all. I still have to take Zofran for the nausea, but this gum helps make it more bearable while waiting for the Zofran to kick in.</li>
            <li> This is the second time that I have purchased this product for a cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy.  He states that this is the only product he finds to be truly effective in managing his nausea.  It is very satisfying to be able to have an impact on the suffering of someone who is so sick.</li>
            <li> Tastes ok, and helps a little with nausea... however, the flavor is gone really fast.</li>
            <li> Went on my first cruise and this gum was all I needed. Have a history of motion sickness, but popped the gum the minute I started feeling queasy and that&#x27;s all I needed. Even shared it with a couple friends who also found it to be effective.</li>
            <li> I am currently under going chemotherapy treatment for cancer of the esophagus. I did not like taking the medications I had to help with the nausea. A pharmacist suggested I try the ginger root gum made by sea band. It is amazing and helps control my nausea. I like it because it is an all natural product. I am currently on my 2nd cycle of chemotherapy and still completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> You have to like ginger.  It has a  Very, Very strong ginger taste.  I had nausea from a new medication I was taking.  Chewed two pieces of gum and in less than 5 minutes the nausea was gone.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this gum when I was searching on Amazon and found it to be a great alternative to tums, etc.  Any natural product in my mind is better than a drug.</li>
            <li> Item as promised quickly shipped.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you get the sea sickness pretty bad but someone like me that if you catch it in tie you can keep sea sickness from occurring this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> bought for my wife &amp; 4 year old, IT WORKS !</li>
            <li> This stuff works both to stop nausea and to calm indigestion. It&#x27;s well worth the price when you are in need.</li>
            <li> My nausea with this pregnancy has ranged from mild to severe but I have yet to vomit in large park thanks to this gum. Used dusk til dawn and I even slept with it in a few rough nights when nothing else would do! Works well, and even on my worst days, knocks impending doom back to being at least manageable. It is ridiculously sticky- don&#x27;t put it on anything and expect it to be useable again!- so one tablet per use, but totally is worth it. Life saver! Buy 2+ packs as soon as you get your positive test and thank me later. :)</li>
            <li> Really helped.  I wish I had bought more.</li>
            <li> My kids suffer badly from motion sickness in the car, I am not sure if it is real or placebo but we will be buying it again. I usually give them crystallized ginger.</li>
            <li> THIS GUM REALLY WORKS.  IT HAS A SPICY TASTE JUST AS GINGER DOES. IT WORKS IN A VERY QUCIK MANNER.</li>
            <li> Tastes good, but very soft, not a great consistency. I do like the flavor, though.</li>
            <li> The flavor and texture is a bit nasty, but it does just what it says. If you like the taste of ginger it would probably be perfect for you</li>
            <li> Medicinal Uses and Indications:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, health care professionals may recommend ginger to help prevent or treat nausea and vomiting from motion sickness, pregnancy, and cancer chemotherapy. It is also used as a digestive aid for mild stomach upset, to reduce pain of osteoarthritis, and may even be used in heart disease or cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Motion Sickness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several studies -- but not all -- suggest that ginger may work better than placebo in reducing some symptoms of motion sickness. In one trial of 80 new sailors who were prone to motion sickness, those who took powdered ginger had less vomiting and cold sweating compared to those who took placebo. Ginger did not reduce nausea, however. Similar results were found in a study with healthy volunteers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, other studies have found that ginger does not work as well as medications in reducing symptoms of motion sickness. In one small study, participants were given either fresh root or powdered ginger, scopolamine, a medication commonly prescribed for motion sickness, or placebo. Those who took scopolamine had fewer symptoms than those who took ginger. Conventional prescription and over-the-counter medicines that decrease nausea may also have side effects, such as dry mouth and drowsiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pregnancy-Related Nausea and Vomiting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Human studies suggests that 1g daily of ginger may be effective for nausea and vomiting in pregnant women when used for short periods (no longer than 4 days). Several studies have found that ginger is better than placebo in relieving morning sickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a small study of 30 pregnant women with severe vomiting, those who took 1 gram of ginger every day for 4 days reported more relief from vomiting than those who took placebo. In a larger study of 70 pregnant women with nausea and vomiting, those who received a similar dosage of ginger felt less nauseous and did not vomit as much as those who received placebo. Pregnant women should ask their doctor before taking ginger, and should be careful not take more than 1g per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chemotherapy nausea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few studies suggest that ginger reduces the severity and duration of nausea -- but not vomiting -- during chemotherapy. However, one of the studies used ginger in combination with another anti-nausea drug, so it&#x27; s hard to say whether ginger had any effect. More studies are needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nausea and vomiting after surgery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Research is mixed as to whether ginger can help reduce nausea and vomiting following surgery. Two studies found that 1g of ginger root before surgery reduced nausea as well as a leading medication. In one of these studies, women who received ginger also needed fewer medications for nausea after surgery. But other studies have found that ginger didn&#x27; t help reduce nausea. In fact, one study found that ginger may actually increase vomiting following surgery. More research is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Osteoarthritis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ginger extract has long been used in traditional medical practices to reduce inflammation. And there is some evidence that ginger may help reduce pain from osteoarthritis (OA). In a study of 261 people with OA of the knee, those who took a ginger extract twice daily had less pain and needed fewer pain-killing medications than those who received placebo. But another study found that ginger was no better than ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or placebo in reducing symptoms of OA. It may take several weeks to see any effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other uses&lt;br /&gt;*A few preliminary studies suggest that ginger may lower cholesterol and help prevent blood from clotting. That can be helpful in treating heart disease, where blood vessels can become blocked and lead to heart attack or stroke. But more studies are needed to know whether ginger is safe or effective for heart disease.&lt;br /&gt;*Laboratory studies have also found that some substances in ginger may kill cancer cells in test tubes. More research is needed toknow if ginger would have the same effect in humans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;Interactions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ginger may alter the effects of some prescription and non-prescription medications. If you are currently being treated with any of the following medications, you should not use ginger without first talking to your health care provider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blood-thinning medications -- Although ginger may interfere with blood clotting, there have been no scientific or case reports of interactions between ginger and blood-thinning medications, such as aspirin and warfarin. However, people taking medications that thin the blood should use ginger only under the supervision of a health care provider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drug Interactions:&lt;br /&gt;Blood-thinning MedicationsCyclophosphamide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternative Names:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ginger; Zingiber officinale</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this but was wiling to try and so glad I did. I take meds in the am that can sometimes give me nausea also having pain can make me nauseated. This gum really helps me. I also sent it to my niece who was having pretty bad morning sickness and she loved it.</li>
            <li> I tried this gum as it was recommended to help with vertigo due to the ginger in it.  While it tasted good (it has a slightly \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; flavor) it really did little for the vertigo.  However, it did seem to calm the stomach and if that is what you would buy it for, it should help calm your stomach down.</li>
            <li> Knowing I tend to be carsick, I purchased this gum for use on a safari trip in Africa.  Although I still needed daily dramamine, this gum provided some additional help.  Rather than chew the gum, I let it sit in my mouth and alleviate dry mouth and some nausea.  I do not think it kept me from being car sick, but it was a nice refreshing taste.</li>
            <li> helped but taste got old QUICK</li>
            <li> I bought this for my pregnant girlfriend in her first trimester when she had terrible nausea nearly every day. When she started using this, she said it helped her nausea a little bit during the day, but not noticeable in the evening.</li>
            <li> These taste great and DO help nausea...but after about 10 chews it turns gritty and pasty and kind-of gross.  Again, they work...but have a tissue or something nearby so you can spit it out quickly before you get gagged on it.  Kind of a cruel trick for those of us with nausea :)</li>
            <li> I have chronic nausea that tends to get worse when I&#x27;m stressed out, and since there isn&#x27;t usually a clear physical cause, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different things. This gum is fine--I&#x27;m not in love with it, because when I&#x27;m nauseated the last thing in the world I want is sugar, and although this isn&#x27;t sickly sweet, there&#x27;s still a fair dose of it. However, it&#x27;s fast, easy, much less sweet than candied ginger, doesn&#x27;t require swallowing anything (which can be a problem when I&#x27;m feeling really crappy), and seems to help some. Not a magic cure, but not the worst. Pickles still work better when I can tolerate them.</li>
            <li> My daughter in law is pleased with the stomach settling the Ginger Gum provides her and it arrived quickly enough to still be needed!</li>
            <li> Ginger gum is hard to find.  I find it helps with nausea. I suffer from Vertigo so I carry this with me everywhere.</li>
            <li> Would probably work if the flavor was deeply imbedded in the gum. but was only on the surface, could probably be made to work better!</li>
            <li> This an ok product for stomach upset.  Not my first choice though.  Tummy Drops are much better!</li>
            <li> This really helps with my nausea. I love this gum!</li>
            <li> I won some of this gum from the company so I tried it when I had nausea with a migraine. It worked in just a minute! I wish they made a migraine medication as effective as this gum is for the nausea.</li>
            <li> My daughter gets extremely nauseated from flying so I purchased several products to help her out. Well she absolutely hated this one. However she doesn&#x27;t like the taste of ginger so that could be it as well</li>
            <li> The gum seemed to work pretty well to address the nausea my wife had during pregnancy, but we were able to find a lot of regular gum that did the job just as well and at a fraction of the cost.  The gum doesn&#x27;t last that long and you typically need to chew more than one at a time.  Still it did its job.</li>
            <li> Great seller!! The gum not only tasted amazing but it also took my nausea away almost immediately. I was very impressed so I bought the 3 pack one as well after trying the single pack. The product arrived on time and was just like the description.</li>
            <li> It may or may not have worked -- hard to tell -- but as a friend said, it&#x27;s certainly the tastiest placebo he&#x27;s ever had!</li>
            <li> During my first trimester, I kept this gum on hand for a quick fix when feeling nauseous. The fix didn&#x27;t last long, but long enough until I could eat something to alleviate the sickness.</li>
            <li> This gum saved my marriage! And it will save yours too. If nausea is a problem for your wife or girlfriend, this gum is the answer!</li>
            <li> Gilligan thinks so.  I will try this when I take my boat out on the ocean. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to go soon because we still have a lot of snow and ice.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to work for me when I flew in an airplane.  However, it did work very well for a lady that I sat by.  I am pregnant so I don&#x27;t know if that was part of my problem.  I took Bonine for the plane ride and it worked wonders.  There was lots of turbulence and I didn&#x27;t feel sick at all.</li>
            <li> these work great. anytime my family feels sick or nauseated we take these and they work quickly and without any side effects. wont be without them. thank you</li>
            <li> I tend to get indigestion after eating meat or spicy foods. If I&#x27;m home, I usually drink ginger tea. If I&#x27;m elsewhere, I try to deal. I tried this gum to see if it would help. It did help some. It was a nice strong ginger flavor, but does lose it&#x27;s flavor quickly. It&#x27;s helpful in a pinch, but I&#x27;ll stick to my ginger tea when I&#x27;m able.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much and will be ordering more very soon.  It&#x27;s more than I expected.  It has worked every time I have used it.</li>
            <li> This ia an excellent tasting gum.  Flavor lasts for hours, doesn&#x27;t stick to teeth like other chiclet style gum.  Kids love this as well.  Does help with nausea.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and son get car sick. No more gallon freezer bags in the car for those moments. They chew on one of these and feel better which is a relief because we travel long distances. Ginger is now part of our diet!</li>
            <li> I get air sick so I always fly with this !</li>
            <li> I do ont know if these work or not. I guess everytime I try to chew one the taste makes me sicker and i have to spit it out. I do like ginger in my food but cant chew ginger gum i guess....</li>
            <li> I used them on a cruise. I don&#x27;t know if it really worked or not, but they tasted good and kept my mouth hydrated in a very dry environment.</li>
            <li> This gum will provide some mild relief from pregnancy induced nausea.  It is not Wrigley&#x27;s, but the flavor is tolerable according to a modeately moody pregnant woman with whom I live.  She prefers real ginger ale, but she takes the ginger gum to work.</li>
            <li> bought this to use in conjunction with Sea Band bracelets on a cruise.  I can suffer from nausea in all kinds of motion-related situations, and I was quite nervous about my 10 day cruise (who wants to be sick for 10 days voluntarily?  This order came very quickly and seemed to work well, though to be honest, I only used it one day for just a little while.  I would recommend the gum just based on recommendations I got from a few very close friends that have used it successfully in the past (which is why I ordered it too).  It is always better to be safe than sorry when you think you may be facing motion sickness, and I do not like the doped up feeling of dramamine!</li>
            <li> This anti-nausea gum has allowed me to enjoy deep sea water fishing and helped fight off frequent nausea spells. I keep it in my purse at all times. If you suffer from sea sickness, morning sickness, car sickness or just nausea in general, it&#x27;d be worthwhile to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> Have not used yet, bought it for ocean trips, or vertigo, so no rate yet, as soon as I use it I will rate it</li>
            <li> This gum was a life saver during my first trimester.  Really made a difference on the nausea and general stomach feeling better. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Ginger products can often come with a bold bite, but this gum is just right. Helped me get through a 4 hour boat tour without feeling sea sick once. I used this along with my ginger trips for a nausea free adventure! That&#x27;s a first!!</li>
            <li> The pieces of gum are so small that it doesn&#x27;t really make a huge difference. You&#x27;re better off taking ginger capsules.</li>
            <li> I used this gum in combination with regular sea sickness medication on a sailing trip in the Channel Islands.  We were on a nice boat, 49 feet, but weather was rough for the first two days and I felt great.  The ginger gum tastes great but looses it&#x27;s flavor rather quickly.  Still, I think it&#x27;s worth having to chew between doses of other sea-sickness medication.</li>
            <li> no sickness so must of worked</li>
            <li> I hope this work as well as they say.</li>
            <li> I had constant morning sickness during my third pregnancy and was skeptical of this product but am SO glad I tried it! After chewing for just a little while my symptoms were much less. I even used the gum during a sporting event with a bunch of very smelly food that was turning my stomach. After using the gum I was able to focus on the game instead of the nausea. The ginger flavor was not as strong in this gum as it was with other candies I was trying at the time.  My only negative is that the gum will break down faster than standard gum so be mindful of how long you have been chewing or it starts to fall apart in your mouth. This is a must try for anyone experiencing nausea!</li>
            <li> I used this recently before my first flight in 15+ years.  I&#x27;m not sure I needed it but better safe than sorry.  I thought the taste was similar to cinnamon and enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> Ok so the flavor is a strong burst and then fades quickly, but it gets you through intense moments of nausea.  Used for morning sickness per my ob&#x27;s recomendation.</li>
            <li> As expected/on time/packaged well.  Perfect product for chemo, as per a patient.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of ginger in its raw form but I can have it processed such as this.  I have terrible terrible morning sickness to the point that I will just about ANYTHING to help ease my symptoms.  After reading all the great reviews about this gum I decided to give it a try.  First, let me just say that this gum has a bit spicy element to it from the ginger.  I was definitely not anticipating that.  I am not a fan of spicy foods and black pepper is about as spicy as I can handle.  This carried a little more spice to it than black pepper but not too much.  However, the spicy effect only lasted a few minutes from when you first start chewing it but did have me drinking my water quite frequently during that time.  I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the flavor.  It wasn&#x27;t horrible but it was still palatable.  I guess in a sense it did help ease my symptoms to an extent because it tricked my body into momentarily forgetting about my morning sickness and focusing on the flavoring of the gum.  I didn&#x27;t chew it for very long though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can see how this could be beneficial to people who are ginger fans and like spicy foods but for me personally I wasn&#x27;t a fan.  That&#x27;s not to say it wouldn&#x27;t work for others though!  So for those of you who have terrible nausea for whatever the reason may be it may be worth a shot.</li>
            <li> It tastes great,  and really helped with motion sickness.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd pregnancy and the nausea has been fierce this time. I will try almost anything for relief.  I think the gum does help a little. However, I am not a fan of the taste of ginger so I don&#x27;t chew it often. I do think the product is worth a try. I really don&#x27;t like crystalized ginger which I have purchased from Whole Foods during the last pregnancy.  The gum is easier for me to take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer Preggie Pop Drops more than anything else.  The candies seem to work for at least 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005AYE8UE Three Lollies Preggie Pop Drops Assorted for Morning Sickness Relief, 21 Count]]</li>
            <li> I keep this in the car for long trips if the kids or others gets queenly traveling. Handy to have in the glove boc</li>
