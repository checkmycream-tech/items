            <li>Very easy to apply...</li>
            <li>Now I can see it clearly and they are absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li>Great idea...just needs more technical work to be a great product.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll likely need to cut them to get the best utility out of them</li>
            <li>They help me to be able to read charts and instruments.  </li>
            <li>Love these for my safety glasses.</li>
            <li>I was able to put these in my sunglasses and now I&#x27;m all set.</li>
            <li>These interchangeable lenses allow me to be stylish AND able to read.</li>
            <li>I found that most optical companies do not want to make reading glasses for you if you did not buy the frames from them or have no prescription.  </li>
            <li>Love these, put them on my sunglasses.</li>
            <li>I was able to see my bike computer again.</li>
            <li>Just OK.  </li>
            <li>I love these for my shades.  </li>
            <li>The flatter the lens is, the better they apply.</li>
            <li>I know have these on all of my favorite sun glasses.</li>
            <li>that I may be buying even more.</li>
            <li>I have applied these to several of mine and my wives diving masks to make reading our computer gauges easier, and they work great !</li>
            <li>This will soften the stick-on lenses and let them form better to your lenses.</li>
            <li>Perfect solution that allows you to use your favorite sunglasses with magnification when needed especially when driving and reading the dash pannel</li>
            <li>I can keep on my polarized sunglasses and I like them better than clip-on</li>
            <li>Great for older shooters.</li>
            <li>Once you get them to stick to your lens, they seem to work pretty good.</li>
            <li>They are easy to install and cheap!</li>
            <li>Easy to install</li>
            <li>Easybto apply and easy to peal off.</li>
            <li>EASY TO INSTALL.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
            <li>The soap helps adhesion but you can still peel these off and reposition them easily using soap each time.</li>
            <li>Once you have the glasses and lenses as warm as you can handle in hot water.</li>
            <li>Easy to trim to fit to attach to sunglasses</li>
            <li>Trim to fit was easy and they stay in place when cleaning the lenses.</li>
            <li>My sunglasses are oversized, so They would be perfect if they were a little wider.</li>
            <li>I think these are really fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I trimmed them to fit my Oakley sunglasses and stuck them on per the instructions and</li>
            <li>great item but air bubbles keep coming back</li>
            <li>Hydrotac has been a fantastic solution for my sunglassesand</li>
            <li>These were easily trimmed for a super &amp;#34;custom&amp;#34; fit on the sunglasses, and aren&#x27;t visible to anyone.  </li>
            <li>I first used a similar product when I was learning to fly to better see chart information.  </li>
            <li>These lenses are perfect for me because I found some large stylish glasses with plain lenses.  </li>
            <li>The sunglasses still look cool, and I can see instruments and read charts and checklists.  </li>
            <li>Pretty easy to install.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quick.  </li>
            <li>However, the clarity was great and they are easier to cut down than the 3M&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>For most glasses, using soap and hot water makes them really hold on well and not separate.</li>
            <li>and they do EXACTLY what they&#x27;re meant to do!</li>
            <li>so I could see the dashboard information more clearly as I was driving</li>
            <li>As a result, there was thin-film interference and/or air pockets that made these about as useful as greasy fingerprints at the bottom of the lens.</li>
            <li>I used this up toward the top of my shooting glasses on the lens of my dominant eye to clear up the front sight.  </li>
            <li>I quickly ordered a pair of bi-focal cycling sunglasses from Amazon - which is what I should have done in the first place.</li>
            <li>If I leave them at full size, however, it is very distracting.</li>
            <li>very clever!</li>
            <li>I may yet be able to use these effectively but it is hard to get the lens to stay in  place.  </li>
            <li>Clear and easy to install</li>
            <li>My first sets lasted eight years with no problems.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a lover of pretty sunglasses, but need readers.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>This was the first pair of stick-on readers I purchased.  </li>
            <li>I have another set I attached to shooting (safety) glasses, only at the top of the lens rather than the bottom.</li>
            <li>They keep falling off on hot days</li>
            <li>Then run them in hot water along with your glasses.</li>
            <li>Press out all the air bubbles and position them as low as you can without touching the edge of the lens.</li>
            <li>Also I was able to cut them down to fit.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t adhere well at all to a super clean lens, that was, ironically, just about exactly the same curvature.</li>
            <li>Works OK, but the tint of the sunglasses makes it hard to read, but it&#x27;s better than not have them.</li>
            <li>They have average clarity, and make it nice to use with sunglasses.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and work just as well as regular bifocal lenses.  </li>
            <li>These lenses are quite large and you may have to trim them to size.  </li>
            <li>fine initially-</li>
            <li>These work really well for converting my sunglasses into sunglass/readers.</li>
            <li>These really did the trick.</li>
            <li>really wanted these to work</li>
            <li>and it makes life so much easier with them.  </li>
            <li>It is so much easier tying on size</li>
            <li>The key is positioning them, pressing them in position with your thumb, and then wiping off the bifocals and trying them on to make sure they are correctly positioned and clear.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more for other sunglasses.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry about soapy spots on the rest of the lens, you can clean that off the next morning.</li>
            <li>[I subsequently bought a different brand, for a second pair of sunglasses, and have given them a better review, as I found them much easier to apply.]</li>
            <li>Doing that accurately so that the lens is the same size/shape for both left and right is not a trivial task, and getting the stick-on lenses to stick in exactly the right spot on both lenses of the glasses is hard to</li>
            <li>Also, the lenses are big enough that many users will want to trim them to a smaller size.  </li>
            <li>I have converted some fine vintage Ray Bans and Vaurnet glasses to readers with a few pairs of these.</li>
            <li>Getting them conformed to my glasses took several tries, but once you get them attached, they do work fine.</li>
            <li>Put them inside my Costa Del Mar sunglasses and can see clearly to tie fishing line to lures when needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are thicker than the cheaper brand, which makes them stiffer too, but they are crystal clear.  </li>
            <li>You must use a dab of clear silicone and a clamp to make them hold for diving conditions.</li>
            <li>If you cannot get it totally clear, peel off and try again.  </li>
            <li>They are clear and adhere to my sunglasses with no problems.</li>
            <li>Really enhances a pair of sunglasses by enabling it to double as a reader.  </li>
            <li>and it is the only way I have found so far to give me a clear picture of thevfront sight on my pistols.  </li>
            <li>Use a large pink pencil eraser to pad the clamp to avoid damage to the lens.</li>
            <li>BARELY VISIBLE ON SUNGLASSES.  </li>
            <li>The trick is to trim them using sharp scissors or a straight edge and an Xacto blade.</li>
            <li>I actually had this wild idea to develop something like these and then during my research I actually found out that they already existed.</li>
            <li>Left overnight, they will dry clear and adhered.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I think these are really fantastic.  You&#x27;ll likely need to cut them to get the best utility out of them but I have purchased 3 sets of these.  I used them on nonprescription sunglasses in an airplane.  They help me to be able to read charts and instruments.  If I leave them at full size, however, it is very distracting.</li>
            <li> Did not work on my glasses</li>
            <li> Love these for my safety glasses.</li>
            <li> Not sticking to my goggles/mask. Too difficult to find right place. Had to go with OTG goggles and prescription mask.</li>
            <li> These work really well for converting my sunglasses into sunglass/readers. Easy to install and they stay put on the lenses.</li>
            <li> These really did the trick. I need bifocals for my bike riding glasses. I was able to put these in my sunglasses and now I&#x27;m all set. Also I was able to cut them down to fit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a big fan these stick on Bifocals for over ten years. My first sets lasted eight years with no problems. I have them on all of my sunglasses.</li>
            <li> I love these things!  I&#x27;m a lover of pretty sunglasses, but need readers. These interchangeable lenses allow me to be stylish AND able to read. Be patient when applying.</li>
            <li> These lenses are perfect for me because I found some large stylish glasses with plain lenses.  I found that most optical companies do not want to make reading glasses for you if you did not buy the frames from them or have no prescription.  These lenses may not be for you if you use smallish frames or have a need to trim them.</li>
            <li> A little hard to get stuck, but then works really well.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.  Really enhances a pair of sunglasses by enabling it to double as a reader.  Easybto apply and easy to peal off.</li>
            <li> Love these, put them on my sunglasses.</li>
            <li> I would imagine these &amp;#34;might&amp;#34; work for some people but I&#x27;m not one of them. The plastic is very thick and is not prone to bending easily even on the relatively shallow arc of eyeglasses. Also, they would not adhere to the plastic lenses of my sunglasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted these to work so I could see the dashboard information more clearly as I was driving but they just wouldn&#x27;t stay on the sunglasses. Very disappointed but I thought I would take a chance trying them. A waste of money but, I suppose, if they did work, they would be a great buy. However, realize that if you purchase them, they might not work for you either.</li>
            <li> This was the first pair of stick-on readers I purchased.  Getting them conformed to my glasses took several tries, but once you get them attached, they do work fine. [I subsequently bought a different brand, for a second pair of sunglasses, and have given them a better review, as I found them much easier to apply.]</li>
            <li> very clever! works well.</li>
            <li> works great. iuse on my shooting glasses and it is the only way I have found so far to give me a clear picture of thevfront sight on my pistols.  Great for older shooters.</li>
            <li> Genius! Very easy to apply... and they do EXACTLY what they&#x27;re meant to do!</li>
            <li> They are a good idea that didn&#x27;t work out for my needs.</li>
            <li> I have converted some fine vintage Ray Bans and Vaurnet glasses to readers with a few pairs of these. They are easy to install and cheap! They make useable glasses from ones that would still be in the back of my glove box.</li>
            <li> I bought prescription sunglasses for driving, only to find I couldn&#x27;t read nearby objects like the GPS, Radio or Odometer. The Hydrotac stick-on bifocals work perfectly, nearly as good as prescription bifocals. I have another set I attached to shooting (safety) glasses, only at the top of the lens rather than the bottom. It&#x27;s tough getting old, but these help a lot when you need to see well at arms length or less.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get them to stick to my Ray Ban sunglasses.</li>
            <li> I may yet be able to use these effectively but it is hard to get the lens to stay in  place.  Also, the lenses are big enough that many users will want to trim them to a smaller size.  Doing that accurately so that the lens is the same size/shape for both left and right is not a trivial task, and getting the stick-on lenses to stick in exactly the right spot on both lenses of the glasses is hard to do.&lt;br /&gt;I know people who have used these successfully but personally I cannot recommend buying them.</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to get the lenses in the correct spot, but they have stayed put ever since (one month).  The optics are as good as reading glasses.  My lenses are glass, so all the reviews which mention the lenses not sticking may be from customers with plastic lenses.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for something like this for quite some time. Didn&#x27;t even know it existed until someone recommended it. It works great.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t adhere well at all to a super clean lens, that was, ironically, just about exactly the same curvature. As a result, there was thin-film interference and/or air pockets that made these about as useful as greasy fingerprints at the bottom of the lens.</li>
            <li> Could not make them work so I sent them back</li>
            <li> Simply put these work.  Put them inside my Costa Del Mar sunglasses and can see clearly to tie fishing line to lures when needed.&lt;br /&gt;These work great.  Just ordered a second pair.  Well Done….put this invention up there with GPS.</li>
            <li> I order up my prescription glasses without bifocals so I can use the stick on ones instead. I get the bifocal effect plus the vision correction too going this route. regular bifocals lenses do not add in the prescription aspect when looking through the bifocal lens.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I actually had this wild idea to develop something like these and then during my research I actually found out that they already existed. I am 48 years old, an avid cyclist and runner whom is unable to read his cycling computer/heat rate monitor.  These were easy to install and work perfectly. I trimmed them to fit my Oakley sunglasses and stuck them on per the instructions and the have been on ever since. I will be purchasing more for other sunglasses.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for bicycling. Followed directions given by the manufacturer, and installed these on my cycling sunglasses. Worked fine initially- I was able to see my bike computer again. I used these for two rides, then one of the bi-focal lenses fell off somewhere, and of course was impossible to find. I quickly ordered a pair of bi-focal cycling sunglasses from Amazon - which is what I should have done in the first place.</li>
            <li> thicker than expected, but works well.</li>
            <li> I got these to convert sunglasses to readers.  Better than getting ugly &amp;#34;sun readers&amp;#34;. I can place these lenses at the best place for focusing on print/digital media.  Great for the patio!</li>
            <li> they are too small and they will not stay on</li>
            <li> Just OK.  Hard to cut if you need to adjust</li>
            <li> Reallly hard to manage and get placed straight onto the lenses</li>
            <li> Does not stick on plastic safe-T glasses.</li>
            <li> Arrived quick.  Sticks to the inside of my snorkeling mask.  Time will tell if they stay there or not.</li>
            <li> They were great.  Easy to trim to fit to attach to sunglasses and it makes life so much easier with them.  I will use them again.</li>
            <li> Once you get them to stick to your lens, they seem to work pretty good. They have average clarity, and make it nice to use with sunglasses. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d want them to use for reading a book or anything where you&#x27;d be reading for any length of time. I use them for fishing so I don&#x27;t have to keep removing my sunglasses and using my reader glasses. I did have to trim about an 1/8&amp;#34; on each piece to lower where the bifocal started.</li>
            <li> I first used a similar product when I was learning to fly to better see chart information.  Now years later, I have started wearing contacts again but I need reading glasses for items up close.  These allow me to use my regular sunglasses in the car and still see information on my phone or a map.</li>
            <li> Applied these to my shooting glasses. I couldn&#x27;t get them to stick to the plastic lenses until I switched from applying them with water to using denatured marine stove alcohol. That did the trick!</li>
            <li> EASY TO INSTALL.  BARELY VISIBLE ON SUNGLASSES.  AS GOOD AS MY PERSCRIPTION GLASSES!</li>
            <li> I used this up toward the top of my shooting glasses on the lens of my dominant eye to clear up the front sight.  Did the job wonderfully, give it a try.  I&#x27;m sure you will be happy.</li>
            <li> Great lenses.  Installed on my beloved Ray-Ban&#x27;s for when I fly wearing contacts.  SInce the contacts are optimized for distance vision, I can&#x27;t read a thing in the cockpit without bifocals.  These were easily trimmed for a super &amp;#34;custom&amp;#34; fit on the sunglasses, and aren&#x27;t visible to anyone.  The sunglasses still look cool, and I can see instruments and read charts and checklists.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I was actually looking for 1.75 and you didn&#x27;t have it</li>
            <li> Since I had cataract surgery, I know longer need bifocals.  These interchangeable lens are great!!!  I bought some &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; glasses like are used in the movies, etc. for very little money.  Popped in my Hydrotac Stick-on Bifocal Lens and I have accomplished the same thing as a pair of $600.00 prescription glasses for just a few dollars.</li>
            <li> on time, as described.  I love these for my shades.  The flatter the lens is, the better they apply.</li>
            <li> Had to return for a refund.  Came off the next day.</li>
            <li> My third pair of stick-on bifocals. I know have these on all of my favorite sun glasses.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a trick to make them stick. This is the second pair I&#x27;ve purchased, and these too fell off. I ordered a weaker strength hoping they would be a little thinner and maybe stick this time, but nope, fell of my sunglasses immediately.</li>
            <li> they work in a pinch, but not great</li>
            <li> Too hard to keep from falling off.</li>
            <li> These lenses are quite large and you may have to trim them to size.  Pretty easy to install.  They are thicker than the cheaper brand, which makes them stiffer too, but they are crystal clear.  I bought three pair and use them in my shooting glasses, motorcycle glasses, and sun glasses.  Even though they have a curve to them, because they are stiff they may want to flatten out if the glasses lens is too curved, but it&#x27;s a minor concern.  They haven&#x27;t fallen off.  I like them enough that I may be buying even more.</li>
            <li> great item but air bubbles keep coming back</li>
            <li> Works OK, but the tint of the sunglasses makes it hard to read, but it&#x27;s better than not have them.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and work just as well as regular bifocal lenses.  Trim to fit was easy and they stay in place when cleaning the lenses.</li>
            <li> I have applied these to several of mine and my wives diving masks to make reading our computer gauges easier, and they work great ! You must use a dab of clear silicone and a clamp to make them hold for diving conditions. But in 2 years I have not had one fail. Use a large pink pencil eraser to pad the clamp to avoid damage to the lens.</li>
            <li> Hydrotac has been a fantastic solution for my sunglassesand it&#x27;s really easy to use. It has helped me a lot and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> They keep falling off on hot days</li>
            <li> Killer vision. The trick is to trim them using sharp scissors or a straight edge and an Xacto blade. Then run them in hot water along with your glasses. This will soften the stick-on lenses and let them form better to your lenses. Once you have the glasses and lenses as warm as you can handle in hot water. Take a small drop of dish soap and rub it on the glasses (both lenses) and then apply the bifocals on the soapy surface. Press out all the air bubbles and position them as low as you can without touching the edge of the lens. Try them on and adjust as necessary. You may have to widen or narrow them to get them in the correct position, depending on your interocular distance.  The soap will help adhesion -just like the soap in model airplane decals helps them stay attached. Left overnight, they will dry clear and adhered. If you missed a bubble, press it out. If you cannot get it totally clear, peel off and try again.  The key is positioning them, pressing them in position with your thumb, and then wiping off the bifocals and trying them on to make sure they are correctly positioned and clear. Don&#x27;t worry about soapy spots on the rest of the lens, you can clean that off the next morning. The soap helps adhesion but you can still peel these off and reposition them easily using soap each time. Depending on the curvature of your glasses, these may slowly start to let go and they may require a re-do. For most glasses, using soap and hot water makes them really hold on well and not separate.</li>
            <li> Works well with my Sunglasses.  My sunglasses are oversized, so They would be perfect if they were a little wider.</li>
            <li> Perfect solution that allows you to use your favorite sunglasses with magnification when needed especially when driving and reading the dash pannel</li>
            <li> I use them for fly fishing.  It is so much easier tying on size 20-24 flies.  I can keep on my polarized sunglasses and I like them better than clip-on&#x27;s.  I have used 3M Stick-on&#x27;s in the past.  These do work but are thicker.  The extra thickness makes them more difficult to stick on the glasses.  However, the clarity was great and they are easier to cut down than the 3M&#x27;s.  Added benefit: I made two pair by cutting them down.  Also, cutting them down keeps them lower in the field of vision so they don&#x27;t interfere with wading.</li>
            <li> Good product. Clear and easy to install</li>
            <li> I was having problems reading my Garmin cycling computer. Now I can see it clearly and they are absolutely perfect. They are clear and adhere to my sunglasses with no problems. The only thing is that they are a slightly too big for me so I cut them down as suggested. Now they are perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using these on my Google Glass to add reader functionality.</li>
            <li> worked satisfactorily on inner surface of the lens of dive goggles that were used as eye protection during spraying caustic solution.</li>
            <li> good but don&#x27;t stay on real good</li>
            <li> Hydrotac, the name is misleading as adding water to this extremely stiff plastic did nothing to help with adhesion to the lens of the sunglasses. Great idea...just needs more technical work to be a great product. Lens were too big for my glasses, did not stay put on the glasses. In a word, &amp;#34;disappointing.&amp;#34;</li>
