            <li>This is my favorite blush.  </li>

            <li>I love the color of this blush.  </li>
            <li>This was a better price than what I could get in the store.</li>
            <li>Classic CoverGirl blush - works great.  </li>
            <li>great natural color for every day</li>
            <li>It is a good product at a reasonable price and the hypo allergenic formulas are just what I need.</li>
            <li>beautiful color, works with all different</li>
            <li>I hope that they always have this one available online at such a great price.</li>
            <li>It works great especially for the cost!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great color.</li>
            <li>i love it very much.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted but couldn&#x27;t find in stores!</li>
            <li>so it looks more natural.</li>
            <li>The only improvement would be to make the lid a bit more secure.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and the brush is not completely unusable like many drugstore brushes.</li>
            <li>A great neutral shade that has a glow-y sheen to it that is usually reserved for higher end blushes.</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY other colors and brands (even high end stuff) but this is still my favorite one.</li>
            <li>it is my first blush.</li>
            <li>I think I just picked a color that wasn&#x27;t exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really pretty.</li>
            <li>Great price, this size will last me a long time.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I have is the brush doesn&#x27;t fit well in the slot and some of the bristles on the brush get bent or kind of crushed.</li>
            <li>Got it super fast and it looks so natural on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this since high school probably!</li>
            <li>Case has held up and protected the product through much banging about and dropping in floor.</li>
            <li>and it goes very well with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Has a slight shimmer to it which I love</li>
            <li>Classic blush from Covergirl.  </li>
            <li>If you are going for a more natural look, you can just use less, for a more dramatic look, use more.  </li>
            <li>It gives my cheeks a very natural looking glow - not all made-up or gooey creamy.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly the same as what I&#x27;ve been butting at the stores for years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not to dark or to light</li>
            <li>I like this color as it is very soft and natural, if applied correctly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t apply it with the cheap little brush they provide</li>
            <li>pretty sophisticated color without being too dramatic.  </li>
            <li>Color - Soft Mink</li>
            <li>/&gt;Did not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I am a natural brunette with lt./med.</li>
            <li>I have been using Cover Girl makeup since I was 15 years old - 45 years ago.</li>
            <li>I have had a couple of the blush compacts to come loose and not click back into place properly afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I really like the blush.</li>
            <li>but it makes my face look strange, like there is a soft glitter all over it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my favorite blush.  Please do not discontinue.</li>
            <li> Classic blush from Covergirl.  I was ordering as a replacement and the shade is still the same as always.</li>
            <li> My favorite, go to color.  Cheaper on Amazon than going to the store.</li>
            <li> I did not like this. I got this for myself. If I liked the kind of blush that looks glittery then it would be okay but it makes my face look strange, like there is a soft glitter all over it.</li>
            <li> it is my first blush. i love it very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this forever, and it is the best I&#x27;ve ever found.  I gave it 4 stars, because I&#x27;m still hoping to find a color between this and darker one someday.  I&#x27;ve used this since high school probably!</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. A great neutral shade that has a glow-y sheen to it that is usually reserved for higher end blushes. If you&#x27;re looking for a blush without any shimmer, go with one of the cover girl cheekers varieties. Goes on smoothly and the brush is not completely unusable like many drugstore brushes. Color - Soft Mink</li>
            <li> Great color for me! Works great and applies easily and smoothly. It works great especially for the cost! The only problem I have is the brush doesn&#x27;t fit well in the slot and some of the bristles on the brush get bent or kind of crushed.</li>
            <li> I would appreciate if it was just a bit richer in color, but I have had not issues with it otherwise.  I think I just picked a color that wasn&#x27;t exactly what I wanted.  It is a fairly pale pink - not as pale as the baby pink that little girls get as &amp;#34;first make up&amp;#34; but not much darker.&lt;br /&gt;Did not irritate my sensitive skin.  Case has held up and protected the product through much banging about and dropping in floor.</li>
            <li> I am a mac cosmetic concealer/foundation user however I love this blush and it wears well with it, also a fraction of the price and I find it to be very similar to Mac blush, it&#x27;s really pretty. I don&#x27;t apply it with the cheap little brush they provide I use a contoured blush brush to apply.</li>
            <li> My favorite blush ever!!!  Have used for many years.  Happy to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is exactly the same as what I&#x27;ve been butting at the stores for years. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase and saved a lot of money so will continue to buy it here in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand of blush for 30 years. Still the best I have found. Has a nice shimmer to it without glittery sparkle. Wears well, not too pink. Best price too.</li>
            <li> I love this color. I have olive skin and it goes very well with my skin tone. Has a slight shimmer to it which I love and it is not overly red or pink so it looks more natural. I have tried MANY other colors and brands (even high end stuff) but this is still my favorite one.</li>
            <li> Since I work in town I hate shopping now with my free shipping,  I don&#x27;t have to fight the crowds just order on line.&lt;br /&gt;This Has always been my favorite blush!</li>
            <li> beautiful color, works with all different make up looks.  will buy again.  pretty sophisticated color without being too dramatic.  thanks</li>
            <li> This is my favorite color and brand of blush. I hope that they always have this one available online at such a great price.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years.  The only objection is the blush container gets smaller every couple of years,  Same price for smaller amount</li>
            <li> This is a color I could not find in the store.  Received quickly, great price, and just what I wanted.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> great natural color for every day</li>
            <li> I have been using this Cover Girl blush - in this same color for at least 18 years.  It gives my cheeks a very natural looking glow - not all made-up or gooey creamy.  I am a natural brunette with lt./med. skin tone (and slightly olive) so #590 is perfect for me!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly - love this blush!</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE blush.  My mother, grandmother, sister-in-law and mother-in-law all uses this same color blush.  It&#x27;s one of those that matches just about all skin tones and it&#x27;s not too bright.  If you are going for a more natural look, you can just use less, for a more dramatic look, use more.  It&#x27;s such a great color.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted but couldn&#x27;t find in stores!</li>

            <li> Got it super fast and it looks so natural on my face. Thank you :)</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says.  The blush was cheaper than the grocery store, and i didn&#x27;t even have to leave the house to get it!</li>
            <li> Classic CoverGirl blush - works great.  I like a bit darker blush color but this is great and I use it every day!</li>
            <li> Wife was very pleased and as the rest of the story goes &amp;#34; if she is pleased I too am VERY pleased &amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It is extremely dark once you place it on your skin</li>
            <li> I love the color of this blush.  It&#x27;s not to dark or to light and it has a nice shimmer to add a glow.  I think this will be my only color from now on.</li>
            <li> I have been using Cover Girl makeup since I was 15 years old - 45 years ago. It is a good product at a reasonable price and the hypo allergenic formulas are just what I need. This was a better price than what I could get in the store.</li>
