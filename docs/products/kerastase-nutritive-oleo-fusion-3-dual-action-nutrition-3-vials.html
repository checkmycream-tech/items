            <li>I will buy more</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product from a hairdresser originally and was thrilled to find it at Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to apply at home too.</li>
            <li>I strongly believe that this product will help my hair.</li>
            <li>I first had this treatment used on my hair in a salon, and it was kind of a miracle product.</li>
            <li>I used a light conditioner after.</li>
            <li>Great deep conditioning as well as treatment .</li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING and really helps to stregthen and condition the hair.</li>
            <li>Very effective and totally addicting!</li>
            <li>but its worth it!</li>
            <li>I also found I do not need the whole bottle for one treatment which makes it an even better value.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is starting to hit issues of middle-age: dries out more easily, color fades into gray, and it is thinner than it used to be.</li>
            <li>This is a new product for my family, but so glad to discover it on-line.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real McCoy!!  </li>
            <li>Hair is super soft, holds color shine and becomes more tamed after color processing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, I thought it made my hair more dry.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the invesment.  </li>
            <li>But from 3 doses, one was kind of open and was leaking inside...</li>
            <li>I am not a professional but the results for me were fantastic, my hair was shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a deep conditioning treatment that takes 5 minutes and it leaves my fine (but plentiful) hair smooth and sleek.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in years, my ends aren&#x27;t split, my hair does &#x27;t break</li>
            <li>If you have time put your hair in a hot towel or go in a sauna for 15 min</li>
            <li>I was skeptical but my hair turned out wonderfully.</li>
            <li>The bottles were not sealed and it wasn&#x27;t as good as the last time I ordered&lt;br /&gt;from a different company.  </li>
            <li>This fusio-dose seems to me like is the bottle, but someone took maybe 1/20 of the actual kerastase stuff and mixed it with something else, so the smell is right, but it is kind of like putting water in your hair with the essence of the real thing.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>if you want to really give your hair an intense treatment, this is the product.  </li>
            <li>As a swimmer I look for everything that can help my hair and this product really helps restore some of the damage from the pool.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and she said these were basically water, not the real product.  </li>
            <li>She has been using kerastase for years and this product was too watery and did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>i even don t kknow if inside is the real product or color water</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Otherwise just apply as a conditioner your hair will be light and shine for a week (not much longer).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I know my hair stay really shine and soft with it...</li>
            <li>I have been with Kerastase products for over 10 years and this had absolutely nothing to do with the product I get at a salon - do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s normal...</li>
            <li>Just by one time use you can see the result from your hair, chicago&#x27;s weather is horriable in winter, my hair became extrmely dry even I use the rich conditioner, but this little bottle, just need to add some water to mix and use the spary to your hair, you really will see the reulst after first time use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The salon charges $35 a treatment, although it is worth it, they spray it on and rinse off, so it feels so quick,, whereas when I use the aquaoleum, I let it sit on on there for at least 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>The serum left my hair soft, manageable and my hair felt really conditioned&lt;br /&gt;without</li>
            <li>it will leave your hair soft, manageable and shiny.  </li>
            <li>and so far is</li>
            <li>Definitely not the real thing.</li>
            <li>You can really noticed the different on your hair after using this produtc, speacially for who has damaged hair..</li>
            <li>I have natural kinky but not tight curls.</li>
            <li>My hair stayed very shiny, smoother, and kept its color much longer than usual.</li>
            <li>It really makes the different in your hair and dont need to wait long to rinse.</li>
            <li>only problem is its take effect when you spary, and you have to let the magic water stay on hair at least ten mintues.</li>

            <li> A must have for any post processing shampoo. I usually apply this after hair color. Wash the color off. Do not use conditioner. Apply the treatment. Put a shower cap or a resizable plastic hair cap and leave it on as long as possible. After that, Wash and condition as usual. I can still smell the product about 10 shampoos after. Hair is super soft, holds color shine and becomes more tamed after color processing. I have natural kinky but not tight curls. Medium to dark Mediterranean hair type, very long length. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  It&#x27;s cheaper than going to the hair salon.  My hair feels soft and healthy.  I only apply once a month!</li>
            <li> The best for my hair!!!</li>
            <li> I applied a vial -I recommend purchasing the spray pump - to washed and towel dried hair.&lt;br /&gt;The product literally disappears into the hair. I worked it through and left it on around 10&lt;br /&gt;minutes. I used a light conditioner after. The serum left my hair soft, manageable and my hair felt really conditioned&lt;br /&gt;without feeling weighed down. I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is starting to hit issues of middle-age: dries out more easily, color fades into gray, and it is thinner than it used to be. I first had this treatment used on my hair in a salon, and it was kind of a miracle product. My hair stayed very shiny, smoother, and kept its color much longer than usual. The price tag was off-putting in the salon, though: $30 for one treatment (vial) combined with one booster cap. They charge around $100 for a &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; of 3 of these plus one salon treatment. So getting three of them for this price is definitely a deal. I do one every 2-3 weeks at home in the winter.</li>
            <li> This product was perfect to my hair, I love it !!! Keratin was applied onto my hair and it was a little damaged. I strongly believe that this product will help my hair.</li>
            <li> These are amazing hair treatments.  it will leave your hair soft, manageable and shiny.  It is worth the invesment.  This product line always puts out there the most innovating and effective products.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I was paying $25 dollars for this treatment every 3 to 4 months.  Now that I can purchase it myself from Amazon I can treat my hair every couple of weeks in the comfort of my own home with out it costing me a fortune. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good,good,good and a awesome price !!! Happy I  will order again !!</li>
            <li> I am  not sure this is the real deal.  The bottles were not sealed and it wasn&#x27;t as good as the last time I ordered&lt;br /&gt;from a different company.  It didn&#x27;t make my hair shiny like before</li>
            <li> love these things! I would get them once in a while at the salon, but they were like $45 for each treatment and my hair stylist would only leave them on for 15 minutes. What a rip off!  I Have naturally brown hair but was bleach blonde for about a year and a half, bleaching my hair every 4 weeks caused serious damage. I used every &amp;#34;deep treatment&amp;#34; conditioning you could buy at the drugstore, nothing came close to these things! For the first time in years, my ends aren&#x27;t split, my hair does &#x27;t break and it&#x27;s actually growing! A couple tips, for mediam hair, use 1/2 the bottle, and it&#x27;s totallly okay to sleep in and rinse in the morning-great results. I use this 3-4 times a week.</li>
            <li> I have loved all their products I just wish this one came with the spray top to keep the integrity if the product and how it&#x27;s applied. I have always said its like Botox for your hair... Very effective and totally addicting!</li>
            <li> I used to pay $25 a treatment plus tip at my salon for this. $30 some dollars for 3 treatments is a steal. It&#x27;s so easy to apply at home too. Leaves my color treated hair soft and shiny but not weighed down.</li>
            <li> I have managed salons for years and you can&#x27;t beat this product. For the price on amazon you can&#x27;t go wrong. This stuff really works. My wife loves it!</li>
            <li> really good for hair with highlights</li>
            <li> My wite uses this product for 5 years and loves it.</li>
            <li> It is a amazing treatment</li>
            <li> Hair seemed dryer after the treatment</li>
            <li> Very good! If you have time put your hair in a hot towel or go in a sauna for 15 min the results are much better this way. Otherwise just apply as a conditioner your hair will be light and shine for a week (not much longer).&lt;br /&gt;I use iron all the time so I have to use this product once a week to recover my hair and so far is the best.&lt;br /&gt;It is just expensive but works.</li>
            <li> if you want to really give your hair an intense treatment, this is the product.  I love how my hair feels when it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li> No the same strength that the one at beauty salon must be a knock off was like any inexpensive conditioner.</li>
            <li> have used for over 5 years at salon and now i can do it myself at home for much less money</li>
            <li> Great. Everyone should use on occassion</li>
            <li> This kit usually comes with a spray bottle attachment and 4 refills, this did not but the product seemed authentic.</li>
            <li> One dose can be used in 3 different time. It really makes the different in your hair and dont need to wait long to rinse.</li>
            <li> Great deep conditioning as well as treatment .</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. It&#x27;s like a deep conditioning treatment that takes 5 minutes and it leaves my fine (but plentiful) hair smooth and sleek.  It doesn&#x27;t take away body, just fly aways.  I use this every month!</li>
            <li> This product transforms dryness. Mixed with the Kerastase-Ciment this will repair and transform your hair.</li>
            <li> I am sad!:(...&lt;br /&gt;I always used this product, never got it here.&lt;br /&gt;My complain is not about the fusio-dose, cause I know my hair stay really shine and soft with it... But from 3 doses, one was kind of open and was leaking inside...what made a little mess....-ok, this happens&amp;#34; :(.  But what made me really sad is that one of the doses was COMPLETALY different from the others (from the other 2 that were clear&amp;#34;/translucide) this one came almost white! I am used to buy this product and I never saw like this... N no, this &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; one does not smell like the others...... I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s normal...if it&#x27;s bad.... I know I&#x27;m not using it!&lt;br /&gt;So from 3 doses, I can use 1 n 1/2! :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, I thought it made my hair more dry. Maybe another kind would be better. I know pixelist works</li>
            <li> As a swimmer I look for everything that can help my hair and this product really helps restore some of the damage from the pool.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have my hair dresser use this once a month. Can get expensive  Thought I would save some money and do it my self. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same product. Would not order again</li>
            <li> I was impressed. As many have said, I was paying a lot of money for these treatments at the salon. I was skeptical but my hair turned out wonderfully. I am not a professional but the results for me were fantastic, my hair was shiny and healthy. I also found I do not need the whole bottle for one treatment which makes it an even better value. I have already purchased more and boosters.</li>
            <li> Just had a chance to put the product on my head and, scared to say, I have no idea what I just did to my hair, could have been baldness inducing serum, I would never know. I have been with Kerastase products for over 10 years and this had absolutely nothing to do with the product I get at a salon - do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Kersatase hs the best treatments and this one offers moisture and shine!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from a hairdresser originally and was thrilled to find it at Amazon. Very happy with the product and price as well!</li>
            <li> Wonderful conditioning treatment!</li>
            <li> Definitely not the real thing. I always buy the kerastase nutritive aquaoleum but this is getting harder to buy. The salon charges $35 a treatment, although it is worth it, they spray it on and rinse off, so it feels so quick,, whereas when I use the aquaoleum, I let it sit on on there for at least 5 minutes. This fusio-dose seems to me like is the bottle, but someone took maybe 1/20 of the actual kerastase stuff and mixed it with something else, so the smell is right, but it is kind of like putting water in your hair with the essence of the real thing. Bummer!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, and the purchase and shipping went well!</li>
            <li> My here loves it, I use  twice month, works great ..</li>
            <li> Hair was extremely dried out from a color process left on too long.  This product has helped. I applied 1/2 of the container after shampoo and conditioner, left on 15 minutes, rinsed out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real McCoy!!  Awesome product.  My hair feels like silk!  You need to purchase the sprayer that comes separate.  You will love it. , Also, always check your packaging.  I have received poor imitations on some Keratase products that were packaged terribly.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Two of the ítems were empty. Had to return the order.</li>
            <li> This product combine with the booster gives may repairs my hair and give it an amazing shine.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels like it changes the texture of your hair - leaves it shiny and manageable. Use it once a week</li>
            <li> Best hair conditioner EVER!</li>
            <li> I pay $25 to get this put on my hair at the salon. Can do it at home for much less.  I alternate between the orange and the green for the healthiest hair.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this stuff. It is a miracle for your hair.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with ths product when I had a treatment done at a salon.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, so I can do it myself!!</li>
            <li> My fav. at all times.</li>
            <li> you will spend triple the price for these treatments in the salon. Do it yourself and save $$$. So good for your hair and looks silky smooth healthy afterwards. I will buy more</li>
            <li> You can really noticed the different on your hair after using this produtc, speacially for who has damaged hair.. i love this product.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING and really helps to stregthen and condition the hair.</li>
            <li> Took these into my hair dresser and she said these were basically water, not the real product.  She has been using kerastase for years and this product was too watery and did absolutely nothing.  Recommend not to buy.</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff</li>
            <li> i got this product from Trace Cosmetics they sent without any instruction the vitals was opened i even don t kknow if inside is the real product or color water i m not goanna use and i m not goanna order agine</li>
            <li> This is a new product for my family, but so glad to discover it on-line.  It does wonders for coarse, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Just by one time use you can see the result from your hair, chicago&#x27;s weather is horriable in winter, my hair became extrmely dry even I use the rich conditioner, but this little bottle, just need to add some water to mix and use the spary to your hair, you really will see the reulst after first time use.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is its take effect when you spary, and you have to let the magic water stay on hair at least ten mintues. but its worth it!</li>
