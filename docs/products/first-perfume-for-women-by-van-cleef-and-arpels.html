            <li>very satisfied with this</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the product, delivery time, and condition of the order when it was received.  </li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant floral smell, not too strong or overwhelming, yet still noticable.  </li>
            <li>The florals are blended wonderfully, but First is also an aldehyde.</li>
            <li>However, it arrived safely!  </li>
            <li>However, the drydown is quite pleasant once the aldehydes and florals pass, wearing more like a woody on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This company&#x27;s product was new, in excellent condition, gift wrapped as requested; it was gorgeous and it was delivered as promised.</li>

            <li>This sent is very strong and overpowering.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best smelling perfume I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite scent, but really nice for a change.  </li>
            <li>The service I receive from the vendor is great - shipped right away and never a problem.  </li>
            <li>Too strong !</li>
            <li>If I apply very lightly, it disappears.  </li>
            <li>She has been using this product for more than 5 years.</li>
            <li>It arrived earlier than scheduled, in perfect conditions.</li>

            <li>I find the price and accessibility on amazon fantastic!</li>
            <li>This is one of my all time favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, l-o-v-e it.  </li>
            <li>What can I say - I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Just as lovely a scent as the perfume.</li>
            <li>Smells great but fades away fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this fragrance for more than 20 years.  </li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I use to use this perfume many years ago and is no longer at department stores, my sister now wears it</li>
            <li>so glad to be able to still get it.</li>
            <li>Love that I can get it anytime from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the product as well as with the delivery.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I just love it</li>
            <li>It is a pleasure to order my favorite scent at a rice I can afford.</li>
            <li>It is a floral with spicy undertones, suitable for the office, not too strong, but lasts well.</li>
            <li>When it was no longer available at my favorite stores, I thought I had lost out on yet another one of my favorite scents (I was a teenager in love with Tuxedo)</li>
            <li>The scent is great, however, it fades quickly, so even though it was a good price, ultimately, it is no bargain.</li>
            <li>Glad to see it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched up before and used Dior&#x27;s Tendre Poison (which I like a lot), also Jean Patou&#x27;s Joy (lovely), but I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li>Have been using this fragrance and receiving compliments for over 20 years, its lasts most of the day and always provides its clean distinctive fragrance....</li>
            <li>It is strong and smells musky.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the EdT designation put you off - this is strong stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful scent for the traditional woman.</li>
            <li>I have been using First for over 15 years and  has become one of my top two favorite perfumes ever since.</li>
            <li>It was great locating the larger bottles for a grat price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal!!!</li>
            <li>However, the scent on my bottle was quite light, not what my original smelled like.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s high praise since I have many of the top fragrances on hand.</li>
            <li>But the return and refund we super easy</li>
            <li>What a delight to find my favorite fragrance through Amazon, and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I normally wear philosophy amazing grace.  </li>
            <li>I started wearing First many years ago.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique, unlike the majority of fragrances out today.  </li>
            <li>Love my First, I was at the</li>
            <li>First by VCA is a very rich and opulent fragrance created in the mid-1970s.</li>
            <li>This is my Mom&#x27;s favorite perfume, and I buy the large size for her every year.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I didn&#x27;t like the product, but it was a gift to my sister, and she really loved it.</li>
            <li>Good for a romantic night out.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it and that was back in 1987.</li>
            <li>This is more for older ladies.</li>
            <li>Product super.</li>
            <li>Love this fragance since I was a girl is quiet elegant, fresh and a longlast</li>
            <li>My wife has used it for many years and never loses its richness.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, with all the positive things going for this fragrance, it&#x27;s just not my style and seems too pleasant, too proper, and too dated for wearing in this century.</li>
            <li>but thanks to speciality distributors like this one and Amazon.com, I am once again enjoying the fragrance of First.</li>
            <li>This has the greatest scent, and I am always complimented on it, but it doesn&#x27;t last long so you need to reapply it.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s exactly what I do!</li>
            <li>Love the classic fragrance of First.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making this Van Cleef and Arpels available.</li>
            <li>and she was kind enough to let me know its name.  </li>
            <li>My order arrived when expected, but just fairly well protected from sliding around within the box.  </li>
            <li>Also, I happen to be very fond of FIRST and could not find it in the duty free shops for quite a number of years now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product itself, in this particular bottle, is a good price for the amount you get and it lasts a LONG time.</li>
            <li>First is a scent I have used for 30 years now.</li>
            <li>I have been using First for decades.  </li>
            <li>First wore it in &#x27;79</li>
            <li>I chose the three items because as a bundle it supposedly gave me a better total price.  </li>
            <li>It arrived just in time for my wife&#x27;s birthday exactly as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was a gift; I learned about it from a woman I believe I was married to.</li>
            <li>This was my first order with Amazon.com  </li>
            <li>I would recommend that a person who is interested in wasting their money on this item smell it first.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this item several times and I have always been pleased.  </li>
            <li>My sister mum and I have loved this perfume for years.it is not easily available in stores.</li>
            <li>First has such a feminine, sweet aroma!</li>
            <li>I was expecting a pretty fragrance due to the high reviews; however, I found this to be very strong and musky.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying from the department store.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Give me a scent from real perfume houses or real designers.</li>
            <li>Prior to my purchase I checked the department stores and while traveling also checked the duty free stores in the airport.  </li>
            <li>The tiny size is great because you only need to dab it on your wrists rather than spray (and potentially get too much).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my original scent that my family identified with me, especially my grandchildren.  </li>
            <li>the essence was very old, not the real smell of perfume is appreciated</li>
            <li>Elegant scent and long lasting.</li>
            <li>The package arrived when expected, and the packaging while minimal, was effective in protecting the product.</li>
            <li>This is a very classy, understated, fragrance.  </li>
            <li>place First into the same camp and Chanel</li>
            <li>If you like Chanel 5, I think you&#x27;re likely to like First and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In both cases the prices for the exact same item were higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one purchased from Amazon came in the exact same bottle, it contained the exact same 3.3 ounces and used exact same spray system.  </li>
            <li>The seller sent me a different eaux de toilette, I bought  First by Van Cleef &amp; Arpels 3.3 oz</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too overpowering and always makes me feel feminine and classy.  </li>
            <li>Not an old lady floral or a cheapy floral.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s brought back so much memories.</li>
            <li>not heavy</li>
            <li>Not the old fragrance that I knew.</li>
            <li>I have an EdT made in France marked 76% alcohol, which is a concentration that is more typically associated with strong EdPs or weak parfums.</li>
            <li>This perfume is very hard to find, glad I checked online.</li>

            <li> /&gt;However, with all the positive things going for this fragrance, it&#x27;s just not my style and seems too pleasant, too proper, and too dated for wearing in this century.</li>
            <li> but thanks to speciality distributors like this one and Amazon.com, I am once again enjoying the fragrance of First.</li>
            <li> This has the greatest scent, and I am always complimented on it, but it doesn&#x27;t last long so you need to reapply it.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s exactly what I do!</li>
            <li> Love the classic fragrance of First.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making this Van Cleef and Arpels available.</li>
            <li> and she was kind enough to let me know its name.  </li>
            <li> My order arrived when expected, but just fairly well protected from sliding around within the box.  </li>
            <li> Also, I happen to be very fond of FIRST and could not find it in the duty free shops for quite a number of years now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product itself, in this particular bottle, is a good price for the amount you get and it lasts a LONG time.</li>
            <li> First is a scent I have used for 30 years now.</li>
            <li> I have been using First for decades.  </li>
            <li> First wore it in &#x27;79</li>
            <li> I chose the three items because as a bundle it supposedly gave me a better total price.  </li>
            <li> It arrived just in time for my wife&#x27;s birthday exactly as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a gift; I learned about it from a woman I believe I was married to.</li>
            <li> This was my first order with Amazon.com  </li>
            <li> I would recommend that a person who is interested in wasting their money on this item smell it first.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this item several times and I have always been pleased.  </li>
            <li> My sister mum and I have loved this perfume for years.it is not easily available in stores.</li>
            <li> First has such a feminine, sweet aroma!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a pretty fragrance due to the high reviews; however, I found this to be very strong and musky.  </li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying from the department store.</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Give me a scent from real perfume houses or real designers.</li>
            <li> Prior to my purchase I checked the department stores and while traveling also checked the duty free stores in the airport.  </li>
            <li> The tiny size is great because you only need to dab it on your wrists rather than spray (and potentially get too much).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my original scent that my family identified with me, especially my grandchildren.  </li>
            <li> the essence was very old, not the real smell of perfume is appreciated</li>
            <li> Elegant scent and long lasting.</li>
            <li> The package arrived when expected, and the packaging while minimal, was effective in protecting the product.</li>
            <li> This is a very classy, understated, fragrance.  </li>
            <li> place First into the same camp and Chanel</li>
            <li> If you like Chanel 5, I think you&#x27;re likely to like First and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In both cases the prices for the exact same item were higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one purchased from Amazon came in the exact same bottle, it contained the exact same 3.3 ounces and used exact same spray system.  </li>
            <li> The seller sent me a different eaux de toilette, I bought  First by Van Cleef &amp; Arpels 3.3 oz</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too overpowering and always makes me feel feminine and classy.  </li>
            <li> Not an old lady floral or a cheapy floral.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s brought back so much memories.</li>
            <li> not heavy</li>
            <li> Not the old fragrance that I knew.</li>
            <li> I have an EdT made in France marked 76% alcohol, which is a concentration that is more typically associated with strong EdPs or weak parfums.</li>
            <li> This perfume is very hard to find, glad I checked online.</li>
            <li> I was worried that it would be a fake or bad version of First because the price was so good, but it is high quality and smells just like it should.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume for a long time.</li>
            <li> She says the bottle lasts her about that long.  </li>
            <li> However, I still had to pay singly for each item.</li>
            <li> This is a classic EDT, one that is difficult to find and considerably more expensive at Harrods or Saks 5th Ave, typically in the $75 range.</li>
            <li> Same as buying it at Perfumania half price!</li>
            <li> /&gt;For an EdT, this is extremely well done and long-lasting.</li>
            <li> Brings back memories of our past days together.  </li>
            <li> I discovered this fragrance several years ago and it used to be hard to find.</li>
            <li> the color was so dark.</li>
            <li> Living in a rural area, I am unable to purchase locally.</li>
            <li> I did not complain since I was on a tight schedule having to return to Canada,  </li>
            <li> some perfumes (manY) give me terrible headaches...</li>
            <li> I was nostalgic for it and surprised that only the very expensive (NM, B-G) stores sell it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very subtle floral.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed the fragrance smelled old</li>
            <li> my wife has been using it for at least 20 years, loves it!!</li>
            <li> She was afraid it would be fake</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I stayed very frustrated because It&#x27;s supposed to be my mother &#x27;s 94 anniversary.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this fragrance as a gift for my mother.  She absolutely loves it.  It has been one of her favorites for years.  I let her put the rating on it.</li>
            <li> This is more for older ladies. I bought it thinking it would smell good. It is strong and smells musky. Reminds me of that perfume Charlie. I ended up giving it to my mom she is 63 and loves it.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the same fragrance from 1986...Too strong !</li>
            <li> Personally, I didn&#x27;t like the product, but it was a gift to my sister, and she really loved it. She has been using this product for more than 5 years. It arrived earlier than scheduled, in perfect conditions.</li>
            <li> A delightful perfume with a unique fragrance that creates a nice aura around the user.</li>
            <li> First is a scent I have used for 30 years now. It&#x27;s a beautiful scent for the traditional woman. I will always keep it in stock.</li>
            <li> First by VCA is a very rich and opulent fragrance created in the mid-1970s. The florals are blended wonderfully, but First is also an aldehyde. That aldehyde aspect is very prominent in the opening, and it&#x27;s not to my liking. However, the drydown is quite pleasant once the aldehydes and florals pass, wearing more like a woody on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an EdT, this is extremely well done and long-lasting. I have an EdT made in France marked 76% alcohol, which is a concentration that is more typically associated with strong EdPs or weak parfums. Don&#x27;t let the EdT designation put you off - this is strong stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d place First into the same camp and Chanel no 5.  If you like Chanel 5, I think you&#x27;re likely to like First and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with all the positive things going for this fragrance, it&#x27;s just not my style and seems too pleasant, too proper, and too dated for wearing in this century.</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume for a long time. Love love love the scent!!!!!!!!! Will continue to use. Day time or evening. It is perfect for me. My husband agrees!!!!!</li>
            <li> My mom has loved this product for many years, and glad to see that they haven&#x27;t changed. Overall packaging and delivery makes this an all-time gift, even for recipients whose location may require packing this on extended flights.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, have been using for years.  Glad to see it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is my mother&#x27;s FAVORITE perfume.. she couldn&#x27;t find it any where!! OMG will she be pleased Christmas day when she get this.. the price is good and shipping was quick!! Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend said he really liked this scent; I foolishly bought it without trying it.  Too strong for me.  If I apply very lightly, it disappears.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best smelling perfume I&#x27;ve ever had.  It has a very pleasant floral smell, not too strong or overwhelming, yet still noticable.  Good for a romantic night out.  Defintely recommend it.  The price is very good too. Much cheaper than buying from the department store.</li>
            <li> I started wearing First many years ago.  I received it as a gift, I believe, from my father.  I love the softness of the fragrance. It&#x27;s not too overpowering and always makes me feel feminine and classy.  When it was no longer available at my favorite stores, I thought I had lost out on yet another one of my favorite scents (I was a teenager in love with Tuxedo) but thanks to speciality distributors like this one and Amazon.com, I am once again enjoying the fragrance of First.</li>
            <li> Love this fragance since I was a girl is quiet elegant, fresh and a longlast I recommend it for day and night use</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  Always refreshing to smell that scent.  Brings back memories of our past days together.  We have had 50 plus years. Thanks for making this Van Cleef and Arpels available.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mom and she absolutely loves it. She was afraid it would be fake but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s the real deal!!!</li>
            <li> Great service, fast delivery. Best price online that  I could find. This perfume is very hard to find, glad I checked online.</li>
            <li> not a problem with packaging and/or delivery.  Product super. thanks</li>
            <li> Love this and gave one as a gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn &amp;#34;First&amp;#34; ever since it came out.  Was happy to find it on-line at a great price.  The package arrived when expected, and the packaging while minimal, was effective in protecting the product.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with this</li>
            <li> When friends need to borrow a scent from me they always choose this one. That&#x27;s high praise since I have many of the top fragrances on hand.</li>
            <li> the essence was very old, not the real smell of perfume is appreciated</li>
            <li> I have been using First for decades.  It was great locating the larger bottles for a grat price.  Very happy with Amazon.</li>
            <li> My sister mum and I have loved this perfume for years.it is not easily available in stores.I find the price and accessibility on amazon fantastic!</li>
            <li> This is a very classy, understated, fragrance.  Not tacky, it doesn&#x27;t enter a room before you or leave 3 days after you&#x27;ve left.  It&#x27;s a very subtle floral.  Not an old lady floral or a cheapy floral.  It&#x27;s unique, unlike the majority of fragrances out today.  First wore it in &#x27;79 &amp; I continue today.</li>
            <li> First has such a feminine, sweet aroma! I smelled this scent on someone else at a party and she was kind enough to let me know its name.  That was it! I have been using First for over 15 years and  has become one of my top two favorite perfumes ever since.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery as promised.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite scent, but really nice for a change.  Long lasting.</li>
            <li> Applause, applause, that you can buy this, on Amazon Prime.  The price was well discounted compared to what the pricey department stores showed on their websites. They also showed: out of stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a beautiful vibrantly sexy scent. I was nostalgic for it and surprised that only the very expensive (NM, B-G) stores sell it. I don&#x27;t want to wear scents of current pop stars or actresses. Give me a scent from real perfume houses or real designers. Classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to start wearing this again.</li>
            <li> I chose the three items because as a bundle it supposedly gave me a better total price.  However, I still had to pay singly for each item. I did not complain since I was on a tight schedule having to return to Canada,  Also, I happen to be very fond of FIRST and could not find it in the duty free shops for quite a number of years now.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I would also have purchased a wireless printer from you if time had allowed.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of chanel #5. cannot tell the difference and it lasts and sets a nice mood also. Very classical!</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite perfume. However, the scent on my bottle was quite light, not what my original smelled like.</li>
            <li> It was as represented.</li>
            <li> The scent is great, however, it fades quickly, so even though it was a good price, ultimately, it is no bargain. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was worried that it would be a fake or bad version of First because the price was so good, but it is high quality and smells just like it should.  Love this perfume.  The scent is beautiful throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Same as buying it at Perfumania half price!</li>
            <li> my wife has been using it for at least 20 years, loves it!!</li>
            <li> Very nice!  One of the best smelling perfumes I have smelled in a while</li>
            <li> If you like Chanel no 5 you will like this one!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife for her birthday.  Prior to my purchase I checked the department stores and while traveling also checked the duty free stores in the airport.  In both cases the prices for the exact same item were higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one purchased from Amazon came in the exact same bottle, it contained the exact same 3.3 ounces and used exact same spray system.  It arrived just in time for my wife&#x27;s birthday exactly as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my purchase and recommend it to anyone to anyone looking for this item</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, l-o-v-e it.  What can I say - I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Great delivery and service. The product hasn&#x27;t changed. The scent is still the same as when my mom use to wear it when I 5. It&#x27;s brought back so much memories.</li>
            <li> This was a gift; I learned about it from a woman I believe I was married to. It&#x27;s become the #1 perfume of the woman I gave it to.</li>
            <li> happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this fragrance for years and it&#x27;s still my favorite. I&#x27;ve switched up before and used Dior&#x27;s Tendre Poison (which I like a lot), also Jean Patou&#x27;s Joy (lovely), but I always come back to this one. It&#x27;s wearable any time of the year and that&#x27;s exactly what I do!</li>
            <li> Awesome fragrance ! Came on time</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter  and she loved it.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. My wife has used it for many years and never loses its richness. I recomend it.</li>
            <li> muy buen producto lleg&amp;oacute; sin problemas y sin defectos, el empaque fue apropiado y no tenia problemas visibles, en lo personal lo recomiento 100%</li>
            <li> Just as lovely a scent as the perfume. Although now I wish I had reordered the perfume because the scent lasts longer.</li>
            <li> This is my Mom&#x27;s favorite perfume, and I buy the large size for her every year.  She says the bottle lasts her about that long.  I can&#x27;t seem to find it in any of my local stores, so I always order it through Amazon.com.  They always have the best price.  The service I receive from the vendor is great - shipped right away and never a problem.  Thank you Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> Smells great but fades away fast. You need to reapply it throughout the day. If you don&#x27;t mind doing so, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this fragrance for more than 20 years.  It does not have the same lasting aroma.  It evaporates within the hour.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> I gambled that I would like it and I was delighted with the product.  I will buy it again and even for a gift.</li>
            <li> signature fragrance. love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I ordered \\&quot;First\\&quot; by Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, the 3.3 ounce spray bottle.  This was my first order with Amazon.com  I was very pleased with the product, delivery time, and condition of the order when it was received.  I would consider ordering this product again.  Unfortunately I am unable to obtain this product in the state that I reside, so I am pleased that I have this website to order this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I use to use this perfume many years ago and is no longer at department stores, my sister now wears it therefore i gave it to her for her birthday</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my original scent that my family identified with me, especially my grandchildren.  so glad to be able to still get it. some perfumes (manY) give me terrible headaches...</li>
            <li> even my mountain man husband LOVES THIS!  LOL!  BUT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD GREAT TASTE IF YOU DO TOO............ TRY IT!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed the fragrance smelled old the color was so dark.</li>
            <li> The seller sent me a different eaux de toilette, I bought  First by Van Cleef &amp; Arpels 3.3 oz and he sent me instead &amp;#34;Homme &amp;#34; 2,2 oz. . I stayed very frustrated because It&#x27;s supposed to be my mother &#x27;s 94 anniversary. I&#x27;ve got the refund but that didn&#x27;t repair at all mine  and my mother frustration.</li>
            <li> Love the classic fragrance of First. I think of Audrey Hepburn when I wear it or someone that loves to wear cashmere.</li>
            <li> This has the greatest scent, and I am always complimented on it, but it doesn&#x27;t last long so you need to reapply it. The product itself, in this particular bottle, is a good price for the amount you get and it lasts a LONG time. I would recommend this size for at home and then the tiny size for your purse. The tiny size is great because you only need to dab it on your wrists rather than spray (and potentially get too much).</li>
            <li> Item arrived timely. I was expecting a pretty fragrance due to the high reviews; however, I found this to be very strong and musky.  I normally wear philosophy amazing grace.  This sent is very strong and overpowering.  I would recommend that a person who is interested in wasting their money on this item smell it first.  There is a reason I could not find this in stores.</li>
            <li> I discovered this fragrance several years ago and it used to be hard to find. Love that I can get it anytime from Amazon. It is a floral with spicy undertones, suitable for the office, not too strong, but lasts well.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to &amp;#34;First&amp;#34; during a visit to the island of Aruba. Living in a rural area, I am unable to purchase locally. What a delight to find my favorite fragrance through Amazon, and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Love my First, I was at the and they were spraying the on and I loved it and that was back in 1987. Its just wonderful.</li>
            <li> Have been using this fragrance and receiving compliments for over 20 years, its lasts most of the day and always provides its clean distinctive fragrance....</li>
            <li> This is a classic EDT, one that is difficult to find and considerably more expensive at Harrods or Saks 5th Ave, typically in the $75 range. Elegant scent and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item several times and I have always been pleased.  I am satisfied with the product as well as with the delivery.</li>
            <li> This company&#x27;s product was new, in excellent condition, gift wrapped as requested; it was gorgeous and it was delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> I have used this scent all my life.  I love it and so does everyone else.  not heavy and I just love it</li>
            <li> My order arrived when expected, but just fairly well protected from sliding around within the box.  However, it arrived safely!  It is a pleasure to order my favorite scent at a rice I can afford.</li>
            <li> returned it. Not the old fragrance that I knew. But the return and refund we super easy</li>
    </ol>
