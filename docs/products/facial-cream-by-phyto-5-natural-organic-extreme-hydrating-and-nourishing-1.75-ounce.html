            <li>in Switzerland, where so many of the best skincare lines originate.</li>
            <li>I honestly couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!  </li>
            <li>It is pleasant without being overbearing.</li>

            <li>in all I would recommend this product to people who are happy to pay for an effective and luxurious cream.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and yummy (must be the vanilla and berries) -- very pleasant.</li>
            <li>Both my wife and I love this cream!</li>
            <li>, a lot of the ingredients are very good and natural, and I think it is great that 11.4% come from organic farming.  </li>
            <li>The immediate result is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>and I do think it works nicely.  </li>
            <li>is does give your skin a nice youthful “glow” (moisture).  </li>
            <li>, it’s a nice product.  </li>
            <li>It lasts all day, and feels nice.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if they could compromise a bit on the packaging to bring the price</li>
            <li>It had kind of  a &amp;#</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s scented but has a light pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>It has a light, pleasant citrus scent, and it goes on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Love it and how it makes my skin look nice.</li>
            <li>But at this price, to see the first ingredient as water…..eh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>It was a nice cream, went on easily &amp; didn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice cream that helps to plump up your skin and thus reduces dryness and fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>and I think hydrate my skin much better.</li>
            <li>Lacking a degree in chemistry or biology, I can&#x27;t comment on the individual ingredients, but the result is impressive.</li>
            <li>My wife found that within a couple of weeks her skin was feeling more hydrated and she got compliments are looking more &#x27;rested&#x27; and &#x27;radiant&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I could do without the safety tab on the cap, as well, but I suppose if you are buying this off the shelf, you would want to be sure it had not been opened.</li>
            <li>No surprise then that this face cream delivered both of those many times over.</li>
            <li>the slightest bit of perspiration sits on top and feel clammy and</li>
            <li>Okay, kidding about the last, but this seems to be a very good product which does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>This is easily the thickest, creamiest, most dense skin cream I have ever encountered.</li>
            <li>She reports that is is easy to apply, not greasy, and is already making her skin feel better.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s organic because it&#x27;s important to understand what your putting on you body.</li>
            <li>I look like I&#x27;ve gotten a full night&#x27;s sleep!</li>
            <li>I also love that I can feel good about using it since it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>But so far I feel very impressed with the visible results though the very dense property does take some getting used to.</li>
            <li>Makeup flows easily over this, like a dream.  </li>
            <li>It eliminates fine lines and smooths out deeper lines.</li>
            <li>This product was fantastic.</li>
            <li>SPF factor which is something important to me in a lotion</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin rosy, smooth, and youthful in appearance.  </li>
            <li>It has a light scent and rubs in leaving no greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even without makeup, my face looked fresh and more hydrated, dewy even, without being shiny or greasy.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and am fairly picky about what I use on it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She’s always trying to find nice natural creams that she can wear during the day under her makeup and many are either too greasy or makeup curdles with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>wife’s skin is usually very sensitive, but she said this did not irritate her skin at all and the overall quality was excellent.</li>
            <li>The Phyto brand, however, was one that she had never tried before, so she was excited to get her hands on it, and get it on her cheeks.</li>
            <li>That said, I think that this is priced out of the realm of what most people would be willing to spend.</li>
            <li>For that price it needs to be something special, and I don&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li>, it is free of hot listed ingredients like parabens, and is GMO free.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells good enough to eat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a believer in good skin care, especially on my face, neck and chest (no one likes crinkly cleavage).</li>
            <li>*, avena sativa (oat) kernal extract*, anhydroxylitol, citrus dulcis (sweet orange) oil*, benzyl alcohol, xylitol, vaccinium vitis idaea (lingonberry) seed oil</li>
            <li>good, solid product that anecdotal evidence shows that works.</li>
            <li>kind of surprised</li>
            <li>Look at the product photo and where you see the words &amp;#34;EXTREME CREAM&amp;#34; is where the full line matches up when none is yet used.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating but sits on top on skin too, so</li>
            <li>This cream does such a good job of hydrating, that there’s no need to use a separate under eye cream at night.</li>
            <li>My skin feels more smooth and I am being mistaken for a 19 year old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice gentle touch of fragrance, not too much and not too</li>
            <li>If you want to skip reading the whole review below:  This product is very high quality, actually does show results by moisturizing the skin, and has very good ingredients.  </li>
            <li>they have been certified by Ecocert, one of the largest organic certification organizations in the world, and the very first certification body to develop standards for &amp;#34;natural and organic cosmetics&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of use, it does seem to have a marked effect on plumping the skin and giving it a healthy full appearance.</li>
            <li>a germ-a-phobe, my first thought was &#x27;Oh no!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice smooth cream that is light yet creamy and once worked into your skin and dried</li>
            <li>However, after using it for more than a month, I couldn&#x27;t really see that it had made much difference, if any.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line for me is that it simply isn&#x27;t worth the expense.  </li>
            <li>A thin layer seems to work best, and once applied</li>
            <li>So this &amp;#34;Phyto 5 Natural Face Cream&amp;#34; is her latest weapon against time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you apply it, it is absorbed by your skin and does not leave a residue on your hands.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and creamy, very moisturizing and smells very nice like citrus and spice without being overwhelming in the slightest.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very rich cream and a little really does go a long way and it feels wonderful</li>
            <li>The label lists one of the ingredients as “arctic berries”, which if some other internet sources are true, is a kind of “super fruit” with an assortment of health benefits and uses.</li>
            <li>She said the design of this tube was particularly innovative--she had more control over how much of the product she wanted, without squirting it all over her hand and wasting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cream is really rich and it hydrates very well.  </li>
            <li>Although expensive, I find that I do not have to use all that much in order to get full coverage on my face, so while still high priced, it is fairly cost effective.</li>
            <li>I want facial cream that will not make my skin more oily and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is now one of my favorite facial products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did discover that it is a mistake to use more than a tiny amount of the Phyto 5 or it leaves a whitish film that I dissipated by spreading the cream over my neck and collarbone.  </li>
            <li>You can tell from the second you apply this moisturizer, that this is a top of the line luxury product.  </li>
            <li>This cream feels as though it might be greasy when you first put it on, but it soon soaks in and dries non greasy.</li>
            <li>Leaves you skin feeling really, really smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>like the simple and elegant packaging.</li>
            <li>So far so good, I haven&#x27;t been using this for long</li>
            <li>Obviously one knows what to do with a face cream, but it’s always nice to have guidance on the packaging for a new product, like how much to use, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how well and quickly it absorbs into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of facial creams and this felt light when applied, has a nice scent and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry after I wash my face anymore!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ingredients include: Organic Lingonberry Seed Oil, Organic Jojoba Oil, Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Aloe Vera, Aquaxyl, Natural Vitamin E, Organic Oat Extract, Organic Ginger Oil, Organic Sweet Orange Oil, Vanilla Extract.</li>
            <li>Many of the small fine lines around my eyes and lips immediately were hydrated and disappeared.  </li>
            <li>gave this one a huge thumbs up, and a space towards the front of her cluttered table (the stuff she doesn&#x27;t like never gets removed, just scooted towards the back for emergencies).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not have instructions on how much to apply.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>(ie, you get some lotion film on your face if you use too much).  </li>
            <li>We both prefer creams that go on very light.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although this product moisturized my skin very well, it also made me break out.  </li>
            <li>Really dries my hands out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, I really like  the ingredients in this moisturizer</li>
            <li>which is always greatly appreciated.  </li>
            <li>- it really hydrates your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She really wants her beauty products to give her a regiment to follow; when to apply at what time of the day, how much and how often, etc ...</li>
            <li>incase I had put on too much, but each time it felt filmy.</li>
            <li>The dry vs hydrated feeling is purely subjective; others may love the soft, not moist effect.  </li>
            <li>When I asked her what made this one good, she rattled off the usual list of natural ingredients that can be found in almost every product.</li>
            <li>My wife and I, however, based on her experience, both believe that if you have tried other facial creams and were less than satisfied, this might be a good option to try instead.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although Japan and South Korea have come to dominate the high-end cosmetics market, she was excited to see this is made in Switzerland, hinting at both Germanic high quality and French luxury.</li>
            <li>It smells like cake batter or frosting, but it&#x27;s not over-powering, it&#x27;s very subtle and very nice.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s dressing table is an alchemists lair, with more mysterious potions and tinctures than I could possibly describe.</li>
            <li>My wife was pleased to see that this was in a tube that’s easy to regulate how much you squeeze out, and she likes to cut open the tube when it’s nearly empty and scrape out the remainder so as not to waste any precious anti-aging potential.  </li>
            <li>Made in the Swiss foothills and with natural essential oils rich in vitamins, minerals and plant extracts.  </li>
            <li>Here in Arizona the sun is tough on skin, so a good skin cream is a must.  </li>
            <li>That alone is a great feature of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it smells faintly like cake.  </li>
            <li>I was encouraged when a coworker mentioned the healthy appearance of my skin a few days ago.</li>
            <li>However, she always seems to have space to try something new.</li>
            <li>Just a dab small enough to sit on the tip of my index finger massaged in very nicely and later that day</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this formula does not bother my skin at all.</li>
            <li>with all these kinds of cosmetics and creams, personal preference, skin type, hygiene, and many other factors will affect how this works for you and whether you like it or not.</li>
            <li>The product comes in a tiny tube, only 1 3/4 oz, and for the very high cost ($68 or $39 an ounce) I expected better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It’s a moisturizer; it’s not going to make old skin suddenly new again or heal scars…</li>
            <li>In other words, shake the container so that the liquid falls down toward the cap, and then look at it in the light to see how full the container is - that&#x27;s what I did for the submitted photo.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel extremely soft and supple.</li>
            <li>All fears of applying it to my sensitive skin evaporated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>*, parfum (natural origin fragrance), tocopherol, xanthan gum, dehydroacetic acid, vanilla tahitenis extract, zingiber officinale (ginger)</li>
            <li>I applied literally a tiny dab onto each cheek and gently rubbed it into my face, beneath my eyes, etc.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face, neck, and hands feeling well moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>So far I give it highest ratings even considering it&#x27;s premium price.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t inexpensive, but you don&#x27;t need much to cover your face, so it will last a while.</li>
            <li>but so far I like it.</li>
            <li>I already have soft even skin though it is prone to a bit of break outs</li>
            <li>I am very particular with facial cream because my skin type is normal to oily, especially in summer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very dry skin on my face, so I think it would be wasted, but it left my hands feeling amazing.</li>
            <li>Primarily, it smells like frosting, but also a little like white sheet cake.  </li>
            <li>It has a subtle fragrance that is only strong enough to make you aware it is there, and the formula is decidedly non-greasy.</li>
            <li>Having used it for a while, I did find that it helped my face from not drying out, but I am not sure it is worth the high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if it worked this well on my hands, I can imagine what it would do for more delicate facial</li>
            <li>Despite that, it was easy to cover her entire face with just a small dab.</li>
            <li>It has a faint fragrance that&#x27;s pleasant, and goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>glides on, and skin instantly feels hydrated with a slight herbalish/botanical scent that quickly dissapates.</li>
            <li>I generally use lines like Boscia, Peter Thomas Roth, and Ole Henrickson.</li>
            <li>tube described earlier is 100% recycleable, no metal or conflicting plastics that make recycling near immpossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>This hydrating cream has a terrific scent and it works well, although my wife didn&#x27;t notice it working better than a few other brands she has used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>net a decent enough cream to help skin but pricey at current $68 for 1.75 ounces, a bit thicker cream than my preference, and no SPF which is my preference &#x3D;</li>
            <li>About the only thing that is unpleasant about this cream is the price, although it&#x27;s nice to know that if you do pay this much, you will get something that works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Kudos to the company for using a new type tube for this product that promises the ability to use every last drop of what you pay for without having to cut open the bottom of the tube and scoop out the last drops.  </li>
            <li>You only need a small amount each time for full coverage</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a fragrance that reminds me a bit of a combination of an orange creamsicle mixed with play-dough, which is kind of weird, and I found that the play-dough scent lasted.</li>
            <li>I usually prefer lighter creams that are absorbed quickly into the skin, usually needing to be reapplied later in the day.</li>
            <li>In fact, today, when I&#x27;m not wearing make-up, my face felt too dry, so I rubbed on some of the old stuff over the Phyto 5.  </li>
            <li>Truly,the 1.75 oz goes a long way, as you can spread a small dab around to get full coverage and also avoid feeling you are using a mask.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The cost is premium, though equal or less than other products, but the fact that so little is needed and at lest for me, one application is all that&#x27;s needed for the entire day, gives it more value.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> But so far I feel very impressed with the visible results though the very dense property does take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Makeup flows easily over this, like a dream.  </li>
            <li> It eliminates fine lines and smooths out deeper lines.</li>
            <li> This product was fantastic.</li>
            <li> SPF factor which is something important to me in a lotion</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin rosy, smooth, and youthful in appearance.  </li>
            <li> It has a light scent and rubs in leaving no greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even without makeup, my face looked fresh and more hydrated, dewy even, without being shiny or greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am fairly picky about what I use on it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She’s always trying to find nice natural creams that she can wear during the day under her makeup and many are either too greasy or makeup curdles with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> wife’s skin is usually very sensitive, but she said this did not irritate her skin at all and the overall quality was excellent.</li>
            <li> The Phyto brand, however, was one that she had never tried before, so she was excited to get her hands on it, and get it on her cheeks.</li>
            <li> That said, I think that this is priced out of the realm of what most people would be willing to spend.</li>
            <li> For that price it needs to be something special, and I don&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> , it is free of hot listed ingredients like parabens, and is GMO free.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good enough to eat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a believer in good skin care, especially on my face, neck and chest (no one likes crinkly cleavage).</li>
            <li> *, avena sativa (oat) kernal extract*, anhydroxylitol, citrus dulcis (sweet orange) oil*, benzyl alcohol, xylitol, vaccinium vitis idaea (lingonberry) seed oil</li>
            <li> good, solid product that anecdotal evidence shows that works.</li>
            <li> kind of surprised</li>
            <li> Look at the product photo and where you see the words &amp;#34;EXTREME CREAM&amp;#34; is where the full line matches up when none is yet used.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating but sits on top on skin too, so</li>
            <li> This cream does such a good job of hydrating, that there’s no need to use a separate under eye cream at night.</li>
            <li> My skin feels more smooth and I am being mistaken for a 19 year old.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a nice gentle touch of fragrance, not too much and not too</li>
            <li> If you want to skip reading the whole review below:  This product is very high quality, actually does show results by moisturizing the skin, and has very good ingredients.  </li>
            <li> they have been certified by Ecocert, one of the largest organic certification organizations in the world, and the very first certification body to develop standards for &amp;#34;natural and organic cosmetics&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of use, it does seem to have a marked effect on plumping the skin and giving it a healthy full appearance.</li>
            <li> a germ-a-phobe, my first thought was &#x27;Oh no!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice smooth cream that is light yet creamy and once worked into your skin and dried</li>
            <li> However, after using it for more than a month, I couldn&#x27;t really see that it had made much difference, if any.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line for me is that it simply isn&#x27;t worth the expense.  </li>
            <li> A thin layer seems to work best, and once applied</li>
            <li> So this &amp;#34;Phyto 5 Natural Face Cream&amp;#34; is her latest weapon against time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you apply it, it is absorbed by your skin and does not leave a residue on your hands.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy, very moisturizing and smells very nice like citrus and spice without being overwhelming in the slightest.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very rich cream and a little really does go a long way and it feels wonderful</li>
            <li> The label lists one of the ingredients as “arctic berries”, which if some other internet sources are true, is a kind of “super fruit” with an assortment of health benefits and uses.</li>
            <li> She said the design of this tube was particularly innovative--she had more control over how much of the product she wanted, without squirting it all over her hand and wasting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cream is really rich and it hydrates very well.  </li>
            <li> Although expensive, I find that I do not have to use all that much in order to get full coverage on my face, so while still high priced, it is fairly cost effective.</li>
            <li> I want facial cream that will not make my skin more oily and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is now one of my favorite facial products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did discover that it is a mistake to use more than a tiny amount of the Phyto 5 or it leaves a whitish film that I dissipated by spreading the cream over my neck and collarbone.  </li>
            <li> You can tell from the second you apply this moisturizer, that this is a top of the line luxury product.  </li>
            <li> This cream feels as though it might be greasy when you first put it on, but it soon soaks in and dries non greasy.</li>
            <li> Leaves you skin feeling really, really smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> like the simple and elegant packaging.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I haven&#x27;t been using this for long</li>
            <li> Obviously one knows what to do with a face cream, but it’s always nice to have guidance on the packaging for a new product, like how much to use, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how well and quickly it absorbs into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of facial creams and this felt light when applied, has a nice scent and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry after I wash my face anymore!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients include: Organic Lingonberry Seed Oil, Organic Jojoba Oil, Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Aloe Vera, Aquaxyl, Natural Vitamin E, Organic Oat Extract, Organic Ginger Oil, Organic Sweet Orange Oil, Vanilla Extract.</li>
            <li> Many of the small fine lines around my eyes and lips immediately were hydrated and disappeared.  </li>
            <li> gave this one a huge thumbs up, and a space towards the front of her cluttered table (the stuff she doesn&#x27;t like never gets removed, just scooted towards the back for emergencies).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not have instructions on how much to apply.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> (ie, you get some lotion film on your face if you use too much).  </li>
            <li> We both prefer creams that go on very light.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although this product moisturized my skin very well, it also made me break out.  </li>
            <li> Really dries my hands out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, I really like  the ingredients in this moisturizer</li>
            <li> which is always greatly appreciated.  </li>
            <li> - it really hydrates your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She really wants her beauty products to give her a regiment to follow; when to apply at what time of the day, how much and how often, etc ...</li>
            <li> incase I had put on too much, but each time it felt filmy.</li>
            <li> The dry vs hydrated feeling is purely subjective; others may love the soft, not moist effect.  </li>
            <li> When I asked her what made this one good, she rattled off the usual list of natural ingredients that can be found in almost every product.</li>
            <li> My wife and I, however, based on her experience, both believe that if you have tried other facial creams and were less than satisfied, this might be a good option to try instead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although Japan and South Korea have come to dominate the high-end cosmetics market, she was excited to see this is made in Switzerland, hinting at both Germanic high quality and French luxury.</li>
            <li> It smells like cake batter or frosting, but it&#x27;s not over-powering, it&#x27;s very subtle and very nice.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s dressing table is an alchemists lair, with more mysterious potions and tinctures than I could possibly describe.</li>
            <li> My wife was pleased to see that this was in a tube that’s easy to regulate how much you squeeze out, and she likes to cut open the tube when it’s nearly empty and scrape out the remainder so as not to waste any precious anti-aging potential.  </li>
            <li> Made in the Swiss foothills and with natural essential oils rich in vitamins, minerals and plant extracts.  </li>
            <li> Here in Arizona the sun is tough on skin, so a good skin cream is a must.  </li>
            <li> That alone is a great feature of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it smells faintly like cake.  </li>
            <li> I was encouraged when a coworker mentioned the healthy appearance of my skin a few days ago.</li>
            <li> However, she always seems to have space to try something new.</li>
            <li> Just a dab small enough to sit on the tip of my index finger massaged in very nicely and later that day</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this formula does not bother my skin at all.</li>
            <li> with all these kinds of cosmetics and creams, personal preference, skin type, hygiene, and many other factors will affect how this works for you and whether you like it or not.</li>
            <li> The product comes in a tiny tube, only 1 3/4 oz, and for the very high cost ($68 or $39 an ounce) I expected better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It’s a moisturizer; it’s not going to make old skin suddenly new again or heal scars…</li>
            <li> In other words, shake the container so that the liquid falls down toward the cap, and then look at it in the light to see how full the container is - that&#x27;s what I did for the submitted photo.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel extremely soft and supple.</li>
            <li> All fears of applying it to my sensitive skin evaporated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> *, parfum (natural origin fragrance), tocopherol, xanthan gum, dehydroacetic acid, vanilla tahitenis extract, zingiber officinale (ginger)</li>
            <li> I applied literally a tiny dab onto each cheek and gently rubbed it into my face, beneath my eyes, etc.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face, neck, and hands feeling well moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> So far I give it highest ratings even considering it&#x27;s premium price.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t inexpensive, but you don&#x27;t need much to cover your face, so it will last a while.</li>
            <li> but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> I already have soft even skin though it is prone to a bit of break outs</li>
            <li> I am very particular with facial cream because my skin type is normal to oily, especially in summer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very dry skin on my face, so I think it would be wasted, but it left my hands feeling amazing.</li>
            <li> Primarily, it smells like frosting, but also a little like white sheet cake.  </li>
            <li> It has a subtle fragrance that is only strong enough to make you aware it is there, and the formula is decidedly non-greasy.</li>
            <li> Having used it for a while, I did find that it helped my face from not drying out, but I am not sure it is worth the high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if it worked this well on my hands, I can imagine what it would do for more delicate facial</li>
            <li> Despite that, it was easy to cover her entire face with just a small dab.</li>
            <li> It has a faint fragrance that&#x27;s pleasant, and goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> glides on, and skin instantly feels hydrated with a slight herbalish/botanical scent that quickly dissapates.</li>
            <li> I generally use lines like Boscia, Peter Thomas Roth, and Ole Henrickson.</li>
            <li> tube described earlier is 100% recycleable, no metal or conflicting plastics that make recycling near immpossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li> This hydrating cream has a terrific scent and it works well, although my wife didn&#x27;t notice it working better than a few other brands she has used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> net a decent enough cream to help skin but pricey at current $68 for 1.75 ounces, a bit thicker cream than my preference, and no SPF which is my preference &#x3D;</li>
            <li> About the only thing that is unpleasant about this cream is the price, although it&#x27;s nice to know that if you do pay this much, you will get something that works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Kudos to the company for using a new type tube for this product that promises the ability to use every last drop of what you pay for without having to cut open the bottom of the tube and scoop out the last drops.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount each time for full coverage</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a fragrance that reminds me a bit of a combination of an orange creamsicle mixed with play-dough, which is kind of weird, and I found that the play-dough scent lasted.</li>
            <li> I usually prefer lighter creams that are absorbed quickly into the skin, usually needing to be reapplied later in the day.</li>
            <li> In fact, today, when I&#x27;m not wearing make-up, my face felt too dry, so I rubbed on some of the old stuff over the Phyto 5.  </li>
            <li> Truly,the 1.75 oz goes a long way, as you can spread a small dab around to get full coverage and also avoid feeling you are using a mask.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The cost is premium, though equal or less than other products, but the fact that so little is needed and at lest for me, one application is all that&#x27;s needed for the entire day, gives it more value.</li>
            <li> But the price is so, so high I feel like I can buy a bottle of Na-PCA and get the same results for much, much less cost.  </li>
            <li> BUT - my dried, starting to crack from the lime in the concrete - hands, were much smother and less like velcro.</li>
            <li> It goes on very silky, not greasy, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been outside for a few days, working with concrete.</li>
            <li> Given that it needs to be spread thinly for full absorption, it ended being designated a before bed routine.  </li>
            <li> I am highly sensitive to scents, and this is not setting me off at all, even though I have heightened issues at the moment due to other seasonal allergies and congestion which will not go away.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be checking out the other items in this brand.</li>
            <li> For myself, I found that it eased the dry patches on my face and reduced some of the wrinkle</li>
            <li> My face tends to dry out.</li>
            <li> packaging is sparse and contains limited information, and no directions on the bottle itself.</li>
            <li> Now a little goes a long way, and I do like it, but I cannot see the average person spending $70 a tube on this on a regular basis.age person spending $70 a tube on this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This is a thick moisturizing cream that goes on thick but soaks in quickly, leaving no greasy after-feel at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricy but as you need so little I think this tube will last for months.</li>
            <li> Phyto 5 Extreme Cream is intended for dry, needy skin.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, a little goes a LONG way... it doesn&#x27;t take too long before you realize how little you actually need to use.</li>
            <li> It was too heavy feeling for my taste, and I will go back to the Rhonda Allison cream that I prefer.</li>

            <li> This is extremely moisturizing for my very dry hands.</li>

            <li> This Photo 5 product does feel like it leaves a film and is not absorbed as readily, as other reviewers have mentioned as well, which requires not slathering it on as thickly as other products, which might be the cause of the problem.</li>

            <li> Waste of products because of packaging is an insult to consumers, so I hope the packaging delivers as promised.</li>
            <li> I used this Phyto5 Organic face cream a few times but it was just to &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; scented for me and made me feel like a girl.  </li>
            <li> So I tried a few dabs when I was done for the day.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it might have a higher oil/fat content which might clog pores and cause blemishes, but that hasn&#x27;t been the case in the least.  </li>
            <li> Refreshingly, it&#x27;s not oily or greasy.  </li>

            <li> I also like that has a subtle fruity fragrance that isn’t overpowering or too girly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Phyto 5 hydrating cream was a little disappointing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First I was skeptical with the ingredients: Jojoba oil, Citrus oil, Lingonberry seed oil, Ginger oil, Sunflower seed oil.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave an uncomfortable residue or oily feel, and it&#x27;s not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li> There is a faint floral fragrance that lasts.  </li>
            <li> On the downside, it is very expensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a very faint scent to it – nothing fragrant or artificial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My bad.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> price shocked me, but I&#x27;m a guy.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am getting good use out of this product. Although expensive, I find that I do not have to use all that much in order to get full coverage on my face, so while still high priced, it is fairly cost effective. I am highly sensitive to scents, and this is not setting me off at all, even though I have heightened issues at the moment due to other seasonal allergies and congestion which will not go away. My skin feels more smooth and I am being mistaken for a 19 year old. Okay, kidding about the last, but this seems to be a very good product which does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cream that helps to plump up your skin and thus reduces dryness and fine wrinkles. It comes inside of a box in a sealed tube that requires you to break the seal before using. This stuff smells good enough to eat. It smells like cake batter or frosting, but it&#x27;s not over-powering, it&#x27;s very subtle and very nice. It&#x27;s a nice smooth cream that is light yet creamy and once worked into your skin and dried, it doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel greasy or sticky. It makes your skin feel extremely soft and supple. It eliminates fine lines and smooths out deeper lines. I have very sensitive skin and this formula does not bother my skin at all. The only downside to this is that there are no instructions on how to use it neither on the box it is packaged in or the tube and I found that odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients include: Organic Lingonberry Seed Oil, Organic Jojoba Oil, Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Aloe Vera, Aquaxyl, Natural Vitamin E, Organic Oat Extract, Organic Ginger Oil, Organic Sweet Orange Oil, Vanilla Extract.</li>
            <li> I am very particular with facial cream because my skin type is normal to oily, especially in summer. I want facial cream that will not make my skin more oily and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I was skeptical with the ingredients: Jojoba oil, Citrus oil, Lingonberry seed oil, Ginger oil, Sunflower seed oil. Everything is oil. But to my surprise, it is not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice gentle touch of fragrance, not too much and not too little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not have instructions on how much to apply. For me, a pea-size is enough for face and neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a believer in good skin care, especially on my face, neck and chest (no one likes crinkly cleavage). This product is price pricey, but you get what you pay for.  It has a faint fragrance that&#x27;s pleasant, and goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve been using it in the warm spring days, so haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it out in cold weather.  From the way it feels, I can tell that it has a protective way.  I have the T zone going on, but no problems with oily skin or a shiny face, used with the rest of my makeup routine.  Made in the Swiss foothills and with natural essential oils rich in vitamins, minerals and plant extracts.  No chemicals to do who knows what to our systems.  Can be used for night or day, with or without makeup.  Love it and how it makes my skin look nice.</li>
            <li> What I liked:&lt;br /&gt;- You only need a small amount each time for full coverage&lt;br /&gt;- It smelled really good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;- It felt really heavy on my face, no matter the amount I put on.&lt;br /&gt;- Always felt greasy to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind a heavy cream, it does make your face feel softer. However, once on you can&#x27;t forget it is on. It was too heavy feeling for my taste, and I will go back to the Rhonda Allison cream that I prefer.</li>
            <li> This is now one of my favorite facial products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived after being banged around by the post office. The Phyto 5 box was a bit crumpled, and no longer sealed.&lt;br /&gt;As a germ-a-phobe, my first thought was &#x27;Oh no! What if it wasn&#x27;t the journey that unsealed it, but some mysterious person contaminating it?! What shall I do?!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I slid the tube out. The cap has a tamper-proof seal! Whew! All fears of applying it to my sensitive skin evaporated.&lt;br /&gt;It glides on, and skin instantly feels hydrated with a slight herbalish/botanical scent that quickly dissapates. After a few days skin is softer and not as tired looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More good news about this product, it is free of hot listed ingredients like parabens, and is GMO free. The formula incorporates the theory of the 5 elements of traditional Chinese medicine, wood, fire, earth, metal, and water.&lt;br /&gt;And they have been certified by Ecocert, one of the largest organic certification organizations in the world, and the very first certification body to develop standards for &amp;#34;natural and organic cosmetics&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;That tube described earlier is 100% recycleable, no metal or conflicting plastics that make recycling near immpossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in Switzerland, where so many of the best skincare lines originate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice. While I try not to put too much emphesis on cost, I don&#x27;t see a difference between this and much less expensive moisturizers/creams. This is more expensive per ounce than the most expensive perfume I have... For that price it needs to be something special, and I don&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> This product was fantastic. I have tried a lot of facial creams and this felt light when applied, has a nice scent and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry after I wash my face anymore! I also love that I can feel good about using it since it&#x27;s all natural. I will definitely be checking out the other items in this brand.</li>
            <li> The Phyto 5 hydrating cream was a little disappointing.  It was a nice cream, went on easily &amp; didn&#x27;t feel greasy.  However, after using it for more than a month, I couldn&#x27;t really see that it had made much difference, if any.  The product comes in a tiny tube, only 1 3/4 oz, and for the very high cost ($68 or $39 an ounce) I expected better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line for me is that it simply isn&#x27;t worth the expense.  I have other night creams that cost much less than this product and I think hydrate my skin much better.</li>
            <li> If you want to skip reading the whole review below:  This product is very high quality, actually does show results by moisturizing the skin, and has very good ingredients.  On the downside, it is very expensive.  It comes out to close to $40 an ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list is: Aqua (water), helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil*, octyldodecanol, glycerin (vegetal), cetyl alcohol, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) oil*, cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl wheat straw glycoside, xylitylglucoside, aloe barbadensis*, avena sativa (oat) kernal extract*, anhydroxylitol, citrus dulcis (sweet orange) oil*, benzyl alcohol, xylitol, vaccinium vitis idaea (lingonberry) seed oil*, parfum (natural origin fragrance), tocopherol, xanthan gum, dehydroacetic acid, vanilla tahitenis extract, zingiber officinale (ginger) oil*, sodium hydroxide, limonene, linalool, citral, geraniol, and anise alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, a lot of the ingredients are very good and natural, and I think it is great that 11.4% come from organic farming.  But at this price, to see the first ingredient as water…..eh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think it does a great job.  I applied literally a tiny dab onto each cheek and gently rubbed it into my face, beneath my eyes, etc.  Just a dab small enough to sit on the tip of my index finger massaged in very nicely and later that day I think my skin looked – and definitely felt – moisturized.  I’ve used it a couple of days now and I do think it works nicely.  It’s a moisturizer; it’s not going to make old skin suddenly new again or heal scars….but is does give your skin a nice youthful “glow” (moisture).  It does not add any greasy look or feel to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very faint scent to it – nothing fragrant or artificial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it’s a nice product.  But the price is so, so high I feel like I can buy a bottle of Na-PCA and get the same results for much, much less cost.  Now a little goes a long way, and I do like it, but I cannot see the average person spending $70 a tube on this on a regular basis.age person spending $70 a tube on this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This is a thick moisturizing cream that goes on thick but soaks in quickly, leaving no greasy after-feel at all. It leaves my face, neck, and hands feeling well moisturized and soft. This cream would be very soothing if you were suffering from the effects of harsh weather such as drying wind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a fragrance that reminds me a bit of a combination of an orange creamsicle mixed with play-dough, which is kind of weird, and I found that the play-dough scent lasted. It is not perfume-y, but it is definitely scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is sparse and contains limited information, and no directions on the bottle itself. It comes in a plain plastic squeeze bottle that looks very generic, containing 1-3/4 oz or 50 mL of cream, which is quite a small amount for the price.</li>
            <li> This is easily the thickest, creamiest, most dense skin cream I have ever encountered. Lacking a degree in chemistry or biology, I can&#x27;t comment on the individual ingredients, but the result is impressive. I usually prefer lighter creams that are absorbed quickly into the skin, usually needing to be reapplied later in the day. This Photo 5 product does feel like it leaves a film and is not absorbed as readily, as other reviewers have mentioned as well, which requires not slathering it on as thickly as other products, which might be the cause of the problem. A thin layer seems to work best, and once applied I don&#x27;t notice it&#x27;s presence.  After 3 weeks of use, it does seem to have a marked effect on plumping the skin and giving it a healthy full appearance. I was encouraged when a coworker mentioned the healthy appearance of my skin a few days ago. I was afraid it might have a higher oil/fat content which might clog pores and cause blemishes, but that hasn&#x27;t been the case in the least.  The cost is premium, though equal or less than other products, but the fact that so little is needed and at lest for me, one application is all that&#x27;s needed for the entire day, gives it more value. I&#x27;ve only used a fraction after 3 weeks and will revisit the review in a few months to update the results. But so far I feel very impressed with the visible results though the very dense property does take some getting used to. So far I give it highest ratings even considering it&#x27;s premium price.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for a few days now, and she likes it.  She reports that is is easy to apply, not greasy, and is already making her skin feel better.  We are in our 60&#x27;s, so our skin isn&#x27;t what it used to be.  Here in Arizona the sun is tough on skin, so a good skin cream is a must.  This isn&#x27;t inexpensive, but you don&#x27;t need much to cover your face, so it will last a while.</li>
            <li> This cream is really rich and it hydrates very well.  It has a light, pleasant citrus scent, and it goes on very smoothly.  It doesn&#x27;t leave an uncomfortable residue or oily feel, and it&#x27;s not at all greasy.  I was very surprised at how well and quickly it absorbs into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t interfere with my primer or my makeup, like some other moisturizers.  It lasts all day, and feels nice.  I honestly couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!  I would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Phyto 5 Extreme Cream is intended for dry, needy skin.  I&#x27;ve been applying this cream to my face twice a day, as instructed on the Amazon.com website, and my average-to-dry face has felt dryer than it has in the years I&#x27;ve been using a product that I buy in a big jar for around $10.  In fact, today, when I&#x27;m not wearing make-up, my face felt too dry, so I rubbed on some of the old stuff over the Phyto 5.  The dry vs hydrated feeling is purely subjective; others may love the soft, not moist effect.  I did discover that it is a mistake to use more than a tiny amount of the Phyto 5 or it leaves a whitish film that I dissipated by spreading the cream over my neck and collarbone.  There is a faint floral fragrance that lasts.  I could smell it on my pillowcase when I awoke this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to the company for using a new type tube for this product that promises the ability to use every last drop of what you pay for without having to cut open the bottom of the tube and scoop out the last drops.  Waste of products because of packaging is an insult to consumers, so I hope the packaging delivers as promised.</li>
            <li> Five star quality/four star price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Phyto 5 Natural Facial Cream has a faint orangy smell.  The product itself is thicker than other skin creams either myself or my wife has used.  Truly,the 1.75 oz goes a long way, as you can spread a small dab around to get full coverage and also avoid feeling you are using a mask.  Given that it needs to be spread thinly for full absorption, it ended being designated a before bed routine.  My wife found that within a couple of weeks her skin was feeling more hydrated and she got compliments are looking more &#x27;rested&#x27; and &#x27;radiant&#x27;.  For myself, I found that it eased the dry patches on my face and reduced some of the wrinkle lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging it top-end, down to having to snip the end of the bottle off to use the cream.  It would be nice if they could compromise a bit on the packaging to bring the price down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good, solid product that anecdotal evidence shows that works.</li>
            <li> As a man, I&#x27;m not ashamed to admit I do use face cream daily.  I used this Phyto5 Organic face cream a few times but it was just to &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; scented for me and made me feel like a girl.  It had kind of  a &amp;#34;berry-like lotion&amp;#34; smell that was just to feminine for my comfort zone so I turned the bottle over to my wife who has been using.  Based on my use and my wife&#x27;s use (besides the scent):&lt;br /&gt; -this lotion is on the thicker side and goes on thick (ie, you get some lotion film on your face if you use too much).  We both prefer creams that go on very light.&lt;br /&gt; -no SPF factor which is something important to me in a lotion (since the sun is the #1 ager).&lt;br /&gt; +the actual results did seem to improve skin moisture/ look and no irritations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Net net a decent enough cream to help skin but pricey at current $68 for 1.75 ounces, a bit thicker cream than my preference, and no SPF which is my preference &#x3D; overall rating from me of 3 STARS in consideration of price/value.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin.  Although this product moisturized my skin very well, it also made me break out.  If you are not prone to acne, this would be a great product a try.</li>
            <li> This hydrating cream has a terrific scent and it works well, although my wife didn&#x27;t notice it working better than a few other brands she has used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What kind of surprised me was how much extra space is in the container. Look at the product photo and where you see the words &amp;#34;EXTREME CREAM&amp;#34; is where the full line matches up when none is yet used. In other words, shake the container so that the liquid falls down toward the cap, and then look at it in the light to see how full the container is - that&#x27;s what I did for the submitted photo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been outside for a few days, working with concrete. Really dries my hands out. So I tried a few dabs when I was done for the day. My GF yelled at me - &amp;#34;Are you nuts? This is a face cream!&amp;#34; My bad. Each squirt was probably $2.00 - oops. BUT - my dried, starting to crack from the lime in the concrete - hands, were much smother and less like velcro. You know - that rough texture your hands or feet can develop from abuse? Hey, I know it&#x27;s a face/neck cream - but if it worked this well on my hands, I can imagine what it would do for more delicate facial skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my GF confiscated the tube with a slightly exasperated sigh. She&#x27;ll be using it on her face over the next week, so I&#x27;ll update then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price shocked me, but I&#x27;m a guy.  I buy stuff by the quart for $3. But you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> This is extremely moisturizing for my very dry hands. I don&#x27;t have very dry skin on my face, so I think it would be wasted, but it left my hands feeling amazing. The scent is light and yummy (must be the vanilla and berries) -- very pleasant. About the only thing that is unpleasant about this cream is the price, although it&#x27;s nice to know that if you do pay this much, you will get something that works. I could do without the safety tab on the cap, as well, but I suppose if you are buying this off the shelf, you would want to be sure it had not been opened.</li>
            <li> My wife is a heavy user of facial creams and moisturizers. The Phyto brand, however, was one that she had never tried before, so she was excited to get her hands on it, and get it on her cheeks. She gave me a rundown on her usage and thoughts from the last week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Japan and South Korea have come to dominate the high-end cosmetics market, she was excited to see this is made in Switzerland, hinting at both Germanic high quality and French luxury. No surprise then that this face cream delivered both of those many times over. It has a subtle fragrance that is only strong enough to make you aware it is there, and the formula is decidedly non-greasy. Despite that, it was easy to cover her entire face with just a small dab. She used it twice a day as recommended and she said she could tell it was making a difference in the smoothness and resilience of her skin, especially in the mornings. (Note that the package design is very simple, almost like a generic product, and there are no instructions for proper use; the usage instructions come from Amazon’s description.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife’s skin is usually very sensitive, but she said this did not irritate her skin at all and the overall quality was excellent. The label lists one of the ingredients as “arctic berries”, which if some other internet sources are true, is a kind of “super fruit” with an assortment of health benefits and uses. Regardless of whether it was the arctic berry effect or something else, her skin is definitely taking to this facial cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all these kinds of cosmetics and creams, personal preference, skin type, hygiene, and many other factors will affect how this works for you and whether you like it or not. My wife and I, however, based on her experience, both believe that if you have tried other facial creams and were less than satisfied, this might be a good option to try instead. In any event, my wife loves it, so we give it five stars.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am fairly picky about what I use on it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I really like  the ingredients in this moisturizer and they are organic as well which is always greatly appreciated.  It&#x27;s a very rich cream and a little really does go a long way and it feels wonderful - it really hydrates your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s scented but has a light pleasant scent. It&#x27;s pricy but as you need so little I think this tube will last for months. A very nice moisturizer and recommended.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, once you hit your forties, it takes a village of products to fight the aging process.  Moisturizer, wrinkle creams, eye gels, Vitamin C treatments, peels...  I&#x27;ve tried them all.  This moisturizer is one of my favorites. It leaves my skin rosy, smooth, and youthful in appearance.  It has a light scent and rubs in leaving no greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only two complaints are:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The cost -  $70 is insane.&lt;br /&gt;2.  There are no instructions printed on the back of the tube, so I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m supposed to be using it in the morning at night or both times.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s dressing table is an alchemists lair, with more mysterious potions and tinctures than I could possibly describe. However, she always seems to have space to try something new. So this &amp;#34;Phyto 5 Natural Face Cream&amp;#34; is her latest weapon against time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She gave this one a huge thumbs up, and a space towards the front of her cluttered table (the stuff she doesn&#x27;t like never gets removed, just scooted towards the back for emergencies).  When I asked her what made this one good, she rattled off the usual list of natural ingredients that can be found in almost every product. She said the design of this tube was particularly innovative--she had more control over how much of the product she wanted, without squirting it all over her hand and wasting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She didn&#x27;t like that it came without instructions. She really wants her beauty products to give her a regiment to follow; when to apply at what time of the day, how much and how often, etc ... She&#x27;s always dismayed on bottles like this that leave it up to personal choice. To her that is a quality mark against this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, she says it works great, feels good going on, and is an exceptional moisturizer!</li>
            <li> So far so good, I haven&#x27;t been using this for long but so far I like it. It&#x27;s thick and creamy, very moisturizing and smells very nice like citrus and spice without being overwhelming in the slightest. I love that it&#x27;s organic because it&#x27;s important to understand what your putting on you body. I do wish it had a bit of SPF in it. I already have soft even skin though it is prone to a bit of break outs so I&#x27;m waiting to see what this can do for me and that&#x27;s going to take some time. I generally use lines like Boscia, Peter Thomas Roth, and Ole Henrickson.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating but sits on top on skin too, so the slightest bit of perspiration sits on top and feel clammy and wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used less each time incase I had put on too much, but each time it felt filmy.</li>
            <li> My face tends to dry out. I am always looking for a cream that will help hydrate my skin without being too perfumey. I decided to take a chance on this one. As other reviewers have mentioned, a little goes a LONG way... it doesn&#x27;t take too long before you realize how little you actually need to use. The scent isn&#x27;t too bad. It is pleasant without being overbearing. Having used it for a while, I did find that it helped my face from not drying out, but I am not sure it is worth the high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, I don&#x27;t want to totally knock this stuff. Because it did work and I do like it. That said, I think that this is priced out of the realm of what most people would be willing to spend. But even if the price doesn&#x27;t shock you, I would definitely recommend trying it before buying it (or someplace with a liberal return policy).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a moisturizer.  It works.  Refreshingly, it&#x27;s not oily or greasy.  When you apply it, it is absorbed by your skin and does not leave a residue on your hands.  That alone is a great feature of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it smells faintly like cake.  Primarily, it smells like frosting, but also a little like white sheet cake.  It&#x27;s not strong, but it&#x27;s different.  I am guessing that&#x27;s the &amp;#34;arctic berries.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> You can tell from the second you apply this moisturizer, that this is a top of the line luxury product.  It goes on very silky, not greasy, and a little goes a long way.  Many of the small fine lines around my eyes and lips immediately were hydrated and disappeared.  Even without makeup, my face looked fresh and more hydrated, dewy even, without being shiny or greasy.  Makeup flows easily over this, like a dream.  The immediate result is amazing.  I look like I&#x27;ve gotten a full night&#x27;s sleep!</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I love this cream! This is not a cheap but a lot goes a long way and it does have a luxurious feel. This cream feels as though it might be greasy when you first put it on, but it soon soaks in and dries non greasy. Leaves you skin feeling really, really smooth and soft. When using this as a night cream, you wake up feeling like your skin is refreshed and renewed. This cream does such a good job of hydrating, that there’s no need to use a separate under eye cream at night. I also like that has a subtle fruity fragrance that isn’t overpowering or too girly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife tells me that she can also use this cream under her makeup. She’s always trying to find nice natural creams that she can wear during the day under her makeup and many are either too greasy or makeup curdles with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the simple and elegant packaging. My wife was pleased to see that this was in a tube that’s easy to regulate how much you squeeze out, and she likes to cut open the tube when it’s nearly empty and scrape out the remainder so as not to waste any precious anti-aging potential.  My only criticism would be that they don’t include any instructions or directions on the packaging. Obviously one knows what to do with a face cream, but it’s always nice to have guidance on the packaging for a new product, like how much to use, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would recommend this product to people who are happy to pay for an effective and luxurious cream.</li>
