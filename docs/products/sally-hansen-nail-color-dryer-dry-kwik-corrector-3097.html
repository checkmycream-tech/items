            <li>I love this product, the manicure is no problem any more, it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>though so it is best not to use your phone or type until your nails are dry and you wash your hands.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this, but honestly you&#x27;re better off without anything on your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of faith in products labeled &#x27;quick dry&#x27;, but this has truly impressed me</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works wonderfully as a quick drying top coat.</li>
            <li>I am glad Amazon has is, it gets sold right away in CVS and Harmon stores.</li>
            <li>stared with clean nails, put on Sally Hansen (SH for ease) &#x27;</li>

            <li>My only reservation is that the shipping &amp; handling cost more than the product.</li>
            <li>I bought this Dry Kwik nail many years ago</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is responsible for that</li>
            <li>I was excited to find in on Amazon and ordered several bottles.  </li>
            <li>They were packaged well to prevent breaking and came quick enough.  </li>

            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It almost instantly dries my freshly painted nails to a glossy finish.</li>
            <li>This same bottle that I had bought at lease ten maybe fifteen years still worked fine.</li>
            <li>I ordered a new bottle and I am waiting for it to come.</li>
            <li>Originally purchased from local pharmacy but later couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li>I bought this at a time when I didn&#x27;t have a lot of extra cash to spend on a more expensive brand, and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>i bought this product by accident on the hunt for a clear polish that is not only &#x27;quick dry&#x27; but high gloss..</li>
            <li>no messy edges...</li>
            <li>This product was unavailable any where in my area, as far as I know.</li>

            <li>, I understand a &amp;#34;quick dry&amp;#34; top coat to mean that once it is dry I can then go be a productive member of society, not now I can lightly brush my fingertip across my nail polish and stare at it for another 60 minutes waiting for it to officially dry.  </li>
            <li>The main ingredient is oil, which will dry your nail polish, but only to touch.  </li>

            <li> , I understand a &amp;#34;quick dry&amp;#34; top coat to mean that once it is dry I can then go be a productive member of society, not now I can lightly brush my fingertip across my nail polish and stare at it for another 60 minutes waiting for it to officially dry.  </li>

            <li> Found and ordered on Amazon, and now can polish and go in much less time than other quick dry products.</li>
            <li> It works at least as well as any other nail drying product I&#x27;ve ever used, even though it&#x27;s relatively cheap.</li>
            <li> I opened the first bottle this morning and the brush was very stiff.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike about this product is the name: Dry Kwik&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to actually soften the layers of polish so that if you attempt to do anything other than leave your hands in a prone position for the next hour, your manicure will be ruined.  </li>
            <li> I put on my nail color, waited a minute like the directions said then put the Kwik Dry on then not even a minute passed</li>
            <li> and they were dry</li>
            <li> (although, it does dry out my cuticles).</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer said, I believe this &#x27;dry&#x27; is superficial, and I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily push down on my nails after applying this product.</li>
            <li> I just brushed my hair back with my fingers and no hair lines in it like usual.  </li>
            <li> Super unfortunate-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nail polish dryer and there&#x27;s not much else to say.</li>
            <li> Dry Kwik indeed!!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t dig my nail in to see if it&#x27;s hard, but it seems dry enough to me.  </li>
            <li> then SH &#x27;Hard as nails, 550 Brownstone&#x27; then wait only like 5 min, put another coat on, waited again then put this stuff on.  </li>
            <li> also is really oily and leaves a weird residue all over the place.</li>
            <li> maybe less?)</li>
            <li> I always wait until late night to refresh my mani/pedi and &#x27;Kwik Dry&#x27;</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done painting my nails, I just put a little of this stuff on each nail.</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought it like I always do instead of this cheap crap.</li>
            <li> Oils do condition cuticles a little though!</li>
            <li> I could hardly believe it.</li>
            <li> This top coat is horrible, I&#x27;m so confused by all the 4 and 5 star reviews.  </li>
            <li> I am very fond of glitter nails, which means at least one coat of base color and two layers of glitter.  </li>
            <li> seriously-</li>
            <li> It has become very hard to find at retail stores, my guess is it is being discontinued.</li>
            <li> It is thin and oily, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting on your skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> , I was shocked.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I literally JUST put this stuff on my nails like 3 minutes ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stared with clean nails, put on Sally Hansen (SH for ease) &#x27;Maximum Growth Daily nail growth program&#x27; waited a bit (5-10 min? maybe less?) then SH &#x27;Hard as nails, 550 Brownstone&#x27; then wait only like 5 min, put another coat on, waited again then put this stuff on.  I waited 1-2 minutes and can touch my nails without gunk coming off.  I wouldn&#x27;t dig my nail in to see if it&#x27;s hard, but it seems dry enough to me.  I just brushed my hair back with my fingers and no hair lines in it like usual.  It feels oily on my skin (not a bad feeling, just describing it to you. First ingredient listed IS mineral oil after all.)&lt;br /&gt;Directions on package tell you to massage into cuticles when it&#x27;s dry.  Just did that and no smudging happened.  I think I&#x27;m good to go. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update this review if I feel the need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS did not buy on Amazon, but I love Amazon and I&#x27;m thankful for product reviews so I thought I&#x27;d share.&lt;br /&gt;Love you Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, the manicure is no problem any more, it dries very quickly. I am glad Amazon has is, it gets sold right away in CVS and Harmon stores.</li>
            <li> I love it I wish I could find more!</li>

            <li> Dry Kwik indeed!! Originally purchased from local pharmacy but later couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. Found and ordered on Amazon, and now can polish and go in much less time than other quick dry products. It&#x27;s an oil and you can massage in the cuticles, so no messy edges...just polish/finish and go.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product. Works great! Has been using this product for years and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> This top coat is horrible, I&#x27;m so confused by all the 4 and 5 star reviews.  I recently purchased this hoping to save money over my normal top coat, and that was such a mistake.  The main ingredient is oil, which will dry your nail polish, but only to touch.

            <li> Super unfortunate- I really wanted to like this, but honestly you&#x27;re better off without anything on your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: it&#x27;s cheap, good for cuticles&lt;br /&gt;Con: It only dries the top layer, preventing lower layers from drying (seriously- I used this after doing my nails, and my nails were smudge proof the next day!).It also is really oily and leaves a weird residue all over the place.</li>
            <li> Need need, can&#x27;t do your nails without this product. Helps me get into my sandals, and get out the door faster.</li>
            <li> This product was unavailable any where in my area, as far as I know. I have used it for years. My only reservation is that the shipping &amp; handling cost more than the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this Dry Kwik nail many years ago and I forgot about. I recently found it and started using it about a month ago. This same bottle that I had bought at lease ten maybe fifteen years still worked fine. So I know it has lasted all this time. I could hardly believe it. Sally Hansen&#x27;s Dryi Kwik nail polish really works, and I am so happy to have found it again! I ordered a new bottle and I am waiting for it to come. Thank you Sally Hansen for this product please don&#x27;t stop making this product. I will be buying it again so I can stock up on it and have plenty on hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nail polish dryer and there&#x27;s not much else to say.</li>
            <li> I am very fond of glitter nails, which means at least one coat of base color and two layers of glitter.  Without some way of speeding up the drying time, it&#x27;d take f o r e v e r! I bought this at a time when I didn&#x27;t have a lot of extra cash to spend on a more expensive brand, and I am so glad I did.  It works at least as well as any other nail drying product I&#x27;ve ever used, even though it&#x27;s relatively cheap. Will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> This nail dryer works great I can paint my nails 20 mints before leaving the house and its dry in 5 mints love this will recommend it to friend and plan to but more</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and it works like a charm. I put on my nail color, waited a minute like the directions said then put the Kwik Dry on then not even a minute passed I touched my nails and they were dry, I was shocked. So I tested it further by rubbing the mineral oil into my cuticles and  no polish on my fingers, no smudging, or marks at all. I don&#x27;t have a lot of faith in products labeled &#x27;quick dry&#x27;, but this has truly impressed me, it actually works like promised.</li>
            <li> Ever since being introduced to this product over 5 years ago by my now sister in law I cannot paint my nails without it!  Tends to get oils on your fingers though so it is best not to use your phone or type until your nails are dry and you wash your hands.  Oils do condition cuticles a little though!</li>
            <li> Not as &amp;#34;kwik&amp;#34; as I was expecting ... I have waited 5 to 10 min with this stuff and nails still smudge after... Boo.</li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike about this product is the name: Dry Kwik&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works wonderfully as a quick drying top coat. When I&#x27;m done painting my nails, I just put a little of this stuff on each nail. It is thin and oily, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting on your skin (although, it does dry out my cuticles). It almost instantly dries my freshly painted nails to a glossy finish. Like another reviewer said, I believe this &#x27;dry&#x27; is superficial, and I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily push down on my nails after applying this product. However, it allows me to continue to do things without messing my nails up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is responsible for that finished, high gloss look. It makes such a big difference that I wouldn&#x27;t think of doing my nails without this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i bought this product by accident on the hunt for a clear polish that is not only &#x27;quick dry&#x27; but high gloss.. I came home only to find it was a drying oil, which wasn&#x27;t that big a deal.. Im so happy I bought Kwik-Dry.. I always wait until late night to refresh my mani/pedi and &#x27;Kwik Dry&#x27; helps me catch my zzz&#x27;s ! Great product ladies, will not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to purchase this product at local stores and have been unable to find it for quite some time.  I was excited to find in on Amazon and ordered several bottles.  They were packaged well to prevent breaking and came quick enough.  I opened the first bottle this morning and the brush was very stiff.  I did not have time to try and separate the bristles yet, but will try tonight.</li>
