            <li>it has no paraben &amp; its great</li>
            <li>Provides great coverages and stays on.</li>
            <li>However, it works great as an eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy for this experiment</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that I bought it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy because It helps to look better!</li>
            <li>I loved the color</li>
            <li>I loved this product from the moment I tried it.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that it would&#x27;ve been lighter, regardless it still matches my skin tone fairly well.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed, a very great product for a low price.</li>
            <li>Product packaging is also very cute and feminine.</li>
            <li>The concealer has a nice consistency and good coverage.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>it took like 2 weeks, and i am very happy with the quality of this makeup and will be using it as my normal concealer stick from now on!</li>
            <li>Came fairly quickly and packaging was great.</li>
            <li>this, however, is pretty darn good!</li>
            <li>The formula is very smooth and blends well with just a finger.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so smooth and glides on nicely.</li>
            <li>Just kinda&#x27; sits on top of the skin.</li>
            <li>This is a must buy :)</li>
            <li>The consistency is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect when I received this</li>
            <li>but I love this concealer.</li>
            <li>Coverage is ok.</li>
            <li>The packaging is cute and it smells nice, plus I bought the right shade.</li>
            <li>I have to rub it in and reapply, but other than that, It fits perfectly and hides my circles.</li>
            <li>, it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I use this concealer after I&#x27;ve already applied my bb cream, it covers well and blends easily but not to the point of disappearing.</li>
            <li>and I think the shade will match me just fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cute and its really portable and its really cute :)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smell is nothing like a crayon, it&#x27;s a light smell that you don&#x27;t notice at all</li>
            <li>i just got it because it was cheap</li>
            <li>It provides great coverage without looking cakey and settling into fine lines like other concealers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again and instead opt for a creamier, more liquid concealer that lasts really long, but this one was definitely amazing and worth the money!</li>
            <li>Might be good for a different skin type, just not mine.</li>
            <li>I use it as a contour because it is too dark, but if i were darker, I would be more than delighted to use is under my eyes or on my blemishes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It is great for dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good concealer for months, but every one is either too clay-like, too smelly, or too dry.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft, has natural effect on the skin.</li>
            <li>I like it better than Urban Decay&#x27;s Potion primer.</li>
            <li>While it is a tad yellow for my skin tone, if you use a foundation on top of it the color blends in well.</li>
            <li>Overall pretty pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Full coverage and works great for my cool toned, red and very pale skin.</li>
            <li>the first one i ever bought was the e.l.f. concealer, which was absolutely abysmal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed on things like pimples, it has to be blended very well otherwise</li>
            <li>The seller was great, it arrived much earlier than expected and even had a few free samples!  </li>
            <li>provides an illuminating effect that I really like.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Overall I enjoy this and would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>Very creamy</li>
            <li>The shipment was fast, as per the confirmation.</li>
            <li>I used a small amount, it leaves my skin soft and with a fair coverage</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not sure if i&#x27;ll be trying to find another concealer at this point, because this is pretty reliable as long as you cover it with a nice foundation or bb cream!</li>
            <li>The color of the product was a little bit darker than I expected and being fair skinned</li>
            <li>The Light Beige was a bit too white for my yellow skin tone.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend applying a large amount, as too much can look very dry on your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got super pale skin and this color works really well with it.</li>
            <li>Thank you for bringing them early.</li>
            <li>It looks natural.</li>
            <li>For zits, pimples, and small blemishes, dab it on and lightly pat it in with your finger.</li>
            <li>It a little bit too light for Asian skin, but it seem to work well.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m new to concealers, and this is my second one.</li>
            <li>I have mildly dark circles under my eyes and that&#x27;s what I mainly use this for (erases them completely).</li>

            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really work if you have a real dark circle under your eyes......</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m thinking of getting another to keep in my purse for the touchup when I have a long day at work.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll look like your skin is flaking and dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still working pretty well, but after a few months the stick dried out a little, which probably should be expected.</li>
            <li> A little too sheer.</li>
            <li> My skin has dry spots and minor redness, with a few blemishes.</li>
            <li> I got the lightest shade possible (light beige) and it was too dark for my pale skin tone :(</li>
            <li> I also use it for around my nose where it tends to look a little pink.</li>
            <li> For dark circles you swipe some (as needed) under each eye and blend with your finger.</li>
            <li> Its not worth it</li>
            <li> and i have dark under eye circles, so</li>
            <li> I put on my go-to BB cream, then a little of this concealer then my finishing powder.  </li>
            <li> My other concealers I get at drugstores don&#x27;t even cover my face up!!!</li>
            <li> I am very very pale</li>
            <li> because when it came it was broken in the tube :/</li>
            <li> that I know it wont look weird.</li>
            <li> The shipping cost was a bit disappointing though...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great concealer, I decided to get this one cause it has no paraben &amp; its great</li>
            <li> Love it.  I have light/fair Asian skin.  This match my skin tone perfectly. It&#x27;s soft and very easy to apply.  I put on my go-to BB cream, then a little of this concealer then my finishing powder.  I keep this at home but I&#x27;m thinking of getting another to keep in my purse for the touchup when I have a long day at work.</li>
            <li> The concealer has a nice consistency and good coverage. I should learn my lesson and stop ordering online though because when it came it was broken in the tube :/</li>
            <li> Provides great coverages and stays on. I like the softness of the stick form, it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> The Light Beige was a bit too white for my yellow skin tone. However, it works great as an eyeshadow primer. In fact! I like it better than Urban Decay&#x27;s Potion primer.</li>
            <li> Thank you for bringing them early. I am very happy for that .It&#x27;s a very beautiful and wonderful . I&#x27;m happy for this experiment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good concealer for months, but every one is either too clay-like, too smelly, or too dry. This was none of those! It&#x27;s so smooth and glides on nicely. It&#x27;s smell is nothing like a crayon, it&#x27;s a light smell that you don&#x27;t notice at all once it&#x27;s on. My skin has dry spots and minor redness, with a few blemishes. I have mildly dark circles under my eyes and that&#x27;s what I mainly use this for (erases them completely). For dark circles you swipe some (as needed) under each eye and blend with your finger. For zits, pimples, and small blemishes, dab it on and lightly pat it in with your finger.

I wouldn&#x27;t recommend applying a large amount, as too much can look very dry on your skin. The seller was great, it arrived much earlier than expected and even had a few free samples!  UPDATE: It&#x27;s still working pretty well, but after a few months the stick dried out a little, which probably should be expected. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again and instead opt for a creamier, more liquid concealer that lasts really long, but this one was definitely amazing and worth the money!</li>
            <li> stays on all day. perfect color for my fair skin tone. doesn&#x27;t ever look caked on. provides an illuminating effect that I really like.</li>
            <li> I loved the color but it doesn&#x27;t really work if you have a real dark circle under your eyes......</li>
            <li> A little too sheer. Just kinda&#x27; sits on top of the skin. Might be good for a different skin type, just not mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got super pale skin and this color works really well with it. While it is a tad yellow for my skin tone, if you use a foundation on top of it the color blends in well. Overall pretty pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> i am very happy with this concealer stick!  i just got it because it was cheap &amp; i wanted to save myself a trip to the store.  after ordering, i found out it was coming from China and would take up to a month or whatever..  it took like 2 weeks, and i am very happy with the quality of this makeup and will be using it as my normal concealer stick from now on!</li>
            <li> My other concealers I get at drugstores don&#x27;t even cover my face up!!! LOL but this concealer does and it&#x27;s amazing! I love it! It&#x27;s super cute and its really portable and its really cute :)  This is a must buy :)</li>
            <li> I use this concealer after I&#x27;ve already applied my bb cream, it covers well and blends easily but not to the point of disappearing.</li>
            <li> I loved this product from the moment I tried it. The packaging is cute and it smells nice, plus I bought the right shade. I used a small amount, it leaves my skin soft and with a fair coverage that I know it wont look weird. It looks natural. I would recomend this product and keep buying it. Thanks</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!!! I got the lightest shade possible (light beige) and it was too dark for my pale skin tone :( The consistency is fantastic! it&#x27;s not too creamy, it&#x27;s not oily, it doesn&#x27;t sink into pores at ALL! I am very impressed, a very great product for a low price. I use it as a contour because it is too dark, but if i were darker, I would be more than delighted to use is under my eyes or on my blemishes.</li>
            <li> Excellent! I&#x27;m happy because It helps to look better!</li>

            <li> Came fairly quickly and packaging was great. It came wrapped in 2 layers of bubble wrap. The color of the product was a little bit darker than I expected and being fair skinned I was hoping that it would&#x27;ve been lighter, regardless it still matches my skin tone fairly well. The formula is very smooth and blends well with just a finger. Product packaging is also very cute and feminine. Overall I enjoy this and would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I never received it. Don&#x27;t purchase it. Its not worth it</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect when I received this but I love this concealer. It is great for dark under eye circles. It provides great coverage without looking cakey and settling into fine lines like other concealers I&#x27;ve used. I also use it for around my nose where it tends to look a little pink.</li>
            <li> Beautiful product :D I am very very pale and i have dark under eye circles, so this helps A LOT. I have to rub it in and reapply, but other than that, It fits perfectly and hides my circles.</li>
            <li> Very creamy and I think the shade will match me just fine. Great product!</li>
            <li> Full coverage and works great for my cool toned, red and very pale skin.</li>
            <li> It a little bit too light for Asian skin, but it seem to work well. Coverage is ok.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft, has natural effect on the skin. the colour suited my skin. I&#x27;m happy that I bought it. The shipment was fast, as per the confirmation. The shipping cost was a bit disappointing though...</li>
