            <li>I have always love this perfume</li>
            <li>and I recently bought it for my best friend for his birthday.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne</li>
            <li>He was so excited!</li>
            <li>But the ones from Amazon is very very mild.  </li>
            <li>and I received a totally Original Perfume if you are looking for something good original and convenience I highly recommend you this Guess Perfume</li>
            <li>so when I found it on amazon for so cheap, I immediately bought it for my husband.</li>
            <li>He had caught a whiff of this scent a few years ago on a guy, loved it, but hadn&#x27;t asked what it was, so was delighted to find it again.</li>
            <li>the only good thing about this is the bottle design..</li>
            <li>if u need a cologne thats fresh, yet has a sweet kick to it, this is the cologne to get.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth buying</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, right?  </li>
            <li>so i think that he likes it very much.</li>
            <li>However, once I received it in good order; I tested it and it was just as good as the bottle of Guess Man I had purchased from Macy&#x27;s a few years ago, but for about half the price.</li>
            <li>last long it smells great</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than buying it from Sephora!</li>
            <li>I first got this at a department store.  </li>
            <li>but it never fails to turn heads.  </li>
            <li>Product exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The smart ones catch on, and the ditzy ones well...  ;)</li>
            <li>It stays on long, and my husband has received many compliments. .</li>
            <li>A clean fresh smell the smell last for about 4 to 6 hours .</li>
            <li>My honey puts it on for special occasions,  but I would love it if he wore it everyday.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>My husband found this cologne at a department store, and we ordered it at a much lower cost from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Will cost more at any other store.</li>
            <li>This perfume is Inexpensive and smell so good and last half of day and spray it again after 12 hours I ordered from Amazon</li>
            <li>The one from Guess is very strong and last very long -- one spray and the fragrance can be detected across the room.  </li>
            <li>When purchasing this product I was concerned that I might be an old bottle and</li>
            <li>For my undrestand this fragrance is for young guys.</li>
            <li>The only thing different was the new bottle shape.  </li>
            <li>For someone who usually prefers high-end scents, I actually love it as well, and find it inviting.... could have longer staying power, but at this price, re-applying it as it wears down isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>

            <li> Every woman (seriously, Every woman) whose walked by and catches a whiff always:&lt;br /&gt;1. Stops&lt;br /&gt;2. Gives a compliment&lt;br /&gt;3. And asks &amp;#34;what kind of cologne are you wearing?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;4. I reply &amp;#34;Guess.&amp;#34; The smart ones catch on, and the ditzy ones well...  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And my girlfriend loves the smell.  So 5 Stars, and no complaints from me.  Since it does work.</li>
            <li> When purchasing this product I was concerned that I might be an old bottle and the fragrance may not be what I expected.  However, once I received it in good order; I tested it and it was just as good as the bottle of Guess Man I had purchased from Macy&#x27;s a few years ago, but for about half the price.</li>

            <li> I bought this perfume for my father and he still doesn&#x27;t complain of anything so i think that he likes it very much.</li>
            <li> I first got this at a department store.  When it was time to replace, I happened to find it on Amazon at about half the price I paid.  I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t be the same but took a chance.  The only thing different was the new bottle shape.  Great find and price.</li>
            <li> Great scent. Good value for the $.</li>
            <li> Very good smell . A clean fresh smell the smell last for about 4 to 6 hours . Very good fragrance for hot days . For my undrestand this fragrance is for young guys.For 16 dollars you can&#x27;t complain . I will buy Again .</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. ..if u need a cologne thats fresh, yet has a sweet kick to it, this is the cologne to get. It stays on long, and my husband has received many compliments. .</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this on my handsome man. Thank you</li>
            <li> A little expensive but i have not yet came across anyone that did not like the smell. Ladys love it</li>
            <li> Para mi una de las mejores fragancias de la guess y las uso a cada momento del dia. es extraordinaria</li>
            <li> Guess man has been around for some time but it never fails to turn heads.  I purchased this for my brother after speaking with several men who say that they continue to wear it because it&#x27;s oil-based strength definitely stays with them throughout the day and the compliments NEVER stop coming.  I like that it&#x27;s not overpowering and didn&#x27;t break the bank as so many designer fragrances do.</li>
            <li> My husband found this cologne at a department store, and we ordered it at a much lower cost from Amazon. He had caught a whiff of this scent a few years ago on a guy, loved it, but hadn&#x27;t asked what it was, so was delighted to find it again. It&#x27;s a casual cologne. For someone who usually prefers high-end scents, I actually love it as well, and find it inviting.... could have longer staying power, but at this price, re-applying it as it wears down isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> Great price, right size I gave it to my nephew as a gift, arrived on time. Will cost more at any other store.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described. Great price and great delivery.</li>
            <li> I have always love this perfume and I recently bought it for my best friend for his birthday. He was so excited!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne so when I found it on amazon for so cheap, I immediately bought it for my husband. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Excelente, fue entregado en el tiempo previsto y sin ningun inconvenientes, lo recomiendo, es responsable 100%. Satisfecho con el servicio prestado</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles of this from Amazon and had one bottle from a Guess store.  The one from Guess is very strong and last very long -- one spray and the fragrance can be detected across the room.  But the ones from Amazon is very very mild.  I literally doused myself and still can hardly smell it.  I had to put my nose all the way against the spot where I sprayed to smell the fragrance.  So this product from Amazon is either a fake or it is extremely diluted.</li>
