            <li>Best of all, my gums stopped bleeding and haven&#x27;t bled during all of the years I have been using Mentadent.</li>
            <li>Use all the time and find it the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

            <li>Great pump style toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Great toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I always get great dental checkups since using mentadent.</li>
            <li>So happy to have a source where I can buy it.</li>
            <li>this product was successful in the toothpaste product or not.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste and always get a great report from my Dental Hygienist...!</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>(I buy way too many products for dental hygiene, have tried everything, so I should know!)</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>This effectively ends all disputes over the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It also effectively ends having toothpaste residue all over one&#x27;s sink.</li>
            <li>Better than screwing and unscrewing a tube.</li>
            <li>it is a creative product for the toothpaste market i have ever seen.</li>
            <li>i need to see more picture for this product too.</li>
            <li>I love the dispenser just on an engineering/practicality basis.  </li>
            <li>My favorite toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>But I purchased these and am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>I would buy more</li>
            <li>best there is, the tiny bubbles oxygenate the spaces between the teeth and keep them healthy.</li>
            <li>Nice fresh taste...what I&#x27;ve been using for many years.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic toothpaste I love it</li>
            <li>Easy to use container</li>
            <li>My teeth look and feel fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great product that can&#x27;t be found anymore in local stores.</li>
            <li>best toothpaste I have been using for the past 20 years and with floss have not seen dentist in 10 years</li>
            <li>This tooth paste leaves one&#x27;s mouth clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>its&#x27; own stand right next to the toothbrush holder.  </li>
            <li>I bought it right away.</li>
            <li>The peroxide gives a clean feeling while the baking soda provides gentle, non-abrasive cleaning.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is my brand of choice, primarily because of its handy little pump.</li>
            <li>My favoite is no longer available and I may have to find a new toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste, can&#x27;t find locally.</li>
            <li>Love it because not only is it a great product, I don&#x27;t have to worry about the mess from a cap left off the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The fresh mint taste makes one forget about the baking soda and peroxide, as it provides that traditional minty taste one often associates with spanking clean teeth.</li>
            <li>Moreover, the pump allows one to access the last bit of toothpaste easily, unlike a tube that needs to be caressed into giving it up.</li>
            <li>easy to get in local stores.</li>
            <li>I like using the Mentadent as it last a long time and is just as good a tube toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>There is a huge price difference from different vendors, and although there are two sizes (I think), I do not understand the price differences.  </li>
            <li>thanks...</li>
            <li>The whole family loves the taste.</li>
            <li>Once you have the pump dispenser, one need only purchase refills that are available in a variety of flavors.</li>
            <li>and it came fast</li>
            <li>but i need more information about this dual pump toothpaste in US or other countries that sold this product.</li>
            <li>a more thorough teeth cleaning than other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>particular refill combines the ingredients that dentists often recommend for the care of one&#x27;s teeth and gums: peroxide and baking soda.</li>
            <li>I have the dispensers and I like them because they look ok to leave sitting out (unlike crushed toothpaste tubes), and I don&#x27;t care too much for the traditional squeeze bottles either.  </li>
            <li>Not the greratest new taste.  </li>
            <li>He said the two ingredients work better if they are mixed just before using rather than already mixed as in standard brands.</li>
            <li>However, the replacement Mentadent cartridges are getting hard to find, so I was glad I could get some on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Mentadent advocates that these two ingredients combine to release tiny oxygen bubbles that get into the tiny spaces between teeth and around one&#x27;s gum line, which makes it a potentially useful product for those seeing a periodontist.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been hard to find on the store shelves recently, so I was pleased to find it here on Amazon.</li>

            <li> Instead of having to squeeze the toothpaste tube to get to the toothpaste, causing arguments between family members who like to squeeze the middle and those who properly squeeze from the end, one merely has to press down on the dispenser, which will then evenly release the desired amount of toothpaste onto one&#x27;s brush.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the grocery stores anymore - and I don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li> My gums were in bad shape, always bleeding when I brushed.</li>

            <li> Nice fresh taste...what I&#x27;ve been using for many years.  Better than screwing and unscrewing a tube.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have used this product for years and like it&#x27;s benefits with the peroxide and baking soda combination. On line is the only place we can buy so we hope it will remain viable in the future.</li>
            <li> Love it because not only is it a great product, I don&#x27;t have to worry about the mess from a cap left off the toothpaste. I can&#x27;t always find it in the store so Amazon is my go to place for it.  (I buy way too many products for dental hygiene, have tried everything, so I should know!)</li>
            <li> it is a creative product for the toothpaste market i have ever seen. but i need more information about this dual pump toothpaste in US or other countries that sold this product. i want to know that is it this product was successful in the toothpaste product or not. i need to see more picture for this product too. thanks...</li>
            <li> This is the 5th time we&#x27;ve purchased the mega multipack (4 double-pack refills) and we couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The whole family loves the taste. I love the dispenser just on an engineering/practicality basis.  Also, you simply can&#x27;t find this brand for less, especially now Costco&#x27;s discontinued carrying it.</li>
            <li> The only brand to use.</li>
            <li> Convenient and I don&#x27;t have to put up with tubes squeezed in the middle.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 10 years. My gums were in bad shape, always bleeding when I brushed. My dentist recommended Mentadent. I bought it right away. It took a couple days to get used to the baking soda taste, but after that, I didn&#x27;t even notice it. The mint flavor was great! Best of all, my gums stopped bleeding and haven&#x27;t bled during all of the years I have been using Mentadent. It&#x27;s been hard to find on the store shelves recently, so I was pleased to find it here on Amazon. I love this toothpaste! I&#x27;ll keep on using it until they don&#x27;t make it anymore!</li>
            <li> I used this toothpaste for a long time but then lost track of it. Thankfully, I have finally discoverd it again!</li>
            <li> like it might order another one</li>
            <li> the only toothpaste that works for me</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is my brand of choice, primarily because of its handy little pump. Instead of having to squeeze the toothpaste tube to get to the toothpaste, causing arguments between family members who like to squeeze the middle and those who properly squeeze from the end, one merely has to press down on the dispenser, which will then evenly release the desired amount of toothpaste onto one&#x27;s brush. This effectively ends all disputes over the toothpaste. It also effectively ends having toothpaste residue all over one&#x27;s sink. Moreover, the pump allows one to access the last bit of toothpaste easily, unlike a tube that needs to be caressed into giving it up. Once you have the pump dispenser, one need only purchase refills that are available in a variety of flavors. The refill, however, will not function without the dispenser into which one must insert the refill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular refill combines the ingredients that dentists often recommend for the care of one&#x27;s teeth and gums: peroxide and baking soda. The peroxide gives a clean feeling while the baking soda provides gentle, non-abrasive cleaning. Mentadent advocates that these two ingredients combine to release tiny oxygen bubbles that get into the tiny spaces between teeth and around one&#x27;s gum line, which makes it a potentially useful product for those seeing a periodontist. The fresh mint taste makes one forget about the baking soda and peroxide, as it provides that traditional minty taste one often associates with spanking clean teeth.</li>

            <li> I love this toothpaste and always get a great report from my Dental Hygienist...! Hard to find in the grocery stores anymore - and I don&#x27;t know why. Hope Amazon doesn&#x27;t quit selling it too!!!</li>
            <li> This tooth paste leaves one&#x27;s mouth clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste. I always get great dental checkups since using mentadent. My teeth look and feel fantastic. It is getting harder to find tho.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste.  So happy to have a source where I can buy it.</li>
            <li> best toothpaste I have been using for the past 20 years and with floss have not seen dentist in 10 years</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste, can&#x27;t find locally.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Tastes good&lt;br /&gt;Has its&#x27; own stand right next to the toothbrush holder.  You can also see when it is about to run out.</li>
            <li> I have the dispensers and I like them because they look ok to leave sitting out (unlike crushed toothpaste tubes), and I don&#x27;t care too much for the traditional squeeze bottles either.  However, the replacement Mentadent cartridges are getting hard to find, so I was glad I could get some on Amazon.  There is a huge price difference from different vendors, and although there are two sizes (I think), I do not understand the price differences.  But I purchased these and am quite satisfied.</li>

            <li> Can no longer find it anywhere else. Good product.</li>

            <li> Fantastic toothpaste I love it and it came fast</li>
            <li> Not the greratest new taste.  My favoite is no longer available and I may have to find a new toothpaste.</li>
            <li> best there is, the tiny bubbles oxygenate the spaces between the teeth and keep them healthy. a more thorough teeth cleaning than other toothpastes. i recommend it.</li>
            <li> order - use - reorder</li>
            <li> Easy to use container and it does the required job of cleaning teeth properly and leaving the mouth fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Not easy to get in local stores.</li>
