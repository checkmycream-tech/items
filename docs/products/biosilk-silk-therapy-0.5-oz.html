            <li>I love the smell its better than anything at Walgreens</li>
            <li>Biosilk Silk Therapy is the best product I have used for my dry hair</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing the full size!</li>
            <li>There is a strong chemical smell.  </li>
            <li>THE BEST FOR YOUR HAIR HANDS DOWN.</li>
            <li>Always silky smooth and helps with dryness.</li>
            <li>I start with a dime sized drop and will use more until I achieve the right look.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s very rare that I buy an unusable hair product and this is just one of these things.</li>
            <li>but this IS a good option in lieu of the former.</li>
            <li>Good product overall.</li>
            <li>I tried it in this size and loved it so much that I bought a whole large bottle!</li>
            <li>This is the best product for thin, fine hair and would recommend to anyone with this type of hair.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has super curly hair</li>
            <li>but I have bleached kinky hair right now).</li>
            <li>and I have super straight hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;smells exactly like rave hair spray.</li>
            <li>MY WHOLE FAMILY USES IT!</li>
            <li>It certainly does the trick smoothing my hair and even taming frizz.</li>
            <li>So I purchased this product not fully understanding how much I would get.  </li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t picture 0.5 oz.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Works better than any other conditioner on my hair</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It really helps smooth it and a get all the tangles out with less discomfort.</li>
            <li>/&gt;super soft hair&lt;</li>
            <li>I really count on biosilk for the consistency when travel interupts with all the different water/salt types.</li>
            <li>Be careful, using too much will result in a greasy look and feel.</li>
            <li>It takes a very small amount to work so this little one lasted me 3 months and the large bottle will probably last me a year or more.</li>
            <li>This little guy is the Real Deal!</li>
            <li>i was a little nervous that it would be a knock off BUT its the real deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m agree with the other less than 3 stars comments, i bought it and is too tiny that even worth the price.</li>

            <li> flyaway, slightly wavy, easily tangled, breakage prone, split ends, slow to grow, and i dont dye or heat style my hair.</li>
            <li> but i havent been using it long enough..</li>
            <li> I purchased sample bottles for my grandgirls, all with long hair, so that they could see the benefits especially in protecting their &amp;#34;ends&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> etc that I have tried for flat ironing my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the container should really allow it to dispense some other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;weighs hair down (pro for me, but con maybe for some curly haired girls)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i initially tried this on dry hair years ago and thought it was</li>
            <li> The price does seem high, but a little of this goes a long way, so this little bottle can last you a while.</li>
            <li> Both dry.....</li>
            <li> First it just too small less than a bottle of nail polish!</li>
            <li> it not worth it just buy a bigger bottle for 24 dollars ....</li>
            <li> My stylist says this is a high quality hair oil and the bottle will last at least 6 months of not more with regular use.</li>
            <li> It was a lot smaller than I thought it would be, although it says how big it is, I didnt realize it would be that small</li>
            <li> then i read reviews and tried it on wet hair</li>
            <li> use a dime size or less even on long hair, trust me.</li>
            <li> you only need a little bit for you ends!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve tried this dry and disliked it, try it wet.</li>
            <li> i also have extremely oily roots.</li>
            <li> other people smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will make your hair feel silky but a hr later it will be dull again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like how it weighed down my hair.</li>
            <li> flyaway hair down (a pro for me)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tried it again with less and it was still greasy.</li>
            <li> hair way less frizzy</li>
            <li> I have had mine for a few months now and there is still plenty to go around.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it hasnt dried out my hair yet</li>
            <li> and since I am not cooking, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> a little goes along way!</li>
            <li> i have very thin hair with dry ends..</li>
            <li> VERY SMALL!!!</li>
            <li> really* bad.</li>
            <li> I just got it today and when I opened it, I was shocked!</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product! Will be purchasing the full size!</li>
            <li> So I purchased this product not fully understanding how much I would get.  I really couldn&#x27;t picture 0.5 oz.  Well, let&#x27;s just say that you will get about same amount of product that is in a bottle of nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product makes me hair feel silky, there is a sheen to it and it is resistant to humidity but not water, of course.  I gave it a 3/5 based on the size and I think that it is an OK product.  I would prefer Chi Silk Infusion to this but this IS a good option in lieu of the former.</li>
            <li> Too greasy even with a couple of drops. Didn&#x27;t like how it weighed down my hair. Had to wash my hair again. Tried it again with less and it was still greasy.</li>
            <li> First it just too small less than a bottle of nail polish! it not worth it just buy a bigger bottle for 24 dollars ....</li>
            <li> This smells great! I would wear this scent as perfume! It certainly does the trick smoothing my hair and even taming frizz. The price does seem high, but a little of this goes a long way, so this little bottle can last you a while. I have had mine for a few months now and there is still plenty to go around. Then again, I only use this on occasion so maybe I am not the best judge of that :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awsome product to keep hair silky!</li>
            <li> my hair is very fine, flyaway, slightly wavy, easily tangled, breakage prone, split ends, slow to grow, and i dont dye or heat style my hair. i also have extremely oily roots. now onto the product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;makes hair shiny&lt;br /&gt;makes hair way less frizzy&lt;br /&gt;makes my hair straighter and healthier looking&lt;br /&gt;super soft hair&lt;br /&gt;weighs flyaway hair down (a pro for me)&lt;br /&gt;does not make my hair greasy (the way i use it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;smells exactly like rave hair spray. i do not know what this peachy nice smell is that other people smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the container should really allow it to dispense some other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;weighs hair down (pro for me, but con maybe for some curly haired girls)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very very easy to overdo it. use a dime size or less even on long hair, trust me. dont apply to roots especially if you have oily hair but thats obvious&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it breaks me out on my neck, back and sides of jaw but not sure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it hasnt dried out my hair yet but i havent been using it long enough..i initially tried this on dry hair years ago and thought it was *really* bad. then i read reviews and tried it on wet hair and i am so glad i did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;ve tried this dry and disliked it, try it wet. i only give it four stars because its not foolproof, you have to tweak your method until it works for you.</li>
            <li> Biosilk Silk Therapy is the best product I have used for my dry hair and I have tried many products..  I highly recommend it, which is something I don&#x27;t often do.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Would like to place another order. Offering any deals?</li>
            <li> So i just got mine in the mail today. i was a little nervous that it would be a knock off BUT its the real deal. (I&#x27;ve own this product before). you only need a little bit for you ends! a little goes along way! its a sample size but should last for a couple weeks. buy it and try it out! i have very thin hair with dry ends.. i also wear extensions so the &amp;#34;silk&amp;#34; makes the biggest difference.</li>
            <li> I just got it today and when I opened it, I was shocked! It was a lot smaller than I thought it would be, although it says how big it is, I didnt realize it would be that small, I haven&#x27;t yet but I will soon!</li>
            <li> I mostly use this in my daughter&#x27;s hair. It really helps smooth it and a get all the tangles out with less discomfort.</li>
            <li> Biosilk has always been amazing.  My daughter has super curly hair and I have super straight hair.  Both dry..... we love this product.  Always silky smooth and helps with dryness.</li>
            <li> I love this and I use it on my Yorkie</li>
            <li> Is too tiny don&#x27;t buy it!!! I&#x27;m agree with the other less than 3 stars comments, i bought it and is too tiny that even worth the price. Please don&#x27;t buy it!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best product for thin, fine hair and would recommend to anyone with this type of hair.  Only wish I had discovered it sooner.</li>
            <li> My sister and I are impressed by its softening our hair.</li>
            <li> This hair serum does nothing for my hair. It&#x27;s just like putting Crisco on my hair. It&#x27;s the same texture as Crisco oil and since I am not cooking, it was a waste of money. I have relaxed hair and perhaps it&#x27;s not for my type of hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I purchased sample bottles for my grandgirls, all with long hair, so that they could see the benefits especially in protecting their &amp;#34;ends&amp;#34;.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Used to get it in a bottle 3 times this size.  Would like to find that again.  Love this product though.</li>
            <li> I got it per recommendation of From Head To Toe youtubestress because she looks sort of like me except much more beautiful.  Was very disappointed.  There is a strong chemical smell.  The hair felt gunky and greasy the next day.  Perhaps it doesn&#x27;t match my hair type or I haven&#x27;t used it correctly.  But it&#x27;s very rare that I buy an unusable hair product and this is just one of these things.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves it -  she uses it daily - makes her hair shiny - she loves the smell and get compliments on the smell as though it was perfume -</li>
            <li> This product is a god send! I tried it in this size and loved it so much that I bought a whole large bottle! It takes a very small amount to work so this little one lasted me 3 months and the large bottle will probably last me a year or more. I use it to reduce frizz and it smells amazing. Be careful, using too much will result in a greasy look and feel. I start with a dime sized drop and will use more until I achieve the right look.</li>
            <li> The product is not biosilk. It is basically water.</li>
            <li> Good product overall. I&#x27;m rating it 3 stars b/c of the size of the bottle. I would not purchase again. However, I would recommend to a friend if they just want to test out this product</li>
            <li> the size is perfect for many weekend trips.  I really count on biosilk for the consistency when travel interupts with all the different water/salt types.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other conditioner on my hair</li>
            <li> It will make your hair feel silky but a hr later it will be dull again. so you would have to keep applying</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and love these bottles for travel. You can also refill them - works great for keeping hair and body smooth, silky and hydrated.</li>
            <li> THE BEST FOR YOUR HAIR HANDS DOWN. I LOVE IT ON MY HAIR MY HUSBAD LOVES IT ON HIS HAIJR MY WHOLE FAMILY USES IT!</li>
            <li> VERY SMALL!!! BUT! you do not need a lot( I do but I have bleached kinky hair right now). My stylist says this is a high quality hair oil and the bottle will last at least 6 months of not more with regular use. I love the smell its better than anything at Walgreens etc that I have tried for flat ironing my hair.</li>
            <li> Works great! This little guy is the Real Deal!</li>
