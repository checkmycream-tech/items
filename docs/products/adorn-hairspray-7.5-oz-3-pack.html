            <li>It is a great hairspray.</li>
            <li>So happy to have located it again for sale.</li>
            <li>So wonderful to find my longtime favorite on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>She laughed then almost cried.</li>
            <li>a good one been around for years</li>
            <li>Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and she is thrilled after trying it for a while.  </li>
            <li>Received on time, product came in good package, and love the products....</li>
            <li>Thanks for a wonderful hair spray.</li>
            <li>wonderful hair spray, wish they would put it back on the market</li>
            <li>Glad we can still get it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You need to package them better.</li>
            <li>No doubt I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I LOVE ADORN AND HAVE USED IT FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t keep producing it since so many people love it.</li>
            <li>I love that I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve never been able to find another that works as well for me.</li>
            <li>I love Adorn.</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong, but it works on my fine hair.no buildup.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, because it holds your hair great and your hair feels soft, not tacky.</li>
            <li>Adorn in the blue can is perfect for quick sets.</li>
            <li>but this is fine for now.</li>
            <li>I prefer the original Adorn hair spray.  </li>
            <li>I would like to have gotten the original unscented Adorn so it didn&#x27;t overpower my colognes</li>
            <li>Great old line product, my wife absolutely loves this brand.  </li>
            <li>The non build up statement is true.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just the right hold.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Adorn for decades for its soft hold and the easy combing it allows.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I WISH MORE STORES WOULD CARRY IT, SO I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO ORDER IT IN LARGER QUANTITY.</li>
            <li>I tried many different hair sprays since they quit selling Adorn in the stores.  </li>
            <li>She swears by it, not too much build-up with use, according to her!</li>
            <li>It also seems to make my hair look like it needs washing sooner than it really does.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying it.</li>
            <li>I like the pink can better</li>
            <li>It is all that I used in high school,a million years ago!</li>
            <li>the  Blue  Can says it&#x27;s the right one ,for medium hold.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair and Adorn does not weigh it down but is effective.</li>
            <li>My longish hair stays neat and still looks natural.  </li>
            <li>Hair stays soft ,and your doo stays put.</li>
            <li>One can had a leak &amp; was completely empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had found it in one market near me, but now they don&#x27;t seem to be selling it anymore.  </li>
            <li>It is so much better than other hair spray for the stiff hair products.  </li>
            <li>Flexible, clear, fresh scent and long lasting.  Not available in any stores in MN; can only find it online.</li>
            <li>I feel this one is too firm when you first put it on.  </li>

            <li> Have used this product for a long time and have ordered it on line as the local stores do not carry it.  </li>
            <li> This is a hairspray that has been around for a very long time</li>
            <li> the inside of the package was all wet &amp; sticky.  </li>
            <li> used the pink  can for 35 years.  </li>
            <li> I always try to use adorn hair spray and it is getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> I have used Adorn Hairspray for a long time, but recently I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding it in the stores in my area.  </li>
            <li> Every other time I have ordered the product, it came in a box with a dozen cans.</li>
            <li> Trouble is that some stores say they can&#x27;t get it to sell , but I know where you can find it  ,on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Does not leave your hair stiff.  </li>
            <li> Thought the cans were the usual spray tops.</li>
            <li> This is a &amp;#34;tried and true&amp;#34; product that has worked well with my hair styles, now and in the past.</li>
            <li> However, it is very hard to find.</li>
            <li> The package did not have any packing materials and the caps were all cracked &amp; broken &amp;</li>
            <li> it is now getting impossible to find even online.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> So wonderful to find my longtime favorite on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve used Adorn for decades for its soft hold and the easy combing it allows.  My longish hair stays neat and still looks natural.  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> Adorn was a staple in her hair routine and a childhood memory for my sisters and I. When she was commenting at Christmas that she can no longer buy it I went to Amazon and found it for Mother&#x27;s Day. She laughed then almost cried. I am now #1 daughter, lol.</li>
            <li> wonderful hair spray, wish they would put it back on the market</li>
            <li> been using it for years!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is the best . Been using for years and it&#x27;s just the right hold. Hair stays soft ,and your doo stays put. Trouble is that some stores say they can&#x27;t get it to sell , but I know where you can find it  ,on Amazon. the  Blue  Can says it&#x27;s the right one ,for medium hold.</li>
            <li> My Mother loves Adorn Hairspray.  Glad we can still get it.</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong, but it works on my fine hair.no buildup. i would buy the 3 pack again.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is so awsome.  No buildup at all.  Does not leave your hair stiff.  I can not find this product in any stores. Just thankful I found it at Amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d</li>
            <li> The package did not have any packing materials and the caps were all cracked &amp; broken &amp; the inside of the package was all wet &amp; sticky.  One can had a leak &amp; was completely empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to package them better.</li>

I still think Adorn is the best hairspray on the market though.  I would like to have gotten the original unscented Adorn so it didn&#x27;t overpower my colognes but you no longer sell it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE ADORN AND HAVE USED IT FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.  I WISH MORE STORES WOULD CARRY IT, SO I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO ORDER IT IN LARGER QUANTITY.</li>
            <li> Adorn in the blue can is perfect for quick sets. You can roll you hair and spray, leave rollers in until dry.&lt;br /&gt;It works well with ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> I tried many different hair sprays since they quit selling Adorn in the stores.  I am so grateful to find this one.&lt;br /&gt;I used the pink  can for 35 years.  My hair is totally unmanageable without Adorn.</li>
            <li> Best Hairspray ever!!  Flexible, clear, fresh scent and long lasting.  Not available in any stores in MN; can only find it online.</li>
            <li> Received on time, product came in good package, and love the products....no complaints at all....will use again and recommmend to friends</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my mom and she is so happy I found it for her.  It is the only hair spray she will use.  Service was excellent.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Every other time I have ordered the product, it came in a box with a dozen cans. This time I only got 3 cans. I can&#x27;t believe 3 cans cost 18.00. Is this correct?</li>
            <li> My mom and I have used this hairspray since the 60&#x27;s. it is now getting impossible to find even online.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t keep producing it since so many people love it. It is a great hairspray.</li>
            <li> I have used Adorn Hairspray for a long time, but recently I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding it in the stores in my area.  I had found it in one market near me, but now they don&#x27;t seem to be selling it anymore.  I don&#x27;t know why, because it holds your hair great and your hair feels soft, not tacky.</li>
            <li> What can i say it is what it is a hairspray and a good one been around for years and my mother loves it.</li>
            <li> Great old line product, my wife absolutely loves this brand.  Seems stores have discontinued it.  She swears by it, not too much build-up with use, according to her!</li>
            <li> It is so much better than other hair spray for the stiff hair products.  It allows you to comb thru your hair if necessary.</li>
            <li> Thought the cans were the usual spray tops. These are the ones that have the cap on them. Not the same spray consistency.</li>
            <li> I always try to use adorn hair spray and it is getting harder and harder to find. I love that I found it on Amazon. Thanks for carrying it. I like the pink can better but this is fine for now.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time and have ordered it on line as the local stores do not carry it.  The non build up statement is true.  It hold well but does not make your hair feel like cardboard</li>
            <li> This spray is an oldie but goodie! However, it is very hard to find. If you have order it, as I do, it is also over priced!</li>
            <li> This is a hairspray that has been around for a very long time but I&#x27;ve never been able to find another that works as well for me. I have fine thin hair and Adorn does not weigh it down but is effective. JMHO</li>
            <li> I love Adorn. It is all that I used in high school,a million years ago! So happy to have located it again for sale.Planning to reorder shortly. 5 stars to seller and Adorn!</li>
            <li> This is a &amp;#34;tried and true&amp;#34; product that has worked well with my hair styles, now and in the past. Good product and an excellent shipment,  Thanks for a wonderful hair spray. Keep up the good work.</li>
