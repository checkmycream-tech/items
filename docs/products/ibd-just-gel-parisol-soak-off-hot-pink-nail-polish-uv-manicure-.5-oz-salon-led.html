            <li>and it just such a bright color.</li>

            <li>This is a very pretty color.</li>
            <li>Good size for price (I often find smaller size bottles for higher price).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a gel polish fanatic so was pleased to see an inexpensive one on the market and couldn&#x27;t wait to do my own manicure!</li>
            <li>Super fun color for spring and summer.</li>

            <li>This is a bright pink with a hint of purple polish.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it -&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li>So bright pink!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying IBD for a long time and love the product!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a hot pink - super cute!</li>
            <li>This product is just as good at nearly half the price.</li>
            <li>Better than red carpet.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more idb colors.</li>
            <li>The first day I wore it.</li>
            <li>I did three coats and turned out really pretty, would recommend if you are into brights.</li>
            <li>I do have to tell you if you are looking for a more true hot pink color this isn&#x27;t really that</li>
            <li>It has a good amount of pigment in it but also has a tiny bit of shrink back so swipe the edge before curing.</li>
            <li>This is such a great neon pink!  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s hot pink but slightly more magenta undertone</li>
            <li>Love the Product, the color really pops and it stays on just as long as the gelish products..</li>
            <li>It dries really fast with LED lamp.</li>
            <li>it is very birght and goes on very evenly.  </li>
            <li>Holds up very well, applied 3 coats.</li>
            <li>and I used it alone on toes for a stunning pedicure and also with other intense ibd colors for a tie dyed leopard print nail.</li>
            <li>It lasts longer than many other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I have had more compliments on this polish than any other ever.  </li>
            <li>It is a little more watery (not a lot) than a few I have just because it does take two coats, with that said, the second coat covers completely and beautifully.</li>
            <li>I have never used the OPI Gel, but to me, the IBD and Gelish are both cost worthy and last</li>
            <li>great quality for the price i used it with gelish base and top coat</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I normally use CND gel polish but decided to give this a try because of the affordability.</li>
            <li>polish is a good thin consistency.</li>
            <li>This color is very vibrant hot pink.  </li>
            <li>I was soooo excited to get a Bright pink color, and unfortunately it was out of stock after I already paid</li>
            <li>The color is very hot pink; the bottle color may be a little misleading and too light.  </li>
            <li>The brush is much more bristly or hard</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this on for a week so far</li>
            <li>This product is working well so far.  </li>
            <li>It takes 2 coats to look completely covered.</li>
            <li>This is my fav color of the IBD so far.  </li>
            <li>I cured this with an LED light and it lasted as long as any other home gel polish does (2 weeks).</li>
            <li>It lasts very long and the color is vibrant!</li>
            <li>So far ibd gel polishes are the only polishes that harden.  </li>
            <li>i used three thin coats and the color look rich and vibrant.</li>
            <li>Went to indoor golf and under black light was neon pink.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty buy it chips and peels in less than a day.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li>at least I got a full refund.</li>

            <li> , it&#x27;s hot pink but slightly more magenta undertone</li>
            <li> Love the Product, the color really pops and it stays on just as long as the gelish products..</li>
            <li> It dries really fast with LED lamp.</li>
            <li> it is very birght and goes on very evenly.  </li>
            <li> Holds up very well, applied 3 coats.</li>
            <li> and I used it alone on toes for a stunning pedicure and also with other intense ibd colors for a tie dyed leopard print nail.</li>
            <li> It lasts longer than many other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I have had more compliments on this polish than any other ever.  </li>
            <li> It is a little more watery (not a lot) than a few I have just because it does take two coats, with that said, the second coat covers completely and beautifully.</li>
            <li> I have never used the OPI Gel, but to me, the IBD and Gelish are both cost worthy and last</li>
            <li> great quality for the price i used it with gelish base and top coat</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I normally use CND gel polish but decided to give this a try because of the affordability.</li>
            <li> polish is a good thin consistency.</li>
            <li> This color is very vibrant hot pink.  </li>
            <li> I was soooo excited to get a Bright pink color, and unfortunately it was out of stock after I already paid</li>
            <li> The color is very hot pink; the bottle color may be a little misleading and too light.  </li>
            <li> The brush is much more bristly or hard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this on for a week so far</li>
            <li> This product is working well so far.  </li>
            <li> It takes 2 coats to look completely covered.</li>
            <li> This is my fav color of the IBD so far.  </li>
            <li> I cured this with an LED light and it lasted as long as any other home gel polish does (2 weeks).</li>
            <li> It lasts very long and the color is vibrant!</li>
            <li> So far ibd gel polishes are the only polishes that harden.  </li>
            <li> i used three thin coats and the color look rich and vibrant.</li>
            <li> Went to indoor golf and under black light was neon pink.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty buy it chips and peels in less than a day.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> at least I got a full refund.</li>
            <li> All the other gel polishes I&#x27;ve used so far do not harden.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is sometimes it leaks if I don&#x27;t set it up straight.</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive and has lasted just as long the pricier brands.</li>
            <li> The first coat goes on very thin, but the second coat makes up for it.</li>
            <li> For some reason the pink leaks around the cap causing a big mess every time I paint my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to only buy the gelish harmony brand gel polish until i saw IBD was a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> This is a brighter pink, but not neon.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really not much to say about it.</li>
            <li> mixed it with gellish base and top coat with no problems.</li>
            <li> If you like neon pink then this is your color!</li>
            <li> I have used opi and gelish in the past with no problem, but this one peeled off the second day of wearing.</li>
            <li> Have to be very careful.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> The polish itself is still good, just a terrible brush!!!!  </li>
            <li> but at half the cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really frustrating and a BIG MESS</li>
            <li> It leaves it streaky and uneven.  </li>
            <li> Will try other colors now!!!</li>
            <li> The white cap that the brush is attached to, is bigger or wider, and those brushes are terrible.  </li>
            <li> and I am tough on my nails since I garden and run a daycare.</li>

            <li> Really pretty color - looks gorgeous on. It&#x27;s my favorite color out of all my nailpolishes and believe me - I have a lot!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite color out of all the IBD colors that I have. Makes me look tanner and it just such a bright color. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a neon pink polish but it is a great fuchsia. It took 3 coats to achieve true opacity and it worked well with the rest of my Gelish set. I cured this with an LED light and it lasted as long as any other home gel polish does (2 weeks). I rated it four because I think any polish that takes &gt;1 coat has some room for improvement.</li>
            <li> beautiful color. nice and bright (part coral/part pink)</li>
            <li> Great gelish! Great color! Tons of complements! Totally worth it -&lt;br /&gt;Glad to add this color to my summer collection of gel polish!</li>
            <li> I love this color - and it lasts about two weeks. I have never used the OPI Gel, but to me, the IBD and Gelish are both cost worthy and last equally long.&lt;br /&gt;I got an OPI gel manicure at the salon once, and the IBD I did at home myself lasted longer!</li>
            <li> The color is amazing and have received many compliments!  It lasts longer than many other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It dries really fast with LED lamp. The finish is perfect. Better than red carpet. The color is so beautiful, very stand-out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying IBD for a long time and love the product!  For some reason the company has changed some of the brushes on them, I&#x27;m assuming some of the newer ones maybe.  The white cap that the brush is attached to, is bigger or wider, and those brushes are terrible.  The brush is much more bristly or hard so when you try to apply the polish is doesn&#x27;t go on smooth.  It leaves it streaky and uneven.  I hated it so much that I took another color similar to it and wiped it off and then used the good brush to apply it, but then had to wipe it off when I was done.  The polish itself is still good, just a terrible brush!!!!  I have another color that is the same way.</li>
            <li> I have not used this color yet, but it looks just like I wanted.  I a nail tech and have used this brand a lot.  Its a really good gel polish and I am sure that the color will be great.</li>
            <li> True to picture.  Good size for price (I often find smaller size bottles for higher price).  Two coats is perfect.  Love the color.</li>
            <li> I love this color!  it is very birght and goes on very evenly.  Looks great with 2 coats, I have gotten many compliments</li>
            <li> Love the color of this polish. Only negative is sometimes it leaks if I don&#x27;t set it up straight. But I still like it!</li>
            <li> I wore this color six weeks in a row because nothing else looks as good in the summer ( and I own almost 100 colors).</li>
            <li> I was worried that this color wasnt going to be as bright as the neon by Harmony buts it&#x27;s better and cheaper!!!  So bright pink! LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I own several IBD colors and I love them all.  This color is bright, but not too bright.  Just right for the summer!  I will continue to order more colors!  Lasts a full 2 weeks and I am tough on my nails since I garden and run a daycare.</li>
            <li> Great price for gel polish. Very easy to apply. The first coat goes on very thin, but the second coat makes up for it. I&#x27;m officially switching to IBD gel polish. I&#x27;ve had this on for a week so far and it&#x27;s wearing just as well as Gelish and Shellac but at half the cost. Love it.</li>
            <li> Very nice bright color!! Holds up very well, applied 3 coats. Perfect spring/ summer color. I have got sooo many compliments on it, definitely a great color for a great price :)</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this color. Many compliments. Stays very well, better than the top brand names. Comes off smooth and easily with acetone on cotton and foil.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that there is a gel nail polish that is cheaper.  This polish looks great on and lasted the same amount of time as the higher priced items.</li>
            <li> I have had more compliments on this polish than any other ever.  It is  a very bright pink.&lt;br /&gt;I mixed it with gellish base and top coat with no problems.</li>
            <li> I used to only buy the gelish harmony brand gel polish until i saw IBD was a little cheaper. I decided to go ahead and buy and I am so glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this color first off. It&#x27;s a hot pink - super cute! I like to use it for accents or leopard prints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish is a good thin consistency. I am going to start buying IBD from now on! Plus, I feel like this color lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this gel polish. I started out with Gelish at $15 per bottle. This product is just as good at nearly half the price. Colors are great and application is easy.</li>
            <li> So far ibd gel polishes are the only polishes that harden.  All the other gel polishes I&#x27;ve used so far do not harden.  It&#x27;s really frustrating and a BIG MESS TOO! I think ibd gel polish is the best compared to what  I&#x27;ve purchased from other manufactures.</li>
            <li> Awesome color! My clients love this, it&#x27;s so bright!</li>
            <li> I normally use CND gel polish but decided to give this a try because of the affordability. I love this brand, and I also like the fact that they have a variety of colors.</li>
            <li> Love it I use this often! Last forever</li>
            <li> This is a brighter pink, but not neon.</li>
            <li> Best color and ibd polish stays on for 2 weeks..no peeling or chipping. Best polish I have used so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a gel polish fanatic so was pleased to see an inexpensive one on the market and couldn&#x27;t wait to do my own manicure! This product is working well so far.  I&#x27;ve almost had the polish on a week and no problems.  The color is very hot pink; the bottle color may be a little misleading and too light.  I like the color and product and will be purchasing more IBD colors. You can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Its a very very pretty color! And the best thing is that it is cheaper than gelish it is the same thing! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great size bottle for the price.  It is a perfect shade of hot pink.  I get compliments whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this gel polish!  The color is bright and I have received a ton of compliments! A side from being a great color, this is the first IBD polish I&#x27;ve used  and I have no complaints! It is inexpensive and has lasted just as long the pricier brands. :)</li>
            <li> I bought purple and it doesn&#x27;t leak. For some reason the pink leaks around the cap causing a big mess every time I paint my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still love the color though.</li>
            <li> Love this color. Bright pink. Went to indoor golf and under black light was neon pink. Happy Happy Happy about this color!</li>

            <li> Love this color!! It is the perfect Girly girl Barbie pink. Super bright and only takes 2-3 coats to get it to the label color.</li>
            <li> Thumbs up! It lasts very long and the color is vibrant! Also, it came in a bigger size bottle, so it&#x27;s definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> I was soooo excited to get a Bright pink color, and unfortunately it was out of stock after I already paid at least I got a full refund.</li>

I will definitely buy more idb colors.</li>
            <li> This is a bright pink with a hint of purple polish. It is almost neon it is so bright. I absolutely love it. It takes 2 coats to look completely covered. It is a little more watery (not a lot) than a few I have just because it does take two coats, with that said, the second coat covers completely and beautifully. Super fun color for spring and summer.</li>
            <li> Perfect hot pink, I love it! Went on right and stayed on! :) didn&#x27;t shrink or spread out while under the lamp.  Awesome polish for my gel polish collection.</li>
            <li> This polish is low quality. The color is pretty buy it chips and peels in less than a day. I have to mix it with another brand so that it lasts.</li>
            <li> This is my fav color of the IBD so far.  It is bright and a color perfect for summer.  It goes on smoothly and dries bubble free.</li>

            <li> This is such a great neon pink!  I am in love with it and it&#x27;s perfect for summer as a pedicure and the coverage is pretty good.  If nothing else, this is simply a fun color to add to your polish collection!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and color. Came on time and my daughter love this color buy it great for a spring or summer color</li>
            <li> I have used opi and gelish in the past with no problem, but this one peeled off the second day of wearing. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a very bright summer color and I used it alone on toes for a stunning pedicure and also with other intense ibd colors for a tie dyed leopard print nail. It has a good amount of pigment in it but also has a tiny bit of shrink back so swipe the edge before curing.</li>

            <li> Gorgeous color, very bright, has lasted well over a week, very happy with this purchase! What a great brand and buy!</li>
            <li> The first day I wore it., no joke four people commented and it&#x27;s so bright that even people who were like 10 feet away were like, I like your nails...lol. I do have to tell you if you are looking for a more true hot pink color this isn&#x27;t really that, it&#x27;s hot pink but slightly more magenta undertone but it&#x27;s beautiful. I did three coats and turned out really pretty, would recommend if you are into brights.</li>
            <li> This is such a great color. Stays on good. I get compliments all the time when I wear this. I love it!</li>
