            <li>Bare Minerals foundation is the best foundation ever made.</li>
            <li>the product is great and the delivery was fast!</li>
            <li>The color match is perfect and I use this product daily.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation and recommend it to anyone who wants a great foundation.</li>
            <li>HOW do you get that top off ?</li>
            <li>But looked ok on.</li>
            <li>I just wish it covered up more blemishes on my face.</li>
            <li>The cakey look doesn&#x27;t look all to appealing.</li>
            <li>why is the price so much better here....</li>
            <li>Simple good business to bring you a great product at a lower price.  </li>
            <li>but that was ok.</li>
            <li>Have been using their products for about five or more years now.  </li>
            <li>have had this before and love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just one more way to keep harmful chemicals out of my body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen my face look better.</li>
            <li>If you use the correct moisturizer you will love the results.</li>
            <li>I love bareMinerals products.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation.</li>
            <li>Love the quality of this powder.  </li>
            <li>Together with the Mineral Veil, it&#x27;s quite lovely.</li>
            <li>The entire line is great!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have used the basic BareMinerals for years - I am happy with the Matte!  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes..</li>
            <li>Covers much better thab</li>
            <li>but as far as going to special events where I want to look flawless, I choose a foundation with more coverage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal True Match powder (their color options match my skin tone), and my face always had a nice glean at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>i love this product and it&#x27;s supper easy to put on.  </li>
            <li>This keeps my complexion clear, covers imperfections, gives a beautiful light all over, all day coverage.  </li>
            <li>I love how it covers ever so lightly</li>
            <li>My husband was completely honest helping me get the right shade.  </li>
            <li>I like the original, non-matte better.</li>
            <li>I have been using the original BE medium beige for many years...</li>
            <li>Its really nice came fast too :-).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a happy Bare Minerals user now.  </li>
            <li>So glad I was able to find what I needed on Amazon and for such a good price.</li>
            <li>Product works just fine,</li>
            <li>This is my go-to foundation of every day work because it goes on easy and is light on my face all day..</li>
            <li>I am a huge BareMinerals fan.</li>
            <li>This is truly a fantastic foundation.  </li>
            <li>Smooth application and hides flaws without looking like you are wearing a mask.</li>
            <li>The matte foundation is perfect for me, and I can wear the medium beige color all year round.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it about 2 weeks and noticed it doesn&#x27;t cover my imperfections like the original did</li>
            <li>; matte, original, shimmer, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She light that effect, taking things lighter rather than matching my true shade.  </li>
            <li>The matte foundation reduces my shine versus the original version</li>
            <li>I am NOT disappointed.</li>
            <li>super light.</li>
            <li>It looks really good when I first put it on, but it does not last more than 2 hours.  </li>
            <li>Most people do not have much change throughout the year.  </li>
            <li>I use Shiseido&#x27;s foundation (stipling) brush for full coverage.</li>
            <li>Its not a bad thing, but it makes me not so inclined to purchase again.</li>
            <li>I love the new lid that keeps it from shaking into the cap every time you travel with it!  </li>
            <li>It is absolutly flawless once on and has a subtle amount of sun protection as well.</li>
            <li>quick delivery&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li>The item came quickly.</li>
            <li>The first time, the salesgirl tried to sell me a shade too light (ghostly).  </li>
            <li>Some very hot and humid days</li>
            <li>This makeup is a great price and beats the quality of most more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>Love bare escentuals covers nicely and not heavy like foundation is.</li>
            <li>I tried the original foundation at first and it was too shimmery for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I did just discover their line of solid compacts that I also love!  </li>
            <li>After paying to have it delivered, this just isn&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I was very happy when my package came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>Love the way it covers while looking natural.</li>
            <li>This is a foundation that is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>It applies easily with a foundation brush, looks very natural, and stays on all day, even with no primer.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE Bare Minerals!</li>
            <li>I love Bare Escentuals BareMinerals MATTE SPF 15 Foundation,</li>
            <li>I love bare essentials</li>
            <li>I love Bare Escentuals and have been using it for over 5 years.  </li>
            <li>Not as much coverage as I expected, but still a good product.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted just what I would of got at the store but for less keep up the good work</li>
            <li>I used the Bare Minerals starting kit 4 years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Stop in and have a cosmetician assist you with application, then wear it home and check it out in natural light.  </li>
            <li>Love the matte foundation, it truly covers all your facial flaws, without looking like your wearing a ton of makeup.</li>
            <li>Exactly as shown.  </li>
            <li>pretty bad!&lt;br /&gt;never</li>
            <li>Nice matte finish, helps with my occasional oily areas better than other powders.</li>
            <li>This is the full sized container just like you would get at the store, I wasn&#x27;t sure from the product description or any other reviews.</li>
            <li>The matte foundation from Bare Minerals seems to have a little more coverage than the original, but it still doesnt give me the Full coverage I want out of a foundation for special events and going out.  </li>
            <li>I use this makeup daily and find it on Amazon much more reasonable than purchasing in stores.  </li>
            <li>Yes this is the original Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li>Its great but so little I had it only for two month</li>
            <li>I really, really wanted to like this -</li>
            <li>I really like the matte finish.</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li>I am very pelased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I use the Matte with the oil control primer because i have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>and this has been the only product so far that doesn&#x27;t seem to cause more oil during the day.</li>
            <li>Same great product I would get from BareMinerals but for less!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the other formula&#x27;s shine, but it does cover better.</li>
            <li>Bare Essentials Medium is much better than the oil based facial beauty products.</li>
            <li>It really stays on longer and helps maintain shine better than the other!  </li>
            <li>Hands down my favorite foundation.</li>
            <li>highly recomended.</li>
            <li>have been using bare minerals for years and this is absolutely the real deal</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have been using Bare Minerals for many years and have several containers here (coloring changes slightly from winter to summer as I soak up sun quickly and my skin tone darkens).  </li>
            <li>Bare minerals is hands down my favorite make up.</li>
            <li>As for the makeup itself, I have very sensitive skin and don&#x27;t like to look like I&#x27;m wearing a pound of makeup.  </li>
            <li>Very professional</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and didn&#x27;t realize the matte was going to make my dry skin so much more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I feel a little ripped off and will definitely NOT purchase this product again, (unless I get MORE of what I thought I was getting).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to wash my face in the early evening.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have the same coverage as the real... And ran out quicker...</li>
            <li>My skin stays soft and clear.</li>
            <li>I used to use the normal bare minerals but the mica made me break out</li>
            <li>and i recommend it to anyone looking for a natural look .</li>
            <li>I like using natural ingredients on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I like it too its soft on yout face.</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily and I did not want any extra shine.  </li>
            <li>Looks natural too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to look natural so don&#x27;t expect to be caking on lots of foundation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really do not worry if I wear to sleep accidently, though that is rare.  </li>
            <li>When I went back I made certain to get a different person.  </li>
            <li>they foundation was sent to me timely although I live in a rural area my order was waiting for me in the mail room-vs in my box</li>
            <li>I have always used Bare Minerals medium beige (and always matte since it came out) but this is not medium beige!</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals keeps up with that.  </li>
            <li>If you consider the savings compared to the Bare Escentuals store or Sephora, I&#x27;ve saved a ton over the years.  </li>
            <li>all the bare minerals products are just divine...</li>
            <li>It took me a while to get use to bare minerals...</li>
            <li>I have been using Bare Escentuals for years</li>
            <li>I have used Bare Minerals for years and this is my go-to powder.  </li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I was expecting, arrived even sooner than expected. will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>I also have very oily skin which might be the reason it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>I am not sure about this product, the smell is not the same and the container isn&#x27;t the same as my original Bare Escentuals I bought at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I even tried using the bare minerals primer first, but this stuff just melts away and a few hours in, you can see all the imperfections in my skin.  </li>
            <li>It really has a different consistency from the other BE matte foundations</li>
            <li>I bought this after using just the regular bare minerals foundation for about 7 years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and have tried others during that time and always come back to my Bare Minerals matte foundation.  </li>
            <li>I do have to change one shade in winter (or mix it down a bit) depending on how much I&#x27;m out in summer.  </li>

            <li> Covers much better thab</li>
            <li> but as far as going to special events where I want to look flawless, I choose a foundation with more coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal True Match powder (their color options match my skin tone), and my face always had a nice glean at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> i love this product and it&#x27;s supper easy to put on.  </li>
            <li> This keeps my complexion clear, covers imperfections, gives a beautiful light all over, all day coverage.  </li>
            <li> I love how it covers ever so lightly</li>
            <li> My husband was completely honest helping me get the right shade.  </li>
            <li> I like the original, non-matte better.</li>
            <li> I have been using the original BE medium beige for many years...</li>
            <li> Its really nice came fast too :-).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a happy Bare Minerals user now.  </li>
            <li> So glad I was able to find what I needed on Amazon and for such a good price.</li>
            <li> Product works just fine,</li>
            <li> This is my go-to foundation of every day work because it goes on easy and is light on my face all day..</li>
            <li> I am a huge BareMinerals fan.</li>
            <li> This is truly a fantastic foundation.  </li>
            <li> Smooth application and hides flaws without looking like you are wearing a mask.</li>
            <li> The matte foundation is perfect for me, and I can wear the medium beige color all year round.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about 2 weeks and noticed it doesn&#x27;t cover my imperfections like the original did</li>
            <li> ; matte, original, shimmer, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She light that effect, taking things lighter rather than matching my true shade.  </li>
            <li> The matte foundation reduces my shine versus the original version</li>
            <li> I am NOT disappointed.</li>
            <li> super light.</li>
            <li> It looks really good when I first put it on, but it does not last more than 2 hours.  </li>
            <li> Most people do not have much change throughout the year.  </li>
            <li> I use Shiseido&#x27;s foundation (stipling) brush for full coverage.</li>
            <li> Its not a bad thing, but it makes me not so inclined to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love the new lid that keeps it from shaking into the cap every time you travel with it!  </li>
            <li> It is absolutly flawless once on and has a subtle amount of sun protection as well.</li>
            <li> quick delivery&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li> The item came quickly.</li>
            <li> The first time, the salesgirl tried to sell me a shade too light (ghostly).  </li>
            <li> Some very hot and humid days</li>
            <li> This makeup is a great price and beats the quality of most more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> Love bare escentuals covers nicely and not heavy like foundation is.</li>
            <li> I tried the original foundation at first and it was too shimmery for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I did just discover their line of solid compacts that I also love!  </li>
            <li> After paying to have it delivered, this just isn&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I was very happy when my package came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Love the way it covers while looking natural.</li>
            <li> This is a foundation that is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> It applies easily with a foundation brush, looks very natural, and stays on all day, even with no primer.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE Bare Minerals!</li>
            <li> I love Bare Escentuals BareMinerals MATTE SPF 15 Foundation,</li>
            <li> I love bare essentials</li>
            <li> I love Bare Escentuals and have been using it for over 5 years.  </li>
            <li> Not as much coverage as I expected, but still a good product.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted just what I would of got at the store but for less keep up the good work</li>
            <li> I used the Bare Minerals starting kit 4 years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Stop in and have a cosmetician assist you with application, then wear it home and check it out in natural light.  </li>
            <li> Love the matte foundation, it truly covers all your facial flaws, without looking like your wearing a ton of makeup.</li>
            <li> Exactly as shown.  </li>
            <li> pretty bad!&lt;br /&gt;never</li>
            <li> Nice matte finish, helps with my occasional oily areas better than other powders.</li>
            <li> This is the full sized container just like you would get at the store, I wasn&#x27;t sure from the product description or any other reviews.</li>
            <li> The matte foundation from Bare Minerals seems to have a little more coverage than the original, but it still doesnt give me the Full coverage I want out of a foundation for special events and going out.  </li>
            <li> I use this makeup daily and find it on Amazon much more reasonable than purchasing in stores.  </li>
            <li> Yes this is the original Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li> Its great but so little I had it only for two month</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to like this -</li>
            <li> I really like the matte finish.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li> I am very pelased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I use the Matte with the oil control primer because i have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> and this has been the only product so far that doesn&#x27;t seem to cause more oil during the day.</li>
            <li> Same great product I would get from BareMinerals but for less!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the other formula&#x27;s shine, but it does cover better.</li>
            <li> Bare Essentials Medium is much better than the oil based facial beauty products.</li>
            <li> It really stays on longer and helps maintain shine better than the other!  </li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite foundation.</li>
            <li> highly recomended.</li>
            <li> have been using bare minerals for years and this is absolutely the real deal</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have been using Bare Minerals for many years and have several containers here (coloring changes slightly from winter to summer as I soak up sun quickly and my skin tone darkens).  </li>
            <li> Bare minerals is hands down my favorite make up.</li>
            <li> As for the makeup itself, I have very sensitive skin and don&#x27;t like to look like I&#x27;m wearing a pound of makeup.  </li>
            <li> Very professional</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and didn&#x27;t realize the matte was going to make my dry skin so much more noticeable.</li>
            <li> I feel a little ripped off and will definitely NOT purchase this product again, (unless I get MORE of what I thought I was getting).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to wash my face in the early evening.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the same coverage as the real... And ran out quicker...</li>
            <li> My skin stays soft and clear.</li>
            <li> I used to use the normal bare minerals but the mica made me break out</li>
            <li> and i recommend it to anyone looking for a natural look .</li>
            <li> I like using natural ingredients on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I like it too its soft on yout face.</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily and I did not want any extra shine.  </li>
            <li> Looks natural too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to look natural so don&#x27;t expect to be caking on lots of foundation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really do not worry if I wear to sleep accidently, though that is rare.  </li>
            <li> When I went back I made certain to get a different person.  </li>
            <li> they foundation was sent to me timely although I live in a rural area my order was waiting for me in the mail room-vs in my box</li>
            <li> I have always used Bare Minerals medium beige (and always matte since it came out) but this is not medium beige!</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals keeps up with that.  </li>
            <li> If you consider the savings compared to the Bare Escentuals store or Sephora, I&#x27;ve saved a ton over the years.  </li>
            <li> all the bare minerals products are just divine...</li>
            <li> It took me a while to get use to bare minerals...</li>
            <li> I have been using Bare Escentuals for years</li>
            <li> I have used Bare Minerals for years and this is my go-to powder.  </li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I was expecting, arrived even sooner than expected. will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I also have very oily skin which might be the reason it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about this product, the smell is not the same and the container isn&#x27;t the same as my original Bare Escentuals I bought at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I even tried using the bare minerals primer first, but this stuff just melts away and a few hours in, you can see all the imperfections in my skin.  </li>
            <li> It really has a different consistency from the other BE matte foundations</li>
            <li> I bought this after using just the regular bare minerals foundation for about 7 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and have tried others during that time and always come back to my Bare Minerals matte foundation.  </li>
            <li> I do have to change one shade in winter (or mix it down a bit) depending on how much I&#x27;m out in summer.  </li>
            <li> As the price was a little high</li>
            <li> Really was not sure what to expect when I ordered this product.</li>
            <li> , my skin has developed a few pimples, some red spots on my nose and just feels overall greasy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s not Bare Minerals or</li>
            <li> BUT I was surprised at how LITTLE product I actually received inside the container.</li>
            <li> I stopped buying Bare Escentuals and tried the other brands of mineral make up.  </li>
            <li> you are not sure of your color choice you can head to a Bare Escentials store, Boston Store (used to carry it) or call around to some of the major department stores.  </li>
            <li> the foundation itself is different from what I expected or use to have.</li>
            <li> I tried other products similar to this.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and will never go back to other types of makeup.</li>
            <li> I have been using bare minerals for a few years.  </li>
            <li> I wear it daily and a container typically lasts me between 2 and 3 months.</li>
            <li> Not sure, so hard to find the right shade</li>
            <li> I laugh when I read the questionable comments as the packing has changed slightly from year to year and with different products</li>
            <li> why I hated it at first was because I have super dry skin in the winter and summer</li>
            <li> I have only used Amazon a few times before so I am no pro at ordering what I need online, but I needed makeup</li>
            <li> The color choices cover a wide range.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday but for those with imperfections this does not cover well if you only plan on using this foundation.</li>
            <li> I ever expected</li>
            <li> Not much coverage unless you use this over concealer and other products.</li>
            <li> Wear nothing with it, or very little extra if going out.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful to NOT over powder!</li>
            <li> Would not use any other makeup</li>
            <li> Will not use any other make up</li>
            <li> I have a fairly dark complexion in summer that fades in winter.  </li>
            <li> It is very orange in color and the texture is weird.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes from my previous experience and the other reviews but am very disappointed with the name change and apparently the new formula as well.</li>
            <li> I would pay less to get some at the store.</li>
            <li> but it seems a little like just the powder you use after your foundation</li>
            <li> I have a high-stress job with little time for primping.</li>
            <li> Just apply it after a few touch ups and your off to start your day,</li>
            <li> its just a plain knock off.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> She was a little shocked and made certain I was &#x27;matched&#x27; correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very uneven skin tone with lots of redness on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical seeing that other reviewers had said it dried their faces and didn&#x27;t cover well.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t bad but not as satisfactory as the Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> the coverage is not good at all.</li>
            <li> returned, ordered wrong color</li>
            <li> Fake from China....</li>
            <li> maybe I got the wrong item?</li>
            <li> again will i use this crap again</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The color match is perfect and I use this product daily. My objection is that it wears off within 4-6 hours and must be refreshed. I also have very oily skin which might be the reason it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I bought this after using just the regular bare minerals foundation for about 7 years.  I love this one even more!  It really stays on longer and helps maintain shine better than the other!  I love the new lid that keeps it from shaking into the cap every time you travel with it!  DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals foundation is the best foundation ever made. I love this foundation and recommend it to anyone who wants a great foundation.</li>
            <li> returned, ordered wrong color</li>
            <li> i have been using this for awhile .  It works great on oily skin.  the only think i would like to see improvement in is  HOW do you get that top off ? because there is quite a bit of powder left in there that cannot be gotten out.and that is a wast of money.  i would recommend it  It has great coverage and goes on well with a brush.</li>
            <li> I used the Bare Minerals starting kit 4 years ago and loved it. As the price was a little high I tried other products similar to this. They weren&#x27;t bad but not as satisfactory as the Bare Minerals. I recently decided to go ahead and get the larger size and get the coverage that only this could provide. I&#x27;ve been using it about 2 weeks and noticed it doesn&#x27;t cover my imperfections like the original did, my skin has developed a few pimples, some red spots on my nose and just feels overall greasy by the end of the day. I can&#x27;t wait to wash my face in the early evening. I had high hopes from my previous experience and the other reviews but am very disappointed with the name change and apparently the new formula as well. I&#x27;m going back to Avon.</li>
            <li> I like the product and I like the locking feature, BUT I was surprised at how LITTLE product I actually received inside the container. WHERE&#x27;S THE BEEF, or should I say POWDER?!  I feel a little ripped off and will definitely NOT purchase this product again, (unless I get MORE of what I thought I was getting).</li>
            <li> Fake from China.... Usable though.  Doesn&#x27;t have the same coverage as the real... And ran out quicker... But looked ok on.</li>
            <li> I like the original, non-matte better. I have dry skin and didn&#x27;t realize the matte was going to make my dry skin so much more noticeable.</li>
            <li> I stopped buying Bare Escentuals and tried the other brands of mineral make up.  Never again, this is the best, now I remember why I loved it before. The shades are perfect and it feels so nice on my skin.  I really do not worry if I wear to sleep accidently, though that is rare.  My skin stays soft and clear.</li>
            <li> Bare Essentials Medium is much better than the oil based facial beauty products. I just wish it covered up more blemishes on my face.</li>
            <li> this is the best product.  my skin looks flawless and it takes its color really.  i love this product and it&#x27;s supper easy to put on.  highly recomended.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Thanks!!&lt;br /&gt;  We ladies all know this great product! Just be careful to NOT over powder! The cakey look doesn&#x27;t look all to appealing.</li>
            <li> Always consistently perfect!  Love this make up, never makes me break out and looks great once I realized the best way to apply it :)</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to like this - I used to use the normal bare minerals but the mica made me break out so I decided to try the Matte.  It looks really good when I first put it on, but it does not last more than 2 hours.  I even tried using the bare minerals primer first, but this stuff just melts away and a few hours in, you can see all the imperfections in my skin.  I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> This is truly a fantastic foundation.  It is powder, however it doesn&#x27;t cake up on your face. It covers flaws but doesn&#x27;t feel or look like you have it on.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about this product, the smell is not the same and the container isn&#x27;t the same as my original Bare Escentuals I bought at Macy&#x27;s. I guess it l</li>
            <li> Not as much coverage as I expected, but still a good product. I ended up using it as a finishing powder, over my foundation, instead of as a single-product foundation.  I don&#x27;t like the other formula&#x27;s shine, but it does cover better.</li>
            <li> Yes this is the original Bare Minerals.  I laugh when I read the questionable comments as the packing has changed slightly from year to year and with different products; matte, original, shimmer, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Bare Minerals for many years and have several containers here (coloring changes slightly from winter to summer as I soak up sun quickly and my skin tone darkens).  This keeps my complexion clear, covers imperfections, gives a beautiful light all over, all day coverage.  Nothings else compares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why is the price so much better here....well they don&#x27;t have all the overhead folks, no store, no sales people...like that.  Simple good business to bring you a great product at a lower price.  Celebrate that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not sure of your color choice you can head to a Bare Escentials store, Boston Store (used to carry it) or call around to some of the major department stores.  Stop in and have a cosmetician assist you with application, then wear it home and check it out in natural light.  Ask a friend, family member, co-worker, someone that looks at you on a regular basis to give you some feedback on the shade.  The first time, the salesgirl tried to sell me a shade too light (ghostly).  She light that effect, taking things lighter rather than matching my true shade.  My husband was completely honest helping me get the right shade.  When I went back I made certain to get a different person.  She was a little shocked and made certain I was &#x27;matched&#x27; correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a happy Bare Minerals user now.  I do have to change one shade in winter (or mix it down a bit) depending on how much I&#x27;m out in summer.  I have a fairly dark complexion in summer that fades in winter.  Bare Minerals keeps up with that.  Most people do not have much change throughout the year.  This make up blend SO well you probably won&#x27;t have to change like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this make up.  Wear nothing with it, or very little extra if going out.  Sweet.t.</li>
            <li> they foundation was sent to me timely although I live in a rural area my order was waiting for me in the mail room-vs in my box but that was ok. the foundation itself is different from what I expected or use to have. I wanted a concealer but it seems a little like just the powder you use after your foundation and I was not too happy with it! maybe I got the wrong item? its been awhile since I&#x27;ve used te products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you&lt;br /&gt;MELISSA B</li>
            <li> I use this stuff all the time. Just apply it after a few touch ups and your off to start your day,</li>
            <li> After paying to have it delivered, this just isn&#x27;t worth it to me. I would pay less to get some at the store.</li>
            <li> Really was not sure what to expect when I ordered this product. It really has a different consistency from the other BE matte foundations I&#x27;ve bought in the same color. Its not a bad thing, but it makes me not so inclined to purchase again. Product works just fine, no complaints on performance of the foundation. Just doesnt quite feel like I&#x27;m using a BE product.</li>
            <li> Nice color, easy to use, good price.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a cpl years.  Putting it on correctly is key with the brush so it blends.  Nice matte finish, helps with my occasional oily areas better than other powders.</li>
            <li> I have a high-stress job with little time for primping. This makeup goes on, doesn&#x27;t get blotchy during my work day, and stays on for hours.</li>
            <li> I love Bare Escentuals BareMinerals MATTE SPF 15 Foundation, Medium Beige have been using them for about 15 years now and never had a issue with their products!</li>
            <li> I go through about 5-6 of these a year and I always buy them on Amazon.  If you consider the savings compared to the Bare Escentuals store or Sephora, I&#x27;ve saved a ton over the years.  As for the makeup itself, I have very sensitive skin and don&#x27;t like to look like I&#x27;m wearing a pound of makeup.  This has been my go to foundation for 13 years and I&#x27;m so grateful for it!  The matte foundation reduces my shine versus the original version so I stick with the matte makeup.  Love it!</li>
            <li> i love it !!! the product is great and the delivery was fast! Its a great product and i recommend it to anyone looking for a natural look .</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted just what I would of got at the store but for less keep up the good work</li>
            <li> Have been using their products for about five or more years now.  Am always happy.  Like the Foundation especially and have recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. Would not use any other makeup</li>
            <li> After years of trying to find the perfect foundation with the perfect coverage, I finally found it. Smooth application and hides flaws without looking like you are wearing a mask.</li>
            <li> Same great product I would get from BareMinerals but for less!</li>
            <li> I have only used Amazon a few times before so I am no pro at ordering what I need online, but I needed makeup so I ordered through Beauty&#x27;s Boutique. I was very happy when my package came earlier than expected. Very professional and I am a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this make up for years now. Love the way it covers while looking natural.</li>
            <li> Came on time and was just what I wanted! Best price ever! I am a huge BareMinerals fan. So finding this product at a great price is a must.</li>
            <li> I love bare essentials have used for years Will not use any other make up</li>
            <li> have had this before and love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I have been using it for years and will never go back to other types of makeup. I like using natural ingredients on my skin.  It&#x27;s just one more way to keep harmful chemicals out of my body.</li>
            <li> works like a charm!!! Nothing like this stuff - I have tried alternatives and there is no comparison. Magic Makeup!! :)</li>
            <li> all the bare minerals products are just divine...&lt;br /&gt;they do what they claim. I&#x27;ve never seen my face look better.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I was expecting, arrived even sooner than expected. will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Its great but so little I had it only for two month n I&#x27;m out I like it too its soft on yout face. Its really nice came fast too :-).</li>
            <li> It took me a while to get use to bare minerals... I figured out why I hated it at first was because I have super dry skin in the winter and summer it is combination around my t zone areas... If you use the correct moisturizer you will love the results. I love how it covers ever so lightly and it gives me a natuaral look!!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product before and so I keep running out. So glad I was able to find what I needed on Amazon and for such a good price. Thank you</li>
            <li> I love bareMinerals products. I have an oily T-zone area and sensitive skin and these products are great!</li>
            <li> I love this foundation. I was skeptical seeing that other reviewers had said it dried their faces and didn&#x27;t cover well. For me, it works wonders! My face stays matte for quite a while. The medium beige color was perfect for me. I use Shiseido&#x27;s foundation (stipling) brush for full coverage. I would definitely say my skin is improving. Also, I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about summer sweat making me break out from my makeup!</li>
            <li> I have been using bare minerals for a few years.  Love the quality of this powder.  The color choices cover a wide range.  I really like the matte finish.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for oily sensitive skin. I use this everyday but for those with imperfections this does not cover well if you only plan on using this foundation. Must use a spot concealer prior to application for those spots that might still be visible.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing I bought this cheaper than I would at the store an it works great. I will continue to bit this product here</li>
            <li> I use their eyeshadow and mascara.  But this broke me out.  May not be for me.  But always excellent quality. Fast Delivery. Excellent price.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Bare Minerals!</li>
            <li> I use this makeup daily and find it on Amazon much more reasonable than purchasing in stores.  I tell everyone I know,</li>
            <li> I have been using the original BE medium beige for many years...I figured I would give the MATTE version a try...I am NOT disappointed. Good stuff!!</li>
            <li> Love bare escentuals covers nicely and not heavy like foundation is. Plus its good for  your skin!!! Been wearing these products for the last. 15 years!</li>
            <li> This has to be the BEST make up I have EVER used!!! I totally reccomend using this!! I have used it now for 3 years.</li>
            <li> I have always used Bare Minerals medium beige (and always matte since it came out) but this is not medium beige! It is very orange in color and the texture is weird. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s not Bare Minerals or what but something is up. Won&#x27;t order from this seller again</li>
            <li> I have been using Bare Escentuals for years and I have always loved the coverage and weight of this product on my skin.  Delivery was quick, price was excellent.  I am very pelased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The color is very yellow. I get this color from ultra all the time but this was cheaper so I thougt I would try it. Very disappointing! Not try BM. Going in the garbage!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and have tried others during that time and always come back to my Bare Minerals matte foundation.  I tried the original foundation at first and it was too shimmery for my skin.  My skin is very oily and I did not want any extra shine.  The matte foundation is perfect for me, and I can wear the medium beige color all year round.  It applies easily with a foundation brush, looks very natural, and stays on all day, even with no primer.  Because my skin is so oily, I don&#x27;t wear primer to avoid any extra pore blockage.  Some very hot and humid days I need a foundation refresher by the end of the day, but that would happen with any foundation.  I use this foundation with the BareMinerals concealer and Mineral Veil.  This makeup is a great price and beats the quality of most more expensive brands.  I wear it daily and a container typically lasts me between 2 and 3 months.</li>
            <li> I use the Matte with the oil control primer because i have very oily skin. It works great! Best make up ever. I work at a tiki bar on the beach and after a nights work my face is still flawless and not oily.  You feel like your not even wearing make up. super light. Looks natural too. Not cakey.</li>
            <li> quick delivery&lt;br /&gt;great product&lt;br /&gt;I have been using bare minerals for years and this is absolutely the real deal&lt;br /&gt;will definitely be ordering again</li>
            <li> I tend to get that shiny look across the forehead ( like allot of us ) . The Matte look helps with that problem. Together with the Mineral Veil, it&#x27;s quite lovely.</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite foundation.</li>
            <li> most favorite makeup ever covers well and is very light weight ! i will be using only their products from now on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to look natural so don&#x27;t expect to be caking on lots of foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have blemishes, you&#x27;ll still have to apply concealer, etc. If you do apply some sort of base/color balancer, I doubt you&#x27;ll have the issue of the BareMinerals wearing off too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and this has been the only product so far that doesn&#x27;t seem to cause more oil during the day. I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal True Match powder (their color options match my skin tone), and my face always had a nice glean at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Love the matte foundation, it truly covers all your facial flaws, without looking like your wearing a ton of makeup.</li>
            <li> I love Bare Escentuals and have been using it for over 5 years.  This product is one I can&#x27;t be without!</li>
            <li> I love this foundation, it has the best coverage.  I did just discover their line of solid compacts that I also love!  The entire line is great!</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup in the world!</li>
            <li> I have skin problems and this foundation does not irritate my skin and it feels like I don&#x27;t have any makeup on.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I have used Bare Minerals for years and this is my go-to powder.  You can wear it alone or over liquid foundation.  It provides good coverage on its own.</li>
            <li> The matte foundation from Bare Minerals seems to have a little more coverage than the original, but it still doesnt give me the Full coverage I want out of a foundation for special events and going out.  This is my go-to foundation of every day work because it goes on easy and is light on my face all day..but as far as going to special events where I want to look flawless, I choose a foundation with more coverage.</li>
            <li> Exactly as shown.  Loved it!  Same as if purchased in store.  Has shaker top that is reclosable which I love!</li>
            <li> I have used the basic BareMinerals for years - I am happy with the Matte!  Happy to get it on amazon!</li>
            <li> Bare minerals is hands down my favorite make up. It is absolutly flawless once on and has a subtle amount of sun protection as well. The item came quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this product. use it every day, bought it for my daughter and she uses it every day. she works out, looks good</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am over 45 and like that i can apply it heavier in areas where my skin has rosasea or is splotchy.  I also order the sparkly mineral veil.</li>
            <li> its just a plain knock off.&lt;br /&gt;Also the coverage is not good at all. I had to keep replying it on like 3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;That also made me breakout pretty bad!&lt;br /&gt;never again will i use this crap again</li>
            <li> Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes..I go thru it too quickly!&lt;br /&gt;Long therm user of this product.highly recomended! Covers much better thab I ever expected</li>
            <li> This is the full sized container just like you would get at the store, I wasn&#x27;t sure from the product description or any other reviews.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I would recommend to those individuals that do not like to over do it on make-up.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation! I have very uneven skin tone with lots of redness on my cheeks. This foundation evens out my skin color and doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve put a ton of makeup on. This is a foundation that is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Not sure, so hard to find the right shade and I&#x27;ve tried several.  Not much coverage unless you use this over concealer and other products.</li>
