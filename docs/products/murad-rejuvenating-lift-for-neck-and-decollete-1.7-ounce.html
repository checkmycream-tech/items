            <li>ODDER FREE CHEAPER THAN STORE.</li>
            <li>LIGHT FEEL.</li>
            <li>While the item did come packaged in a Murad box it did not bear the Murad hologram to indicate that it was a genuine Murad product</li>
            <li>Immediately after applying the moisturizer, my skin turned BRIGHT RED</li>
            <li>and it certainly did not smell like the genuine article (which fortunately I had on had to compare).</li>
            <li>this product its great for the rejuvenating for the neck and décolleté area and y want to buy other when finished my cram</li>
            <li>I quickly grabbed my cleanser and attempted to wash of all of the Murad products.  </li>
            <li>Came quickly and well packaged.  </li>
            <li>I think this product is worth every dime.</li>
            <li>I liked it well enough to buy again.  </li>
            <li>I did not notice any improvement to my skin at all after using it consistently until gone.</li>
            <li>I tried this product and could tell a difference in the first week.</li>
            <li>Gave better texture to skin suffering through a long winter.</li>
            <li>First, the products will highly irritate your skin.  </li>
            <li>There are a lot of skin care products out there that are over priced and don&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t think it does all that much for my neck, it works really well on the décolleté.</li>
            <li>very disapointed.  </li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>It really makes a difference in hydrating the neck area.  </li>
            <li>I really like Murad Resurgence products, it does not leave my face or neck greasy.</li>
            <li>Murad Resurgence Rejuvenating Lift for neck really works for me.  </li>
            <li>I use only Murad products and this one is just as good as all the other Murad products.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get these products and started with washing my face followed by applying the Murad daily moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands of skincare with various results.  </li>
            <li>Had high recommendations  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50, I live in Hawaii</li>
            <li>One odd thing was I had stinging on my skin in certain areas when I applied this product, but the stinging would go away relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>Works okay but no better than local pharmacy products.</li>
            <li>The message on the customer service line stated that there was a high call volume and recommended calling back at another time.  </li>
            <li>I am a long time user of Murad and this really does temporarily lift the jaw line and it helps with the lines on my neck also.</li>
            <li>The scent is a little off-putting but goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>Every single time I called (I tried calling at all hours of the day), I had the same exact experience....</li>
            <li>It took several hours for my skin to stop burning and finally returned to a normal color.  </li>

            <li> I tend to have dry skin, especially in the winter, and I was recently looking for a product to revive my complexion.  </li>
            <li> used for 2 weeks and lefted my neck dry and red.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait for the long term results.</li>
            <li> #34;I look younger today, wow!&amp;#34;  I probably should use it everyday.</li>

            <li> the lines in my neck showed up worse after i started using this.  would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I had a very bad sunburn years ago that left my neck and chest quite discolored.</li>
            <li> Lifted--no, sadly, but I doubt that any cream can do that.</li>
            <li> I began to smell a faint boiled egg smell from the disposable foam wedge I use to apply the product.</li>
            <li> Have never experienced anything like this before. :( :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The skin firming product that I used was discontinued so I tried this product by Murad because I do love their sunscreen.  I did not notice any improvement to my skin at all after using it consistently until gone.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of skin care products out there that are over priced and don&#x27;t do much. This is not one of them. While I don&#x27;t think it does all that much for my neck, it works really well on the décolleté.</li>
            <li> I had a reaction using this. My neck and chest turned red and broke out in multiple skin bumps. .</li>
            <li> This is my second tube of this product. I had a very bad sunburn years ago that left my neck and chest quite discolored. I tried this product and could tell a difference in the first week. I have been using it ever since. And while that area will never look pristine again, the difference is amazing! And I can wear lower cut tops again!! I think this product is worth every dime.</li>
            <li> Have used this in the past and was eager to start it again!</li>
            <li> very disapointed.  used for 2 weeks and lefted my neck dry and red.  the lines in my neck showed up worse after i started using this.  would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product... Great price... Great service...</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It really works.  I don&#x27;t always use it, but when I do, I catch a look in the mirror and think &amp;#34;I look younger today, wow!&amp;#34;  I probably should use it everyday.</li>
            <li> When I did use it I very little change.  Had high recommendations  but  do not feel I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle, but I have seen good results.  I liked it well enough to buy again.  The scent is a little off-putting but goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> NOT STICKY I THINK IT HAS WORKED. GOOD GREAT WOULD BY IT AGAIN. ODDER FREE CHEAPER THAN STORE. LIGHT FEEL.</li>
            <li> Did not work as stated. I used the entire bottle and applied as directed and did not see any improvement in my skin. One odd thing was I had stinging on my skin in certain areas when I applied this product, but the stinging would go away relatively quickly.</li>
            <li> I use only Murad products and this one is just as good as all the other Murad products. The Resurgence line suits my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li> While the item did come packaged in a Murad box it did not bear the Murad hologram to indicate that it was a genuine Murad product and it certainly did not smell like the genuine article (which fortunately I had on had to compare).</li>
            <li> Great product!  It really makes a difference in hydrating the neck area.  I&#x27;ve been using the Murad products for some time and love them.</li>
            <li> Works okay but no better than local pharmacy products.</li>
            <li> Gave better texture to skin suffering through a long winter. Rejuvenated--yes. Lifted--no, sadly, but I doubt that any cream can do that. Wish it could. But will reorder. Also excellent service from Brand Names For Less--product in box and new.</li>
            <li> this product its great for the rejuvenating for the neck and décolleté area and y want to buy other when finished my cram</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands of skincare with various results.  I tend to have dry skin, especially in the winter, and I was recently looking for a product to revive my complexion.  After viewing a short infomercial for the Murad Rejuvenating products, I decided to give them a try and order them.  I was excited to get these products and started with washing my face followed by applying the Murad daily moisturizing cream.  Immediately after applying the moisturizer, my skin turned BRIGHT RED and I started to have a burning sensation all over my face!!  I quickly grabbed my cleanser and attempted to wash of all of the Murad products.  It took several hours for my skin to stop burning and finally returned to a normal color.  My mom, sister and best friend also tried the cleanser and moisturizer with the EXACT same results.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I decided that I wanted to return all of the products.  I quickly discovered that Murad customer service is the WORST company that I have ever encountered.  Several times, I tried calling, but had the same experience each time.  The message on the customer service line stated that there was a high call volume and recommended calling back at another time.  I decided to wait on the line and it kept shifting me to different menus and finally hung up on me.  Every single time I called (I tried calling at all hours of the day), I had the same exact experience....same message was repeated and always shifted to different menus and to no surprise, I was hung up on again and again and again. I would NEVER recommend any Murad products to anyone!!!  First, the products will highly irritate your skin.  Then, when you attempt to return the products to the company, the customer service department is nonexistent.  NEVER BUY MURAD PRODUCTS!!</li>
            <li> This product is too expensive And the results not as expected. I selected this over any other well know products because the Murad&#x27;s reputation and excellent performance. This product is over priced</li>
            <li> The skin on my neck looks better with this product. I use it in the morning and evening and my lines look smoother and less noticeable. But, it takes constant use to maintain the smoother look. I apply a moisturizer after application. Lines are not erased, but diminished look is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> I really like Murad Resurgence products, it does not leave my face or neck greasy. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Murad Resurgence Rejuvenating Lift for neck really works for me.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I like to alternate this serum with the night cream. It is like a mini peel without all the redness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for about a month.  It appears to be working at this point.  I&#x27;m receiving a smoothing affect on my neck.  I will continue to use this product.  Can&#x27;t wait for the long term results.</li>
            <li> It made me break out/burnt my neck. Am having to go to the dr. tomorrow to se what can be done.  Have never experienced anything like this before. :( :(</li>
            <li> Came quickly and well packaged.  I didn&#x27;t see any change though but plan to use what I have left in the bottle.</li>
            <li> When I first started to use this I was impressed by the immediate dewy effect it had on my skin. After about a week, I began checking my neck after my lunch break when I would touch up my makeup at work. The effect didn&#x27;t last. I would reapply the product. I began to smell a faint boiled egg smell from the disposable foam wedge I use to apply the product. There must be a chemical reaction in murad with my perfume or hair product. I&#x27;m 50, I live in Hawaii and I don&#x27;t have damage from the sun.. just drying, aging skin. I wouldnt buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great price point. Timely shipping. Unfortunately I found the product to not only be ineffective for me, but seemed to worsen the area I am trying to manage.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Murad and this really does temporarily lift the jaw line and it helps with the lines on my neck also.</li>
