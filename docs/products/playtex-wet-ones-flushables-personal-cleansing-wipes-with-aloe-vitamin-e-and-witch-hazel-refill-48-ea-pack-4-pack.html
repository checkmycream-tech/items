            <li>This is a good product, easy to use, very convenient, and refreshing.....</li>
            <li>These are very good personal wipes.</li>

            <li>I like that it is alcohol free.</li>

            <li>you don&#x27;t go out to shop, or do not have access to stores that offer these kinds of deals, online buying is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Not only do these wipes glide easily through all the sensitive parts, it does such a great job at cleaning that I&#x27;ve reduced my toilet paper consumption by way more than half.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I have Crohn&#x27;s disease, and these really work well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they have too much perfume</li>
            <li>The size is great, not skimpy, and the fiber is thick enough not to tear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>i used these for my post-partum recovery, and highly recommend these wipes over the cottonelle brand.</li>
            <li>In the end, after comparing lots of websites and special offers, I still think you save money to buy it locally IF you can find it.</li>
            <li>These are the best wipes, too bad they are not sold in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li>Great also for those hot, muggy days when you&#x27;re dripping wet and can&#x27;t get to a wash basin right away!</li>
            <li>However, I believe you have overcharged considerably!</li>
            <li>Lightly scented and just wet enough.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find these in any local store, but I still recommend them highly.</li>
            <li>It also resolved a mild allergic rash that I had suddenly developed after using Cottonelle wet wipes for the last several years.</li>
            <li>Wow, I definitely feel a little awkward writing a review touting about how great these sanitary wipes are for cleaning my you-know-whats.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am looking for a flushable wipe that is about the size of a baby wipe. The descriptions and reviews for this product say \\&quot;large.\\&quot; Reading that, I was hoping that they are larger than \\&quot;normal\\&quot; flushable wipes, but they are not, at least not in my experience. For the record, the measurements printed on the Wet Ones package are 7.5\\&quot; x 5.75\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not too thick and not too thin. They don&#x27;t tear and they don&#x27;t appear to clog my toilet. Plus, they have a really nice scent! Great also for those hot, muggy days when you&#x27;re dripping wet and can&#x27;t get to a wash basin right away!</li>
            <li> I have written about this product many times.  They are used at home, at work, in the car, etc.  Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> The wet ones products are superior to any I&#x27;ve used ... too bad they are so hard to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> great product. Need a lower price</li>
            <li> This product beats the socks off other brands in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;The sheets are moist without being too wet and the blend of aloe, Witch Hazel and Vit.E is genius. I like that it is alcohol free. The size is great, not skimpy, and the fiber is thick enough not to tear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding the product at an affordable price can be a challenge. In the end, after comparing lots of websites and special offers, I still think you save money to buy it locally IF you can find it. Using my store&#x27;s senior discount I get the 56 sheet dispenser box for what equates to $.04 per sheet. That is the price to beat. Tip-you will always pay more for the refill pack than the box. Why? who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you don&#x27;t go out to shop, or do not have access to stores that offer these kinds of deals, online buying is very reasonable. You may find it for $.08 and up. You must consider tax and shipping. Add it all up and get your best price per sheet. Then you&#x27;ll know you&#x27;ve gotten the best deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion to the manufacturer is to make the refills as affordable as the initial purchase of the dispenser box. Why fill the landfills with plastic boxes?</li>
            <li> My husband had Crohn&#x27;s disease and this is the gentlest thing on his bum for when he&#x27;s having a flare up.</li>
            <li> I use this type item all the time and to find it with the Aloe, witch hazel and vitamin E is a plus.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED OTHER BRANDS AND NO COMPARISON.  THEY AR THE BEST AND WOULD RECOMMEND THEM ALWAYS.  I AM SORRY THAT PUBLIX SUPERMARKETS DOES NOT CARRY THE PRODUCT IN MY AREA (KENDALL IN MIAMI). ANY MORE.  THE PRICE WAS EXCELLENT.</li>
            <li> I started with getting a box of Wet Ones to set by each commode, then got packages of these as replacements while re-using the boxes. Be warned that depending upon the soils under your house, wipes advertised as &amp;#34;flushable&amp;#34; might not be. I learned expensively that the drainpipes under my house have settled and no longer slope as much as they once did, so for me, these wipes cannot be flushed away or they might cause clogs. That is not the fault of the wipes, which do their work well and without irritation. Hint: the wipes on top will stay helpfully damp if you leave the box upside-down between uses.</li>
            <li> These came very fast and for a good price. The WetOnes are a nice product that have a come to be sort of a staple around the home.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, however, the store where I usually bought them, quit handling them, so, I&lt;br /&gt;went to AMAZON  where I can always find what I need and at a great price  THANKS</li>
            <li> Not to get into the details here but these wipes are the best hands down. Whatever is in the keeps the inflammation and irritation at bay for everyone in the family. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have Crohn&#x27;s disease, and these really work well. Their size is fine, and they aren&#x27;t perfumey like some of the other brands, which cause a rash and irritation...as several of the other reviewers have mentioned, these are hard to find in south Florida. I used to buy them at Publix, but for some reason they stopped carrying them...thank&#x27;s Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years, and take them with me wherever I travel.  Cannot do without them.</li>
            <li> For anyone who has irritation this is a great product. It relieves and soothes and provides comfort.  I recommend this product for anyone looking for relief.</li>
            <li> Both myself and my mother have been using Scott&#x27;s and Cottonelle brand wipes for multiple years now, and we always assumed that we needed them to help with sore butts. We never thought that the wipes were causing our problem! After researching, we found that these Wet Ones wipes don&#x27;t contain some sort of chemical that the other wipes do. We tried them out and almost instantaneously our problem vanished! I can&#x27;t find these in any local store, but I still recommend them highly.</li>
            <li> I like this product and can&#x27;t get it in any of the three grocery stores where I shop.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, easy to use, very convenient, and refreshing.....I&#x27;m &amp;#34;throwing in&amp;#34; here with the five star reviewers, I love this product, and I recommend!</li>
            <li> I like the ingredients in these wet ones.  I also like the fact they are flushable.  I use them on my feet mostly since I have terrible diabetic ulcers.  They also smell good and for the money, these are better than the other ones that cost more.</li>
            <li> I have been using this great product for personal hygene for several years.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands and&lt;br /&gt;they have too much perfume and/or cause irritation, not good for my sensitive skin and UTI problems.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the store where I usually purchased the refill package (and even with the plastic tub) for around $2.00, has stopped carrying them and I can&#x27;t seem to find them anywhere locally (Orlando).  Why should I have to order this product online at twice the cost and then have to pay for shipping?  There are other &amp;#34;Wet Ones&amp;#34; products on the store shelves but not the flushable personal cleansing wipes.  Guess my next step is to have a talk with the store manager... wish me luck with that!.</li>
            <li> Wow, I definitely feel a little awkward writing a review touting about how great these sanitary wipes are for cleaning my you-know-whats. But (no pun intended) I feel that I need to support this product with a 5 star review because it has radically changed my butt wiping paradigm. Not only do these wipes glide easily through all the sensitive parts, it does such a great job at cleaning that I&#x27;ve reduced my toilet paper consumption by way more than half. It&#x27;s so gentle and soothing that I no longer have any butt problems (from prolong sitting, if you know what I mean...). It also resolved a mild allergic rash that I had suddenly developed after using Cottonelle wet wipes for the last several years. Can&#x27;t praise these wipes enough!</li>
            <li> A good product that is flushable. It is a great body wipe that can be used for a number of sanitary procedures</li>
            <li> These are the best wipes, too bad they are not sold in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent.  .Always  has been and  is one of the best. However, I believe you have overcharged considerably!</li>
            <li> Pricey.  But awesome.</li>
            <li> Great product - easily fliushable in the toilet. Exactly the right amount of wetness. Perfect size vs regular baby wipes.</li>
            <li> I have tried all brands and this is definitely the best!!! It is larger and softer and stronger and wetter.  No contest  It does not irritate.</li>
            <li> Non irritating wipes that do not clog my toilet. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I used another brand of flushable wipes and got a terrible rash!  These wipes are soothing and they don&#x27;t fall apart.  I&#x27;m glad I found them.</li>
            <li> very happy with this product and at a really affordable price. i used these for my post-partum recovery, and highly recommend these wipes over the cottonelle brand.</li>
            <li> Good smell, great on sensitive skin w/ vitamin E and Aloe. It is also nice to be able to flush these wipes!</li>
            <li> These are very good personal wipes. Lightly scented and just wet enough.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST THING THAT THERE IS. NICE AND SOFT, SMELLS GOOD, AND IT IS  ALSO FLUSHABLE.</li>
