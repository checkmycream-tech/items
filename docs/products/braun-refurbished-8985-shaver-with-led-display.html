            <li>The shaver arrived in perfect working and cosmetic condition.  </li>
            <li>This is the best razor I&#x27;ve owned to date!</li>
            <li>I have been using an electric razor for over 50 years and this is the best one yet.  </li>
            <li>The best shaver I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>I searched the internet thoroughly and this was the best quality shaver at the best price that I could find.</li>
            <li>Apart from those problems, the shave is very good</li>
            <li>Great price and great service!</li>
            <li>Great quality for the best price.  </li>
            <li>Great quality for the best price.  </li>
            <li>A good shaver, but not the best.</li>
            <li>and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>Great bargain for the price.    </li>
            <li>This product is good, but its not a razor and you will not get the closeness with any electric shaver with an electric razor.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great bargain for a top notch product.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>It even works perfectly with my old existing cleaning/charging station.  </li>
            <li>My face is smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt and the ladies now find me adorable!</li>
            <li>The shave is great and the best part is it is available at significantly less cost.</li>
            <li>Like most shavers, under the neck is still a problem</li>
            <li>it transformed the 8985 into the most efficient shaver i&#x27;ve ever used (or tried).  </li>
            <li>I am quite satisfied with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>and I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I have used earlier Braun models and this is the best one that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This is the best value in the 8000 series imo (fancy lights don&#x27;t do much for my shaving ;).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the shaver for a few weeks now and can honestly say it&#x27;s the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Braun quality control should have easily caught that.</li>
            <li>The foils do get pretty warm if using the trimmer for an extended period but they seem to wear well.</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s refurbished made it available at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>When I lost my original on a recent trip, this was a great replacement.  </li>
            <li>I would advise that you give the shaver a week or two before you decide whether it is the right one for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a number of electric razors over my shaving career of more than fifty years of shaving,and this is the finest I&#x27;ve owned, with the closest, most comfortable, least skin-damaging results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast, fairly quiet and has a quick clean feature that is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Most of them fall outside of the shaver and into the sink.    </li>
            <li>This comb design scrapes the skin more intensely (it is thicker, wider and protrudes more), which left me with a red face after shaving (from irritation).  </li>
            <li>It makes for a very close shave.</li>
            <li>The shaver works very well.</li>
            <li>With the fast oscilations of this model, there is no tugging</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never skipped a beat, cuts very close, even though its&#x27; a foil design.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to purchase it since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>LED warning light for re-charge could be bigger &amp; brighter.</li>
            <li>The 7000 series (30B) cutter/foil is more recessed and glides better on my skin without irritating it and while giving me a faster, closer shave.    </li>
            <li>This shaver has a quality feel to it, and operation is simple and straightforward.  </li>
            <li>Mine came without a special cleaning and a local dealer said not to worry.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve noticed that the current cutter blocks and foil (like the 51S) listed by Braun for the 8000 series have the more agressive &#x27;comb&#x27; between the foils  (blue in color).  </li>
            <li>I generally only shave twice a week at most, sometimes only twice a month</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this particular shaver model and source.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Appreciated the lower price, far exceeded all my expectations.</li>
            <li>Razor arrived in like new condition - couldn&#x27;t tell it was refurbished.</li>
            <li>The only accessories included were a user&#x27;s manual, a charger (appear to be new), a carrying bag (not the case that included with the new unit), and a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>In the past I have used both Norelco rotary shavers and Braun foil shavers, and comparing my most recent experiences with both, I find that the Braun shaves closer and has a longer battery life between charges.  </li>
            <li>This refurbished shaver looks and works as well any new shaver possibly could.  </li>
            <li>The benefits of the 800 series are all there:  very fast oscillation for efficient cutting, ergonomic shape for easy handling, quieter than my 6520 (by a lot!).    </li>
            <li>No regrets buying!</li>
            <li>Just as they claim, this shaver gets the hairs on the neck and in other areas that lay flat or cross-ways, even the very fine hairs that usually don&#x27;t get cut.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers since the early 80&#x27;s and have been through the single foil/cutter and flex (5400) flex integral (6520) to now the 8985.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this thing, I&#x27;ve used orbitals and don&#x27;t like them for thier clumsy feeling, I&#x27;ve had two other foil shavers that went through cutters and foils quickly and didn&#x27;t cut nearly as well.</li>

            <li> It tends to pull hairs out rather than shave them when they are that long.</li>

            <li> The cleaner kits are not worth it.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s always cutting growth not just light stubble usually.</li>
            <li> and i get a shave closer than a wet blade in very little time.    </li>
            <li> i ordered a 30B cutting block and foil  (for the series 7000 synchro models), which has the older, skinny blades design and bingo!  </li>
            <li> Refurbished unit arrived with two teeth missing in its cutter block.</li>
            <li> To my dismay the until came loosely in a plain box.</li>
            <li> Not sure who one of the reviewers purchased his unit, but mine came with everything in a box. . .</li>
            <li> I bought it for my elderly father, but it was a little difficult for him to achieve a close shave with it.</li>
            <li> But so far it does not seem to matter that I don&#x27;t have the base.</li>
            <li> but I do wish the Amazon page had a clear sign saying \\&quot;no cleaning base included.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I thought for the price that I was only getting a shaver and not the base.  </li>
            <li> This Braun did not come with the cleaning base, so it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> The wiskers do not build up inside the cutting head like on lots of shavers.</li>
            <li> He hates it and says it does a terrible job on his neck hairs.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought my Braun shaver in Oct 2009 to replace my Norelco rotary. This Braun did not come with the cleaning base, so it was less expensive. But so far it does not seem to matter that I don&#x27;t have the base. I pop open the foil and blow out the whisker remnants that are left after every few shaves. It makes for a very close shave. The wiskers do not build up inside the cutting head like on lots of shavers. Most of them fall outside of the shaver and into the sink.    Since I am not a daily shaver, sometimes not even weekly, the Braun gets a bit of a workout one in a while when my beard gets to 1/4 to 3/8\\&quot; long. It tends to pull hairs out rather than shave them when they are that long. So what I do to get around it is to use the side burn trimmer to cut all of the hair down short then use the shaver normally and it does a great job. Just a couple of extra minutes to cut facial hairs down short enough to be painlessly shaved. I do have some stubborn neck hairs that I have to use the side burn trimmer to get.     I like this shaver!</li>
            <li> When I lost my original on a recent trip, this was a great replacement.  Appreciated the lower price, far exceeded all my expectations.</li>
            <li> The shaver works very well. Like most shavers, under the neck is still a problem but this one works as well as any Braun shaver I&#x27;ve had. I would advise that you give the shaver a week or two before you decide whether it is the right one for you. Mine came without a special cleaning and a local dealer said not to worry. The cleaner kits are not worth it. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the shaver for a few weeks now and can honestly say it&#x27;s the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Just as they claim, this shaver gets the hairs on the neck and in other areas that lay flat or cross-ways, even the very fine hairs that usually don&#x27;t get cut.  I charged the battery when I got it and now some 3-4 weeks later it&#x27;s still fully charged and cutting fine.  Dave</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband. He hates it and says it does a terrible job on his neck hairs. Oh well...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers since the early 80&#x27;s and have been through the single foil/cutter and flex (5400) flex integral (6520) to now the 8985.  This is the best value in the 8000 series imo (fancy lights don&#x27;t do much for my shaving ;).  The shaver arrived in perfect working and cosmetic condition.  Great bargain for the price.    The benefits of the 800 series are all there:  very fast oscillation for efficient cutting, ergonomic shape for easy handling, quieter than my 6520 (by a lot!).

I highly recommend this particular shaver model and source.  It&#x27;s a great bargain for a top notch product.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I&#x27;ve owned to date! My face is smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt and the ladies now find me adorable! One charge has lasted an entire month! Razor arrived in like new condition - couldn&#x27;t tell it was refurbished. No regrets buying!</li>
            <li> Not sure who one of the reviewers purchased his unit, but mine came with everything in a box. . . .like knew. I thought for the price that I was only getting a shaver and not the base.  I wanted a different type of shaver then the one with the round heads.  This product is good, but its not a razor and you will not get the closeness with any electric shaver with an electric razor.    Great price and great service!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for several years now. I generally only shave twice a week at most, sometimes only twice a month so it&#x27;s always cutting growth not just light stubble usually. It&#x27;s never skipped a beat, cuts very close, even though its&#x27; a foil design. I&#x27;ve only replaced the cutters and foils once. The foils do get pretty warm if using the trimmer for an extended period but they seem to wear well. I can&#x27;t say enough about this thing, I&#x27;ve used orbitals and don&#x27;t like them for thier clumsy feeling, I&#x27;ve had two other foil shavers that went through cutters and foils quickly and didn&#x27;t cut nearly as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using an electric razor for over 50 years and this is the best one yet.  I have never had a big cleaner unit and have no room for one, so I picked this model.  Also the price was what I had hoped to pay.</li>
            <li> This refurbished shaver looks and works as well any new shaver possibly could.  It even works perfectly with my old existing cleaning/charging station.  The shave is great and the best part is it is available at significantly less cost.</li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied with this shaver.  In the past I have used both Norelco rotary shavers and Braun foil shavers, and comparing my most recent experiences with both, I find that the Braun shaves closer and has a longer battery life between charges.  This shaver has a quality feel to it, and operation is simple and straightforward.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I searched the whole page trying to figure out if this refurbished unit came with a cleaning base without a success. I finally decided to purchase it since it was so cheap. To my dismay the until came loosely in a plain box. The only accessories included were a user&#x27;s manual, a charger (appear to be new), a carrying bag (not the case that included with the new unit), and a cleaning brush. The razor works okay but I do wish the Amazon page had a clear sign saying \\&quot;no cleaning base included.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The best shaver I&#x27;ve had.  Great quality for the best price.  Great quality for the best price.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a number of electric razors over my shaving career of more than fifty years of shaving,and this is the finest I&#x27;ve owned, with the closest, most comfortable, least skin-damaging results.</li>
            <li> Refurbished unit arrived with two teeth missing in its cutter block. Braun quality control should have easily caught that. Amazon credited my account for the cost of a replacement cutter block and screen. LED warning light for re-charge could be bigger &amp; brighter. Apart from those problems, the shave is very good and I am pleased.</li>
            <li> A good shaver, but not the best. Although it was refurbished, it performed as well as any. I bought it for my elderly father, but it was a little difficult for him to achieve a close shave with it.</li>
            <li> I ordered a refurbished Braun 8985 shaver a couple months ago. I am very satisfied with it. I have used earlier Braun models and this is the best one that I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s fast, fairly quiet and has a quick clean feature that is easy to use. The fact that it&#x27;s refurbished made it available at an affordable price. I searched the internet thoroughly and this was the best quality shaver at the best price that I could find.</li>
