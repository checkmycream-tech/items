            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great smell and looking forward to summer of 2015</li>
            <li>When your skin is warm and damp it absorbes the moist best.</li>
            <li>They were happy to receive this item,</li>
            <li>This is a very nice and pleasant tanning oil.</li>
            <li>You shouldn&#x27;t use this if you have fair skin since it has no SPF whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Good luck finding it in stores though..</li>
            <li>I love the smell!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It was amazing.</li>
            <li>An absolutely AMAZING product, I will buy this again once this bottle is through!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had forgotten how nice the scent is.  </li>
            <li>My absolute favorite smell in the world!!!</li>
            <li>Great fragrance, and makes your skin nice and soft. :)</li>
            <li>Not to mention the tan is better with it.  </li>
            <li>but it surely doesn&#x27;t seem to be hurting.</li>
            <li>Feels even better if the oil has been warmed up a bit before applying.</li>
            <li>I love Hawaiian Tropic products....</li>
            <li>I love it, hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magic goodness with this tanning oil.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>However, your skin needs to be able to breathe to perform these functions.</li>
            <li>It also has a pretty good EWG rating, which means its ingredients arent poisonous to your body.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice tropical smell and leaves hour skin very soft.</li>
            <li>It is still excellent quality and exactly the same as always.  </li>
            <li>Use the other Hawaiian Tropic tanning oil (with 6SPF or 8) if you have fair skin!</li>
            <li>As for the products intended use, it addes a perfect shade of tan for anyone who enjoys laying out and adding a little color to there skin tone.</li>
            <li>The scent is fantastic and smells like a tropical beach to me.  </li>
            <li>gives a nice dark tan, love it have used it for yesrs!</li>
            <li>and I still love it just as much now as ever.  </li>
            <li>I tan pretty easily, but I think this product assists me with it.</li>
            <li>i have been using this for years.. as great as expected!</li>
            <li>After about ten minutes, any oily-residue has completely absorbed and will leave your skin feeling amazingly</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m 60 years old and lotions and light oils are absorbed into my skin too quickly.</li>
            <li>do not burn despite having a fair complexion, but I would advise you be very careful with this product if you are prone to burning, as the main ingredient is mineral oil which will burn those with fair complexions, even with minimal exposure.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would avoid using this on the face as it has no SPF and facial skin is the most sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first thing I did when I bought this was smell it.</li>
            <li>In less than 30 minutes I noticed that the once basic tanned body was now a beautiful creamy golden.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to get this product in the condition in which it was advertised... new and unopened for a reasonable price, as it is very hard to find in our area.</li>
            <li>My skin has fairly nice color, not exactly Jersey Shore</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you tan naturally well, I would recommend giving this a try, as it will condition your skin and accelerate your natural tan without the high price or &amp;#34;bronzers&amp;#34; loaded into most tanning oils these days.</li>
            <li>: I don&#x27;t personally enjoy the scent &amp; as others have stated you are left with a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Overall a fantastic value.</li>
            <li>it so much and will never use another tanning oil product again.</li>
            <li>OMG the smell is heavenly , tried it twice so far and it gave me a little nice and shine color</li>
            <li>As someone who has used several other tanning accelerators, including Maui babe and the ultra-pricey DS products, I have to admit that Hawaiian Tropic Dark Tanning Oil works great for the price- better than the aforementioned &amp;#34;Hawaiian&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li>Stopped using it when I noticed that its main ingredient is a mineral oil.</li>
            <li>However, I always use a sunscreen with high SPF on my face to avoid premature aging.</li>
            <li>Yes, it goes on clear but fairly messy (being an oil) but it absorbs quickly into skin to the point that I don&#x27;t even need to shower after using this for quick outdoor sessions.</li>
            <li>Other than the soothing qualities and the pleasant smell I&#x27;m not sure how much it helps out with my tan</li>
            <li>I do prefer the thicker oil as I live in Florida</li>
            <li>/&gt;It contains no bronzers or colorants, which means no clothing stains or &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; skin.&lt;br /&gt;I find that laying out for a half hour usually gives me a nice, golden color.</li>
            <li>I actually bring a soap bottle with me for the outdoor showers because that&#x27;s pretty much the only way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very thankful to have it back.  </li>
            <li>Two hours under direct sunlight at the beach</li>
            <li>So there, I made an excuse to use a #8 SPF ;)</li>
            <li>You feel very sticky when this is on you, so instead I gave it to someone who wanted to get dark, yes it will get you dark, but it also attracts flies cause you smell so sweet, and then all you really want to do is shower this stuff of cause</li>
            <li>Kim Anderson, a health care consultant to Arbonne International, states that \\&quot;mineral oil coats the skin like plastic wrap, disrupting the skin&#x27;s natural immune barrier and inhibiting its ability to breathe and absorb the &#x27;natural moisture factor&#x27; (moisture and nutrition).\\&quot;</li>
            <li>My family and I been using this for years and it has kept me very tan, as though I had spent two weeks in the Bahamas.</li>
            <li>I also have ridiculously sensitive skin ( breakout city with a lot of various products)</li>
            <li>I know, kindof weird, but to be honest it&#x27;s heavenly.</li>

            <li> I know, kindof weird, but to be honest it&#x27;s heavenly.</li>
            <li> Normal cell development is slowed down and the skin ages prematurely when skin cells are robbed of moisture.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Spent an hour or so out in the sun for a couple days &amp; this stuff really darkened my base tan nicely.</li>
            <li> I use it as a body moisturizer all summer long and also along with sunscreen out in the sun, as this product doesn&#x27;t contain sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> A simple wet towel won&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts for a long time if you don&#x27;t share.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft and moisturized all year round after my gym workout and shower.</li>
            <li> Living in Hawai&#x27;i myself, the beach is a constant stop in my daily basis even if it&#x27;s just for half an hour.</li>
            <li> 4 stars instead of 5 due to personal preferences</li>
            <li> Hunny did use some for her dry hands and it helps that too.  </li>
            <li> This is the only dark tanning oil i ever use.</li>
            <li> title is because I have an extremely white friend hoping she could get a \\&quot;dark\\&quot; tan in half an hour, used this product, and turned out looking like a lobster because of the no SPF.</li>
            <li> This is a great tanning oil to use once you have your base tan!</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this is that about a third of the oil came out of the bottle during shipping.  </li>
            <li> If you want to look like you just spent two weeks under the sun in St. Tropez, this is the stuff.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s expected since it&#x27;s an oil.</li>
            <li> The trick is to only get in the sun a few minutes a day and build up the tan as the SPF is 0.</li>
            <li> and it doesnt come off unless you shower and exfoliate your skin extremely well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Read more: [...]</li>
            <li> This means that cell renewal is slowed, collagen breaks down, and the connective tissue is destroyed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find it for less . . .</li>
            <li> It was an oily mess.  </li>
            <li> All you need is a little bit on each part of your body and the results are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has no SPF, so be CAREFUL!!!</li>
            <li> Got this for summer but summer of 2014 was missing the sun.</li>
            <li> I was asked if I could bring a dark tanning oil to someone who is working outside the country, where all items are truly expensive.  </li>
            <li> If you want a real dark tan this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this instead of my usual Banana Boat</li>
            <li> I swear people must buy this product year round because i can never find it except online!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to wash off also.</li>
            <li> you have that weird bla feeling after you put it on.</li>
            <li> holy crap</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great for getting a tan.  I love the smell!</li>
            <li> The smell alone would make you want to drink this product, but we all know you can&#x27;t. As for the products intended use, it addes a perfect shade of tan for anyone who enjoys laying out and adding a little color to there skin tone. Great product.</li>
            <li> Reliable product.  Great fragrance, and makes your skin nice and soft. :)</li>
            <li> I had forgotten how nice the scent is.  Very thankful to have it back.  Not to mention the tan is better with it.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Other than the soothing qualities and the pleasant smell I&#x27;m not sure how much it helps out with my tan but it surely doesn&#x27;t seem to be hurting. Feels even better if the oil has been warmed up a bit before applying.</li>
            <li> holy crap its like lathering your body in gasoline oil and it doesnt come off unless you shower and exfoliate your skin extremely well.</li>
            <li> Got this for summer but summer of 2014 was missing the sun. Hunny did use some for her dry hands and it helps that too.  Great smell and looking forward to summer of 2015</li>
            <li> It smells like a tropical island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use after shower, but before drying yourself. When your skin is warm and damp it absorbes the moist best.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite smell in the world!!! It has no SPF, so be CAREFUL!!!</li>
            <li> If you want to look like you just spent two weeks under the sun in St. Tropez, this is the stuff. Two hours under direct sunlight at the beach and you have a lasting, glowing tan.</li>
            <li> This has always been my go to product. My family and I been using this for years and it has kept me very tan, as though I had spent two weeks in the Bahamas. It has a very nice tropical smell and leaves hour skin very soft. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how greasy it is but that&#x27;s expected since it&#x27;s an oil. After using this I like to use the after sun lotion which soothes your skin and locks in the color. Great product! Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> OMG the smell is heavenly , tried it twice so far and it gave me a little nice and shine color&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t get enough of the smell I kept smell my arms and hands !</li>

I also use this with a 275 watt indoor tanning lamp to erase tan lines for 15 minute sessions and have never had a problem with burning. However, I always use a sunscreen with high SPF on my face to avoid premature aging. I would avoid using this on the face as it has no SPF and facial skin is the most sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;I do not burn despite having a fair complexion, but I would advise you be very careful with this product if you are prone to burning, as the main ingredient is mineral oil which will burn those with fair complexions, even with minimal exposure.&lt;br /&gt;However, if you tan naturally well, I would recommend giving this a try, as it will condition your skin and accelerate your natural tan without the high price or &amp;#34;bronzers&amp;#34; loaded into most tanning oils these days.</li>

            <li> I love Hawaiian Tropic products....they have the smell of summer!!!!!  This is a great tanning oil to use once you have your base tan!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 20 years and I still love it just as much now as ever.  It is still excellent quality and exactly the same as always.  The scent is fantastic and smells like a tropical beach to me.  I use it as a body moisturizer all summer long and also along with sunscreen out in the sun, as this product doesn&#x27;t contain sunscreen.  I love it, hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> No SPF protection but I use it in addition - smells like summer!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good! I love it! It also has a pretty good EWG rating, which means its ingredients arent poisonous to your body.</li>
            <li> Living in Hawai&#x27;i myself, the beach is a constant stop in my daily basis even if it&#x27;s just for half an hour. My skin has fairly nice color, not exactly Jersey Shore but it could be ranked as a basic California tan. When I purchased this instead of my usual Banana Boat it was only because everybody else in Hawai&#x27;i seemed to use it. I thought maybe it was just because of it&#x27;s name, but I decided to try it out. The first thing I did when I bought this was smell it. I know, kindof weird, but to be honest it&#x27;s heavenly. Not like that fake coconut smell that seems to be in many tourist lotions. It was amazing. I immediately laid out on the beach and tanned away. In less than 30 minutes I noticed that the once basic tanned body was now a beautiful creamy golden. No joke, my jaw dropped. I flipped over, rested for 30 minutes again and felt the sun work it&#x27;s magic goodness with this tanning oil. I looked back at my body when the time was up and saw yet again a beautiful golden-brown. I looked native (and that&#x27;s coming from a once \\&quot;you-can-see-my-veins\\&quot; type skinned girl back before I tanned). An absolutely AMAZING product, I will buy this again once this bottle is through!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this isn&#x27;t 5 Star is that once you&#x27;re done tanning, it&#x27;s a b*tch trying to get the oil off. A simple wet towel won&#x27;t do it. I actually bring a soap bottle with me for the outdoor showers because that&#x27;s pretty much the only way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title is because I have an extremely white friend hoping she could get a \\&quot;dark\\&quot; tan in half an hour, used this product, and turned out looking like a lobster because of the no SPF. Use the other Hawaiian Tropic tanning oil (with 6SPF or 8) if you have fair skin!</li>
            <li> I was very happy to get this product in the condition in which it was advertised... new and unopened for a reasonable price, as it is very hard to find in our area.</li>
            <li> i have been using this for years.. as great as expected!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Spent an hour or so out in the sun for a couple days &amp; this stuff really darkened my base tan nicely. 4 stars instead of 5 due to personal preferences: I don&#x27;t personally enjoy the scent &amp; as others have stated you are left with a greasy feeling.I use it sparingly &amp; still feel slimy, but it is an oil after all. I also have ridiculously sensitive skin ( breakout city with a lot of various products) although it&#x27;s oil i&#x27;ve had no skin irritation whatsoever. Overall a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> I tan pretty easily, but I think this product assists me with it. Of course it&#x27;s oily, because it&#x27;s oil! One bottle lasts for a long time if you don&#x27;t share. The smell is simply incredible. You shouldn&#x27;t use this if you have fair skin since it has no SPF whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I was asked if I could bring a dark tanning oil to someone who is working outside the country, where all items are truly expensive.  They were happy to receive this item,</li>
            <li> This is the only dark tanning oil i ever use. I have tried every tanning product before i found this one. It smells incredible and gives you the perfect tan. All you need is a little bit on each part of your body and the results are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it so much and will never use another tanning oil product again. Good luck finding it in stores though..because i go to CVS, Rite Aid, supermarkets, convenient stores, Duane Read .. They are ALWAYS sold out ! I swear people must buy this product year round because i can never find it except online! Thank God for Amazon!</li>
            <li> You feel very sticky when this is on you, so instead I gave it to someone who wanted to get dark, yes it will get you dark, but it also attracts flies cause you smell so sweet, and then all you really want to do is shower this stuff of cause you have that weird bla feeling after you put it on.</li>
            <li> I use it every day, and am darker for it. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find it for less . . .</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  I put a lot of it on my skin and went outside for about 2 hours.  After 2 hours my skin was still the same. It&#x27;s hard to wash off also.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this is that about a third of the oil came out of the bottle during shipping.  It was an oily mess.  I do prefer the thicker oil as I live in Florida, I&#x27;m 60 years old and lotions and light oils are absorbed into my skin too quickly.</li>
            <li> gives a nice dark tan, love it have used it for yesrs!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice and pleasant tanning oil. The oil itself doesn&#x27;t have any color. Used it a couple of times onyl, so I can&#x27;t say anything about getting tan with it. Stopped using it when I noticed that its main ingredient is a mineral oil. Why mineral oil is bed for you skin?&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Your skin is the body&#x27;s largest organ, and it works together with the kidneys to rid the body of toxins. However, your skin needs to be able to breathe to perform these functions. Kim Anderson, a health care consultant to Arbonne International, states that \\&quot;mineral oil coats the skin like plastic wrap, disrupting the skin&#x27;s natural immune barrier and inhibiting its ability to breathe and absorb the &#x27;natural moisture factor&#x27; (moisture and nutrition).\\&quot; In addition, mineral oil attracts needed moisture from cells deep inside your skin. This means that cell renewal is slowed, collagen breaks down, and the connective tissue is destroyed. Normal cell development is slowed down and the skin ages prematurely when skin cells are robbed of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read more: [...]</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft and moisturized all year round after my gym workout and shower.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t resist the smell of Hawaiian Tropic for the beach in the summer! I would buy this even if I did not use it for the smell! Actually it helps your skin stay moisturized! So there, I made an excuse to use a #8 SPF ;)</li>
