    <ol>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>Perfect nothing to say</li>
            <li>We used this to ensure my daughter&#x27;s wedding dress stayed perfectly in place.  </li>
            <li>and it stuck between the materials perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>I cut each one of the strip in thirds and that works perfectly!  </li>
            <li>A very good product.</li>
            <li>Stayed on great for a Halloween costume.</li>
            <li>works great.</li>
            <li>but not that great</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s great for holding my pasties on.</li>
            <li>They work great and are affordable.</li>
            <li>i read the others review before i bought this item for my wife an it worked great on her lace wig.</li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t say that it works good on wigs</li>
            <li>Superior to fashion tapes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Good product, and good company</li>
            <li>I was going on a cruise and figured it might come in handy.  </li>
            <li>is the most popular brand for men and women peaces in the market</li>
            <li>your actor isn&#x27;t sweaty or running around a lot, or if the adhesion isn&#x27;t used in an area with a lot of movement (like the mouth), then it may provide better hold on its own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>it was just OK</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Since manufacturing companies can&#x27;t seem to make a top that covers, I use these to keep &amp;#34;the girls&amp;#34; covered and the shoulders on my shoulders.</li>
            <li>it is nice to have pre-cut strips handy and ready to use!</li>
            <li>It is pretty good product</li>
            <li>its easy to stick on.and in my situation lasts for three days&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li>but I know for a fact that if you have a little one that uses hearing aids this is perfect to keep them in place.</li>
            <li>It holds securely, and will not damage your lace system.</li>
            <li>If you cut the strips in fourths or even smaller, they work great for keeping the CI processors on the ear.</li>
            <li>another great product  for the back of the hair piece it curves</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a TV sound guy and use this to hold lavaliere microphones in place.</li>
            <li>It gently peels off, easy to clean up and does not irritate the skin at all.</li>
            <li>I did not care for these strips would have like them to hold stronger but for a quick</li>
            <li>Well, the first night I tried it between the top of my dress and my skin to keep from showing too much, and it didn&#x27;t want to stick at all.  </li>
            <li>This product is excellent as long as you store in a cool dry place.</li>
            <li>I do tend to be very warm often, but my skin is normal - neither oily nor dry -</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I live it!!!</li>
            <li>Our 15 month old son has fine hair so the tape doesn&#x27;t stick so well to his scalp.  </li>
            <li>I always make sure I clean my skin with rubbing alcohol or astringent before sticking the tape down.  </li>
            <li>so good less mess and easy to clean</li>
            <li>I use these strips, cut into small pieces, to keep my infant son&#x27;s hearing aids on more securely.</li>
            <li>This looks fancy but it doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>but I know it didn&#x27;t stick to my skin very well.  </li>
            <li>The tape sticks very well and</li>
            <li>Thank You Very much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>TopStick is the first tape I reach for in my sound kit and works better than anything else I know for keeping mics in place and clothing noise as little as possible.</li>
            <li>The classic go to tape-works for all manner of wardrobe disaster avoidance as well as toupee tape.</li>
            <li>The tape works extremely well at first but the box has to be kept in a cool environment.</li>
            <li>Wig slid to the left almost right away.</li>
            <li>I have to pull his hair apart to expose as much of his scalp as possible for the tape to adhere yet in the process my son gets fussy.</li>
            <li>I am a professional clown.  </li>
            <li>They work well and don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s available for around $5.00 at most beauty supplies, not sure why it&#x27;s so expensive on here.</li>
            <li>Also the sticky residue left on the headpiece is hard to clean.</li>
            <li>Okay ladies - this is something you just should always keep in your bag, if you carry too small of a bag, take a few of these out and stick them in your coin purse - you never know when you are going to need double sided tape.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I do mean quick hold</li>
            <li>A little piece of Topstick attached to the backside of the hearing aid sticks lightly to his head behind his ear and really does keep the aids in place.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for applying facial hair to kids in a high school show of &amp;#34;Beauty and the Beast.&amp;#34; It wasn&#x27;t providing the required adhesion all the way through the show, so I ended up prepping the skin with rubbing alcohol first, then a thin layer of spirit gum before applying the facial hair with the Topstick.</li>

            <li> Okay ladies - this is something you just should always keep in your bag, if you carry too small of a bag, take a few of these out and stick them in your coin purse - you never know when you are going to need double sided tape.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I do mean quick hold</li>
            <li> A little piece of Topstick attached to the backside of the hearing aid sticks lightly to his head behind his ear and really does keep the aids in place.</li>

            <li> I actually used it during an opera theater show and it stayed on through the sweat and action of the performances, but it did irritate the skin on my chest a little taping and removing it 5 times each weekend.  </li>
            <li> use this any time I go to work in a button up shirt - just in case it decides to gape on me - or when my shirt is a little to low cut, I can tape it to my body - keeping it professional.</li>
            <li> I use this as an accessory to fix minor fashion issues.....like blouse gap.</li>
            <li> We actually use this product to adhere our daughter&#x27;s cochlear implants to her ears so they stay on, it was just as we expected in the time promised.  </li>
            <li> I take a piece, cut it in half and place it into my red clown nose.</li>
            <li> Keeps bra strap hidden, keeps gaps closed, stops breezes from raising my skirt above my head.</li>
            <li> All in all, it provided the adhesion needed with a little extra help.</li>
            <li> I would be careful though because I know with some people, like I found out this weekend</li>
            <li> A couple other nights, I used it between my cardigan and a dress</li>
            <li> Everything else is just an imitation.</li>
            <li> If the strip is wide it rips in half quite easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really worth it for me to keep using this tape for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy the other tapes!</li>
            <li> I have been doing burlesque for a few months and been using this product from other dancers.</li>
            <li> I cut these in half lengthwise and use this in lieu of Hollywood Tape for keeping my dress straps in place.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stickier and half the price.  </li>
            <li> I was about half was through mine when carried it in my cosmetic bag in my car</li>
            <li> One little piece actually sticks and re-sticks, too, for at least a few wearings.</li>
            <li> I cut small pieces off this tape and it holds his hearing aids in place all day through sweating and rough play.</li>
            <li> I have used it everyday since I received it.</li>
            <li> By doing this I do not have to use any of the messy clown glues that stick to your skin when the nose is removed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the have it listed as roll tape, because it comes in strips.  </li>
            <li> It might stick to a thin skin wig but not lace.  </li>
            <li> the remainder of the tapes were useless.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This looks fancy but it doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> We use this wig tape for our son&#x27;s cochlear implants. Works great!</li>
            <li> Stayed on great for a Halloween costume.</li>
            <li> A very good product. It holds securely, and will not damage your lace system. I do recommend this item to those of you who wear lace wigs. No damage to hair or skin..</li>
            <li> I use this as an accessory to fix minor fashion issues.....like blouse gap.</li>
            <li> We actually use this product to adhere our daughter&#x27;s cochlear implants to her ears so they stay on, it was just as we expected in the time promised.  works great.</li>
            <li> I stick one of these at the front of my wigs and it keeps them from sliding around, especialy if I have a cap on too.I take the wig off at night but the tape holds 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but not that great it will get the job done but not fantastically. It is pretty good product</li>
            <li> I have never in my life worn a wig but it was suggested to use this to help keep my sons hearing aids in place. I cut small pieces off this tape and it holds his hearing aids in place all day through sweating and rough play. So I can&#x27;t say that it works good on wigs but I know for a fact that if you have a little one that uses hearing aids this is perfect to keep them in place. It gently peels off, easy to clean up and does not irritate the skin at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for over 5 years now.&lt;br /&gt;Strong stick and no allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;This is the most popular brand for men and women peaces in the market right now.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a 5 star Product.</li>
            <li> I did not care for these strips would have like them to hold stronger but for a quick and I do mean quick hold it was just OK</li>
            <li> We bought this tape to try to keep the cochlear implant headpiece on our sons head from falling off. Our 15 month old son has fine hair so the tape doesn&#x27;t stick so well to his scalp.  I have to pull his hair apart to expose as much of his scalp as possible for the tape to adhere yet in the process my son gets fussy. It&#x27;s not really worth it for me to keep using this tape for that purpose. Each time the magnet falls off w the tape, it pulls some of my son&#x27;s hair out. Also the sticky residue left on the headpiece is hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been doing burlesque for a few months and been using this product from other dancers. It. Is. AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it leaves no residue, or any pain. I would be careful though because I know with some people, like I found out this weekend, it can cause a reaction. So I would just be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for me, no reactions. And it&#x27;s great for holding my pasties on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not kidding, no woman should be without Topstick. I have used it everyday since I received it. Keeps bra strap hidden, keeps gaps closed, stops breezes from raising my skirt above my head. If I could I would give them out to all my friends like packs of gum. I live it!!!</li>
            <li> Use this for lace moustache and beards</li>
            <li> Perfect nothing to say</li>
            <li> I ordered this for applying facial hair to kids in a high school show of &amp;#34;Beauty and the Beast.&amp;#34; It wasn&#x27;t providing the required adhesion all the way through the show, so I ended up prepping the skin with rubbing alcohol first, then a thin layer of spirit gum before applying the facial hair with the Topstick. This proved to hold the hair on the entire show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your actor isn&#x27;t sweaty or running around a lot, or if the adhesion isn&#x27;t used in an area with a lot of movement (like the mouth), then it may provide better hold on its own. All in all, it provided the adhesion needed with a little extra help.</li>
            <li> Did not stick at all. Wig slid to the left almost right away.</li>
            <li> We used this to ensure my daughter&#x27;s wedding dress stayed perfectly in place.  Superior to fashion tapes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re buying this tape for your lace wig.......... THEN DON&#x27;T BUY IT!!!  It doesn&#x27;t stick at all!  It might stick to a thin skin wig but not lace.  Save your money and buy the other tapes!</li>
            <li> It does not stick at all!!! Wouldn&#x27;t stick to the netting on my wig nor to my skin !! I would not recommend!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after hearing \\&quot;the celebrities\\&quot; use it to hold dresses and clothing in place. I was going on a cruise and figured it might come in handy.  Well, the first night I tried it between the top of my dress and my skin to keep from showing too much, and it didn&#x27;t want to stick at all.  A couple other nights, I used it between my cardigan and a dress and it stuck between the materials perfectly.  I can&#x27;t speak to it as a toupee tape, having not used it for that, but I know it didn&#x27;t stick to my skin very well.  I do tend to be very warm often, but my skin is normal - neither oily nor dry - so maybe I just didn&#x27;t prep my skin properly.</li>
            <li> If you cut the strips in fourths or even smaller, they work great for keeping the CI processors on the ear. The tape sticks very well and it is nice to have pre-cut strips handy and ready to use!</li>
            <li> They work great and are affordable.</li>
            <li> Good product, and good company</li>
            <li> another great product  for the back of the hair piece it curves and you can cut it to whatever you want to shape the back of your hair piece</li>
            <li> I use these strips, cut into small pieces, to keep my infant son&#x27;s hearing aids on more securely. A little piece of Topstick attached to the backside of the hearing aid sticks lightly to his head behind his ear and really does keep the aids in place. Great product! One little piece actually sticks and re-sticks, too, for at least a few wearings.</li>
            <li> i read the others review before i bought this item for my wife an it worked great on her lace wig.</li>
            <li> I read somewhere it can double as a dress tape but somehow I didnt find it to work. The lint on the fabric and the oil on the skin wont let it work.</li>
            <li> I cut these in half lengthwise and use this in lieu of Hollywood Tape for keeping my dress straps in place.  It&#x27;s stickier and half the price.  I actually used it during an opera theater show and it stayed on through the sweat and action of the performances, but it did irritate the skin on my chest a little taping and removing it 5 times each weekend.  I always make sure I clean my skin with rubbing alcohol or astringent before sticking the tape down.  It holds longer when there is not extra oil on the skin.</li>
            <li> I am a female and I wear a human hair topper that needs a piece of wig tape in the front. I cut each one of the strip in thirds and that works perfectly!  I remove my topper daily and these tapes hold well and don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a TV sound guy and use this to hold lavaliere microphones in place. TopStick is the first tape I reach for in my sound kit and works better than anything else I know for keeping mics in place and clothing noise as little as possible.</li>
            <li> Okay ladies - this is something you just should always keep in your bag, if you carry too small of a bag, take a few of these out and stick them in your coin purse - you never know when you are going to need double sided tape.&lt;br /&gt;I use this any time I go to work in a button up shirt - just in case it decides to gape on me - or when my shirt is a little to low cut, I can tape it to my body - keeping it professional.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the have it listed as roll tape, because it comes in strips.  It does work well.</li>
            <li> The tape works extremely well at first but the box has to be kept in a cool environment. I was about half was through mine when carried it in my cosmetic bag in my car and the adhesive began to melt. the remainder of the tapes were useless. It holds my wig in place with all day coverage. This product is excellent as long as you store in a cool dry place.</li>
            <li> its easy to stick on.and in my situation lasts for three days&lt;br /&gt;its so good less mess and easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thank You Very much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Pravin Patel</li>
            <li> I am a professional clown.  I take a piece, cut it in half and place it into my red clown nose. By doing this I do not have to use any of the messy clown glues that stick to your skin when the nose is removed. There is no cleanup</li>
            <li> I use these to keep tops/shirts where I want them. Since manufacturing companies can&#x27;t seem to make a top that covers, I use these to keep &amp;#34;the girls&amp;#34; covered and the shoulders on my shoulders. They work well and don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Everything else is just an imitation. The classic go to tape-works for all manner of wardrobe disaster avoidance as well as toupee tape. If the strip is wide it rips in half quite easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s available for around $5.00 at most beauty supplies, not sure why it&#x27;s so expensive on here.</li>
