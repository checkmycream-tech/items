            <li>The gentlest roll will pick up all the polish you need to get a great transfer to the nail.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>I had heard great things about XL squishes and gave this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off the bat, it would not pick up ANY designs.</li>
            <li>it picks the image great</li>

            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this one on amazon.</li>
            <li>however so the stickiness doesnt go away which i believe makes it great)</li>
            <li>Great for images you have to line up, and it was a lot easier to prevent smudging.</li>
            <li>Great product for the price.  </li>

            <li>Very deserving of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Just started playing with this 2 days ago when I received it and its already made an amazing difference in the quality of my designs!</li>
            <li>you can do amazing designs!</li>
            <li>but it works AMAZINGLY!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it will work just wonderful</li>
            <li>I like creative shop and moyou best</li>
            <li>I will get it buffed out, and then I am sure it will be great!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen this used successfully in youtube tutorials, so</li>
            <li>to be fair it would be a great stamper it did not keep falling apart.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>but once you get the hang of it, it works really good.</li>
            <li>(Good thing I contacted them).</li>
            <li>It does pick up the images from the plates really good.</li>
            <li>I know it is a good product.  </li>
            <li>yes it is, however don&#x27;t let that stop you from getting it because if works good.</li>
            <li>Maybe a better sponge tip along with the good scrapers and you will have a winner!</li>
            <li>Also do not use acetone on this stamper, i use a sticky lint roller to clean it up and it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>Picked up the images cleanly and released on to the Nail perfectly</li>
            <li>The stamper does an excellent job on full size - all over - nail stamps.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and I am very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It works great and cannot wait to do more nail art with it.</li>
            <li>Works great for longer nails and nails with a prominent C curve.  </li>
            <li>Great product and was delivered ahead of schedule which is an added perk :)</li>
            <li>you need to file it till some of the shine is gone then test it and file some more if the image isnt picked up well and repeat until you are happy with how the image is picked up.</li>
            <li>This has become my very favorite stamper.  </li>
            <li>This is a great buy &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>The right way is to push the stamper in perpendicular direction to the plate, do some pressure and the design comes out beautifully!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This stamp is like magic!</li>
            <li>Love this stamper!</li>
            <li>Using the plastic scrapers is a better idea though because it does not damage my metal stamp art plates!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS STAMPER!</li>
            <li>I like using the large squishy stampers over firmer ones and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li>However the rubber end is amazing.  </li>
            <li>in one word amazing....</li>
            <li>works amazingly.</li>
            <li>This stamp works amazingly.</li>
            <li>Nice product just need practice</li>
            <li>I am just thrilled with this product</li>
            <li>never used this kind of stamper before.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to have options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, the scrapers are nice.  </li>
            <li>This stamper works perfectly if you gently file the squishy cushion with a nail file.  </li>
            <li>the squishy stamper captures the images on the plates nicely.</li>
            <li>The stamper is a nice size.</li>
            <li>well is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>and it works nicely.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going to try another kind of stamper, just for grins.</li>
            <li>lmao</li>
            <li>I use my older konad and works great!  </li>
            <li>is easy to use and soft to touch, works great for me, the stamper is perfect.</li>
            <li>Do not use acetone to clean the gel !!  </li>
            <li>EASY ON AND OFF GOOD FOR BEGINNERS</li>
            <li>Love that I was able to get this stamper!</li>
            <li>love love this stamper!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 100% pleased and will be ordering more heads for it!</li>
            <li>There might be a bit of a sucking sound as it shifts into place; that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>, now, onto my review about this stamper:&lt;br /&gt;-First of all, it is SO SOFT and that&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>i think the stamper is even better than konad to be honest</li>
            <li>but that can be fixed with a bit of glue over all very happy</li>
            <li>I used a very fine grit nail file to do this.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>The scrapers were very cheap and all plastic.</li>
            <li>The miniature scraper is a super great idea, and it works fine...</li>
            <li>Great item love this item works great easy to pick up stamps super fast shipping</li>
            <li>It took me a while to get the hang of this one, but its large surface works great for the length of my nails</li>
            <li>I love this stamper.</li>
            <li>Was hoping this would do even better.  </li>
            <li>This is better than the stamper I got with the Salon Express kit.</li>
            <li>Great for picking up the whole picture/pattern.</li>
            <li>i love this stamper and Winstonia delivered on time</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stamper.</li>
            <li>Love this stamper.  </li>
            <li>i love it..</li>
            <li>I love the size of this and the squishiness--</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll make it a bit more snug.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no problem with the end falling out, although I&#x27;m sure it can</li>
            <li>I also love the plastic scrapers because I don&#x27;t use metal scrapers on my plates because they leave scratches.</li>
            <li>of course I ordered two more nail stamp sets from you.</li>
            <li>when I did it that way, was able to do this well.</li>
            <li>No instructions or inserts so many (like myself) would have to wing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I totally love it.</li>
            <li>Done :)</li>
            <li>I love stamping</li>
            <li>I usually love Winstonia&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>So the stamper is OK.</li>
            <li>I was able to pick up much better images with this stamper.</li>
            <li>Magic happened.  </li>
            <li>Watched many videos to see how to use this since I was used to the Konad which is rubber and firmer.  </li>
            <li>This stamper has become my favorite.</li>
            <li>Also, the bell shape scraper works even better than my Konad plastic scraper.</li>
            <li>great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>but thats ok because I didnt buy it for the&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li>The stamp is permanently sticky, I&#x27;ve wiped with nail polish remover and acetone, the top is always tacky to the touch.</li>
            <li>I love this stamper</li>
            <li>The next day I tried it again and this time it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>Ok so now that I tested it out</li>
            <li>I must say that I just love it.</li>
            <li>Otherwise works ok</li>
            <li>I have the Konad brand stamper and the cici and sisi stamper and both work better than this stamper.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if I had ordered this used or not as it came in a ziplock bag...</li>
            <li>I also heard you can take it out and put it inside a bottle top</li>
            <li>love it and will be ordering more ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the look but</li>
            <li>I love, love,love  </li>
            <li>Really love my stamper thank you...</li>
            <li>I love this stamper, I used to have a konad stamper</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the most stamping experience, I&#x27;ll admit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rare occasion that I pick up a really good image</li>
            <li>Works way better than the kit stamper I was using before.  </li>
            <li>If I buy more (like as gifts, or to have one to leave at my boyfriends house) I will stick with the Claire&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li>This stamper works way better than the stamper I received in the kit I ordered before.</li>
            <li>In my personal experience, the bell shaped scraper it the best.</li>
            <li>This stamp is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Works perfectly for full nail designs and small designs!&lt;br /&gt;It makes all the job easier, picks up all the polish for perfect designs, easy to apply to the nail and easy to clean!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s huge and squishy, it picks up images very easily and transfer even better.</li>
            <li>Happy New Year!</li>
            <li>With the flat side it easily picked up the image with a very light touch and stamped perfectly on the nail.</li>
            <li>but my full nail stamps have never turned out this nice.  </li>
            <li>This eliminates that issue, the soft, squishy texture transfers beautifully with no need to roll.</li>
            <li>, it took me awhile to get use to it because of large size, but once I got the grip of it, it is fantastic, works really great, now I can enlarge and shrink the images.  </li>
            <li>But I especially love this stamper because it is larger than any other stamper I have seen, so it accommodates L and XL images perfectly.</li>
            <li>The images are so nice and clean and full coverage for my thumb!</li>
            <li>OMG I love me because its so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The stamping head is very soft and a great size, but it is does not have that marshmallow feel that I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>all clean!</li>
            <li>The stamp is great and the straight edge is metal do the slates and stamps are clean</li>
            <li>As seen on Youtube I bought a Mr. Clean magic eraser and buffed the top of the spongy thing.  </li>
            <li>So far it is picking up images great.</li>
            <li>(Useful if you smudge a bit of nailpolish on the sides; the holder kind of gets in the way)</li>
            <li>I had heard good things about this stamper and was very eager to try it out.</li>
            <li>Really love it, is easy to use and soft to touch, highly recommended, works for me, the stamper is perfect</li>
            <li>BUT I flipped it to the other side and tried again scraped off perfectly.</li>
            <li>BUT I flipped it to the other side and tried again scraped off perfectly.</li>
            <li>Also using the tape to clean it works so much better than trying to use acetone.</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it, its easy to use.</li>
            <li>The stampy ends are designed to come out so that you can clean them more easily.</li>
            <li>but once you know the technique its easy.</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly too.  </li>
            <li>That is easy to solve using a bottle lid as a stamper.</li>
            <li>Cleaning it between stamps is so easy:  </li>
            <li>LOVE that you do not use acetone to clean this (do NOT use acetone on this, period).</li>
            <li>That part also comes out easily though; but some krazy glue could fix that.</li>
            <li>do come out easily</li>
            <li>Once you file the top off (literally) and clean it with Acetone to get off the stickiness, the product will work fine.  </li>
            <li>Suddenly, its picking up beautifully every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>yup sure would be cool</li>
            <li>Hands down one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a while!</li>
            <li>Pure MAGIC!</li>
            <li>The scrapers were fine.</li>
            <li>Buff all the shine off with a fine grit buffer evenly.</li>
            <li>plate and stamping polish can be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;Konad plates and polish work fine.</li>
            <li>This would have been fine because my Konad stamp does it sometimes too.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do well with images that contain fine lines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, too, because you can get full nail coverage without having to roll the stamper, as this one is soft.  </li>
            <li>shipping was quick!</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need konad or a special stamping polish; it works great with many regular brands.</li>
            <li>the little stamp is perfect.  </li>
            <li>As for the stamper itself, it is easy to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t is so comfortable, anyways</li>
            <li>Some people use tape, but I find a lint roller to be very convenient and effective.</li>
            <li>Just lightly buff off all the shine.  </li>
            <li>so I took a medium file and lightly filed it to remove the smooth shiny surface.</li>
            <li>then you know how detailed their plates are.</li>
            <li>so I thought that was thoughtful.</li>
            <li>the most useful was video</li>
            <li>The scrapers are plastic and are easy to clean and don&#x27;t scratch up your plates.</li>
            <li>The red end works really well, and always makes a perfect transfer.</li>
            <li>but once you find the right amount of pressure to use you will love this stamper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve followed all of the instructions, used tape to clean it and NOT acetone, pressed lightly when trying to pick up the image, lightly filed the surface ,</li>
            <li>Even cleaning it off is quick and easy using the scotch tape method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have fun!</li>
            <li>The pueen super squishy works just fine</li>
            <li>It is a great stamper for long fingernails.</li>
            <li>I bought this along with moyou stamping plates and if you&#x27;re familiar with moyou</li>
            <li>I have had nothing but success with this stamper!</li>
            <li>okay at first i</li>
            <li>First, the stamper arrived promptly, ahead of schedule!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading tons of reviews, here and elsewhere, in which the reviewer said that once they&#x27;d figured it out this was their favorite stamper, I was determined to work with it until I made it work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really excited for this because I use a lot of full nail designs that don&#x27;t fit my nails</li>
            <li>The stamper needs to be filed very lightly with a file that doesn&#x27;t have large grits.</li>
            <li>Do NOT try to clean your Winstonia stamper with acetone or nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>You can clean it by using the sticky side of a piece of tape</li>
            <li>It feels like those sticky reusable lint rollers that you have to clean with water.</li>
            <li>The easiest way to clean the stamp is just stamp it on the lint roller.</li>
            <li>I also found a tip online about doubling a piece of tape to use to clean it as it&#x27;s used.  </li>
            <li>so I taped it to my scraping palate to clean between each stamp.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t clean with polish remover ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and squishy that I&#x27;ve gotten great transfers just by lining it up and pressing my whole nail into the pad</li>
            <li>I also read how to clean the stopper.</li>
            <li>Use tape to clean it, you&#x27;ll se is easier that way too for the others</li>
            <li>I use the tape to clean it too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the softer texture of the stamping head as far as stamping the nail but had issues with being able to pick up the image.  </li>
            <li>Use a tape roller to clean it.</li>
            <li>i clean the residue on the stamper after stamping off with tape to maintain it sticky and saves you nail polish.</li>
            <li>worked once, I pressed it against tape to clean it, but again, it wouldn&#x27;t pick up any polish.</li>
            <li>I tried to use tape to clean</li>
            <li>it continually pops out of the holder when picking up images or when you clean it on a lint roller.</li>
            <li>I was very exited about this stamper mostly because most of the reviews were good, the package arrived and the note that came with the stamper was all wet, so I don&#x27;t now</li>
            <li>Granted I do not have special polish..</li>
            <li>The stamper gave me nice clean and clear images on my nails.  </li>
            <li>Really nice and large surface for stamping, but I will need to buff this out because It did not pick up the design on the first try, as it is quite shiny.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need to roll to stamp on the nail, doesn&#x27;t matter how hard you scrape, it&#x27;ll still pick up the image and stamp it perfectly.</li>
            <li>The stamper is great on the pink side.</li>
            <li>If you want to use full nail images, this is the best.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this and am so much happier with this than my Konrad one...</li>
            <li>Full nail patterns</li>
            <li>Full nail patterns</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t pop out once during the one full mani + 5 practice swatches I did; Not once.</li>
            <li>the big scraper works good sometimes.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t scrape the polish off plate good enough to pick the image off the plate.</li>
            <li>Soft stamper, nice product</li>
            <li>However, I haven&#x27;t had any success in using this for ANY plate using special and (non) special polishes.</li>
            <li>Other than that is is great.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and didn&#x27;t require much priming.</li>
            <li>I like this stamp delivery was quick picks up</li>
            <li>This has quickly become my preferred stamper.</li>
            <li>I did receive it very quickly so that was one positive.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this set to everyone. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much, will order again!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite stamper.</li>
            <li>I totally love and am enjoyin my new stamper</li>
            <li>I love my new stamper.</li>
            <li>Its certainly easy to get used to and makes thing go so much faster.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to straight stamp, which I couldn&#x27;t do with my Konad stampers.</li>
            <li>If you want clean again with dishsoap after each manicure, make sure to air dry since it will pick up lint super easy.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
            <li>Thanks again!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stamper!!!</li>
            <li>My first package looked like it went through a war!</li>
            <li>This is great for people with highly arched nails as opposed to having a flat nail bed.</li>
            <li>Although I can easily remove it, I don&#x27;t have the same problem many people have of the silicone gel popping</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so quick and easy to just leave a strip of tape near by and clean it off.</li>
            <li>it picks up clean crisp images.  </li>
            <li>No problem with the foam popping out and the plastic little scraper works great; don&#x27;t like to use metal as they scratch my plates.  </li>
            <li>and once I got this one and used it for the first time I could tell immediately I was right!</li>
            <li>The larger scraper works wonderfully and the stamp itself is large enough to pick up images from cheeky jumbo plates.</li>
            <li>the stamper does come out of the holder but that is helpful when you want to stretch your imagine to fit your whole nail otherwise</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>Practiced with it just once and felt confident to do a complete stamping mani.</li>
            <li>I also liked the idea of the double ended stamp.</li>
            <li>I think it is well worth buying.</li>
            <li>As an older woman with arthritis I can&#x27;t believe how easy this stamper makes everything.  </li>
            <li>I am so thrilled because I have longer nails and larger design nail plates.</li>
            <li>just make sure its in the holder completely before you start stamping.</li>
            <li>When I transfer it from the stamper directly to my nail, the image is more transparent instead of opaque.</li>
            <li>an old credit card works better.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s soft, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty sticky and I clean it with scotch tape after each stamp which was a good suggestion I read from other reviewers.</li>
            <li>Per other reviews, the pad does indeed pop off, and right away, but a little adhesive will solve that I&#x27;m sure, and this is otherwise great!  </li>
            <li>Item came quickly and is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I have watched many different tutorials on how to prep the stamp, clean the stamp, use the stamp...</li>
            <li>My tips for using it are to first &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; it by gently buffing it with a fine grain buffer.</li>
            <li>but I could not get it to work right.</li>
            <li>Fell apart and way to sticky for my taste as the prints didn&#x27;t come out right....</li>
            <li>scraper: I know, some people don&#x27;t like it, but mine was perfectly level, not rough or uneven, and also did not leave any scratches on my plates (Pueen)</li>
            <li>scraper: I know, some people don&#x27;t like it, but mine was perfectly level, not rough or uneven, and also did not leave any scratches on my plates (Pueen)</li>
            <li>The stamper falls out of the holder from time to time, but that&#x27;s never been more than a slight annoyance for me, and the removable feature is great for people with larger nails who use this stamper to stretch designs.  </li>
            <li>So nice to finally stamp my designs straight, it was driving me nuts!  </li>
            <li>oh also less than a week for shipping great service very please would recommend.</li>
            <li>Does require some prepping before use but other wise completely reliable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great concept, I love how its soft and conforms to your nails rather than being a hard surface and having to roll it like a konad stamper.</li>
            <li>My decision to try this particular stamper was based on the reviews and its unique design.  </li>
            <li>At first I couldn&#x27;t get this stamper to work right.</li>
            <li>picks up imagine easily and complete.</li>
            <li>Yes, the white rubber pops out if you&#x27;d like, makes it easy to clean or replace, but I&#x27;ve never had an issue with it coming out during a manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had success with the bigger scraper as the edge is thicker and it seems that the thinner the edge on the scraper, the better it works.</li>
            <li>this is a great stamper if you are not using white, if your stamping with white you can&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li>Once I got in touch with Winstonia, they fixed my problem very quickly and replaced the head of the stamper.</li>
            <li>As the directions state, and as you would with any new stamper, lightly file the surface before the first use and maybe every 10 manicures or so.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s true that the sponge comes out easily, it does conform to the shape of the nail especially if your nails are rounded!  </li>
            <li>Also, very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I found I had to VERY gently pick up the polish.  </li>
            <li>Very fast delivery</li>
            <li>Hands down, this is the single best nail stamper out there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It definitely has to be primed with a nail file (or nail block) first, and make sure to keep tape on you to pick up everything that sticks to it.</li>
            <li>This is my first squishy one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you could suspend the tape between anything open and with a bit of weight (or between two things, I suppose)</li>
            <li>Which the first time I tried to stamp it was so wobbly that it just smeared the design.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried if with many different nail polishes.</li>
            <li>I actually find this stamper to be more reliable and</li>
            <li>The only thing I would change with this stamper is to also make available a full size colored stamper to allow seeing the white stamping better for placement.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve heard that if you place a bead or two of hot glue gun glue in the area the pad fits</li>
            <li>make sure you&#x27;re using it properly!</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>My first attempt, I was nervous because it didn&#x27;t pick up the design</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because the learning curve with this is pretty steep.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a newbie at stamp art, and that is most likely why.  </li>
            <li>FIRST you HAVE to buffer the surface.</li>
            <li>Its an OK product, but if I were to go back I would send the extra $$$$ for a better one.</li>
            <li>it came on time and is exactly what is described i have yet to try it</li>
            <li>Apart from falling apart the rubber stamp (white part has holes in as it poured into a mould with air bubbles and the holes remain these are both on the top and the bottom and they look as if with continued use</li>
            <li>You can just press your nail exactly onto the design as you want it.</li>
            <li>I wish somebody would put a dcecent quality xl stamp on amazon.our nail exactly onto the design as you want it.</li>
            <li>but then again it&#x27;s my first time to use the stamping technique.</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>Firstly I thought it&#x27;s not working and decided to return it.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>first, I couldn&#x27;t get it to pick up a thing.</li>
            <li>Did need to prime it first in order to get crisper images.</li>
            <li>I first I couldn&#x27;t get it work</li>
            <li>I still was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that it does need to be primed first.</li>
            <li>I did have to lightly file off the shiny film with a (probably) 220 grit nail file; a very soft nail file; it doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li>You can just smoosh it right down over your nail, or smoosh your nail into it, and the pattern goes on nice and clean with none of the distortion that comes from rolling over your nail with the old style stamper.  </li>
            <li>Love the extra large size it picks up everything.</li>
            <li>I though about not giving any stars but decided that since I am able to use the little bell shaped scraper (doesn&#x27;t work fabulous but works) anyway because of that it deserved one star.  </li>
            <li>My wife ordered this product and had some trouble with it at first, however, after contacting the company they were more than wiling to give detailed instruction and suggestions to make it work for her.</li>
            <li>Overall the stamper and the big scraper is good.</li>
            <li>I love this squishy firm stamper so much that I ordered a backup!!!</li>
            <li>though the price was too good to be true considering this is the only seller that offers the xl stamper on amazon and the rest of the stampers are only sold on ebay but come from china and are twice the price...</li>
            <li>When you first get it you need to remove the shiny layer with a dry magic eraser.  </li>
            <li>The positive side is now</li>
            <li>exactly what i was looking for, it came really quickly&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>I have better luck when I don&#x27;t leave the stamp on the plate too long.</li>
            <li>I knew what I was buying thanks to the exact details of the product.</li>
            <li>Winstonia&#x27;s customer service is great and will definitely be ordering from them in the near future.</li>
            <li>The small tip works good</li>
            <li>The stamper is more firm than i thought it would be but overall its a nice stamper i almost wish is was squishier but that might be easier to damage.</li>
            <li>I fixed this by super glueing it</li>
            <li>I did have to buff it before using it but instructions on how to do that were easy enough to find online.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a major pain to clean it with tape all the time and it picks up tons of fuzzies and what not</li>
            <li>the large grits would cause some damage to it if you used it.</li>
            <li>I give this stamper a 5 star because of it&#x27;s softness and large size.  </li>
            <li>I love my new stamper and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>Okay guys, before I tell you how great the Winstonia stamper is, I first have to say a few things in response to the negative reviews:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>I filed both ends with fine and coarse files and started using a lint roller to remove excess polish versus polish remover as some say the remover damages the stamp.</li>
            <li>The large on is very sticky and falls out of the holder all the time.  </li>
            <li>The large stamping end will not stay attached and its REALLY sticky to the touch which makes the smallest piece of lint stick to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large so that you can pick up the whole image even on an xl plate.</li>
            <li>Much easier than using acetone.</li>
            <li>scraper: I didn&#x27;t like it that much</li>
            <li>scraper: I didn&#x27;t like it that much</li>
            <li>then when I went to wipe of the polish (and I wiped it gently)</li>
            <li>so when I received it in mail and took out of package the pad fell out of it and was very sticky, I could not stamp with it</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand the neg reviews of this.</li>
            <li>Just one even handed plunge, immediately after scraping the plate works very well.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t take much pressure to pick up the image off the stamping plate.</li>
            <li>You are now ready to go.  </li>
            <li>It picks up the  images real well</li>
            <li>It really took me a while to get the hang of using this stamper.  </li>
            <li>It is very squishy and had a very marshmallow consistency.</li>
            <li>if you try and practice (you don&#x27;t need to much effort)</li>
            <li>Put the polish on the image plate, and roll the stamper gently across the design.</li>
            <li>so the design covers the whole nail.</li>
            <li>Was really concerned because I bought the rock star plate that has the faces, but it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li>Press the used stamp over the tape and release and the stamp is ready to use again.  </li>
            <li>I find it so much easier to use the lint roller, or even just stamp the remaining polish on to my nail polish</li>
            <li>Although I used a bit of tape to gently remove remaining bits of nail polish and not acetone (which damages the stamper), the sticky side immediately began to tear and crumble, and some bits of gunk seem to be permanently wedged into the surface of the squishy side.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this stamper.  </li>
            <li>the packaging, straight out of the bag, it fell apart, the rubber /plastic</li>
            <li>It was really strange at first, getting used to the stickiness and the squishy texture, but the first time I tried stamping a full nail pattern with it, I was hooked.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this stamper</li>
            <li>Place it perpendicularly against the plate, straight on, rather than rolling it across the plate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The softness &amp; flexibility makes it easier to wrap around the whole nail.</li>
            <li>fast shipping product as described</li>
            <li>if I could experice that as well I&#x27;m ready to throw the thing out the window and</li>
            <li>Thanks for my products</li>
            <li>This one is made out of a thicker silicone and holds up over time very well.</li>
            <li>But that is a small inconvenience compared to being able to transfer a full nail pattern.</li>
            <li>I find you have a little more working time with this stamper than with the other kind.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, its very useful for larger images.</li>
            <li>arrived on time product is as it states like most other reviews the rubber ends</li>
            <li>All the reviews I have read say to NOT use acetone to clean the white end, and to use another sticky surface to &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; off the remaining polish.  </li>
            <li>THIRD don&#x27;t rubber it with polish remover to clean the non used design.</li>
            <li>it tried to use non acetone polish remover to clean it and acetone to clean used several different polishes stamper polish and non stamper polish to still have it not work</li>
            <li>I then resorted to priming several times with various recommendations such as using a fine grit filer, Mr. Clean magic eraser, soap, and using various opaque nail polishes</li>
            <li>I love that its large especially when stamping my big toe and thumbs</li>
            <li>Only thingn that its true its that its a XL but not squishy at all..</li>
            <li>The small red stamper works pretty good...</li>
            <li>i surprised first impression</li>
            <li>OMG what a difference it made it picking up full images whether regular or XL MoYou.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; the soft side by softly filing it a bit prior to use.  </li>
            <li>It picks up and transfers images beautifully, even on difficult to use plates.</li>
            <li>that is a better value (the stampers come in a kit with 3 plates and a mini special polish for $10 even less if you take advantage of there constant cosmetic \\&quot;multiples\\&quot; deals) and there&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t pop out like this one</li>
            <li>The edges get little nicks and tears kind of easily, so it may need to be replaced sometime down the road.  </li>
            <li>but it works way better than any other stamp I&#x27;ve owned!  </li>
            <li>I literally scrape the extra polish off, push the stamper (LIGHTLY) on the plate and pick it right back off.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to pick up the polish (unlike some reviewers, I have had no problems with picking up the polish in a straight up-and-down motion) and also, the softness really helps with laying the polish down too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m frustrated and feel stupid to be having this issue when I read all the great reviews here saying its wonderful and that it&#x27;s pure magic</li>
            <li>Remember, the key to stamping well is to pick up the polish quickly after you scrape, and to do it in one rolling motion.</li>
            <li>Though if your quick stamping on paper after each nail can have the same effect, wont remove lint or hair that way though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it was decent</li>
            <li>The small side is a perfect size for small images.</li>
            <li>I was able to use several plates from various manufactures.</li>
            <li>Love having a bigger stamp for the bigger designs.</li>
            <li>I wasted this much money on something I can&#x27;t get to work when I was so excited to have my first real stamper not the salon express one that I have had for years</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes that this stamper was going to be The One.</li>
            <li>Love the service too, they sent me a little note thanking me for the purchase and stuff</li>
            <li>Was delivered very quickly and works well as stated in the other reviews.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t bad but it isn&#x27;t perfect.</li>
            <li>I got it it was in a cheap zip lock plastic bag, no real packaging</li>
            <li>I was exspecting it to be very sticky and marshmallow soft and it was not.</li>
            <li>This is easier than holding the tape in your fingers and possibly smudging your fresh manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good with small images, having troubles with bigger designs.</li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars because I still think it&#x27;s a bit messy. :)</li>
            <li>The end in which you scrape with is uneven and scratches the plate (which defeats the purpose because most people do not want to see scratches on their plates and would stick to the metal scraper).</li>
            <li>So I buffed the shiny top away with a medium nail file, with firm strokes, and then rinsed it</li>
            <li>This is definitely a keeper and well worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I had at the beginning was that the white end was not very secure in the stamper, but if you squeeze and twist it into the hole it stays much more secure.  </li>
            <li>Put it in, then press down on one side and kind of push/roll it further into the holder.</li>
            <li>amazing that i don&#x27;t have to roll the image on my nail just press down on the nail and BOOM!!!</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t stay put that way, it&#x27;ll pop right back out.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m going to buy the big Konad stamper right now, this thing is already in the trash.</li>
            <li>Do not use nail polish remover on it though, just use some double sided tape and dab it on there and the polish comes right off....</li>
            <li>And the pattern goes right up to the cuticle with no extra effort.  </li>
            <li>The white foam came off right away</li>
            <li>the white part remains stuck to the plate, you  try to clean it between uses the top goes flying off, you rest it down and pick it back up</li>
            <li>I love that the white side is big enough to pick up even big full nail art images without the edges of the images being too close to the edge of the stamper.</li>
            <li>The only good side is the red side the white side suck and doesn&#x27;t pick up the nail polish overall</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly new to stamping, and w/</li>
            <li>If faulty I would like a new one and if the norm, I will not buy again.</li>
            <li>The bottom white part of this stamper is very large but it comes out and it is very soft</li>
            <li>because you can take out the white part (no it will not break trust me) and use it to minimized the image (to make the image smaller) to make it fit on your nail,</li>
            <li>I thought it had filed down the stamper too much, but after doing my first full set of nails with stamping on all of them, I finally got the hang of using this stamper.</li>
            <li>Love the black handle however had to order messy mention stamping head works so much better than the white one that comes with it.</li>
            <li>they had the audacity to send a small note with the item askinh to make sure to give them a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li>and this was alot different for me at first.</li>
            <li>so I am limited to that one, but it is kind of small for the large stamps.</li>
            <li>Clean the white pad only by rolling it across some tape.</li>
            <li>As other have said the simplest way to clean</li>
            <li>The stamp keeps falling out of the holder and the stamper doesn&#x27;t do a clean stamp like the other stamper I have.</li>
            <li>Great price, only issue is white piece doesn&#x27;t want to stay in,and trouble with stamping on white side</li>
            <li>WASTE your Money like I did...........for as much as it cost all I got that was useable was the tiny bell scrapper, and honestly, an old credit card works better than it.</li>
            <li>images transferred were nice and clear but the trouble to get them in the first place its not worth it.</li>
            <li>images transferred were nice and clear but the trouble to get them in the first place its not worth it.</li>
            <li>This stamper only seems to pick up images if you only use the special stamping polishes.  </li>
            <li>I personally clean the squishy white stamp part with a piece of clear white tape; no fuss no muss.</li>
            <li>The more I let the stamper sit on the image, the less polish it actually picks</li>
            <li>If you put it in by firmly pressing around the circumference, it stays in fine.</li>
            <li>i had tried the konad (only picks up certain nail polish brands $$$)....</li>
            <li>At first I couldn&#x27;t get the large white side of the stamp to work but after reading some online reviews I saw that trying the to pick up the image you go straight down and then roll to apply.</li>
            <li>etc-- nothing I have done has picked up a consistently clear image.  </li>
            <li>The sticky white end comes out a bit, but that&#x27;s not too much of an issue.</li>
            <li>, as far as it being sent in pieces, that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
            <li>I was using old gift cards and old credit cards to scrape</li>
            <li>However, all I needed to do was gently press the stamp end back in.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;(3) applied nail polish to selected design&lt;br /&gt;(4) scarped polish using old gift card (the scrapers that come with this stamp...</li>
            <li>I was surprised that the stopper was sticky.</li>
            <li>I ordered it because it was larger and could pick up the whole images from the plates.</li>
            <li>Completely plastic and doesn&#x27;t scrape well.</li>
            <li>The white end is really squishy and you don&#x27;t roll the image on just mash.</li>
            <li>The stamper kept falling out of the holder and when trying to pick up an image off a plate the stamp did not look as clear as when I used my old stamper</li>
            <li>It goes over the nail well because it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li>It picked up the design well for me; and goes over my nails well because it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li>It was slightly soft and not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>As for the scrapers I cannot get a grip on them, no problem i&#x27;ll keep using my old credit cards.</li>
            <li>how much I pushed it back in</li>
            <li>If you are wondering if this nail stamp is soft...</li>
            <li>The marshmallow ones can be finicky at times because it is so soft and sticky</li>
            <li>So soft that the central high point on the head would literally push the polish out of the way when trying to gather the image</li>
            <li>First off, the larger white stamp did not transfer ANY nail polish to the nail.</li>
            <li>This will only work with one particular brand of nail polish that i have....</li>
            <li>After a lot of practice, I learned that I must stamp straight down on to the image plate, and pull the stamper right back up.</li>
            <li>I go straight up and down when picking up compact images and roll with longer images although with this size really didn&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li>Lightly file down the white silicone stamper until it is not shiny anymore.</li>
            <li>I purchased this with such high hopes.</li>
            <li>it was really sticky and soft a little too much and</li>
            <li>Majorly BUMMED!</li>
            <li>I sure would love that feel like a dumb failure over here</li>
            <li>this feature bothers you, a little super glue would probably keep the end piece in place...</li>
            <li>The squishy white head makes aligning the design so easy since you can simply press down instead of roll.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s to pick up polish better than a regular hard stamper.</li>
            <li>(just stamp down on it, the leftover nail polish comes right off).</li>
            <li>The stamper did pick up some of the designs but after a while it was very apparent that I would have to prep it.</li>
            <li>When this stamper set arrived, the large soft white end was rolling loose in the package</li>
            <li>it just pops right out, leaving a mess of polish EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li>I just received mine and the large white end of the stamper is very soft &amp; squishy unlike other stampers I bought.</li>
            <li>When you do it this way, at the same time that you are putting the soft bit in, you are pushing air out.</li>
            <li>All I do is pick up the image, transfer it to my nail, and then stick the white end directly onto the sticky side of the lint roll sheet.  </li>
            <li>but I just went back to using an old plastic gift card.</li>
            <li>barely.</li>
            <li>the only thing it does hold is dust or anything else near by . .  </li>
            <li>times that it did stamp the softness of it made it much easier than stamping with the harder Konad stamp.</li>
            <li>the problem of it detaching i put a coin inside and that not only keeps the soft part of the stamper from going in but because it is sticky it sticks to the coin and does not allow it to fall.</li>
            <li>I have fairly curved nails and my konad stamper just wasn&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li>most frustrating thing is that I had to search online to find out how to use it.  </li>
            <li>The only part that made it hard to use  was that i had to press harder onto the nail plate in order to get the image unlike konad stampers so it took a few times to get a hang of, but Other than that the product works great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this stamper once, and did have trouble picking up some designs, though, I&#x27;m sure it was due to the nail polish I used.  </li>
            <li>, it was a bit too curved for me to use, at least with the plates I was using (small images), but I&#x27;ll keep it around; maybe it&#x27;ll come in handy for bigger things.problems with picking up the polish in a straight up-and-down motion) and also, the softness really helps with laying the polish down too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, I found it only needs a light touch when stamping because my first time I messed one up because I think I pressed too hard and it sort of squiched the design a little.</li>
            <li>And it is impossible to clean even with nail polish remover as the fibers (even lint free) stick.  </li>
            <li>is a lifesaver for stretching those too small plate images to fit long nails or wider thumb</li>
            <li>Even the scrapers are absolute garbage, the bell shaped mini scraper is jagged and uneven, the other does not scrape all of the polish off of the plate and leaves a mess, no matter how many times or different directions you scrape.</li>
            <li>far as the scrapers go I definitely prefer them to the metal varieties, and each one scrapes differently</li>
            <li>I like that it is soft which allows you to stamp your entire nail without the rolling motion which when done with a traditional stamper can be hit or miss when it comes to lining up</li>
            <li>This smaller side worked however the straight edge to clean your slate did not do its job either because it left streaks of nail polish behind.</li>
            <li>but it is also very small and doesn&#x27;t fit over my entire nail.</li>
            <li>I generally grow my nails long and the regular stampers don&#x27;t provide complete coverage.</li>
            <li>this makes the regular Konad stamper that i have too small to stamp any full nail images on my nails without double stamping.</li>
            <li>The Winstonia stamper is different from any other stamper because the large white end is coated in a sticky substance that makes picking up and transferring images a breeze.  </li>
            <li>So I now have a small and a large soft marshmallow stamper.  </li>
            <li>It is also hard to lift complete images consistently.  </li>
            <li>Had a tiny bit of trouble at first</li>
            <li>, it was a bit too curved for me to use, at least with the plates I was using (small images), but I&#x27;ll keep it around; maybe it&#x27;ll come in handy for bigger things.</li>
            <li>I love how it grabs more of the images and doesn&#x27;t mess up the base nail polish.</li>
            <li>And none of those things is enough to take a star away from how this little stamper lets me have straight stripes and geometric patterns with ease.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty annoyed I wasted money on this AND a nice new XL stamping plate, since the stamper will be useless trying to pick up my new images.</li>

            <li> Just started playing with this 2 days ago when I received it and its already made an amazing difference in the quality of my designs!</li>
            <li> you can do amazing designs!</li>
            <li> but it works AMAZINGLY!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it will work just wonderful</li>
            <li> I like creative shop and moyou best</li>
            <li> I will get it buffed out, and then I am sure it will be great!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this used successfully in youtube tutorials, so</li>
            <li> to be fair it would be a great stamper it did not keep falling apart.</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> but once you get the hang of it, it works really good.</li>
            <li> (Good thing I contacted them).</li>
            <li> It does pick up the images from the plates really good.</li>
            <li> I know it is a good product.  </li>
            <li> yes it is, however don&#x27;t let that stop you from getting it because if works good.</li>
            <li> Maybe a better sponge tip along with the good scrapers and you will have a winner!</li>
            <li> Also do not use acetone on this stamper, i use a sticky lint roller to clean it up and it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Picked up the images cleanly and released on to the Nail perfectly</li>
            <li> The stamper does an excellent job on full size - all over - nail stamps.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and I am very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It works great and cannot wait to do more nail art with it.</li>
            <li> Works great for longer nails and nails with a prominent C curve.  </li>
            <li> Great product and was delivered ahead of schedule which is an added perk :)</li>
            <li> you need to file it till some of the shine is gone then test it and file some more if the image isnt picked up well and repeat until you are happy with how the image is picked up.</li>
            <li> This has become my very favorite stamper.  </li>
            <li> This is a great buy &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The right way is to push the stamper in perpendicular direction to the plate, do some pressure and the design comes out beautifully!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This stamp is like magic!</li>
            <li> Love this stamper!</li>
            <li> Using the plastic scrapers is a better idea though because it does not damage my metal stamp art plates!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS STAMPER!</li>
            <li> I like using the large squishy stampers over firmer ones and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> However the rubber end is amazing.  </li>
            <li> in one word amazing....</li>
            <li> works amazingly.</li>
            <li> This stamp works amazingly.</li>
            <li> Nice product just need practice</li>
            <li> I am just thrilled with this product</li>
            <li> never used this kind of stamper before.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to have options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the scrapers are nice.  </li>
            <li> This stamper works perfectly if you gently file the squishy cushion with a nail file.  </li>
            <li> the squishy stamper captures the images on the plates nicely.</li>
            <li> The stamper is a nice size.</li>
            <li> well is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> and it works nicely.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to try another kind of stamper, just for grins.</li>
            <li> lmao</li>
            <li> I use my older konad and works great!  </li>
            <li> is easy to use and soft to touch, works great for me, the stamper is perfect.</li>
            <li> Do not use acetone to clean the gel !!  </li>
            <li> EASY ON AND OFF GOOD FOR BEGINNERS</li>
            <li> Love that I was able to get this stamper!</li>
            <li> love love this stamper!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% pleased and will be ordering more heads for it!</li>
            <li> There might be a bit of a sucking sound as it shifts into place; that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> , now, onto my review about this stamper:&lt;br /&gt;-First of all, it is SO SOFT and that&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> i think the stamper is even better than konad to be honest</li>
            <li> but that can be fixed with a bit of glue over all very happy</li>
            <li> I used a very fine grit nail file to do this.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> The scrapers were very cheap and all plastic.</li>
            <li> The miniature scraper is a super great idea, and it works fine...</li>
            <li> Great item love this item works great easy to pick up stamps super fast shipping</li>
            <li> It took me a while to get the hang of this one, but its large surface works great for the length of my nails</li>
            <li> I love this stamper.</li>
            <li> Was hoping this would do even better.  </li>
            <li> This is better than the stamper I got with the Salon Express kit.</li>
            <li> Great for picking up the whole picture/pattern.</li>
            <li> i love this stamper and Winstonia delivered on time</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stamper.</li>
            <li> Love this stamper.  </li>
            <li> i love it..</li>
            <li> I love the size of this and the squishiness--</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll make it a bit more snug.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no problem with the end falling out, although I&#x27;m sure it can</li>
            <li> I also love the plastic scrapers because I don&#x27;t use metal scrapers on my plates because they leave scratches.</li>
            <li> of course I ordered two more nail stamp sets from you.</li>
            <li> when I did it that way, was able to do this well.</li>
            <li> No instructions or inserts so many (like myself) would have to wing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I totally love it.</li>
            <li> Done :)</li>
            <li> I love stamping</li>
            <li> I usually love Winstonia&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> So the stamper is OK.</li>
            <li> I was able to pick up much better images with this stamper.</li>
            <li> Magic happened.  </li>
            <li> Watched many videos to see how to use this since I was used to the Konad which is rubber and firmer.  </li>
            <li> This stamper has become my favorite.</li>
            <li> Also, the bell shape scraper works even better than my Konad plastic scraper.</li>
            <li> great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> but thats ok because I didnt buy it for the&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> The stamp is permanently sticky, I&#x27;ve wiped with nail polish remover and acetone, the top is always tacky to the touch.</li>
            <li> I love this stamper</li>
            <li> The next day I tried it again and this time it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Ok so now that I tested it out</li>
            <li> I must say that I just love it.</li>
            <li> Otherwise works ok</li>
            <li> I have the Konad brand stamper and the cici and sisi stamper and both work better than this stamper.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if I had ordered this used or not as it came in a ziplock bag...</li>
            <li> I also heard you can take it out and put it inside a bottle top</li>
            <li> love it and will be ordering more ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the look but</li>
            <li> I love, love,love  </li>
            <li> Really love my stamper thank you...</li>
            <li> I love this stamper, I used to have a konad stamper</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the most stamping experience, I&#x27;ll admit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rare occasion that I pick up a really good image</li>
            <li> Works way better than the kit stamper I was using before.  </li>
            <li> If I buy more (like as gifts, or to have one to leave at my boyfriends house) I will stick with the Claire&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> This stamper works way better than the stamper I received in the kit I ordered before.</li>
            <li> In my personal experience, the bell shaped scraper it the best.</li>
            <li> This stamp is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Works perfectly for full nail designs and small designs!&lt;br /&gt;It makes all the job easier, picks up all the polish for perfect designs, easy to apply to the nail and easy to clean!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s huge and squishy, it picks up images very easily and transfer even better.</li>
            <li> Happy New Year!</li>
            <li> With the flat side it easily picked up the image with a very light touch and stamped perfectly on the nail.</li>
            <li> but my full nail stamps have never turned out this nice.  </li>
            <li> This eliminates that issue, the soft, squishy texture transfers beautifully with no need to roll.</li>
            <li> , it took me awhile to get use to it because of large size, but once I got the grip of it, it is fantastic, works really great, now I can enlarge and shrink the images.  </li>
            <li> But I especially love this stamper because it is larger than any other stamper I have seen, so it accommodates L and XL images perfectly.</li>
            <li> The images are so nice and clean and full coverage for my thumb!</li>
            <li> OMG I love me because its so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The stamping head is very soft and a great size, but it is does not have that marshmallow feel that I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li> all clean!</li>
            <li> The stamp is great and the straight edge is metal do the slates and stamps are clean</li>
            <li> As seen on Youtube I bought a Mr. Clean magic eraser and buffed the top of the spongy thing.  </li>
            <li> So far it is picking up images great.</li>
            <li> (Useful if you smudge a bit of nailpolish on the sides; the holder kind of gets in the way)</li>
            <li> I had heard good things about this stamper and was very eager to try it out.</li>
            <li> Really love it, is easy to use and soft to touch, highly recommended, works for me, the stamper is perfect</li>
            <li> BUT I flipped it to the other side and tried again scraped off perfectly.</li>
            <li> BUT I flipped it to the other side and tried again scraped off perfectly.</li>
            <li> Also using the tape to clean it works so much better than trying to use acetone.</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, its easy to use.</li>
            <li> The stampy ends are designed to come out so that you can clean them more easily.</li>
            <li> but once you know the technique its easy.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly too.  </li>
            <li> That is easy to solve using a bottle lid as a stamper.</li>
            <li> Cleaning it between stamps is so easy:  </li>
            <li> LOVE that you do not use acetone to clean this (do NOT use acetone on this, period).</li>
            <li> That part also comes out easily though; but some krazy glue could fix that.</li>
            <li> do come out easily</li>
            <li> Once you file the top off (literally) and clean it with Acetone to get off the stickiness, the product will work fine.  </li>
            <li> Suddenly, its picking up beautifully every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> yup sure would be cool</li>
            <li> Hands down one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a while!</li>
            <li> Pure MAGIC!</li>
            <li> The scrapers were fine.</li>
            <li> Buff all the shine off with a fine grit buffer evenly.</li>
            <li> plate and stamping polish can be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;Konad plates and polish work fine.</li>
            <li> This would have been fine because my Konad stamp does it sometimes too.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do well with images that contain fine lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, too, because you can get full nail coverage without having to roll the stamper, as this one is soft.  </li>
            <li> shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need konad or a special stamping polish; it works great with many regular brands.</li>
            <li> the little stamp is perfect.  </li>
            <li> As for the stamper itself, it is easy to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t is so comfortable, anyways</li>
            <li> Some people use tape, but I find a lint roller to be very convenient and effective.</li>
            <li> Just lightly buff off all the shine.  </li>
            <li> so I took a medium file and lightly filed it to remove the smooth shiny surface.</li>
            <li> then you know how detailed their plates are.</li>
            <li> so I thought that was thoughtful.</li>
            <li> the most useful was video</li>
            <li> The scrapers are plastic and are easy to clean and don&#x27;t scratch up your plates.</li>
            <li> The red end works really well, and always makes a perfect transfer.</li>
            <li> but once you find the right amount of pressure to use you will love this stamper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve followed all of the instructions, used tape to clean it and NOT acetone, pressed lightly when trying to pick up the image, lightly filed the surface ,</li>
            <li> Even cleaning it off is quick and easy using the scotch tape method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have fun!</li>
            <li> The pueen super squishy works just fine</li>
            <li> It is a great stamper for long fingernails.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with moyou stamping plates and if you&#x27;re familiar with moyou</li>
            <li> I have had nothing but success with this stamper!</li>
            <li> okay at first i</li>
            <li> First, the stamper arrived promptly, ahead of schedule!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading tons of reviews, here and elsewhere, in which the reviewer said that once they&#x27;d figured it out this was their favorite stamper, I was determined to work with it until I made it work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this because I use a lot of full nail designs that don&#x27;t fit my nails</li>
            <li> The stamper needs to be filed very lightly with a file that doesn&#x27;t have large grits.</li>
            <li> Do NOT try to clean your Winstonia stamper with acetone or nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> You can clean it by using the sticky side of a piece of tape</li>
            <li> It feels like those sticky reusable lint rollers that you have to clean with water.</li>
            <li> The easiest way to clean the stamp is just stamp it on the lint roller.</li>
            <li> I also found a tip online about doubling a piece of tape to use to clean it as it&#x27;s used.  </li>
            <li> so I taped it to my scraping palate to clean between each stamp.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t clean with polish remover ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and squishy that I&#x27;ve gotten great transfers just by lining it up and pressing my whole nail into the pad</li>
            <li> I also read how to clean the stopper.</li>
            <li> Use tape to clean it, you&#x27;ll se is easier that way too for the others</li>
            <li> I use the tape to clean it too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the softer texture of the stamping head as far as stamping the nail but had issues with being able to pick up the image.  </li>
            <li> Use a tape roller to clean it.</li>
            <li> i clean the residue on the stamper after stamping off with tape to maintain it sticky and saves you nail polish.</li>
            <li> worked once, I pressed it against tape to clean it, but again, it wouldn&#x27;t pick up any polish.</li>
            <li> I tried to use tape to clean</li>
            <li> it continually pops out of the holder when picking up images or when you clean it on a lint roller.</li>
            <li> I was very exited about this stamper mostly because most of the reviews were good, the package arrived and the note that came with the stamper was all wet, so I don&#x27;t now</li>
            <li> Granted I do not have special polish..</li>
            <li> The stamper gave me nice clean and clear images on my nails.  </li>
            <li> Really nice and large surface for stamping, but I will need to buff this out because It did not pick up the design on the first try, as it is quite shiny.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to roll to stamp on the nail, doesn&#x27;t matter how hard you scrape, it&#x27;ll still pick up the image and stamp it perfectly.</li>
            <li> The stamper is great on the pink side.</li>
            <li> If you want to use full nail images, this is the best.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this and am so much happier with this than my Konrad one...</li>
            <li> Full nail patterns</li>
            <li> Full nail patterns</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t pop out once during the one full mani + 5 practice swatches I did; Not once.</li>
            <li> the big scraper works good sometimes.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t scrape the polish off plate good enough to pick the image off the plate.</li>
            <li> Soft stamper, nice product</li>
            <li> However, I haven&#x27;t had any success in using this for ANY plate using special and (non) special polishes.</li>
            <li> Other than that is is great.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and didn&#x27;t require much priming.</li>
            <li> I like this stamp delivery was quick picks up</li>
            <li> This has quickly become my preferred stamper.</li>
            <li> I did receive it very quickly so that was one positive.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this set to everyone. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much, will order again!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite stamper.</li>
            <li> I totally love and am enjoyin my new stamper</li>
            <li> I love my new stamper.</li>
            <li> Its certainly easy to get used to and makes thing go so much faster.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so easy to straight stamp, which I couldn&#x27;t do with my Konad stampers.</li>
            <li> If you want clean again with dishsoap after each manicure, make sure to air dry since it will pick up lint super easy.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
            <li> Thanks again!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this stamper!!!</li>
            <li> My first package looked like it went through a war!</li>
            <li> This is great for people with highly arched nails as opposed to having a flat nail bed.</li>
            <li> Although I can easily remove it, I don&#x27;t have the same problem many people have of the silicone gel popping</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so quick and easy to just leave a strip of tape near by and clean it off.</li>
            <li> it picks up clean crisp images.  </li>
            <li> No problem with the foam popping out and the plastic little scraper works great; don&#x27;t like to use metal as they scratch my plates.  </li>
            <li> and once I got this one and used it for the first time I could tell immediately I was right!</li>
            <li> The larger scraper works wonderfully and the stamp itself is large enough to pick up images from cheeky jumbo plates.</li>
            <li> the stamper does come out of the holder but that is helpful when you want to stretch your imagine to fit your whole nail otherwise</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Practiced with it just once and felt confident to do a complete stamping mani.</li>
            <li> I also liked the idea of the double ended stamp.</li>
            <li> I think it is well worth buying.</li>
            <li> As an older woman with arthritis I can&#x27;t believe how easy this stamper makes everything.  </li>
            <li> I am so thrilled because I have longer nails and larger design nail plates.</li>
            <li> just make sure its in the holder completely before you start stamping.</li>
            <li> When I transfer it from the stamper directly to my nail, the image is more transparent instead of opaque.</li>
            <li> an old credit card works better.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s soft, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty sticky and I clean it with scotch tape after each stamp which was a good suggestion I read from other reviewers.</li>
            <li> Per other reviews, the pad does indeed pop off, and right away, but a little adhesive will solve that I&#x27;m sure, and this is otherwise great!  </li>
            <li> Item came quickly and is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I have watched many different tutorials on how to prep the stamp, clean the stamp, use the stamp...</li>
            <li> My tips for using it are to first &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; it by gently buffing it with a fine grain buffer.</li>
            <li> but I could not get it to work right.</li>
            <li> Fell apart and way to sticky for my taste as the prints didn&#x27;t come out right....</li>
            <li> scraper: I know, some people don&#x27;t like it, but mine was perfectly level, not rough or uneven, and also did not leave any scratches on my plates (Pueen)</li>
            <li> scraper: I know, some people don&#x27;t like it, but mine was perfectly level, not rough or uneven, and also did not leave any scratches on my plates (Pueen)</li>
            <li> The stamper falls out of the holder from time to time, but that&#x27;s never been more than a slight annoyance for me, and the removable feature is great for people with larger nails who use this stamper to stretch designs.  </li>
            <li> So nice to finally stamp my designs straight, it was driving me nuts!  </li>
            <li> oh also less than a week for shipping great service very please would recommend.</li>
            <li> Does require some prepping before use but other wise completely reliable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great concept, I love how its soft and conforms to your nails rather than being a hard surface and having to roll it like a konad stamper.</li>
            <li> My decision to try this particular stamper was based on the reviews and its unique design.  </li>
            <li> At first I couldn&#x27;t get this stamper to work right.</li>
            <li> picks up imagine easily and complete.</li>
            <li> Yes, the white rubber pops out if you&#x27;d like, makes it easy to clean or replace, but I&#x27;ve never had an issue with it coming out during a manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had success with the bigger scraper as the edge is thicker and it seems that the thinner the edge on the scraper, the better it works.</li>
            <li> this is a great stamper if you are not using white, if your stamping with white you can&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> Once I got in touch with Winstonia, they fixed my problem very quickly and replaced the head of the stamper.</li>
            <li> As the directions state, and as you would with any new stamper, lightly file the surface before the first use and maybe every 10 manicures or so.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s true that the sponge comes out easily, it does conform to the shape of the nail especially if your nails are rounded!  </li>
            <li> Also, very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I found I had to VERY gently pick up the polish.  </li>
            <li> Very fast delivery</li>
            <li> Hands down, this is the single best nail stamper out there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It definitely has to be primed with a nail file (or nail block) first, and make sure to keep tape on you to pick up everything that sticks to it.</li>
            <li> This is my first squishy one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you could suspend the tape between anything open and with a bit of weight (or between two things, I suppose)</li>
            <li> Which the first time I tried to stamp it was so wobbly that it just smeared the design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried if with many different nail polishes.</li>
            <li> I actually find this stamper to be more reliable and</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change with this stamper is to also make available a full size colored stamper to allow seeing the white stamping better for placement.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve heard that if you place a bead or two of hot glue gun glue in the area the pad fits</li>
            <li> make sure you&#x27;re using it properly!</li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> My first attempt, I was nervous because it didn&#x27;t pick up the design</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because the learning curve with this is pretty steep.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newbie at stamp art, and that is most likely why.  </li>
            <li> FIRST you HAVE to buffer the surface.</li>
            <li> Its an OK product, but if I were to go back I would send the extra $$$$ for a better one.</li>
            <li> it came on time and is exactly what is described i have yet to try it</li>
            <li> Apart from falling apart the rubber stamp (white part has holes in as it poured into a mould with air bubbles and the holes remain these are both on the top and the bottom and they look as if with continued use</li>
            <li> You can just press your nail exactly onto the design as you want it.</li>
            <li> I wish somebody would put a dcecent quality xl stamp on amazon.our nail exactly onto the design as you want it.</li>
            <li> but then again it&#x27;s my first time to use the stamping technique.</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Firstly I thought it&#x27;s not working and decided to return it.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> first, I couldn&#x27;t get it to pick up a thing.</li>
            <li> Did need to prime it first in order to get crisper images.</li>
            <li> I first I couldn&#x27;t get it work</li>
            <li> I still was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that it does need to be primed first.</li>
            <li> I did have to lightly file off the shiny film with a (probably) 220 grit nail file; a very soft nail file; it doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li> You can just smoosh it right down over your nail, or smoosh your nail into it, and the pattern goes on nice and clean with none of the distortion that comes from rolling over your nail with the old style stamper.  </li>
            <li> Love the extra large size it picks up everything.</li>
            <li> I though about not giving any stars but decided that since I am able to use the little bell shaped scraper (doesn&#x27;t work fabulous but works) anyway because of that it deserved one star.  </li>
            <li> My wife ordered this product and had some trouble with it at first, however, after contacting the company they were more than wiling to give detailed instruction and suggestions to make it work for her.</li>
            <li> Overall the stamper and the big scraper is good.</li>
            <li> I love this squishy firm stamper so much that I ordered a backup!!!</li>
            <li> though the price was too good to be true considering this is the only seller that offers the xl stamper on amazon and the rest of the stampers are only sold on ebay but come from china and are twice the price...</li>
            <li> When you first get it you need to remove the shiny layer with a dry magic eraser.  </li>
            <li> The positive side is now</li>
            <li> exactly what i was looking for, it came really quickly&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I have better luck when I don&#x27;t leave the stamp on the plate too long.</li>
            <li> I knew what I was buying thanks to the exact details of the product.</li>
            <li> Winstonia&#x27;s customer service is great and will definitely be ordering from them in the near future.</li>
            <li> The small tip works good</li>
            <li> The stamper is more firm than i thought it would be but overall its a nice stamper i almost wish is was squishier but that might be easier to damage.</li>
            <li> I fixed this by super glueing it</li>
            <li> I did have to buff it before using it but instructions on how to do that were easy enough to find online.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a major pain to clean it with tape all the time and it picks up tons of fuzzies and what not</li>
            <li> the large grits would cause some damage to it if you used it.</li>
            <li> I give this stamper a 5 star because of it&#x27;s softness and large size.  </li>
            <li> I love my new stamper and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Okay guys, before I tell you how great the Winstonia stamper is, I first have to say a few things in response to the negative reviews:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I filed both ends with fine and coarse files and started using a lint roller to remove excess polish versus polish remover as some say the remover damages the stamp.</li>
            <li> The large on is very sticky and falls out of the holder all the time.  </li>
            <li> The large stamping end will not stay attached and its REALLY sticky to the touch which makes the smallest piece of lint stick to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large so that you can pick up the whole image even on an xl plate.</li>
            <li> Much easier than using acetone.</li>
            <li> scraper: I didn&#x27;t like it that much</li>
            <li> scraper: I didn&#x27;t like it that much</li>
            <li> then when I went to wipe of the polish (and I wiped it gently)</li>
            <li> so when I received it in mail and took out of package the pad fell out of it and was very sticky, I could not stamp with it</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the neg reviews of this.</li>
            <li> Just one even handed plunge, immediately after scraping the plate works very well.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t take much pressure to pick up the image off the stamping plate.</li>
            <li> You are now ready to go.  </li>
            <li> It picks up the  images real well</li>
            <li> It really took me a while to get the hang of using this stamper.  </li>
            <li> It is very squishy and had a very marshmallow consistency.</li>
            <li> if you try and practice (you don&#x27;t need to much effort)</li>
            <li> Put the polish on the image plate, and roll the stamper gently across the design.</li>
            <li> so the design covers the whole nail.</li>
            <li> Was really concerned because I bought the rock star plate that has the faces, but it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> Press the used stamp over the tape and release and the stamp is ready to use again.  </li>
            <li> I find it so much easier to use the lint roller, or even just stamp the remaining polish on to my nail polish</li>
            <li> Although I used a bit of tape to gently remove remaining bits of nail polish and not acetone (which damages the stamper), the sticky side immediately began to tear and crumble, and some bits of gunk seem to be permanently wedged into the surface of the squishy side.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this stamper.  </li>
            <li> the packaging, straight out of the bag, it fell apart, the rubber /plastic</li>
            <li> It was really strange at first, getting used to the stickiness and the squishy texture, but the first time I tried stamping a full nail pattern with it, I was hooked.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this stamper</li>
            <li> Place it perpendicularly against the plate, straight on, rather than rolling it across the plate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The softness &amp; flexibility makes it easier to wrap around the whole nail.</li>
            <li> fast shipping product as described</li>
            <li> if I could experice that as well I&#x27;m ready to throw the thing out the window and</li>
            <li> Thanks for my products</li>
            <li> This one is made out of a thicker silicone and holds up over time very well.</li>
            <li> But that is a small inconvenience compared to being able to transfer a full nail pattern.</li>
            <li> I find you have a little more working time with this stamper than with the other kind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, its very useful for larger images.</li>
            <li> arrived on time product is as it states like most other reviews the rubber ends</li>
            <li> All the reviews I have read say to NOT use acetone to clean the white end, and to use another sticky surface to &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; off the remaining polish.  </li>
            <li> THIRD don&#x27;t rubber it with polish remover to clean the non used design.</li>
            <li> it tried to use non acetone polish remover to clean it and acetone to clean used several different polishes stamper polish and non stamper polish to still have it not work</li>
            <li> I then resorted to priming several times with various recommendations such as using a fine grit filer, Mr. Clean magic eraser, soap, and using various opaque nail polishes</li>
            <li> I love that its large especially when stamping my big toe and thumbs</li>
            <li> Only thingn that its true its that its a XL but not squishy at all..</li>
            <li> The small red stamper works pretty good...</li>
            <li> i surprised first impression</li>
            <li> OMG what a difference it made it picking up full images whether regular or XL MoYou.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; the soft side by softly filing it a bit prior to use.  </li>
            <li> It picks up and transfers images beautifully, even on difficult to use plates.</li>
            <li> that is a better value (the stampers come in a kit with 3 plates and a mini special polish for $10 even less if you take advantage of there constant cosmetic \\&quot;multiples\\&quot; deals) and there&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t pop out like this one</li>
            <li> The edges get little nicks and tears kind of easily, so it may need to be replaced sometime down the road.  </li>
            <li> but it works way better than any other stamp I&#x27;ve owned!  </li>
            <li> I literally scrape the extra polish off, push the stamper (LIGHTLY) on the plate and pick it right back off.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to pick up the polish (unlike some reviewers, I have had no problems with picking up the polish in a straight up-and-down motion) and also, the softness really helps with laying the polish down too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m frustrated and feel stupid to be having this issue when I read all the great reviews here saying its wonderful and that it&#x27;s pure magic</li>
            <li> Remember, the key to stamping well is to pick up the polish quickly after you scrape, and to do it in one rolling motion.</li>
            <li> Though if your quick stamping on paper after each nail can have the same effect, wont remove lint or hair that way though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was decent</li>
            <li> The small side is a perfect size for small images.</li>
            <li> I was able to use several plates from various manufactures.</li>
            <li> Love having a bigger stamp for the bigger designs.</li>
            <li> I wasted this much money on something I can&#x27;t get to work when I was so excited to have my first real stamper not the salon express one that I have had for years</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that this stamper was going to be The One.</li>
            <li> Love the service too, they sent me a little note thanking me for the purchase and stuff</li>
            <li> Was delivered very quickly and works well as stated in the other reviews.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad but it isn&#x27;t perfect.</li>
            <li> I got it it was in a cheap zip lock plastic bag, no real packaging</li>
            <li> I was exspecting it to be very sticky and marshmallow soft and it was not.</li>
            <li> This is easier than holding the tape in your fingers and possibly smudging your fresh manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good with small images, having troubles with bigger designs.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because I still think it&#x27;s a bit messy. :)</li>
            <li> The end in which you scrape with is uneven and scratches the plate (which defeats the purpose because most people do not want to see scratches on their plates and would stick to the metal scraper).</li>
            <li> So I buffed the shiny top away with a medium nail file, with firm strokes, and then rinsed it</li>
            <li> This is definitely a keeper and well worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I had at the beginning was that the white end was not very secure in the stamper, but if you squeeze and twist it into the hole it stays much more secure.  </li>
            <li> Put it in, then press down on one side and kind of push/roll it further into the holder.</li>
            <li> amazing that i don&#x27;t have to roll the image on my nail just press down on the nail and BOOM!!!</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t stay put that way, it&#x27;ll pop right back out.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m going to buy the big Konad stamper right now, this thing is already in the trash.</li>
            <li> Do not use nail polish remover on it though, just use some double sided tape and dab it on there and the polish comes right off....</li>
            <li> And the pattern goes right up to the cuticle with no extra effort.  </li>
            <li> The white foam came off right away</li>
            <li> the white part remains stuck to the plate, you  try to clean it between uses the top goes flying off, you rest it down and pick it back up</li>
            <li> I love that the white side is big enough to pick up even big full nail art images without the edges of the images being too close to the edge of the stamper.</li>
            <li> The only good side is the red side the white side suck and doesn&#x27;t pick up the nail polish overall</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to stamping, and w/</li>
            <li> If faulty I would like a new one and if the norm, I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> The bottom white part of this stamper is very large but it comes out and it is very soft</li>
            <li> because you can take out the white part (no it will not break trust me) and use it to minimized the image (to make the image smaller) to make it fit on your nail,</li>
            <li> I thought it had filed down the stamper too much, but after doing my first full set of nails with stamping on all of them, I finally got the hang of using this stamper.</li>
            <li> Love the black handle however had to order messy mention stamping head works so much better than the white one that comes with it.</li>
            <li> they had the audacity to send a small note with the item askinh to make sure to give them a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> and this was alot different for me at first.</li>
            <li> so I am limited to that one, but it is kind of small for the large stamps.</li>
            <li> Clean the white pad only by rolling it across some tape.</li>
            <li> As other have said the simplest way to clean</li>
            <li> The stamp keeps falling out of the holder and the stamper doesn&#x27;t do a clean stamp like the other stamper I have.</li>
            <li> Great price, only issue is white piece doesn&#x27;t want to stay in,and trouble with stamping on white side</li>
            <li> WASTE your Money like I did...........for as much as it cost all I got that was useable was the tiny bell scrapper, and honestly, an old credit card works better than it.</li>
            <li> images transferred were nice and clear but the trouble to get them in the first place its not worth it.</li>
            <li> images transferred were nice and clear but the trouble to get them in the first place its not worth it.</li>
            <li> This stamper only seems to pick up images if you only use the special stamping polishes.  </li>
            <li> I personally clean the squishy white stamp part with a piece of clear white tape; no fuss no muss.</li>
            <li> The more I let the stamper sit on the image, the less polish it actually picks</li>
            <li> If you put it in by firmly pressing around the circumference, it stays in fine.</li>
            <li> i had tried the konad (only picks up certain nail polish brands $$$)....</li>
            <li> At first I couldn&#x27;t get the large white side of the stamp to work but after reading some online reviews I saw that trying the to pick up the image you go straight down and then roll to apply.</li>
            <li> etc-- nothing I have done has picked up a consistently clear image.  </li>
            <li> The sticky white end comes out a bit, but that&#x27;s not too much of an issue.</li>
            <li> , as far as it being sent in pieces, that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
            <li> I was using old gift cards and old credit cards to scrape</li>
            <li> However, all I needed to do was gently press the stamp end back in.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;(3) applied nail polish to selected design&lt;br /&gt;(4) scarped polish using old gift card (the scrapers that come with this stamp...</li>
            <li> I was surprised that the stopper was sticky.</li>
            <li> I ordered it because it was larger and could pick up the whole images from the plates.</li>
            <li> Completely plastic and doesn&#x27;t scrape well.</li>
            <li> The white end is really squishy and you don&#x27;t roll the image on just mash.</li>
            <li> The stamper kept falling out of the holder and when trying to pick up an image off a plate the stamp did not look as clear as when I used my old stamper</li>
            <li> It goes over the nail well because it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li> It picked up the design well for me; and goes over my nails well because it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li> It was slightly soft and not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> As for the scrapers I cannot get a grip on them, no problem i&#x27;ll keep using my old credit cards.</li>
            <li> how much I pushed it back in</li>
            <li> If you are wondering if this nail stamp is soft...</li>
            <li> The marshmallow ones can be finicky at times because it is so soft and sticky</li>
            <li> So soft that the central high point on the head would literally push the polish out of the way when trying to gather the image</li>
            <li> First off, the larger white stamp did not transfer ANY nail polish to the nail.</li>
            <li> This will only work with one particular brand of nail polish that i have....</li>
            <li> After a lot of practice, I learned that I must stamp straight down on to the image plate, and pull the stamper right back up.</li>
            <li> I go straight up and down when picking up compact images and roll with longer images although with this size really didn&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> Lightly file down the white silicone stamper until it is not shiny anymore.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with such high hopes.</li>
            <li> it was really sticky and soft a little too much and</li>
            <li> Majorly BUMMED!</li>
            <li> I sure would love that feel like a dumb failure over here</li>
            <li> this feature bothers you, a little super glue would probably keep the end piece in place...</li>
            <li> The squishy white head makes aligning the design so easy since you can simply press down instead of roll.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s to pick up polish better than a regular hard stamper.</li>
            <li> (just stamp down on it, the leftover nail polish comes right off).</li>
            <li> The stamper did pick up some of the designs but after a while it was very apparent that I would have to prep it.</li>
            <li> When this stamper set arrived, the large soft white end was rolling loose in the package</li>
            <li> it just pops right out, leaving a mess of polish EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> I just received mine and the large white end of the stamper is very soft &amp; squishy unlike other stampers I bought.</li>
            <li> When you do it this way, at the same time that you are putting the soft bit in, you are pushing air out.</li>
            <li> All I do is pick up the image, transfer it to my nail, and then stick the white end directly onto the sticky side of the lint roll sheet.  </li>
            <li> but I just went back to using an old plastic gift card.</li>
            <li> barely.</li>
            <li> the only thing it does hold is dust or anything else near by . .  </li>
            <li> times that it did stamp the softness of it made it much easier than stamping with the harder Konad stamp.</li>
            <li> the problem of it detaching i put a coin inside and that not only keeps the soft part of the stamper from going in but because it is sticky it sticks to the coin and does not allow it to fall.</li>
            <li> I have fairly curved nails and my konad stamper just wasn&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> most frustrating thing is that I had to search online to find out how to use it.  </li>
            <li> The only part that made it hard to use  was that i had to press harder onto the nail plate in order to get the image unlike konad stampers so it took a few times to get a hang of, but Other than that the product works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this stamper once, and did have trouble picking up some designs, though, I&#x27;m sure it was due to the nail polish I used.  </li>
            <li> , it was a bit too curved for me to use, at least with the plates I was using (small images), but I&#x27;ll keep it around; maybe it&#x27;ll come in handy for bigger things.problems with picking up the polish in a straight up-and-down motion) and also, the softness really helps with laying the polish down too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I found it only needs a light touch when stamping because my first time I messed one up because I think I pressed too hard and it sort of squiched the design a little.</li>
            <li> And it is impossible to clean even with nail polish remover as the fibers (even lint free) stick.  </li>
            <li> is a lifesaver for stretching those too small plate images to fit long nails or wider thumb</li>
            <li> Even the scrapers are absolute garbage, the bell shaped mini scraper is jagged and uneven, the other does not scrape all of the polish off of the plate and leaves a mess, no matter how many times or different directions you scrape.</li>
            <li> far as the scrapers go I definitely prefer them to the metal varieties, and each one scrapes differently</li>
            <li> I like that it is soft which allows you to stamp your entire nail without the rolling motion which when done with a traditional stamper can be hit or miss when it comes to lining up</li>
            <li> This smaller side worked however the straight edge to clean your slate did not do its job either because it left streaks of nail polish behind.</li>
            <li> but it is also very small and doesn&#x27;t fit over my entire nail.</li>
            <li> I generally grow my nails long and the regular stampers don&#x27;t provide complete coverage.</li>
            <li> this makes the regular Konad stamper that i have too small to stamp any full nail images on my nails without double stamping.</li>
            <li> The Winstonia stamper is different from any other stamper because the large white end is coated in a sticky substance that makes picking up and transferring images a breeze.  </li>
            <li> So I now have a small and a large soft marshmallow stamper.  </li>
            <li> It is also hard to lift complete images consistently.  </li>
            <li> Had a tiny bit of trouble at first</li>
            <li> , it was a bit too curved for me to use, at least with the plates I was using (small images), but I&#x27;ll keep it around; maybe it&#x27;ll come in handy for bigger things.</li>
            <li> I love how it grabs more of the images and doesn&#x27;t mess up the base nail polish.</li>
            <li> And none of those things is enough to take a star away from how this little stamper lets me have straight stripes and geometric patterns with ease.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty annoyed I wasted money on this AND a nice new XL stamping plate, since the stamper will be useless trying to pick up my new images.</li>
            <li> Its even possible to press your nail directly into the stamper rather than the other way around, making it easier to line up</li>
            <li> It makes placing the design easier too if you&#x27;re new to stamping, because you can line up your nail to the stamp and press down.</li>
            <li> Since my main purpose was the little stamp - it works for me.</li>
            <li> I prefer the large scraper over the small one because it has that extra lip.</li>
            <li> and I really like the small stamp end for smaller images.</li>
            <li> The small plastic stamper and scraper don&#x27;t work well, but the large squishy stamper and scraper work like a champ.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time at first</li>
            <li> I disagree with the previous review; I think this stamper works very well although it took 2 or 3 tries to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I put a long strip of packing tape on my work surface, and remove leftover polish, lint, and the occasional cat hair by rolling the pad over the tape.</li>
            <li> and I noticed the flat side.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Only draw backs to me is that neither of the scrapers work as well as an old gift card and the smaller head is your standard slightly stiff stamper.</li>
            <li> Dry it thoroughly and put it back in the holder.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> (1)placed double sided tape on my station&lt;br /&gt;(2) cleaned my plate with acetone and allowed it to dry</li>
            <li> Nothing whatsoever, the texture of the white stamp was too slippery as oppose to the smaller pink side.</li>
            <li> When I complained about the product via Amazon, I received an email from the company telling me their customers are super glueing the white tip to the black piece.  </li>
            <li> The white side is CONSTANTLY coming out of the handle which is a drag.</li>
            <li> To do so, DO NOT push the larger (soft, white) end in its center to try to get it in there tightly.</li>
            <li> No matter how deep you cram the white sticky head into the black handle the second that you stamp something</li>
            <li> When I first used the large scraper it didn&#x27;t work which I was afraid of because of another review</li>
            <li> When I first used the large scraper it didn&#x27;t work which I was afraid of it.</li>
            <li> The only reason I took one star off of this is because it came with absolutely no instructions.  </li>
            <li> the red side picks up pieces of it but not nearly as much as it should.</li>
            <li> The size is also big enough for my nails about the size of the Kona stamp plus half .The</li>
            <li> The size is also big enough for my nails about the size of the Kona stamp plus half .The</li>
            <li> My other stamper didn&#x27;t pick up the entire design</li>
            <li> Every other nail polish will not be picked up by the white part of the stamper.</li>
            <li> I have other ones but this one was different.</li>
            <li> I have seen other reviews similar to mine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using a damp cloth to wipe the plate after I&#x27;ve cleaned it with remover, and then drying it with a dry cloth.</li>
            <li> it comes to stamp it just falls apart the white part that stamps falls off so it ruins  my stamps.</li>
            <li> so full nail designs would fail me often.</li>
            <li> I have wide nail beds and long nails</li>
            <li> The white stamper falls out and when pressing down to pick up the image, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t pick up at all.  </li>
            <li> I was totally let down,</li>
            <li> The white stamper fits too loose on the black plastic holder and it keeps falling off all the time.</li>
            <li> I found it a bit of a trial to hold a piece of tape with slightly wet nails, so I put two strips of tape across a roll of masking tape, then put the roll down so that the weight of it was holding the tape stretched flat, sticky side up.</li>
            <li> I see from other reviews that other&#x27;s had the same problem.  </li>
            <li> AND THOSE WHO HAVE HAND ISSUES WHEN THEY ARE SHAKY AND LESS LIKELY TO BE STEADY ON DESIGNS</li>
            <li> it kept popping out when I tried to do my nails, I ended up taking it out and trying to use just the rubber without the holder which was too difficult, and I EVEN TRIED SUPER GLUING IT</li>
            <li> The hardest thing for me to get used to was that the harder you press, the less likely the polish will transfer to the pad.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s got both a small and large end, and that one is firm and the other is squishy.</li>
            <li> This is very very similar to the pueen little pink stamper.  </li>
            <li> and the larger scraper is so uneven that there is no way you can scrape with</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t pick up the image for me like I expected, just not my preference.</li>
            <li> I preped it by filing and washing the white side a few times.</li>
            <li> and I kept ending up with empty images.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking everywhere to find an xl stamper (you can find them on ebay but not really anywhere else).</li>
            <li> Money spent with absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other downside is that white polish on the white pad is a little hard to see.</li>
            <li> But third times a charm, I primed it with a finer file and a little dab of acetone and voila!</li>
            <li> This stamper took a little long to get use to.</li>
            <li> what so ever even trying other user tips it still did not work</li>
            <li> I only tried the small scraper it came with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen reviews stating that some people get a defective stamper, and I&#x27;m not sure if that was the case here, but I decided to go order a different stamper instead.</li>
            <li> I went to see what other people that ordered it had to say.</li>
            <li> stampers, but this one just wasn&#x27;t made extremely well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;A couple of other tips, as other&#x27;s have said.</li>
            <li> But I have done my due diligence when it comes to researching nail polishes, stamping plates, prepping/priming a stamper, etc.</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;4) I found that letting the polish dry a little on the stamper before applying it to my nail helps with having a darker image that transfers.</li>
            <li> I also have the Konad double ended one which is very firm.  </li>
            <li> I am finding that the silicone stamper pad is a little harder than the Pueen, and although I can get an image, I do have to try a couple of times.  </li>
            <li> I do find it annoying that the white stamp head pops out once in awhile as I clean it between stamps.</li>
            <li> I wish Wistonia sold the bell shape scraper separately and with several in a pack to stock up as the edges dull over time &amp; use.</li>
            <li> it is not worth your time or money</li>
            <li> it is not worth it</li>
            <li> I only gave it one star because amazon does not allow negative starring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Average shipping time.  </li>
            <li> I Tried the suggestions below with no success.  </li>
            <li> I gave up after few tries.</li>
            <li> (if you can call it that) at the top separated from the base.</li>
            <li> Just play with it a bit till you get your technique down</li>
            <li> it all comes down to preference.</li>
            <li> You can just squish it down.</li>
            <li> but I always had trouble due to my curvy nails.</li>
            <li> That certainly is not a major complaint though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> stamper falls out of black thingy mabob.</li>
            <li> The tackiness of this stamper means you need less pressure, which means there&#x27;s less chance of your design smearing.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my experience, based partially on previous reviews here and lots of trial and error:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> read on a nail blog that the squishy end piece is designed to be removable so that you can bend it to slightly enlarge designs before stamping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i would of bought two if the shipping was less than that.</li>
            <li> It was less squishy and sticky than the one I previously bought.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s one thing less</li>
            <li> salon express (sucks not soft and flexible</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any issues with the stamper falling out if I press it down firmly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not necessary to push down very hard when picking up the pattern.</li>
            <li> the Konad rubber stamp I&#x27;d often have trouble picking up the design if I scraped too hard, trouble transferring the design onto my nail if I took too long.</li>
            <li> This does have a little bit of a learning curve.</li>
            <li> Then I found this little miracle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever have issues with my Konad stamper, other than it being a little small for my nails sometimes.</li>
            <li> but it might take just a little getting used to or trial and error.</li>
            <li> and the tape pulled it back out all the time, and its really hard to use the images are hard to stamp.</li>
            <li> The smaller bell shaped scraper sucks, or at least the one I received</li>
            <li> Then your stampy bit should stay in firmly.</li>
            <li> I suppose if you&#x27;re having a lot of trouble though, a bit of superglue could help you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money here.</li>
            <li> the rolling motion needed with those if your finger isn&#x27;t on a firm surface.</li>
            <li> Then use a piece of tape or a lint roller on it it a few times.  </li>
            <li> I had so much trouble figuring out how this works.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the head falling out</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopefully I can find reliable instructions or help before I admit to myself that I wasted nine dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have a few choice words with stamper&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few tips for the beginners:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky and it&#x27;s squishy firm.</li>
            <li> enough)...non brands (waste of money)...</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few downsides: the scrapers didn&#x27;t work at all for me, I just tossed them.  </li>
            <li> But, having trouble with the scrapers?</li>
            <li> I had an issue with the stamp head being too firm.</li>
            <li> like I considered throwing it in the garbage after I tried to use it a few times.</li>
            <li> I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan anymore...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using, but it seems to leave a bit of a film behind, even after I&#x27;ve cleaned it w/ the remover &amp; dried it, that I can only assume is interfering with the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that this stamper is bad but am trying to figure out why it doesn&#x27;t stamp right, don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the nail polish or</li>
            <li> A lot of the negative reviews I have read seem to be due to user error not product defect.</li>
            <li> not easy to work with at all.  </li>
            <li> you have had trouble with stamping in the past</li>
            <li> Now the previous reviewer said that it came apart, I took this to mean that after a couple of stamps and repeated use it would fall out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to get my money back through Amazon, but because it was past the 30 days, I got screwed!!!  </li>
            <li> It is a teeny bit small, but whatever.</li>
            <li> It is a teeny bit small, but whatever.</li>
            <li> plus I could not get past the stickiness.</li>
            <li> , im not to crazy for the scrapers i used an old gift card.</li>
            <li> Not sure it needed it though.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I received a faulty one or if this is just how they are.</li>
            <li> The smaller scrapper I got had a slightly flawed edge, but I wasn&#x27;t planning on using the scrappers at all, so having one work</li>
            <li> For it to stamp you have to roll the stamp across the image, dont press and lift because as I said some times the stamp stays behind other times</li>
            <li> For it to stamp you have to roll the stamp across the image, dont press and lift because as I said some times the stamp stays behind other times</li>
            <li> The scrapers are not very good.</li>
            <li> lone disappointment with the stamper is that it&#x27;s white, just because it can be difficult to see how well your image picked up when using white polish.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, it isn&#x27;t that hard to get them to stay in.</li>
            <li> If I pressed too hard there was no transfer..  </li>
            <li> too hard to get even pressure as i rolled it on my nails</li>
            <li> so it is hard for the design to set it is an alright stamper</li>
            <li> hard ones-</li>
            <li> I think that may be what I prefer; stampers are usually hard and feel like you press too  hard on your nails.</li>
            <li> As for myself my nails are arched so i can just push the stamp onto my nails and it will mold whereas the hard rubber stamps would require a rolling motion</li>
            <li> I used to have to try really hard to not get gaps with my Konad</li>
            <li> Cannot make these work, no matter how hard I try.</li>
            <li> The smaller scraper is a bit awkward to use, however.</li>
            <li> i would not recommend this product to anybody if i could give this item negative stars</li>
            <li> Sucks to have bought this and not know how to use them</li>
            <li> Remove the pad and wash off the oily coating with some delicate soap.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write customer reviews, but I was really disappointed in this stamper.</li>
            <li> but the stamper sucks</li>
            <li> but the ones I have tried to use are thick, holo, or chrome.</li>
            <li> I was not able to use this product once!  </li>
            <li> and I mean DON&#x27;T roll it over the plate.</li>
            <li> Also, it picks up lint like mad, but I&#x27;ve never had it drop any lint back on my nails, so that&#x27;s not an issue for me.  </li>
            <li> Both stamps loose either end, and what&#x27;s worse is the horrible sticky material the large end has.</li>
            <li> Was not happy with delivery time and not sure why it didn&#x27;t get ship until almost a week after I ordered it????  </li>
            <li> and they are very stiff!</li>
            <li> Scrapers not good</li>
            <li> the stamper was not good.</li>
            <li> It is frustrating.  </li>
            <li> The stamper also was of poor quality.</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;re picking up base only the head remains on the table.</li>
            <li> How anybody could have their name associated with a product this poor is beyond me.</li>
            <li> How anybody could have their name associated with a product this poor is beyond me.</li>
            <li> But the product itself has a poorly executed design.</li>
            <li> 1) Glue that sucker in and 2)Stack a few coins in the base under the head.</li>
            <li> My stamper had dents in it, which made me a little disappointed since I&#x27;ve read tons of reviews raving about this product.</li>
            <li> Not really sure, I might have got a bad one, but mine doesn&#x27;t pick up the stamp, even after buffing it out and washing it.</li>
            <li> I have tried gluing it but that is useless.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately both sides of the stamper just pop out.</li>
            <li> second issue is the absolutely horrible quality.</li>
            <li> So sad</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I cannot get the stamper to pick up the image.  </li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> mad</li>
            <li> The stamper is very flawed.</li>
            <li> I have returned this product and they refuse to return my money after contacting them 3 times :(  </li>
            <li> it doesnt want to pick up my nail polishes for some reason :(</li>

            <li> Nothing worked. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in the Winstonia Nail Art Stamper.</li>
            <li> The silicone head falls out all and is annoying.</li>
            <li> Hate this product.</li>
            <li> and  I will be replacing the metal one with this plastic one because I hate it when the plates are scratched.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s sticky and disgusting.</li>
            <li> Awful, will not pick up the design at all.</li>
            <li> But the bell scraper is JUST HORRIBLE.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you want to use full nail images, this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely has to be primed with a nail file (or nail block) first, and make sure to keep tape on you to pick up everything that sticks to it.</li>
            <li> Was delivered very quickly and works well as stated in the other reviews. I love it!</li>
            <li> Yes i had to prime it as others spoke about.  This is my first squishy one.  I also have the Konad double ended one which is very firm.  Not a huge fan anymore...but it helps with white stamping because of the color.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite stamper. It&#x27;s huge and squishy, it picks up images very easily and transfer even better. Easy to clean and didn&#x27;t require much priming.</li>
            <li> This does have a little bit of a learning curve. It IS sticky by design which is great for getting all of the polish off the plates. The sticky white end comes out a bit, but that&#x27;s not too much of an issue. Also using the tape to clean it works so much better than trying to use acetone. I love this and am so much happier with this than my Konrad one... Just play with it a bit till you get your technique down</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, its easy to use. I thought I would not have to do a rolling motion with this stamper but you still do. stamper falls out of black thingy mabob.</li>
            <li> I totally love and am enjoyin my new stamper</li>
            <li> Okay guys, before I tell you how great the Winstonia stamper is, I first have to say a few things in response to the negative reviews:&lt;br /&gt;1. Do NOT try to clean your Winstonia stamper with acetone or nail polish remover. It is *supposed* to be sticky! You can clean it by using the sticky side of a piece of tape (just stamp down on it, the leftover nail polish comes right off). I found it a bit of a trial to hold a piece of tape with slightly wet nails, so I put two strips of tape across a roll of masking tape, then put the roll down so that the weight of it was holding the tape stretched flat, sticky side up. Then, between stamps, I would just stamp inside the masking tape roll... all clean! Much easier than using acetone. I&#x27;m sure you could suspend the tape between anything open and with a bit of weight (or between two things, I suppose) This is easier than holding the tape in your fingers and possibly smudging your fresh manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The stampy ends are designed to come out so that you can clean them more easily. (Useful if you smudge a bit of nailpolish on the sides; the holder kind of gets in the way) HOWEVER, it isn&#x27;t that hard to get them to stay in. To do so, DO NOT push the larger (soft, white) end in its center to try to get it in there tightly. It won&#x27;t stay put that way, it&#x27;ll pop right back out. Put it in, then press down on one side and kind of push/roll it further into the holder. When you do it this way, at the same time that you are putting the soft bit in, you are pushing air out. There might be a bit of a sucking sound as it shifts into place; that&#x27;s good. Then your stampy bit should stay in firmly. I don&#x27;t have any problem with mine; it&#x27;s never popped out on me. I suppose if you&#x27;re having a lot of trouble though, a bit of superglue could help you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, now, onto my review about this stamper:&lt;br /&gt;-First of all, it is SO SOFT and that&#x27;s wonderful. It is so easy to pick up the polish (unlike some reviewers, I have had no problems with picking up the polish in a straight up-and-down motion) and also, the softness really helps with laying the polish down too.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s big. Full nail patterns ahoy!&lt;br /&gt;-Bell scraper: I know, some people don&#x27;t like it, but mine was perfectly level, not rough or uneven, and also did not leave any scratches on my plates (Pueen) so I&#x27;m happy with it. It is a teeny bit small, but whatever. Good enough.&lt;br /&gt;-Clam scraper: I didn&#x27;t like it that much, it was a bit too curved for me to use, at least with the plates I was using (small images), but I&#x27;ll keep it around; maybe it&#x27;ll come in handy for bigger things.problems with picking up the polish in a straight up-and-down motion) and also, the softness really helps with laying the polish down too.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s big.

            <li> Love the black handle however had to order messy mention stamping head works so much better than the white one that comes with it.</li>
            <li> exactly what i was looking for, it came really quickly&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> My stamper had dents in it, which made me a little disappointed since I&#x27;ve read tons of reviews raving about this product. The scrapers were fine.</li>
            <li> I though about not giving any stars but decided that since I am able to use the little bell shaped scraper (doesn&#x27;t work fabulous but works) anyway because of that it deserved one star.  I purchased this for the white stamping end.  Which the first time I tried to stamp it was so wobbly that it just smeared the design. then when I went to wipe of the polish (and I wiped it gently) the white end fell out.  I have tried gluing it but that is useless.  and the larger scraper is so uneven that there is no way you can scrape with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t WASTE your Money like I did...........for as much as it cost all I got that was useable was the tiny bell scrapper, and honestly, an old credit card works better than it.</li>
            <li> No, no, no! Please don&#x27;t waste your money here. First off, the larger white stamp did not transfer ANY nail polish to the nail. Nothing whatsoever, the texture of the white stamp was too slippery as oppose to the smaller pink side. This smaller side worked however the straight edge to clean your slate did not do its job either because it left streaks of nail polish behind. When you went ahead and used the smaller Stamp, the streaks and stamp design would transfer to nail. I used the suggested nail polish amongst the once I have at home and nothing worked. I decided to put the Konad stamp which was $16 but it&#x27;s well worth it. The stamp is great and the straight edge is metal do the slates and stamps are clean</li>
            <li> I bought this cause it was larger than the stamper I have so when I received it in mail and took out of package the pad fell out of it and was very sticky, I could not stamp with it cause pad kept falling out plus I could not get past the stickiness. So maybe just me but I could not get it to work right.</li>
            <li> EASY ON AND OFF GOOD FOR BEGINNERS AND THOSE WHO HAVE HAND ISSUES WHEN THEY ARE SHAKY AND LESS LIKELY TO BE STEADY ON DESIGNS</li>
            <li> not squishy at all!! Only thingn that its true its that its a XL but not squishy at all.. &amp;&amp; when you contact the seller about it all they want you to do is return it...</li>
            <li> Nothing is usable. Will not pick up nail paint. And the plastics are not have an even edge. Would not recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> At first I couldn&#x27;t get this stamper to work right. I primed it not once but two times and still wouldn&#x27;t work properly. But third times a charm, I primed it with a finer file and a little dab of acetone and voila! I love this stamper. It is now my go to stamper and you don&#x27;t need konad or a special stamping polish; it works great with many regular brands. You just need to practice. It&#x27;ll work out. Hope this info helps. Happy Stamping!! 💅</li>
            <li> Best stamper set I&#x27;ve tried. The small plastic stamper and scraper don&#x27;t work well, but the large squishy stamper and scraper work like a champ. I run a nail art club, so I bought a second set for my kids to use. Remember, the key to stamping well is to pick up the polish quickly after you scrape, and to do it in one rolling motion. Have fun!</li>
            <li> The stamper didn&#x27;t work at all. I&#x27;ve tried if with many different nail polishes. Definitely don&#x27;t recommend buying this product</li>
            <li> I like this stamp delivery was quick picks up image beautifully do recommend</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS HORRIBLE!  The white stamper falls out and when pressing down to pick up the image, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t pick up at all.  I use my older konad and works great!  Was hoping this would do even better.  Very disappointed.  I see from other reviews that other&#x27;s had the same problem.  Shame on me for not looking at this before.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the neg reviews of this. This stamp is like magic! I&#x27;m fairly new to stamping, and w/ the Konad rubber stamp I&#x27;d often have trouble picking up the design if I scraped too hard, trouble transferring the design onto my nail if I took too long. Until now, I&#x27;d only stamped an accent nail or two. Then I found this little miracle. Practiced with it just once and felt confident to do a complete stamping mani. All 10 fingers. It was effortless. Don&#x27;t need to roll to stamp on the nail, doesn&#x27;t matter how hard you scrape, it&#x27;ll still pick up the image and stamp it perfectly. It makes placing the design easier too if you&#x27;re new to stamping, because you can line up your nail to the stamp and press down. You can&#x27;t do that with the Konad type stampers, because you don&#x27;t get enough pressure w/ the rolling motion needed with those if your finger isn&#x27;t on a firm surface. The tackiness of this stamper means you need less pressure, which means there&#x27;s less chance of your design smearing. Even cleaning it off is quick and easy using the scotch tape method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as far as it being sent in pieces, that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s supposed to be. The white part is supposed to detach to make cleaning easier. If you put it in by firmly pressing around the circumference, it stays in fine. It didn&#x27;t pop out once during the one full mani + 5 practice swatches I did; Not once.</li>
            <li> This is better than the stamper I got with the Salon Express kit. The scrapers are plastic so they don&#x27;t scratch my plates. The smaller scraper is a bit awkward to use, however. As for the stamper itself, it is easy to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it.  Didn&#x27;t pick up the image for me like I expected, just not my preference.</li>
            <li> gift she uses it all the time loves it</li>
            <li> the scrapers are great.  the little stamp is perfect.  The large on is very sticky and falls out of the holder all the time.  Since my main purpose was the little stamp - it works for me.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this item, I do not recommend it. The white squishy part falls out and I can not get an image to transfer onto my nail. I am an experienced nail stamper and this did not work at all.  It was a BIG DISSAPOINTMENT!</li>
            <li> I love it !!!!!! It came fast 3 days !!!!!!! awesome</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it had plastic scrapers instead of metal. My Konad seems to leave scratch marks on my plates BUT this product is terrible! The large stamping end will not stay attached and its REALLY sticky to the touch which makes the smallest piece of lint stick to it. The scrapers are un-level so it&#x27;s a joke to scrape all excess polish off the plate.</li>
            <li> This stamper will not pick up images. I don&#x27;t feel like I should have to file a stamper or go through a lot of changes for it to work. The pueen super squishy works just fine so I use that one instead.</li>
            <li> Great price, only issue is white piece doesn&#x27;t want to stay in,and trouble with stamping on white side</li>
            <li> I was very exited about this stamper mostly because most of the reviews were good, the package arrived and the note that came with the stamper was all wet, so I don&#x27;t now if I got my stamper with any alteration because of the water.&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to stamp it just falls apart the white part that stamps falls off so it ruins  my stamps. I solved this issue using a bottle cap but it isn&#x27;t is so comfortable, anyways it&#x27;s good with small images, having troubles with bigger designs. DO NOT USE ACETONE WITH IT</li>
            <li> Great for picking up the whole picture/pattern. Works differently than the konad stamper, so I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using it like it. I actually find this stamper to be more reliable and often times will work with polish that the konad stamper won&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips when using this stamper:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Although I can easily remove it, I don&#x27;t have the same problem many people have of the silicone gel popping out.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s not necessary to push down very hard when picking up the pattern. Just one even handed plunge, immediately after scraping the plate works very well.&lt;br /&gt;- Do not use acetone to clean the gel !!  Some people use tape, but I find a lint roller to be very convenient and effective.</li>
            <li> Absolutly best stamper</li>
            <li> Nice product just need practice</li>
            <li> Took awhile for the design to stick on but once i got the hang of it, it was great!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the ergonomically shaped handle. I also liked the idea of the double ended stamp. Unfortunately both sides of the stamper just pop out. Ironically I accidently put two in my shopping cart. The positive side is now I see that I did not just receive a faulty product, I received two. Both stamps loose either end, and what&#x27;s worse is the horrible sticky material the large end has. Once again...both products not just a faulty one. So now I have two double ended stamps that don&#x27;t even have a suggestion of a retaining material (glue/silicone) for the stamping ends. Do yourself a favor and get another brand! Now I get to do the same...</li>
            <li> Please do not buy this item it is not worth your time or money it was the worst stamper i have ever used it does not pick up the image what so ever even trying other user tips it still did not work i would not recommend this product to anybody if i could give this item negative stars i would</li>
            <li> In my opinion It works great. It shipped well and works well. I think it is well worth buying. It does take a while to learn how to use but once you know the technique its easy.</li>
            <li> The Winstonia stamper is different from any other stamper because the large white end is coated in a sticky substance that makes picking up and transferring images a breeze.  All the reviews I have read say to NOT use acetone to clean the white end, and to use another sticky surface to &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; off the remaining polish.  I have been using a sheet from a lint roller and it works perfectly.  All I do is pick up the image, transfer it to my nail, and then stick the white end directly onto the sticky side of the lint roll sheet.  The sheet will pick up any remaining polish or fuzz that sticks to the stamper.  The only problem I had at the beginning was that the white end was not very secure in the stamper, but if you squeeze and twist it into the hole it stays much more secure.  But I especially love this stamper because it is larger than any other stamper I have seen, so it accommodates L and XL images perfectly.</li>
            <li> It came in pieces! Yes, the white part WILL NOT stay in the stamper. It is terrible, I&#x27;ve tried everything and it just won&#x27;t stay! It&#x27;s sticky and disgusting. It feels like those sticky reusable lint rollers that you have to clean with water. I tried &#x27;de-stickefying&#x27; it with acetone, nada, it stays sticky no matter what you do. No matter how deep you cram the white sticky head into the black handle the second that you stamp something it just pops right out, leaving a mess of polish EVERYWHERE. I don&#x27;t know about you but I&#x27;m going to buy the big Konad stamper right now, this thing is already in the trash. Even the scrapers are absolute garbage, the bell shaped mini scraper is jagged and uneven, the other does not scrape all of the polish off of the plate and leaves a mess, no matter how many times or different directions you scrape. Yes, the steel ones scratch the plates but this one did NOTHING.(BTW, This came in a snack sized baggie, no retail packaging.) Never. Again.</li>
            <li> It took several times to get this stamper primed. Once the priming worked it picks up the image off a stamping plate. Also, it doesn&#x27;t take much pressure to pick up the image off the stamping plate. It is a great stamper for long fingernails.</li>
            <li> Not really sure, I might have got a bad one, but mine doesn&#x27;t pick up the stamp, even after buffing it out and washing it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product thinking it was going to be what is advertised.  However, after I received it, I used it and found the white tip, is in no way attached.  Also, it is too sticky, like gum.  The nail polish does not stick.  And it is impossible to clean even with nail polish remover as the fibers (even lint free) stick.  I was not able to use this product once!  When I complained about the product via Amazon, I received an email from the company telling me their customers are super glueing the white tip to the black piece.  I was upset because not only did the product not work, they knew they were selling a faulty product and wanted me, the consumer, to fix their problem.  I&#x27;ve tried to get my money back through Amazon, but because it was past the 30 days, I got screwed!!!  What&#x27;s up with that AMAZON???!!!!!</li>
            <li> Do not work ! I have returned this product and they refuse to return my money after contacting them 3 times :(  konad is the way to go!</li>
            <li> Scrapers not good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White side of stamper falls out</li>
            <li> Awful, will not pick up the design at all. And to thjnk they had the audacity to send a small note with the item askinh to make sure to give them a 5 star rating. Hah I dont think so.</li>
            <li> i love this stamper and Winstonia delivered on time</li>
            <li> Takes some practice to get used to using it but once you get the hang of it, it works really good.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stamper. As an older woman with arthritis I can&#x27;t believe how easy this stamper makes everything.  I still have a learning curve with getting the stamper to stay in the handle but my full nail stamps have never turned out this nice.  The only thing I would change with this stamper is to also make available a full size colored stamper to allow seeing the white stamping better for placement. I would recommend this stamper to everyone.</li>
            <li> Love this stamper.  When you first get it you need to remove the shiny layer with a dry magic eraser.  Just lightly buff off all the shine.  Then use a piece of tape or a lint roller on it it a few times.  You are now ready to go.  This is very very similar to the pueen little pink stamper.  So I now have a small and a large soft marshmallow stamper.  They are wonderful.  The easiest way to clean the stamp is just stamp it on the lint roller.</li>
            <li> The stamper is great on the pink side. but the white side comes out a lot. It picks up the  images real well but it tends to fall out a lot. I fixed this by super glueing it and now when i stamp it doest fall out. the big scraper works good sometimes. i think you have to apply pressure to it when you scrape.But the bell scraper is JUST HORRIBLE. I DID NOT LIKE IT AT ALL. When i scrape it it just takes all the polish off. Overall the stamper and the big scraper is good.</li>
            <li> Awesome stamper!! I&#x27;m very satisfied. Also, very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get my stamps to work. I purchased this with such high hopes. It didn&#x27;t come with any instructions. I have watched many different tutorials on how to prep the stamp, clean the stamp, use the stamp... nothing works. I can&#x27;t get the polish to adhere to the stamp from the plates. Majorly BUMMED!</li>
            <li> I had so much trouble figuring out how this works. But I did! And I&#x27;m happy my nails are awsome. I gave up after few tries. But I tried again today and it worked!  I give it 4 stars because I still think it&#x27;s a bit messy. :)</li>
            <li> It really took me a while to get the hang of using this stamper.  I found I had to VERY gently pick up the polish.  If I pressed too hard there was no transfer..  I also found a tip online about doubling a piece of tape to use to clean it as it&#x27;s used.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Just started playing with this 2 days ago when I received it and its already made an amazing difference in the quality of my designs! Its certainly easy to get used to and makes thing go so much faster. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the head falling out but if it bothers you there are two things I&#x27;ve seen done. 1) Glue that sucker in and 2)Stack a few coins in the base under the head. The squishy white head makes aligning the design so easy since you can simply press down instead of roll. As other have said the simplest way to clean it is with a piece of tape. I had some double stick on hand so I taped it to my scraping palate to clean between each stamp. Though if your quick stamping on paper after each nail can have the same effect, wont remove lint or hair that way though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only draw backs to me is that neither of the scrapers work as well as an old gift card and the smaller head is your standard slightly stiff stamper. I wish both ends were sticky as the texture picks up and transfers details so well.</li>
            <li> The stamper did pick up some of the designs but after a while it was very apparent that I would have to prep it. I preped it by filing and washing the white side a few times. It is very squishy and had a very marshmallow consistency. The white side is CONSTANTLY coming out of the handle which is a drag. It seems like the red side picks up designs easier but it is also very small and doesn&#x27;t fit over my entire nail.</li>
            <li> i love it.. if you try and practice (you don&#x27;t need to much effort) you can do amazing designs!</li>
            <li> Per other reviews, the pad does indeed pop off, and right away, but a little adhesive will solve that I&#x27;m sure, and this is otherwise great!  Arrived very quickly too.  Thx!</li>
            <li> I love the size of this and the squishiness-- I had high hopes for this. I&#x27;ve followed all of the instructions, used tape to clean it and NOT acetone, pressed lightly when trying to pick up the image, lightly filed the surface , etc-- nothing I have done has picked up a consistently clear image.  I don&#x27;t ever have issues with my Konad stamper, other than it being a little small for my nails sometimes. I&#x27;m pretty annoyed I wasted money on this AND a nice new XL stamping plate, since the stamper will be useless trying to pick up my new images. I&#x27;ve run out of tricks to try to get this to work.</li>
            <li> Really love it, is easy to use and soft to touch, highly recommended, works for me, the stamper is perfect</li>
            <li> Great nail art stamping kit.</li>
            <li> I have fairly curved nails and my konad stamper just wasn&#x27;t cutting it. too hard to get even pressure as i rolled it on my nails so full nail designs would fail me often. This stamper is great!!! I wish the head was not white because using white polish just would get lost on the pad (haven&#x27;t used white polish to even try it though).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my pad fall out but I&#x27;ve heard that if you place a bead or two of hot glue gun glue in the area the pad fits it&#x27;ll make it a bit more snug. You don&#x27;t want to glue the pad in though for replacement and cleaning purposes. I&#x27;ve also heard of washing the pad with dishsoap to &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; it to pick up polish if you are having issues. This pad is SUPPOSED TO BE STICKY it&#x27;s to pick up polish better than a regular hard stamper. Stamp remaining polish on tape after each nail and do not use nail polish remover since that will ruin the pad. If you want clean again with dishsoap after each manicure, make sure to air dry since it will pick up lint super easy.</li>
            <li> If you have ordered stamping plates that comes with the stamper,mi suggest you toss the stamper and buy this one... It&#x27;s amazing!!! Do not use nail polish remover on it though, just use some double sided tape and dab it on there and the polish comes right off.... Plus I ordered on a Sunday night and it came in on Wednesday morning...</li>
            <li> I ordered product on Sept 3rd...was suppose to ship by Sept 16th, but at that time no word on being shipped. I sent the seller an email &amp; on Sept 17th I received an email saying the &amp;#34;product was on pre-order&amp;#34;...a.k.a out-of-stock &amp; that they would ship it out on the 17th. (Good thing I contacted them). So by the 19th I tracked package and was informed that it had left the carrier facility with a delivery date of Sept 23. Lo &amp; Behold...on the 24th the seller sent me a PR email which translated to &amp;#34;Hey Smuck! The Carrier Lost Your Package! I cant rate the product as I have not received it as of yet, but I will definitely do 2 things...1) Never-Ever-Never deal with this seller again! 2) I Do Plan On Returning It! Promptly and get it there Expeditiously to show them how it is done.</li>
            <li> No DIRECTIONS on how to USE RHIS OR STENCIL!! Sucks to have bought this and not know how to use them</li>
            <li> This stamp is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Works perfectly for full nail designs and small designs!&lt;br /&gt;It makes all the job easier, picks up all the polish for perfect designs, easy to apply to the nail and easy to clean!&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you&#x27;re using it properly!</li>
            <li> I switched from a generic type stamper to this one and I really like it! I&#x27;ve had no problem with the end falling out, although I&#x27;m sure it can just he glued in if necessary. It&#x27;s pretty sticky and I clean it with scotch tape after each stamp which was a good suggestion I read from other reviewers. I find you have a little more working time with this stamper than with the other kind. Also, I found it only needs a light touch when stamping because my first time I messed one up because I think I pressed too hard and it sort of squiched the design a little. I do like how it seems to conform to your finger so there&#x27;s no gap at the corners or anything like that. I only tried the small scraper it came with and it was decent but I just went back to using an old plastic gift card. I think the larger size of this stamper head helps align the stamp well too. I do recommend this but it might take just a little getting used to or trial and error.</li>
            <li> The white silicone end pops out constantly and the priming of it can be a bit tricky.  Once you file the top off (literally) and clean it with Acetone to get off the stickiness, the product will work fine.  However the rubber end is amazing.  Picks up the image immediately (no priming needed).</li>
            <li> the stamper was not good. Fell apart and way to sticky for my taste as the prints didn&#x27;t come out right....</li>
            <li> it doesnt want to pick up my nail polishes for some reason :(</li>
            <li> The only good side is the red side the white side suck and doesn&#x27;t pick up the nail polish overall it is not worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this stamper once, and did have trouble picking up some designs, though, I&#x27;m sure it was due to the nail polish I used.  I do find it annoying that the white stamp head pops out once in awhile as I clean it between stamps.</li>
            <li> This does need to be primed after you get it but it works AMAZINGLY!</li>
            <li> I love this product and I am very pleased with my purchase! It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
            <li> I just got this today and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. My first attempt, I was nervous because it didn&#x27;t pick up the design so I took a medium file and lightly filed it to remove the smooth shiny surface. Then I wiped it with acetone and tried again-SUCCESS!! I am so thrilled because I have longer nails and larger design nail plates. My other stamper didn&#x27;t pick up the entire design but this one does! I also love the plastic scrapers because I don&#x27;t use metal scrapers on my plates because they leave scratches. I was using old gift cards and old credit cards to scrape but now I can use this one and it works great! I am just thrilled with this product so THANK YOU WINSTONIA! I also got a discount coupon with my order for 5% off on one item or 10% off on two items so of course I ordered two more nail stamp sets from you. I will SO recommend this nail stamper to others. Thanks again!!</li>
            <li> Item came quickly and is exactly as described.  It works great and cannot wait to do more nail art with it.</li>
            <li> is easy to use and soft to touch, works great for me, the stamper is perfect. picks up imagine easily and complete. the stamper does come out of the holder but that is helpful when you want to stretch your imagine to fit your whole nail otherwise just make sure its in the holder completely before you start stamping.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because the learning curve with this is pretty steep. It took me a while to get the hang of this one, but its large surface works great for the length of my nails and I was determined to make this work. Here&#x27;s my experience, based partially on previous reviews here and lots of trial and error:&lt;br /&gt;1. Remove the pad and wash off the oily coating with some delicate soap. Dry it thoroughly and put it back in the holder.&lt;br /&gt;2. Buff all the shine off with a fine grit buffer evenly. I never got any polish to stick to the pad while it still had its factory shine on it.&lt;br /&gt;3. Clean the white pad only by rolling it across some tape. I put a long strip of packing tape on my work surface, and remove leftover polish, lint, and the occasional cat hair by rolling the pad over the tape. Don&#x27;t clean with polish remover ever.&lt;br /&gt;4. Put the polish on the image plate, and roll the stamper gently across the design. The hardest thing for me to get used to was that the harder you press, the less likely the polish will transfer to the pad. The gentlest roll will pick up all the polish you need to get a great transfer to the nail.&lt;br /&gt;5. It&#x27;s so soft and squishy that I&#x27;ve gotten great transfers just by lining it up and pressing my whole nail into the pad so the design covers the whole nail. In fact, I prefer pressing my nail into the pad than trying to roll the design across my nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other downside is that white polish on the white pad is a little hard to see. But that is a small inconvenience compared to being able to transfer a full nail pattern.</li>
            <li> Hands down, this is the single best nail stamper out there. Does require some prepping before use but other wise completely reliable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This stamper is wonderful!!! I bought this along with moyou stamping plates and if you&#x27;re familiar with moyou then you know how detailed their plates are. This stamper picked up every nook and cranny and transferred beautifully. Was really concerned because I bought the rock star plate that has the faces, but it worked like a charm. I go straight up and down when picking up compact images and roll with longer images although with this size really didn&#x27;t need to. Works perfectly both ways. I prefer the large scraper over the small one because it has that extra lip.</li>
            <li> never used this kind of stamper before. The white part falls out a bunch. That is easy to solve using a bottle lid as a stamper. when I did it that way, was able to do this well.</li>
            <li> I like this set.  I am finding that the silicone stamper pad is a little harder than the Pueen, and although I can get an image, I do have to try a couple of times.  I&#x27;m a newbie at stamp art, and that is most likely why.  The scraper is very good and I really like the small stamp end for smaller images.</li>
            <li> This will only work with one particular brand of nail polish that i have.... barely. Every other nail polish will not be picked up by the white part of the stamper. T__T&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother buying this and get an actual name brand stamper.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write customer reviews, but I was really disappointed in this stamper. I had heard great things about XL squishes and gave this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off the bat, it would not pick up ANY designs. It wouldn&#x27;t pick up any polish at all. I tried all of the recommendations — washing it, etc, but nothing would work. It as only after I soaked it in acetone that it would start to pick up designs, and even though, the design had bubbles and was fuzzy. I&#x27;ve seen reviews stating that some people get a defective stamper, and I&#x27;m not sure if that was the case here, but I decided to go order a different stamper instead.</li>
            <li> Great item love this item works great easy to pick up stamps super fast shipping</li>
            <li> When this stamper set arrived, the large soft white end was rolling loose in the package and I thought I had received a defective item.  However, all I needed to do was gently press the stamp end back in.  The stamper does an excellent job on full size - all over - nail stamps.  Cleaning it between stamps is so easy:  I just put a strip of scotch tape hanging off the counter.  Press the used stamp over the tape and release and the stamp is ready to use again.  The stamper gave me nice clean and clear images on my nails.  Overall, I am very pleased.  The only reason I took one star off of this is because it came with absolutely no instructions.  I had to read reviews and the description on this listing in order to learn how to use it properly.  This has quickly become my preferred stamper.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that this stamper was going to be The One. My decision to try this particular stamper was based on the reviews and its unique design.  However, I haven&#x27;t had any success in using this for ANY plate using special and (non) special polishes. Nothing picked up. The stamper comes in a simple ziplock bag with a thank you note.  No instructions or inserts so many (like myself) would have to wing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully I can find reliable instructions or help before I admit to myself that I wasted nine dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I...(1)placed double sided tape on my station&lt;br /&gt;(2) cleaned my plate with acetone and allowed it to dry&lt;br /&gt;(3) applied nail polish to selected design&lt;br /&gt;(4) scarped polish using old gift card (the scrapers that come with this stamp...just no)&lt;br /&gt;(5) immediately placed stamp over treated design&lt;br /&gt;(6) pick up stamp&lt;br /&gt;(7) nothing...nothing is on my stamper.&lt;br /&gt;(8) have a few choice words with stamper&lt;br /&gt;(9) dab stamper over tape (...even though nothing is visible to the naked eye)&lt;br /&gt;(10) repeat steps 1-10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Help please?!?!?</li>
            <li> The bottom white part of this stamper is very large but it comes out and it is very soft so it is hard for the design to set it is an alright stamper but I wouldn&#x60;t order it again.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get it to work. Ended up buying another stamper from an indie company.</li>
            <li> Once I primed this stamper I fell in love!!! I highly recommend this stamper!!!</li>
            <li> It took me some time to get use to using this stamper. I thought it had filed down the stamper too much, but after doing my first full set of nails with stamping on all of them, I finally got the hang of using this stamper. A few tips for the beginners:&lt;br /&gt;1) Lightly file down the white silicone stamper until it is not shiny anymore. I used a very fine grit nail file to do this.&lt;br /&gt;2) Use a lint roller to remove left over polish from the stamp. DO NOT use nail polish remover, as I have heard that it can ruin the stamper. I find it so much easier to use the lint roller, or even just stamp the remaining polish on to my nail polish mat.&lt;br /&gt;3) After a lot of practice, I learned that I must stamp straight down on to the image plate, and pull the stamper right back up. I have better luck when I don&#x27;t leave the stamp on the plate too long. I literally scrape the extra polish off, push the stamper (LIGHTLY) on the plate and pick it right back off. The more I let the stamper sit on the image, the less polish it actually picks up.&lt;br /&gt;4) I found that letting the polish dry a little on the stamper before applying it to my nail helps with having a darker image that transfers. When I transfer it from the stamper directly to my nail, the image is more transparent instead of opaque.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package to check out, the rubber end already poped out. I put it back in. I was surprised that the stopper was sticky. I have other ones but this one was different. I ordered it because it was larger and could pick up the whole images from the plates. I tried it out and the stopper would come out. I went to see what other people that ordered it had to say. They said they same thing. I read it the reviews on how to keep the stopper in. I have to get used to the stickyness. I also read how to clean the stopper. I still like it but have to get used to using this one. It is different. It does pick up the images from the plates really good.</li>
            <li> The silicone head falls out all and is annoying. Other than that is is great.  Remember to use tape to pull of the left over polish NOT polish remover.</li>
            <li> This stamper took a little long to get use to. I love that its large especially when stamping my big toe and thumbs</li>
            <li> The scrapers are not very good. Completely plastic and doesn&#x27;t scrape well. The stamper is very flawed. The stamp keeps falling out of the holder and the stamper doesn&#x27;t do a clean stamp like the other stamper I have. I DO NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> The white stamper fits too loose on the black plastic holder and it keeps falling off all the time. It is frustrating.  The small red stamper works pretty good... so I am limited to that one, but it is kind of small for the large stamps. ; (</li>
            <li> I totally love it. it picks the image great, im not to crazy for the scrapers i used an old gift card. amazing that i don&#x27;t have to roll the image on my nail just press down on the nail and BOOM!!! Done :)</li>
            <li> After almost a month I decided to learn how to use it. FIRST you HAVE to buffer the surface. I used the 240 Opi and after that worked perfectly!  SECOND don&#x27;t and I mean DON&#x27;T roll it over the plate. The right way is to push the stamper in perpendicular direction to the plate, do some pressure and the design comes out beautifully! THIRD don&#x27;t rubber it with polish remover to clean the non used design. Use tape to clean it, you&#x27;ll se is easier that way too for the others stampers -the hard ones- I have another from konad and since I realized this I use the tape to clean it too.&lt;br /&gt;Finally my konad stamper is there,  but I don&#x27;t use it anymore since I learn how to use the winstonia one.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
            <li> I love stamping but I always had trouble due to my curvy nails. This eliminates that issue, the soft, squishy texture transfers beautifully with no need to roll. As the directions state, and as you would with any new stamper, lightly file the surface before the first use and maybe every 10 manicures or so. A lot of the negative reviews I have read seem to be due to user error not product defect. Yes, the white rubber pops out if you&#x27;d like, makes it easy to clean or replace, but I&#x27;ve never had an issue with it coming out during a manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE that you do not use acetone to clean this (do NOT use acetone on this, period). It&#x27;s so quick and easy to just leave a strip of tape near by and clean it off. That alone speeds up the process immensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lone disappointment with the stamper is that it&#x27;s white, just because it can be difficult to see how well your image picked up when using white polish. That certainly is not a major complaint though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the scrapers go I definitely prefer them to the metal varieties, and each one scrapes differently so it&#x27;s nice to have options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have had trouble with stamping in the past I would definitely give this stamper a try, it makes the process a breeze.</li>
            <li> Love that I was able to get this stamper! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I fancy myself a very experienced nail stamper and I like &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; stampers, but this one just wasn&#x27;t made extremely well. Although I used a bit of tape to gently remove remaining bits of nail polish and not acetone (which damages the stamper), the sticky side immediately began to tear and crumble, and some bits of gunk seem to be permanently wedged into the surface of the squishy side. Too bad! I usually love Winstonia&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> does not work and white part falls out . the only thing it does hold is dust or anything else near by . .  {{cat hair}} . .  waste of money</li>
            <li> So the stamper is OK. It does make bubbles where the polish misses spots. It isn&#x27;t bad but it isn&#x27;t perfect. The white end is really squishy and you don&#x27;t roll the image on just mash. It helps with alignment. The red end works really well, and always makes a perfect transfer. The scrapers in the set tho.... They aren&#x27;t level. Useless, credit cards are better anyway.  Its an OK product, but if I were to go back I would send the extra $$$$ for a better one.</li>
            <li> Love this stamper! I was able to pick up much better images with this stamper. Works great for longer nails and nails with a prominent C curve.  Works great and shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> Love the softer texture of the stamping head as far as stamping the nail but had issues with being able to pick up the image.  So soft that the central high point on the head would literally push the polish out of the way when trying to gather the image and I kept ending up with empty images.  Then the stamp fell out of the holder and I noticed the flat side.  Magic happened.  With the flat side it easily picked up the image with a very light touch and stamped perfectly on the nail.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this product and had some trouble with it at first, however, after contacting the company they were more than wiling to give detailed instruction and suggestions to make it work for her. She is very happy with the stamper and the customer service she received!</li>
            <li> it came on time and is exactly what is described i have yet to try it but I&#x27;m sure it will work just wonderful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the marshmallow, but I knew that buying it! It&#x27;s not sticky and it&#x27;s squishy firm.</li>
            <li> Yay they&#x27;re are the best</li>
            <li> love love this stamper!</li>
            <li> the white side of the stamper does not pick up the image at all. the red side picks up pieces of it but not nearly as much as it should. the scrapers take all of the polish out of the image. an old credit card works better. I would not reccomend.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. Granted I do not have special polish.. but the ones I have tried to use are thick, holo, or chrome. I filed both ends with fine and coarse files and started using a lint roller to remove excess polish versus polish remover as some say the remover damages the stamp. Nothing works. Will try different stamper.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this stamper.  The stamping head is very soft and a great size, but it is does not have that marshmallow feel that I was hoping for.  It is also hard to lift complete images consistently.  I have tried prepping the stamper several times but it doesn&#x27;t help. However, the scrapers are nice.  I like that they are not metal so they don&#x27;t scratch my plates. I will keep trying to get the stamper to work.  It would be a shame to have to throw this out.</li>
            <li> Watched many videos to see how to use this since I was used to the Konad which is rubber and firmer.  Once you get the hang of it,  it&#x27;s nice.&lt;br /&gt;Softer on your nails and picks up bigger designs.&lt;br /&gt;The plate and stamping polish can be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;Konad plates and polish work fine. BMC stamping polish seems to only like the Konad.&lt;br /&gt;This softer stamper also makes it easier to apply where the stamp lands on your nail. Use a tape roller to clean it. Would definitely say to watch videos showing tips on this stamper.</li>
            <li> This stamper has become my favorite. I love that the white side is big enough to pick up even big full nail art images without the edges of the images being too close to the edge of the stamper. The small side is a perfect size for small images. Also, the bell shape scraper works even better than my Konad plastic scraper. I haven&#x27;t had success with the bigger scraper as the edge is thicker and it seems that the thinner the edge on the scraper, the better it works. I wish Wistonia sold the bell shape scraper separately and with several in a pack to stock up as the edges dull over time &amp; use. I also like that Wistonia sells replacement white scampers for this set. I would highly recommend this set to everyone. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> So glad I found this!!!</li>
            <li> Used a pencil easer on stamper to get images to pick up and now it&#x27;s my fave.</li>
            <li> Like the size but couldn&#x27;t get it to pick up images even after I primed it. I like creative shop and moyou best</li>
            <li> I love my new stamper. great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Great price. Perfect for nail art newbies. I was able to use several plates from various manufactures. This was a great buy!</li>
            <li> Hate this product. The scrapers were very cheap and all plastic. Wouldn&#x27;t scrape the polish off plate good enough to pick the image off the plate. The stamper also was of poor quality. The stamper kept falling out of the holder and when trying to pick up an image off a plate the stamp did not look as clear as when I used my old stamper</li>
            <li> the rubber thing falls out a lot but when it stays in place it transfers image well.</li>
            <li> I have been already warned that the stamper part comes off sometimes so I don&#x27;t mind that. The only part that made it hard to use  was that i had to press harder onto the nail plate in order to get the image unlike konad stampers so it took a few times to get a hang of, but Other than that the product works great! Love the service too, they sent me a little note thanking me for the purchase and stuff so I thought that was thoughtful. Just the way I imagined it.</li>
            <li> I have wide nail beds and long nails this makes the regular Konad stamper that i have too small to stamp any full nail images on my nails without double stamping. I have been looking everywhere to find an xl stamper (you can find them on ebay but not really anywhere else). I was so happy to find this one on amazon. Even when I read the review that only gave it two stars I decided to try it. I only gave it one star because amazon does not allow negative starring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got it it was in a cheap zip lock plastic bag, no real packaging but thats ok because I didnt buy it for the&lt;br /&gt;for the packaging, straight out of the bag, it fell apart, the rubber /plastic (if you can call it that) at the top separated from the base. Now the previous reviewer said that it came apart, I took this to mean that after a couple of stamps and repeated use it would fall out. This would have been fine because my Konad stamp does it sometimes too. NO. It just keeps falling apart. You try to stamp it the white part remains stuck to the plate, you  try to clean it between uses the top goes flying off, you rest it down and pick it back up, you&#x27;re picking up base only the head remains on the table. SMH. That was issue number one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second issue is the absolutely horrible quality. Apart from falling apart the rubber stamp (white part has holes in as it poured into a mould with air bubbles and the holes remain these are both on the top and the bottom and they look as if with continued use they will eventually tear. The stamp is permanently sticky, I&#x27;ve wiped with nail polish remover and acetone, the top is always tacky to the touch. The smaller of the two scrapers has a practically serrated edge, its so rough it leaves streaks through the design and is completely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The times that it did stamp the softness of it made it much easier than stamping with the harder Konad stamp. Especially with designs that have to be centered on the nail. You can just press your nail exactly onto the design as you want it. The size is also big enough for my nails about the size of the Kona stamp plus half .The images transferred were nice and clear but the trouble to get them in the first place its not worth it. For it to stamp you have to roll the stamp across the image, dont press and lift because as I said some times the stamp stays behind other times the image does not transfer but if you roll it across it picks up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big scraper works just as well as the metal scraper and  I will be replacing the metal one with this plastic one because I hate it when the plates are scratched. But I didnt buy it for the scraper. I think this company should pull this product from their list and just dump them. How anybody could have their name associated with a product this poor is beyond me. I wish somebody would put a dcecent quality xl stamp on amazon.our nail exactly onto the design as you want it.

            <li> This stamper works perfectly if you gently file the squishy cushion with a nail file.  This will remove the &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; that prevents the image from adhering to the pad.  I love this stamper it picks up clean crisp images.  I don&#x27;t have any issues with the stamper falling out if I press it down firmly.  My only criticism is that the scrapers don&#x27;t work. I hate them.  I use my Konad scraper instead.</li>
            <li> The stamper is great! I had a hard time at first it won&#x27;t the image won&#x27;t show on the stamper at all but then again it&#x27;s my first time to use the stamping technique. The next day I tried it again and this time it worked perfectly. I love my new stamper and would definitely recommend. Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Hands down one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a while! I&#x27;ve struggled with stamping for over a year now and finally decided to stop shopping and actually buy something to try to fix the problem. I figured my stamper was the issue and once I got this one and used it for the first time I could tell immediately I was right! I have had nothing but success with this stamper! I did have to buff it before using it but instructions on how to do that were easy enough to find online. Great product and was delivered ahead of schedule which is an added perk :)</li>
            <li> Firstly I thought it&#x27;s not working and decided to return it. But then Lisa from Winstonia Client Service answered me and gave some advices how to use it properly.&lt;br /&gt;And the most useful was video, she send me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;W8amEBqGknw&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried again, as was said in that video and it works! The stamp is great!&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave 4 stars — there is no any information how to use it. I think, you should print some and send with your product. It would be easier for all.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I knew what I was buying thanks to the exact details of the product.</li>
            <li> Neither scraper works. The white stamping head keeps popping out.</li>
            <li> I just received mine and the large white end of the stamper is very soft &amp; squishy unlike other stampers I bought. I think that may be what I prefer; stampers are usually hard and feel like you press too  hard on your nails. It goes over the nail well because it&#x27;s soft. That part also comes out easily though; but some krazy glue could fix that. Haven&#x27;t actually tried it yet so I will update my review when I do....  Ok so now that I tested it out I must say that I just love it. It picked up the design well for me; and goes over my nails well because it&#x27;s soft. Will definitely repurchase this!!!!</li>
            <li> The rubber piece doesn&#x27;t stay in the holder</li>
            <li> The small tip works good the bing one does not grab the design. So sad</li>
            <li> I give it a one star because in my personal opinion it does not work. such a waist of money. The item was defective. The squishy part  was like falling apart.</li>
            <li> Love having a bigger stamp for the bigger designs.</li>
            <li> Needed to buff out the finish on the white end &amp; then it will pick up polish. Otherwise works ok</li>
            <li> I got my second stamper sent to me from Winstonia. My first package looked like it went through a war! No fault of Winstonia, that was USPS. Winstonia&#x27;s customer service is great and will definitely be ordering from them in the near future. The stamper is squishy and works beautifully! It&#x27;s large so that you can pick up the whole image even on an xl plate.</li>
            <li> I have the Konad brand stamper and the cici and sisi stamper and both work better than this stamper.  This stamper only seems to pick up images if you only use the special stamping polishes.  It doesn&#x27;t do well with images that contain fine lines.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I cannot get the stamper to pick up the image.  I will continue to try and if I succeed, I will update my review.  I did receive it very quickly so that was one positive.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if I had ordered this used or not as it came in a ziplock bag... Don&#x27;t send this as a gift. Directions were not included.</li>
            <li> what can i say are there 100 stars that i could give to this product?...in one word amazing....i had tried the konad (only picks up certain nail polish brands $$$)....salon express (sucks not soft and flexible enough)...non brands (waste of money)...okay at first i though the price was too good to be true considering this is the only seller that offers the xl stamper on amazon and the rest of the stampers are only sold on ebay but come from china and are twice the price...then i took a chance but boy was i surprised first impression it was really sticky and soft a little too much and the problem of it detaching i put a coin inside and that not only keeps the soft part of the stamper from going in but because it is sticky it sticks to the coin and does not allow it to fall. I also heard you can take it out and put it inside a bottle top but idk your choice. Anyways it picks up any brand nail polish works with any and every nail plate and it picks up perfect however so the stickiness doesnt go away which i believe makes it great) i clean the residue on the stamper after stamping off with tape to maintain it sticky and saves you nail polish. love it and will be ordering more ...oh also less than a week for shipping great service very please would recommend.</li>
            <li> The smaller bell shaped scraper sucks, or at least the one I received did. The end in which you scrape with is uneven and scratches the plate (which defeats the purpose because most people do not want to see scratches on their plates and would stick to the metal scraper). The larger scraper works wonderfully and the stamp itself is large enough to pick up images from cheeky jumbo plates. I&#x27;ve had trouble with the silicone stamp falling out, but if you line up the grooves it should stay well without too much fuss. This is great for people with highly arched nails as opposed to having a flat nail bed. As for myself my nails are arched so i can just push the stamp onto my nails and it will mold whereas the hard rubber stamps would require a rolling motion (you can also use the rolling motion with this stamper) it all comes down to preference.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with a lot of stamping art plates and polish ,but the sponges come off and stick to the nail which makes it very difficult to do the stamp art! I had to glue the tips back in to the holder and they are very stiff! Sorry! Using the plastic scrapers is a better idea though because it does not damage my metal stamp art plates! Maybe a better sponge tip along with the good scrapers and you will have a winner! Thank You! Happy New Year!</li>
            <li> I disagree with the previous review; I think this stamper works very well although it took 2 or 3 tries to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;I also have the Konad double-ended stamper, but I prefer this one for full-nail designs.&lt;br /&gt;I read on a nail blog that the squishy end piece is designed to be removable so that you can bend it to slightly enlarge designs before stamping.&lt;br /&gt;This is a lifesaver for stretching those too small plate images to fit long nails or wider thumb nails.&lt;br /&gt;If this feature bothers you, a little super glue would probably keep the end piece in place...</li>
            <li> I like using the large squishy stampers over firmer ones and this one is perfect. The scrapers are plastic and are easy to clean and don&#x27;t scratch up your plates.</li>
            <li> When the squishy xl stampers get there they have a bit of oil on them from when they were made. I washed it a bit with dish soap to get the oil off. The stamper needs to be filed very lightly with a file that doesn&#x27;t have large grits. the large grits would cause some damage to it if you used it. you need to file it till some of the shine is gone then test it and file some more if the image isnt picked up well and repeat until you are happy with how the image is picked up. The stamper is more firm than i thought it would be but overall its a nice stamper i almost wish is was squishier but that might be easier to damage. i would buy this product again. i dont like that the shipping was $3 i would of bought two if the shipping was less than that.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done. It fits well in the hand and the squishy stamper captures the images on the plates nicely. I personally clean the squishy white stamp part with a piece of clear white tape; no fuss no muss.</li>
            <li> This has become my very favorite stamper.  It was really strange at first, getting used to the stickiness and the squishy texture, but the first time I tried stamping a full nail pattern with it, I was hooked.  You can just smoosh it right down over your nail, or smoosh your nail into it, and the pattern goes on nice and clean with none of the distortion that comes from rolling over your nail with the old style stamper.  And the pattern goes right up to the cuticle with no extra effort.  I used to have to try really hard to not get gaps with my Konad stamper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few downsides: the scrapers didn&#x27;t work at all for me, I just tossed them.  The stamper falls out of the holder from time to time, but that&#x27;s never been more than a slight annoyance for me, and the removable feature is great for people with larger nails who use this stamper to stretch designs.  The edges get little nicks and tears kind of easily, so it may need to be replaced sometime down the road.  Also, it picks up lint like mad, but I&#x27;ve never had it drop any lint back on my nails, so that&#x27;s not an issue for me.  And none of those things is enough to take a star away from how this little stamper lets me have straight stripes and geometric patterns with ease.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I love how it grabs more of the images and doesn&#x27;t mess up the base nail polish.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast. Love the extra large size it picks up everything.</li>
            <li> Best stamper out there.  OMG what a difference it made it picking up full images whether regular or XL MoYou.  As seen on Youtube I bought a Mr. Clean magic eraser and buffed the top of the spongy thing.  Not sure it needed it though.  I prefer my Konad blades to the ones that shipped with this but I was buying the product for the stamper.  Average shipping time.  Would recommend ordering from them again.</li>
            <li> This was my second set that I purchased. I got a different brand to try at the same time. I&#x27;m pleased with the look but the stamping sponge thing keeps falling out. Annoying. I&#x27;m not sure if I received a faulty one or if this is just how they are. If faulty I would like a new one and if the norm, I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> this is a great stamper if you are not using white, if your stamping with white you can&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> I love, love,love  this stamper,  it picks up so perfect. They never miss a picture. Thanks for this stamper</li>
            <li> Really love my stamper thank you...</li>
            <li> The stamper is a nice size. But, having trouble with the scrapers? Was not happy with delivery time and not sure why it didn&#x27;t get ship until almost a week after I ordered it????  However, would probably order again when needed and wished I would have purchased the rubber replacement pieces just in case.</li>
            <li> Really nice and large surface for stamping, but I will need to buff this out because It did not pick up the design on the first try, as it is quite shiny.  I will get it buffed out, and then I am sure it will be great!  I&#x27;ve seen this used successfully in youtube tutorials, so I know it is a good product.  The miniature scraper is a super great idea, and it works fine...</li>
            <li> I have bought one of these from this seller before and the one I got in this order was not the same. It was less squishy and sticky than the one I previously bought. So while it is as the seller described, it is not the same as I have gotten from them before. I was exspecting it to be very sticky and marshmallow soft and it was not. It was slightly soft and not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> works amazingly. Great for images you have to line up, and it was a lot easier to prevent smudging. When I first used the large scraper it didn&#x27;t work which I was afraid of because of another review BUT I flipped it to the other side and tried again scraped off perfectly. Very deserving of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with the stamp head being too firm. Once I got in touch with Winstonia, they fixed my problem very quickly and replaced the head of the stamper. Shipped for me on Monday, I received it today Wednesday. Thank you very much, will order again! And again. ;)</li>
            <li> I like the size of the stamper.  I generally grow my nails long and the regular stampers don&#x27;t provide complete coverage. While it&#x27;s true that the sponge comes out easily, it does conform to the shape of the nail especially if your nails are rounded!  Great product for the price.  Just use your imagination to make it work for you.</li>
            <li> First, the stamper arrived promptly, ahead of schedule!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading tons of reviews, here and elsewhere, in which the reviewer said that once they&#x27;d figured it out this was their favorite stamper, I was determined to work with it until I made it work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I couldn&#x27;t get it to pick up a thing. So I buffed the shiny top away with a medium nail file, with firm strokes, and then rinsed it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked once, I pressed it against tape to clean it, but again, it wouldn&#x27;t pick up any polish. Hours later, I tried it again, and it picked up the polish once - but only once &amp; not again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two days of messing around, I seem to have figured it out. I don&#x27;t know if its the type of remover I&#x27;m using, but it seems to leave a bit of a film behind, even after I&#x27;ve cleaned it w/ the remover &amp; dried it, that I can only assume is interfering with the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using a damp cloth to wipe the plate after I&#x27;ve cleaned it with remover, and then drying it with a dry cloth. Voila! Suddenly, its picking up beautifully every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of other tips, as other&#x27;s have said. It requires a lighter touch than a firmer stamper. Place it perpendicularly against the plate, straight on, rather than rolling it across the plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, its very useful for larger images. The softness &amp; flexibility makes it easier to wrap around the whole nail. Its even possible to press your nail directly into the stamper rather than the other way around, making it easier to line up the image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have come to prefer the larger scraper over the gift card technique. The smaller scrapper I got had a slightly flawed edge, but I wasn&#x27;t planning on using the scrappers at all, so having one work well is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> My winstonia stamping plates and stamp/scraper kit came today. At first I couldn&#x27;t get the large white side of the stamp to work but after reading some online reviews I saw that trying the to pick up the image you go straight down and then roll to apply. Works perfect! So happy! The images are so nice and clean and full coverage for my thumb!</li>
            <li> I love this stamper, I used to have a konad stamper and this was alot different for me at first. This stamper is squishy and picks up almost any image. I have used this with moyoulondon plates, konad, bundle monster, cheeky, and bunny nails and have had no problems. My tips for using it are to first &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; it by gently buffing it with a fine grain buffer. Also do not use acetone on this stamper, i use a sticky lint roller to clean it up and it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Just what I was looking for. The perfect Stamper. Picked up the images cleanly and released on to the Nail perfectly</li>
            <li> Sucked. The white foam came off right away and it didn&#x27;t work anymore!</li>
            <li> Great stamper, picks up images very nicely. Did need to prime it first in order to get crisper images. Would have preferred a &amp;#34;credit card&amp;#34; type scraper.</li>
            <li> My wife says this is her #1 stamper... She is very happy with it....she just order the second one for her friend</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t stamp.  Tried all sorts of polishes, primed it and everything.  Still not working.</li>
            <li> works perfect after priming</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery and it works nicely.</li>
            <li> not easy to work with at all.  very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS STAMPER! i think the stamper is even better than konad to be honest hehe</li>
            <li> Would not pick up the stamp at all until I prepped it. Once I filed it it works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great stamper.  I love that it&#x27;s soft, so I don&#x27;t have to rock the stamper; just press it on my nail and it&#x27;s so easy to straight stamp, which I couldn&#x27;t do with my Konad stampers. I did have to lightly file off the shiny film with a (probably) 220 grit nail file; a very soft nail file; it doesn&#x27;t take much.  This is definitely a keeper and well worth the wait.  No problem with the foam popping out and the plastic little scraper works great; don&#x27;t like to use metal as they scratch my plates.  So nice to finally stamp my designs straight, it was driving me nuts!  An addition 10/1/2014 I did notice that it doesn&#x27;t work with some nail polish (I used a cheapie) it wouldn&#x27;t pick up the image; so I used my Konad stamper and it picked up the desing; could be the depth of the etching as well.</li>
            <li> fast shipping product as described</li>
            <li> I give this stamper a 5 star because of it&#x27;s softness and large size.  I first I couldn&#x27;t get it work, it took me awhile to get use to it because of large size, but once I got the grip of it, it is fantastic, works really great, now I can enlarge and shrink the images.  As for the scrapers I cannot get a grip on them, no problem i&#x27;ll keep using my old credit cards.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that this stamper is bad but am trying to figure out why it doesn&#x27;t stamp right, don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the nail polish or what !? So anyway if anyone hase any opinion why it&#x27;s not working let me know , I&#x27;ll post pictures below so you can see how does the print look like on the stamper and as well applied  to the nail, any comments or thoughts let me know .</li>
            <li> When this thing isn&#x27;t being finicky it works well. I like the fact that it&#x27;s got both a small and large end, and that one is firm and the other is squishy. That said, I get a lot of inconsistent results with this stamper. I don&#x27;t have the most stamping experience, I&#x27;ll admit. But I have done my due diligence when it comes to researching nail polishes, stamping plates, prepping/priming a stamper, etc. It&#x27;s a rare occasion that I pick up a really good image and I know that I&#x27;m using quality plates. I have seen other reviews similar to mine. I think I&#x27;m going to try another kind of stamper, just for grins.</li>
            <li> Getting really frustrated been sittin here for three hours trying to get this stupid thing to work tried to buff I tried to use tape to clean it tried to use non acetone polish remover to clean it and acetone to clean used several different polishes stamper polish and non stamper polish to still have it not work I&#x27;m frustrated and feel stupid to be having this issue when I read all the great reviews here saying its wonderful and that it&#x27;s pure magic yup sure would be cool if I could experice that as well I&#x27;m ready to throw the thing out the window and mad I wasted this much money on something I can&#x27;t get to work when I was so excited to have my first real stamper not the salon express one that I have had for years oh and before I forget yes I did try different scrapers to anyone have any advice to help me I sure would love that feel like a dumb failure over here lmao</li>
            <li> I had heard good things about this stamper and was very eager to try it out. when it arrived the white part of the stamp was not inside of the stamper. I still was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. I put the stamper back together and tried using it. to be fair it would be a great stamper it did not keep falling apart. I like that it is soft which allows you to stamp your entire nail without the rolling motion which when done with a traditional stamper can be hit or miss when it comes to lining up you stamp with your nail. if they can fix this stamp so that it does not fall apart it would get five stars. the scraper is garbage but since I only wanted it for the stamper this did not bother me. Sad.</li>
            <li> Great stamper!  Works way better than the kit stamper I was using before.  Be sure to &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; the soft side by softly filing it a bit prior to use.  You&#x27;ll get a perfect stamp every time.  It&#x27;s great, too, because you can get full nail coverage without having to roll the stamper, as this one is soft.  You can just squish it down.</li>
            <li> Cannot make these work, no matter how hard I try. I give up.</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t work for me. I tried using it several times without priming and it doesn&#x27;t work. I then resorted to priming several times with various recommendations such as using a fine grit filer, Mr. Clean magic eraser, soap, and using various opaque nail polishes (Sally Hansen Insta-Dri / Sinful Snow Me White). Nothing worked. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in the Winstonia Nail Art Stamper. I Tried the suggestions below with no success.  I tried using it with several different polishes, different levels of pressure with the stamper,  scraping the disk with different pressures,  and still the polish would not transfer to the stamping pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most frustrating thing is that I had to search online to find out how to use it.  No instructions came with it.  I see others had the same experience.  Money spent with absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> So far it is picking up images great.</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this because I use a lot of full nail designs that don&#x27;t fit my nails the greatest (like the 1st set of bundle monster plates) and I saw a tutorial on how to use this product so I bought it feeling very confident! I was totally let down, like I considered throwing it in the garbage after I tried to use it a few times. I do not know how the person who did the tutorial got her stamp to stay in place! It&#x27;s a great concept, I love how its soft and conforms to your nails rather than being a hard surface and having to roll it like a konad stamper. But the product itself has a poorly executed design. I know the white surface is supposed to pop out for cleaning but this was horrible, I couldn&#x27;t get it to stay in no matter how much I pushed it back in it kept popping out when I tried to do my nails, I ended up taking it out and trying to use just the rubber without the holder which was too difficult, and I EVEN TRIED SUPER GLUING IT IN AND IT STILL POPPED OUT! It&#x27;s a major pain to clean it with tape all the time and it picks up tons of fuzzies and what not and the tape pulled it back out all the time, and its really hard to use the images are hard to stamp. I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money on this product. That and I just found one at Claire&#x27;s that is a better value (the stampers come in a kit with 3 plates and a mini special polish for $10 even less if you take advantage of there constant cosmetic \\&quot;multiples\\&quot; deals) and there&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t pop out like this one does I will still have the fuzzy problem but that&#x27;s one thing less I have to deal with. If I buy more (like as gifts, or to have one to leave at my boyfriends house) I will stick with the Claire&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> arrived on time product is as it states like most other reviews the rubber ends do come out easily but that can be fixed with a bit of glue over all very happy</li>
            <li> Great stamper! This stamper works way better than the stamper I received in the kit I ordered before. Had a tiny bit of trouble at first but once you find the right amount of pressure to use you will love this stamper.</li>
            <li> If you are wondering if this nail stamp is soft...yes it is, however don&#x27;t let that stop you from getting it because if works good. Why? because you can take out the white part (no it will not break trust me) and use it to minimized the image (to make the image smaller) to make it fit on your nail, OMG I love me because its so easy to use.  This is a great buy &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It took some priming to get it to pick up the image but it works way better than any other stamp I&#x27;ve owned!  I&#x27;m 100% pleased and will be ordering more heads for it!</li>
            <li> The stamper is perfect and works sooo amazing!!  In my personal experience, the bell shaped scraper it the best. The larger scraper does not work at all for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks for my products</li>
            <li> Soft stamper, nice product</li>
            <li> I love this squishy firm stamper so much that I ordered a backup!!! It picks up and transfers images beautifully, even on difficult to use plates. The marshmallow ones can be finicky at times because it is so soft and sticky it continually pops out of the holder when picking up images or when you clean it on a lint roller. This one is made out of a thicker silicone and holds up over time very well. Keep in mind that it does need to be primed first.</li>
            <li> I like the scraper but the stamper sucks</li>
            <li> Pure MAGIC! This stamp works amazingly. Great for images you have to line up, and it was a lot easier to prevent smudging. When I first used the large scraper it didn&#x27;t work which I was afraid of it. Because of another review BUT I flipped it to the other side and tried again scraped off perfectly. Very deserving of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The best stamper I&#x27;ve received</li>
