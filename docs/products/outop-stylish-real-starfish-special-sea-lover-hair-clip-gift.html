            <li>Another review here says, &amp;#34;a spray of perfume&amp;#34; might make it better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how cute it is.</li>
            <li>and the smell is still as strong as when i took it out of the ENVELOPE.</li>
            <li>but i honestly didn&#x27;t know that it was real.</li>
            <li>It will be a great gift for a teen age friend.</li>
            <li>clip looks very life like &amp; the detail is amazing</li>
            <li>A unique piece.</li>
            <li>I most certainly would recommend this clip to friends and family.</li>
            <li>Otherwise very pretty.</li>
            <li>Really  pretty !  </li>
            <li>There is nothing that would make wearing this stank clip worth it.</li>
            <li>And i was right.</li>
            <li>its exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>It is a real shell, but eeeeeww!</li>
            <li>They are absolutely adorable but it feels like its taking up the entire side of my head.</li>
            <li>Cute but larger than I thought they would be.  </li>
            <li>Did not realize it was going to be a real starfish!</li>
            <li>Seller describe exactly as clip is.</li>
            <li>It is just as pictured however the clip part fell off the first time I tried to clip it.</li>
            <li>it really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>you know cause it&#x27;s a REAL starfish.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much tolerable.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice that it was real</li>
            <li>When I bought it, I didn&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s a REAL starfish.  </li>
            <li>The packaging sucked but it was a real starfish, not painted foam or ceramic.</li>
            <li>Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s a real starfish</li>
            <li>I even aired it out, outside for more than a week.</li>
            <li>The clip on the back is stiff, which will be great for keeping it attached to my head.  </li>
            <li>You can barely smell the ocean unless you take a hit and super whiff it.</li>
            <li>It is a cute hair clip but because it is a real starfish (dead animal)</li>
            <li>I do not have the courage to pin that fetid creature to my hair to see if the clip would even hold, but thought it&#x27;s worth mentioning that it might need a bigger clip attached.</li>
            <li>(I guess if you didn&#x27;t grow up new the ocean</li>
            <li>The starfish is beautiful - it does have a bad smell though, but then again it is REAL!</li>
            <li>I did notice a slight smell, but only up close, and it wasn&#x27;t very strong at all.</li>
            <li>I opened the package, so I hot glued it back on.  </li>
            <li>Really cute, but it&#x27;s a real dead sea creature and smells like the entire ocean at first.</li>
            <li>Was surprised by the smell.</li>
            <li>size  &amp;  not  heavy.  </li>
            <li>This product is adorable in my hair, although the clip fell off when I dropped it from a small height (oops!)</li>
            <li>It was a bit smaller than I expected, but considering they are real, you can&#x27;t expect every starfish to be the exact same size.</li>
            <li>Someone standing near you would definitely smell it.</li>
            <li>A little large for hair wear, but super-cute!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> For such a large starfish clip (a little heavier than I&#x27;d anticipated too), the clip seemed a bit small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cute, the only problem I found with it is that it smells really bad, but I think a spray of perfume will help with that.</li>
            <li> Rinsed it, repeated with soap and water and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> Pretty, but very delicate and clips often come off starfish.</li>
            <li> all fairness, I am not sure why I am surprised by the smell, as the product claims &amp;#34;Real Starfish.&amp;#34; I just didn&#x27;t think anyone would sell a hair clip so horrid</li>
            <li> But this also makes it a bit difficult to open and close without feeling like you might put too much pressure on the starfish and crack it.  </li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY NOT.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll just have to be careful with it!</li>
            <li> The only thing I noticed about it was there was a small chip on one of the points.</li>
            <li> I washed it with water and soap let it soak a little and rinsed it off.</li>
            <li> Several arrived broken.</li>
            <li> If there is a demand for starfishes to be killed so they can become someone&#x27;s hairclip, they will be killed for that purpose.</li>
            <li> it smells like rotten dead animal.</li>
            <li> Nice but smelled terrible</li>
            <li> Once it dried, it still smelled barf-inducing.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that I can get rid of the odor.  </li>
            <li> I am also not sure I want to ;put this in my hair.</li>
            <li> When I received this starfish, some of the little cone &#x27;spikes&#x27; were broken off, it looked like it had just been glued on.</li>
            <li> but it made me a little uncomfortable but</li>
            <li> I am deeply concerned for the hygiene of these 10 reviewers who would wear something that smells so bad.</li>
            <li> It absolutely horrifies me that anyone would wear this clip from how bad it smells, and I am utterly shocked that 10 people gave it a 4-5 star review.</li>
            <li> I received 2 of these and one came broken</li>
            <li> Arrived with three tips broken off.</li>
            <li> this came in the mail broken and it smelled like death.</li>
            <li> When you open the package,  the odor is terrible.  </li>
            <li> The dead awful stench never went away, no matter how I washed it, sprayed it, soaked it.</li>
            <li> I was so nervous buying this item because I was afraid it would break during shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I am obsessed with nautical items, and I dress like a mermaid of the land!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have any experience with a bad smell.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t let people think it smells bad</li>
            <li> The that bad boy in the trash.</li>
            <li> Im disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible!</li>
            <li> This thing smells HORRIBLE!  </li>
            <li> Spraying this disgusting thing with perfume or anything scented will make your perfume smell like death warmed over.</li>
            <li> Smells awful, nothing covers the smell.</li>
            <li> It smells like a disgusting, rotting fish.</li>

            <li> This clip is adorable! Didn&#x27;t have any experience with a bad smell.</li>
            <li> This is very nice with one exception.  When you open the package,  the odor is terrible.  I am not sure that I can get rid of the odor.  I am also not sure I want to ;put this in my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this hair clip. I was excited to find it because I knew it would be perfect for my Ariel cosplay. And i was right. ITS PERFECT! its exactly like the picture but i honestly didn&#x27;t know that it was real. I don&#x27;t know why but it made me a little uncomfortable but i got over it lol also as i read the comments a lot of people we complaining about the smell of the Clip....news flash people, that&#x27;s the smell of the ocean. (I guess if you didn&#x27;t grow up new the ocean you wouldn&#x27;t know that) So don&#x27;t let people think it smells bad it really doesn&#x27;t. Its a really nice hair clip for the price it is :)</li>
            <li> Got the same one off eBay. Was surprised by the smell. Smells like seaweed and the ocean, you know cause it&#x27;s a REAL starfish. I washed it with water and soap let it soak a little and rinsed it off. Added alcohol. Rinsed it, repeated with soap and water and let it air dry. The metal got a bit rusty but Better than the clip make my hair smell like seaweed. I then added Batiste in &amp;#34;blush&amp;#34; and let it airdry and it&#x27;s so much tolerable. You can barely smell the ocean unless you take a hit and super whiff it. Don&#x27;t knock it because of the smell unless you ACTUALLY TRY to fix it.</li>
            <li> Pretty, but very delicate and clips often come off starfish. Several arrived broken.</li>
            <li> Awful. Clip Broke immediately.  The dead awful stench never went away, no matter how I washed it, sprayed it, soaked it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make s hair clip for a costume. When I opened the bag it absolutely wreaked like dead fish. It is a real shell, but eeeeeww! The that bad boy in the trash.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE my hairpin!! It was a bit smaller than I expected, but considering they are real, you can&#x27;t expect every starfish to be the exact same size. I did notice a slight smell, but only up close, and it wasn&#x27;t very strong at all.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected. Still cute!</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible! You can smell it before even opening the package. Im disappointed. I didn&#x27;t notice that it was real and I didnt reference the comments. Shame on me. Lesson learned. I will b returning this item.</li>
            <li> Bought this to go Disney Bound to Walt Disney World.  Stayed in my hair all day without any problem!</li>
            <li> I love this. The clip on the back is very tiny. You will need a booby pin to make this stay in. The shell is perfect. A unique piece.</li>
            <li> They are absolutely adorable but it feels like its taking up the entire side of my head. So if you want to wear them as a side pin I would reconsider.</li>
            <li> Cute but larger than I thought they would be.  I should have checked the measurements that were stated.</li>
            <li> To all customers here: Please do not order items made out of animal parts. Compassion should be rated above fashion. If there is a demand for starfishes to be killed so they can become someone&#x27;s hairclip, they will be killed for that purpose. Please stop the demand for these products. Please do not be a mermaid at the expense of the starfish.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this. It looks great in her hair. The item was in great condition when it arrived ,she was impressed.</li>
            <li> Arrvd on time &amp; well pkd.  It will be a great gift for a teen age friend.</li>
            <li> Did not realize it was going to be a real starfish! It kind of smells. But I got a cure to cover it up so it won&#x27;t smell anymore. It is really cute and I like it!</li>
            <li> This star fish clip was the talk of my salon, every stylist there wanted to where I got this beautiful clip from.&lt;br /&gt;This clip looks very life like &amp; the detail is amazing, I wish there were different colors. Seller describe exactly as clip is. I most certainly would recommend this clip to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Really  pretty !  Nice  size  &amp;  not  heavy.  Just  clip  on  as  an  accent  accessory  to  your  hair  style.</li>
            <li> This product is adorable in my hair, although the clip fell off when I dropped it from a small height (oops!)</li>
            <li> I was so nervous buying this item because I was afraid it would break during shipping. I&#x27;m so glad it didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s really cute, the only problem I found with it is that it smells really bad, but I think a spray of perfume will help with that. All in all this is the perfect mermaid accessory :)</li>
            <li> Broke the minute I opened it..</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous hair clip.  The one I received is about 4&amp;#34; in diameter.  The clip on the back is stiff, which will be great for keeping it attached to my head.  But this also makes it a bit difficult to open and close without feeling like you might put too much pressure on the starfish and crack it.  Overall, I like it and I&#x27;ll just have to be careful with it!</li>
            <li> The starfish is beautiful - it does have a bad smell though, but then again it is REAL!</li>
            <li> Love it! Very cute!! Wish there were bigger sizes though, but i want to buy more.</li>
            <li> I received 2 of these and one came broken but it is cute!</li>
            <li> It is a cute hair clip but because it is a real starfish (dead animal) it smells like rotten dead animal.</li>
            <li> These are smaller than I pictured so I did not use them.</li>
            <li> So cute will be ordering another.</li>
            <li> I used them for my mermaid themed party every one got one</li>
            <li> A little large for hair wear, but super-cute!</li>
            <li> When I received this starfish, some of the little cone &#x27;spikes&#x27; were broken off, it looked like it had just been glued on. I still wear the clip though, it stays in my hair nicely. I bought this because I am obsessed with nautical items, and I dress like a mermaid of the land! I will buy more sea-themed accessories.</li>
            <li> This thing smells HORRIBLE!  When I bought it, I didn&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s a REAL starfish.  Maybe being shipped from overseas in plastic causes it to stink, I don&#x27;t know.  I tried EVERYTHING to get the stink out of it.  I even aired it out, outside for more than a week. Now it smells like poop.  It&#x27;s in the garbage where it belongs.  Even THEN you can smell the stench of it.  Ugh... ZERO stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note:  Spraying this disgusting thing with perfume or anything scented will make your perfume smell like death warmed over.</li>
            <li> Arrived with three tips broken off. The packaging sucked but it was a real starfish, not painted foam or ceramic.</li>
            <li> this came in the mail broken and it smelled like death. i tried to let it air out but its been almost a week and the smell is still as strong as when i took it out of the ENVELOPE.</li>
            <li> Smells awful, nothing covers the smell.</li>
            <li> the clip had come off hen I opened the package, so I hot glued it back on.  Smaller than I thought it would be but it was a great price and my daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> Nice but smelled terrible</li>
            <li> So the smell I can get over since it is a beach wedding. However it showing up in the package broke without enough time to replace it before my wedding is beyond words. Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li> This is literally killing wildlife. No different than killing Cecil the Lion.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Good transaction</li>
            <li> Really cute product! Loved it! The only problem is a fish smell that coming out of the item.</li>
            <li> It absolutely horrifies me that anyone would wear this clip from how bad it smells, and I am utterly shocked that 10 people gave it a 4-5 star review. It smells like a disgusting, rotting fish. The scent is VERY strong. Another review here says, &amp;#34;a spray of perfume&amp;#34; might make it better. ABSOLUTELY NOT. I cleaned this thing in scented soap and water. Once it dried, it still smelled barf-inducing. I am deeply concerned for the hygiene of these 10 reviewers who would wear something that smells so bad. I don&#x27;t care how cute it is. There is nothing that would make wearing this stank clip worth it. Someone standing near you would definitely smell it. Please do everyone a favor, and do not buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all fairness, I am not sure why I am surprised by the smell, as the product claims &amp;#34;Real Starfish.&amp;#34; I just didn&#x27;t think anyone would sell a hair clip so horrid smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrific smell aside, before I opened the package, I observed it from within the plastic. For such a large starfish clip (a little heavier than I&#x27;d anticipated too), the clip seemed a bit small. I do not have the courage to pin that fetid creature to my hair to see if the clip would even hold, but thought it&#x27;s worth mentioning that it might need a bigger clip attached.</li>
            <li> love it looks great with my mermaid wig i have</li>
            <li> Really cute, but it&#x27;s a real dead sea creature and smells like the entire ocean at first. So 1: give it time to air out the smell and spray it with something fragrant, and 2: Handle with care.</li>
            <li> It is just as pictured however the clip part fell off the first time I tried to clip it.</li>
            <li> Very adorable.. My sister loved it. The only thing I noticed about it was there was a small chip on one of the points. I believe it&#x27;s a real starfish so I didn&#x27;t expect it to be perfect but maybe that&#x27;s how they all are! Otherwise very pretty.</li>
