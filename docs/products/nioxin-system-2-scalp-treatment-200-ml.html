            <li>This is really a great product.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy to get it through Amazon.com...</li>
            <li>They work great with my thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy too.</li>
            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>This does howver definatley add to the look of volumn and is probably perfect for many</li>
            <li>on time, well packaged and a good deal... thank you</li>
            <li>This stuff was recommended by my stylist and it feels good to use</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a good product.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the results I have been getting with this product.</li>
            <li>I smiled because I had noticed his thinning hair</li>
            <li>My hair started thinning and then I started using Nioxin recommended by my mother -in-law who owns her own salon and who says Mother-in-laws are your biggest enemy ???  </li>
            <li>System one is a liquid and made my hair shiny, this product is a mouse and had some kind of thinking agent, I like it</li>
            <li>Along with the shampoos and conditioner, I think the Nioxin system promotes a healthy scalp and promotes the best hair growth you are genetically capable of.  </li>
            <li>Best run into so far.  </li>
            <li>I thought the idea was cute but NEVER dreamed that I would notice results within 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I bought it at a local beauty salon 4-5 years ago and was impressed but also started using propecia.  </li>
            <li>have since stopped using propecia and am satisfied with the results that I get using the Nioxin</li>
            <li>It does not regrow hair but is next best thing.</li>
            <li>a lot&lt;br /&gt;Going to call nioxn and find out for sure tomorrow, unless someone else post&#x27;s here,</li>
            <li>I am glad they indroduced me to this product, because it is great!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nioxin products are top of the line</li>
            <li>Did not produce thickness to hair as stated, felt sticky, Diamox Infusion much better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>My husband really likes and is happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need to use much of product to get good results.</li>
            <li>I came to Amazon and purchased the system 2 series and very quickly saw a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have fine noticeably thinning hair</li>
            <li>As long as it makes him happy....</li>
            <li>and I feel confident saying that Nioxin is a very well-perpetrated scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love it would buy it again makes my hair feel so much thicker.  </li>
            <li>I came across this SUPER SHAMPOO that stopped my hair to fall.</li>
            <li>I can hardly wait to see my results, after a few more months of using this amazing product!!!...:)</li>
            <li>If you are thinning it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the Nioxin products to slow hair loss, promote growth and give you a healthy scalp and good looking hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff protects from the sun, thickens hair a bit and probably adds some vitamin type benefits because hair seems to grow a little faster, but I also use the shampoo and conditioner which is like a complete package, but on its own this seems pretty good.  </li>
            <li>are not bad; noticed that not as much hair falls out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you buy it off Amazon.com and NOT the hot chicks at Sports Clips, you save $$</li>
            <li>You have got to love a product that will help either grow back hair or stave off balding!</li>
            <li>Also feels so clean and soft .</li>
            <li>When I tried to brush it out, large clumps of hair were in my brush.  </li>
            <li>works better than expected, adding lots of volume and body.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since then I&#x27;ve done a lot of research and really educated myself on the causes of hair loss</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than when I would get it at Ulta.</li>
            <li>Thanks to her</li>
            <li>It seems to really thicken up my hair.</li>
            <li>but my hair doesnt have much movement.  </li>
            <li>give it two stars because despite how firmly I believe Nioxin is a joke, this Scalp Treatment is effective for &#x27;plumping&#x27; hair and creating an illusion of thickness.</li>
            <li>I find this product to be decent for keeping my hair a bit thicker and healthier.</li>
            <li>I told the Customer Service person  that at a VERY MINIMUM, CONCISE DIRECTIONS need to be printed on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll probably use this up (because it isn&#x27;t cheap) and then look into some other products to replace this.</li>
            <li>I notice less of my hair coming out, I used to shed significantly.</li>
            <li>I no doubt wasted around 1/4 of the container because I followed SPECIFICALLY what was written, and what WAS written, wasn&#x27;t accurate re:</li>
            <li>Try these products out, I know you will be pleasantly surprised like I was.</li>
            <li>Essentially it&#x27;s a wildly over-priced thickening mousse.</li>
            <li>I have so much hair on my head (knock on the wood) that hairdressers charge extra for blowouts!!!!</li>
            <li>Using 2-3 time a week to avoid over saturation, as recommended by hair care specialist, there seems to be a marked increase in the body of my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I am in my late 20s and have thinning hair at the top of my head.</li>
            <li>The directions state to apply directly to scalp.  </li>
            <li>This product felt like I&#x27;d poured SYRUP directly onto my hair.  </li>
            <li>This bottle has to be a couple years old.  </li>
            <li>this was $38 not long ago!!!</li>
            <li>This only happens it you use too much and let it dry without blow drying.</li>
            <li>I purchased this along with a variety of Nioxin products when I first started noticing a little thinning in my hair and basically freaked the eff out.</li>
            <li>My hair has become less thin and it is filling in nicely.</li>

            <li> I purchased this along with a variety of Nioxin products when I first started noticing a little thinning in my hair and basically freaked the eff out.</li>
            <li> My hair has become less thin and it is filling in nicely.</li>
            <li> and I did see a few new hairs--but not enough to continue.</li>
            <li> so my hair doesn&#x27;t look thinner than it actually is, so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m just negating the whole purpose of it -</li>
            <li> the one I have has the same spf factor cause I really needed at least a spf 15 being in the sun</li>
            <li> Now here I am recommending this product to others and I plan on ordering these products for my husband from amazon for a long time.</li>
            <li> and it is thicker than it was then and what you get lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It is a foam and the first time I used it, it left my hair dull, stiff, and sticky.</li>
            <li> I have to blow-dry or towel dry after treatment</li>
            <li> I used them diligently but to my dismay they not only seemed to not be helping, but my hair felt increasingly limp and greasy,</li>
            <li> I also treat with Rogaine on a daily basis and it all seems to slow down overall hair loss.</li>
            <li> I use the other lvl 2 items ie shampoo conditioner , with Biotin supplement I have noticed improvement in density.</li>
            <li> Also dries it out to an extreme.</li>
            <li> stuff is thick, sticky, smelly, and leaves a residue on your hands when applying - god forbid you have to run a comb through your hair later, you may rip it out by the roots if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li> I combined this with supplements and their hair booster but had little results, other than thickening so it makes it harder for your hair to fall out</li>
            <li> I have to blow dry to get the thickening effect and do not get any stiff feeling hair.</li>
            <li> I would say, conservatively, that my hair loss was at least DOUBLE to THREE TIMES what it has been.  </li>
            <li> Have to shake twice as long and the foam is thin and watery compared to previous purchases of the same product.</li>
            <li> Less hair seems to fall out also.</li>
            <li> Improvement over my previous  hair drying gel; however, I have been using for 2 months</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a few yrs</li>
            <li> Some reviews have stated that this product makes your hair feel stiff.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the scalp treatment - its thick and acts like hairspray which actually makes my hair look worse.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for past 2 years and still going.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the ingredients have changed on the step 3 portion though.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would suggest it to a friend.</li>
            <li> but I am not sure it works</li>
            <li> If my hair gets wet from humidity while this in in my hair it gets all weird and crispy, making it look even thinner than it otherwise would.</li>
            <li> But that doesn&#x27;t mean it might not work for you!  </li>
            <li> problems I&#x27;ve never experienced before and which I attribute exclusively to Nioxin.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s too expensive and the system 2 shampoo and conditioner do not work anymore.</li>
            <li> Product is EXPENSIVE, too.  </li>
            <li> About 10 years ago my barber told me that I was thinning badly  and recommended Nioxin Hair Care Products.</li>
            <li> YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Nioxin shampoo and conditioner along with the scalp treatment and have not seen any improvement in the thinning of my hair. :(</li>
            <li> but figured they probably sold him crap, after all it was not a state of the art hair salon.</li>
            <li> WTF with the price hike!?!?!</li>
            <li> To me, it smells awful, and leaves my hair crispy.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> on time, well packaged and a good deal... thank you</li>
            <li> But that doesn&#x27;t mean it might not work for you!  This stuff was recommended by my stylist and it feels good to use and I did see a few new hairs--but not enough to continue.</li>
            <li> My husband had his haircut and came home with this product system (3 products in all).  I smiled because I had noticed his thinning hair but figured they probably sold him crap, after all it was not a state of the art hair salon. I thought the idea was cute but NEVER dreamed that I would notice results within 2 weeks.  Now here I am recommending this product to others and I plan on ordering these products for my husband from amazon for a long time. Try these products out, I know you will be pleasantly surprised like I was.</li>
            <li> Age 31 &amp; I have  been using this product for 3 weeks with obvious hair growth noticeable !! I do not have any medical reasons for my thinning hair issues nor do I take any medications that would contribute to hair loss but this product seems to be helping &amp; I will continue to use !!</li>
            <li> This is a scalp treatment product that for me doubles as a setting gel.  Two for the price of one.</li>
            <li> works better than expected, adding lots of volume and body. don&#x27;t need to use much of product to get good results.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the results I have been getting with this product. My hair has become less thin and it is filling in nicely.</li>
            <li> I was turned on to Nioxin for hair loss by my mother in law who had to suffer through chemo.  I bought it at a local beauty salon 4-5 years ago and was impressed but also started using propecia.  After finishing the Nioxin I went back to regular shampoo etc.. and noticed thinning again (still on propecia).  This went on for 6-8 months.  I came to Amazon and purchased the system 2 series and very quickly saw a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I have since stopped using propecia and am satisfied with the results that I get using the Nioxin alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with a variety of Nioxin products when I first started noticing a little thinning in my hair and basically freaked the eff out. I used them diligently but to my dismay they not only seemed to not be helping, but my hair felt increasingly limp and greasy, problems I&#x27;ve never experienced before and which I attribute exclusively to Nioxin. (Since stopping their use, by the way, the texture of my hair has improved dramatically.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I&#x27;ve done a lot of research and really educated myself on the causes of hair loss and I feel confident saying that Nioxin is a very well-perpetrated scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it two stars because despite how firmly I believe Nioxin is a joke, this Scalp Treatment is effective for &#x27;plumping&#x27; hair and creating an illusion of thickness. Essentially it&#x27;s a wildly over-priced thickening mousse. Nothing else.</li>
            <li> This is really a great product.  I was so happy to get it through Amazon.com...Much cheaper than when I would get it at Ulta.</li>
            <li> The Nioxin Scalp; Shampoo; and Conditioner products&lt;br /&gt;are great! They work great with my thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;They add volume and promote hair growth in thinning areas.</li>
            <li> My hair started thinning and then I started using Nioxin recommended by my mother -in-law who owns her own salon and who says Mother-in-laws are your biggest enemy ???  Thanks to her I came across this SUPER SHAMPOO that stopped my hair to fall. I have been using this for past 2 years and still going. I have so much hair on my head (knock on the wood) that hairdressers charge extra for blowouts!!!!</li>
            <li> i am using for the last 14 years .  It is very good product  .  I used recommend my friends</li>
            <li> Using 2-3 time a week to avoid over saturation, as recommended by hair care specialist, there seems to be a marked increase in the body of my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff protects from the sun, thickens hair a bit and probably adds some vitamin type benefits because hair seems to grow a little faster, but I also use the shampoo and conditioner which is like a complete package, but on its own this seems pretty good.  It does not regrow hair but is next best thing. Less hair seems to fall out also.</li>
            <li> got mine today and it dosent say spf15 it just says with uv ingredients for the hair. so different packaging for some reason,&lt;br /&gt;Hope the one I have has the same spf factor cause I really needed at least a spf 15 being in the sun a lot&lt;br /&gt;Going to call nioxn and find out for sure tomorrow, unless someone else post&#x27;s here,</li>
            <li> If you use this consistantly, It works.&lt;br /&gt;The key is to use it consistantly. I notice less of my hair coming out, I used to shed significantly. Now, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;I was introduced to this product at Sports Clips. I am glad they indroduced me to this product, because it is great!&lt;br /&gt;However, if you buy it off Amazon.com and NOT the hot chicks at Sports Clips, you save $$</li>
            <li> Met my expectations.  Nioxin products are top of the line</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s too expensive and the system 2 shampoo and conditioner do not work anymore. Apparently a different company bought out Nioxin and they have changed the ingredients in the shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;m not sure if the ingredients have changed on the step 3 portion though.</li>
            <li> Not the same quality as before.  Does not foam up.  Have to shake twice as long and the foam is thin and watery compared to previous purchases of the same product.</li>
            <li> Hair feels fuller and thicker, after just 1 month of using product.  I intend to keep ordering it, and using this product.  I can hardly wait to see my results, after a few more months of using this amazing product!!!...:)</li>
            <li> I think it helps to provide health to hair my hair is stronger and healthier I use the other lvl 2 items ie shampoo conditioner , with Biotin supplement I have noticed improvement in density.</li>
            <li> To me, it smells awful, and leaves my hair crispy. If my hair gets wet from humidity while this in in my hair it gets all weird and crispy, making it look even thinner than it otherwise would. Also dries it out to an extreme. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> This is the third step in a hair care treatment system. About 10 years ago my barber told me that I was thinning badly  and recommended Nioxin Hair Care Products. I was hesitant, especially because of the price. But you know what? I worked.  I still have my hair and it is thicker than it was then and what you get lasts a long time. If you are thinning it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product!  Best run into so far.  Always share this information with others.&lt;br /&gt;Have used for years.  In fact, like all their products!</li>
            <li> For the price and the fourth order I did expect to be seeing some results.&lt;br /&gt; Not sure if I would suggest it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Did not produce thickness to hair as stated, felt sticky, Diamox Infusion much better. Did work well for sunscreen scalp protection.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT MY HAIR IS THICKER I CANT BELIEVE THIS STUFF WORKS AWESOME GREAT PRODUCT YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> I apply the treatment after showering and before blow drying my hair. It seems to really thicken up my hair. I don&#x27;t know if it does anything else, but it does make your hair seem thicker. I recently tried the similar Bosley product and didn&#x27;t like it at all. It didn&#x27;t have the same &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; effect. Some reviews have stated that this product makes your hair feel stiff. This only happens it you use too much and let it dry without blow drying. I have to blow dry to get the thickening effect and do not get any stiff feeling hair. Along with the shampoos and conditioner, I think the Nioxin system promotes a healthy scalp and promotes the best hair growth you are genetically capable of.  I also treat with Rogaine on a daily basis and it all seems to slow down overall hair loss. I would recommend the Nioxin products to slow hair loss, promote growth and give you a healthy scalp and good looking hair.</li>
            <li> Be warned that this product is no longer SPF 15. I called Nioxin and that line is actually discontinued. What you will get is  &amp;#34;UV protection&amp;#34;, which is *not* equivalent to SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I am in my late 20s and have thinning hair at the top of my head. I find this product to be decent for keeping my hair a bit thicker and healthier. I use it twice a day. I was hoping for SPF for the summer, but I guess that&#x27;s not an option.</li>
            <li> I use it but I am not sure it works</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the scalp treatment - its thick and acts like hairspray which actually makes my hair look worse.  I have to blow-dry or towel dry after treatment so my hair doesn&#x27;t look thinner than it actually is, so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m just negating the whole purpose of it - I can&#x27;t tell if this stuff is ACTUALLY HELPING MY HAIR at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this stuff is thick, sticky, smelly, and leaves a residue on your hands when applying - god forbid you have to run a comb through your hair later, you may rip it out by the roots if you aren&#x27;t careful.  I think I&#x27;ll probably use this up (because it isn&#x27;t cheap) and then look into some other products to replace this.</li>
            <li> I combined this with supplements and their hair booster but had little results, other than thickening so it makes it harder for your hair to fall out, this is no help.......also......WTF with the price hike!?!?! this was $38 not long ago!!!</li>
            <li> Have only used the Scalp Treatment once.( Have been using the Cleanser and Scalp THERAPY (conditioner) for a couple weeks now.)  I was HORRIFIED at the amount of hair loss when using the Scalp treatment.  The directions state to apply directly to scalp.  Turns out I was SUPPOSED to apply to my fingertips-- SPARINGLY--and then onto my scalp.  This product felt like I&#x27;d poured SYRUP directly onto my hair.  Could not begin to comb through it, using  a wide-toothed comb.  I would say, conservatively, that my hair loss was at least DOUBLE to THREE TIMES what it has been.  Product is EXPENSIVE, too.  I told the Customer Service person  that at a VERY MINIMUM, CONCISE DIRECTIONS need to be printed on the bottle.  I no doubt wasted around 1/4 of the container because I followed SPECIFICALLY what was written, and what WAS written, wasn&#x27;t accurate re: application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t even USE it a second time.  Maybe I will try it again, but was sooo traumatized by the RADICAL HAIR LOSS that I haven&#x27;t wanted to.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a few yrs and it does seem to reduce hair loss. At the same time it acts like a holding gel to control longer hair.</li>
            <li> System one is a liquid and made my hair shiny, this product is a mouse and had some kind of thinking agent, I like it but my hair doesnt have much movement.  One this is finished I&#x27;ll go back to system one for the scalp treatment.  This does howver definatley add to the look of volumn and is probably perfect for many</li>
            <li> I have fine noticeably thinning hair so thought I would give System 2 a try.  The shampoo and scalp cond. are not bad; noticed that not as much hair falls out.  The scalp treatment.....I would definitely not recommend it.  It is a foam and the first time I used it, it left my hair dull, stiff, and sticky. When I tried to brush it out, large clumps of hair were in my brush.  Would recommend using the scalp treatment in System 3 - that works; it is a liquid spray.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes and is happy with this product.  As long as it makes him happy.... I&#x27;m happy too.</li>
            <li> You have got to love a product that will help either grow back hair or stave off balding! Also acts as a styling gel!</li>
            <li> Improvement over my previous  hair drying gel; however, I have been using for 2 months and I can&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li> This bottle has to be a couple years old.  My last 3 bottles (which last 2-3 months) had newer labeling...  Item leaked in packaging..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Nioxin shampoo and conditioner along with the scalp treatment and have not seen any improvement in the thinning of my hair. :(</li>
            <li> Love it would buy it again makes my hair feel so much thicker.  Also feels so clean and soft . Great buy.</li>
