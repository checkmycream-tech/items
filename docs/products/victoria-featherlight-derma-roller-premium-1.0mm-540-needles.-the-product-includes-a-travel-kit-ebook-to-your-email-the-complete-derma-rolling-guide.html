            <li>Im very impressed, and would certainly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>AS IF IT MIGHT DO MORE HARE THAN GOOD.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t believe in serums or any kind of lotions  before ( because they didn&#x27;t work without the derma roller)</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;No need to purchase one elsewhere - this is the best!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep trying :)</li>
            <li>I have bought 4 Derma Rollers in varying lengths &amp; this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>SO glad i had the courage to put those needles on my face.</li>
            <li>Found this to be very useful!  </li>
            <li>The product itself is of good quality, and while I was a little worried about using it, I found it to be surprisingly pleasant to use!</li>
            <li>The product is very professional and looks very nice and elegant.</li>
            <li>the needles is good thanks.</li>
            <li>4 times a week should do the work just fine.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Found this product to be very appealing on the outside - beautiful design just like in the pictures and seems its made out of good material - not a cheap made in china product.</li>
            <li>My prior experience has included the 0.5mm and with that size I experienced pin point bleeding.  </li>
            <li>Using the product greatly  enhances  the penetration of your products immensely.</li>
            <li>I found the 1.0mm to be very useful , don&#x27;t recommend on longer needles.</li>
            <li>Love it Been using since I got it .Very easy to use really like the look</li>
            <li>The luminosity of the skin quickly returns, fine lines diminsh and the price point of your products decrease.</li>
            <li>Defenetly worth the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ify on exactly how many times your supposed to use it</li>
            <li>Love my new derma roller, great quality and my order was here in 4 days with standard mailing.  </li>
            <li>stainless steel &amp;#34; needles and I couldn&#x27;t use the derma roller any more.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, there was no bleeding only redness.</li>
            <li>Most of the scars haven&#x27;t gone away, but they blend in much better with the surrounding skin, are softer, and most noticeably they are much less discolored.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to use a combo of the Derma roller together with bit of lotion or moisturizer for even better results.</li>
            <li>Great quality product compared to others previously purchased.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>have had great success in the past and was looking forward to returning to the fantastic benefits associated with microneedling.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Made out of good quality materials and the titanium needles did not bend break or rust during the use, not like other derma rollers i&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the outcome was worth the time and consistent use.</li>
            <li>In general I&#x27;m really satisfied with my choice - the quality,</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly and and I barely feel the fine needles pressed on my screen.  </li>
            <li>The customer service letter i got after purchasing the victoria featherlight derma roller closed the deal with a professional feeling of a company with great customer service.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my acne scars, but it can be used for so many things such as wrinkles and stretch marks.</li>
            <li>And if it had any effect, then any changes would be more obvious</li>
            <li>If it has always been there can I fix this my using the dermaroller?&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after my first session though, my acne scars raised</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The morning after i used it for the first time i already saw some improvement.</li>
            <li>I used it very gently at first</li>
            <li>I used the device for the first time this evening.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on what i read on the Beauty Brains blog, one thing to note is that you really have to go at it.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much clearer.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t doing much</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think that this would work</li>
            <li>Now when she used it first couple days a little more acne came but not a lot.</li>
            <li>The area generated new skin and looks much better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A couple of the smallest lightest keloid scars HAVE more or less disappeared, which makes me optimistic about the prospects of the heavier ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I only used light pressure but the titanium needles are sturdy enough to be used with quite an amount of force (no bending or breaking).</li>
            <li>Can someone please tell me if these are all normal?</li>
            <li>but i did use normal moisturizer</li>
            <li>Its light, and gentle (if used properly) and even though ive only used it three times so far, i have noticed a difference already!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more prone to scarring than anyone I&#x27;ve ever met, still get breakouts (that of course, always result in hyperpigmentation), and now at 30 I think I&#x27;m starting to see the first faint traces of fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I used it for a month and a half and the results were fantastic.</li>
            <li>And she said her skin is really soft.</li>
            <li>but now they are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>I have used it on my chest and face so far</li>
            <li>I think this is helping slowly but surely.</li>
            <li>Be gentle, don&#x27;t pressure it and be consistent with the every other day use!</li>
            <li>I thought I saw results after the first treatment, and definitely after the second.</li>
            <li>Due to my skin&#x27;s propensity to scar, I figured I&#x27;d first test this out on some old keloid scars before I stuck a bunch of needles in my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only did it come quickly, it far exceeded my expectations in terms of quality!</li>
            <li>The results are fantastic - I have seen a difference in only a few days!</li>
            <li>Also she has only used it 5 times so far.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s been a few days since I first derma rolled my face.</li>
            <li>I am still trying to get rid of my &amp;#34;mommy mustache,&amp;#34; my very stubborn dark spots above my upper lip.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve spent more than 1000$ on treatments and other things for these scars and small wrinkles to vanish.</li>

            <li> So it&#x27;s been a few days since I first derma rolled my face.</li>
            <li> I am still trying to get rid of my &amp;#34;mommy mustache,&amp;#34; my very stubborn dark spots above my upper lip.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve spent more than 1000$ on treatments and other things for these scars and small wrinkles to vanish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are some hardcore old keloid scars, over a decade old and long past fading.</li>
            <li> My purchases on amazon have been a bit of hit and miss lately, but this one was EXACTLY what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;m not that young it seem it took a bit longer than the average time for results to show up.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s no apparent effects yet.</li>
            <li> It has been a year since I have used the dermaroller due to medical reasons and decided to upgrade.</li>
            <li> Today as I was doing my makeup, I noticed I had a weird dimple/indentation above my right eyebrow when I raise them.</li>
            <li> Every other night for 5 weeks straight and the wrinkles are hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, does the job I need it for &amp; not as painful as the others.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy another one of these in the future, since they do have to be replaced when the needles get dull.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL...</li>
            <li> Does as expected, no need to look anywhere else!</li>
            <li> dark spots had lightened up .Would recommend it</li>
            <li> I started with only twice a week because i have delicate skin, but after two weeks i got the idea and tried 4 times a week.</li>
            <li> it looks brighter and slightly firmer.  </li>
            <li> I have a stubborn line on my chin which I hope over time it will become less noticeable as I continue to use the derma roller.  </li>
            <li> I can already see a slight difference in my stretch marks after two weeks of using the roller.</li>
            <li> Plus my acne scars from flare ups due to PMS and PCOS are starting to slowly disappear!</li>
            <li> and after I got the hang of it I used slight force</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly uncomfortable but not enough to stop using it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made some half-assed effort to get rid of them in the past with scar sheets and ointments, but those didn&#x27;t take.</li>
            <li> They are raised,  puckered, discolored, and hard.</li>
            <li> but I am slowly seeing results.</li>
            <li> I hope to someday without having to go the other expensive route, which is not going to happen since I have no moola.</li>
            <li> Now my skin is tighter, looks younger and no more thick ugly lines on my throat.</li>
            <li> No more need to invest in expensive ingredients.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had a bad experience with the last derma roller I bought - the color came off from the &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it Been using since I got it .Very easy to use really like the look&lt;br /&gt;My dark spots had lightened up .Would recommend it</li>
            <li> excelente, beatiful&lt;br /&gt;excellent&lt;br /&gt;amazing Results</li>
            <li> Good choice. I used it just for my wrinkles on the cheeks and forehead, it took a while but the outcome was worth the time and consistent use. Every other night for 5 weeks straight and the wrinkles are hardly noticeable. Use a good vitamin c serum !</li>
            <li> I received the derma roller promptly and in good condition.  I have been using it once a week for three weeks.  It&#x27;s slightly uncomfortable but not enough to stop using it.  You get redness after you are done which lasts for about an hour or so.  I have noticed some improvement in my skin it looks brighter and slightly firmer.  I have a stubborn line on my chin which I hope over time it will become less noticeable as I continue to use the derma roller.  Overall I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure what to expect. I&#x27;m still using it as much as possible. I&#x27;ll keep trying :)</li>
            <li> This is great!! Its light, and gentle (if used properly) and even though ive only used it three times so far, i have noticed a difference already! I bought it for my acne scars, but it can be used for so many things such as wrinkles and stretch marks. Im very impressed, and would certainly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> the needles is good thanks.</li>
            <li> After 1 use, I saw a bend needle. I don&#x27;t know to risk my skin, so I decided to throw it away</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL...I AM RETURNING THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT SAYS  TO &amp;#34;CONSULT A DOCTOR BEFORE USE&amp;#34;...IT SOUNDS AS IF IT MIGHT DO MORE HARE THAN GOOD.</li>
            <li> My skin is crappy. I&#x27;m more prone to scarring than anyone I&#x27;ve ever met, still get breakouts (that of course, always result in hyperpigmentation), and now at 30 I think I&#x27;m starting to see the first faint traces of fine lines around my eyes. Due to my skin&#x27;s propensity to scar, I figured I&#x27;d first test this out on some old keloid scars before I stuck a bunch of needles in my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are some hardcore old keloid scars, over a decade old and long past fading. They are raised,  puckered, discolored, and hard. I&#x27;ve made some half-assed effort to get rid of them in the past with scar sheets and ointments, but those didn&#x27;t take. If the dermaroller was gonna damage my skin, then no harm done here. And if it had any effect, then any changes would be more obvious here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a month of rolling (about once a weekish?) I am definitely seeing results. I thought I saw results after the first treatment, and definitely after the second. Most of the scars haven&#x27;t gone away, but they blend in much better with the surrounding skin, are softer, and most noticeably they are much less discolored. A couple of the smallest lightest keloid scars HAVE more or less disappeared, which makes me optimistic about the prospects of the heavier ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on what i read on the Beauty Brains blog, one thing to note is that you really have to go at it. Not &amp;#34;gently roll&amp;#34; like it says on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally tested it out in my face last night. Will keep this review updated.</li>
            <li> Love my new derma roller, great quality and my order was here in 4 days with standard mailing.  I will definitely be ordering another roller.</li>
            <li> Can not see it does anything although it does make asking tingle</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and and I barely feel the fine needles pressed on my screen.  I can already see a slight difference in my stretch marks after two weeks of using the roller.</li>
            <li> Only used it twice for myself and nothing yet but I can tell the difference on my daughters face. She has acne and blemishes, like brown spots. They are starting to lighten up. Now when she used it first couple days a little more acne came but not a lot. Also she has only used it 5 times so far. And she said her skin is really soft. Hope this hepls</li>
            <li> Idk maybe it&#x27;s jus me I&#x27;m starting to notice results but then again I&#x27;m not. I stopped using it for a while but I think I&#x27;m going to start using it again and see what happens.</li>
            <li> Love this Derma Roller! Does as expected, no need to look anywhere else! Product is everything I needed and comes with a storage container for sanitary purposes. Love the affordability! Can&#x27;t wait to see my results!</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much clearer. I am still trying to get rid of my &amp;#34;mommy mustache,&amp;#34; my very stubborn dark spots above my upper lip. I hope to someday without having to go the other expensive route, which is not going to happen since I have no moola.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s been a few days since I first derma rolled my face. I&#x27;ve only rolled once so there&#x27;s no apparent effects yet. Today as I was doing my makeup, I noticed I had a weird dimple/indentation above my right eyebrow when I raise them. I don&#x27;t know if that is an effect of dermarolling or it has always been there. If it is an effect, is this permanent or what? If it has always been there can I fix this my using the dermaroller?&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after my first session though, my acne scars raised and I got tiny white bumps on my cheek. Can someone please tell me if these are all normal?</li>
            <li> I think this is helping slowly but surely. It does take time. My pores are shrinking. I use it along with Thayers Lemon With Hazel and Jason&#x27;s Vitamin C cream. I use Burt Bees day and night moisturizers. It take time but I am slowly seeing results. Plus my acne scars from flare ups due to PMS and PCOS are starting to slowly disappear! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this derma roller! Not only did it come quickly, it far exceeded my expectations in terms of quality! The results are fantastic - I have seen a difference in only a few days! Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;No need to purchase one elsewhere - this is the best!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had a bad experience with the last derma roller I bought - the color came off from the &amp;#34; stainless steel &amp;#34; needles and I couldn&#x27;t use the derma roller any more. This is why I got this titanium 540 needles one and it works perfect! I used it for a month and a half and the results were fantastic. Real good quality, no need to worry :)</li>
            <li> I have bought 4 Derma Rollers in varying lengths &amp; this one is my favorite. Very comfortable, does the job I need it for &amp; not as painful as the others. Great product. Will definitely buy another one of these in the future, since they do have to be replaced when the needles get dull. My favorite!!!!</li>
            <li> The product is very professional and looks very nice and elegant. I found the 1.0mm to be very useful , don&#x27;t recommend on longer needles. Made out of good quality materials and the titanium needles did not bend break or rust during the use, not like other derma rollers i&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it to reduce wrinkles on my throat area, it took 2-3 weeks but now they are almost completely gone. I started with only twice a week because i have delicate skin, but after two weeks i got the idea and tried 4 times a week. Now my skin is tighter, looks younger and no more thick ugly lines on my throat. --MG</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for! My purchases on amazon have been a bit of hit and miss lately, but this one was EXACTLY what I was looking for. The product itself is of good quality, and while I was a little worried about using it, I found it to be surprisingly pleasant to use! Would be happy to recommend this to anyone looking into purchasing it!</li>
            <li> I bought the 540 1.0mm needles because i wanted to use it on my face. Found this product to be very appealing on the outside - beautiful design just like in the pictures and seems its made out of good material - not a cheap made in china product. The customer service letter i got after purchasing the victoria featherlight derma roller closed the deal with a professional feeling of a company with great customer service.This is my story:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 5 years i had scars and wrinkles on my face from a surgery i went through. I think I&#x27;ve spent more than 1000$ on treatments and other things for these scars and small wrinkles to vanish. This product is great! It did what 1000$ of products could not do in 5 years. The morning after i used it for the first time i already saw some improvement. My friends and family were astonished by the results after only 2 weeks of treatment ( i used it 4 times a week). Definitely worth the price. Will be buying again.&lt;br /&gt;by the way i didn&#x27;t use any serum after each session but i did use normal moisturizer</li>
            <li> I’m a happy camper!&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived on time and the design is great. At first I only used light pressure but the titanium needles are sturdy enough to be used with quite an amount of force (no bending or breaking). I have used it on my chest and face so far and it feels very nice. I would highly recommend to use a combo of the Derma roller together with bit of lotion or moisturizer for even better results. Id like to add that everyone at VF Derma customer service was very kind in helping out with my questions, Thank you!</li>
            <li> The best anti aging product. Be gentle, don&#x27;t pressure it and be consistent with the every other day use! SO glad i had the courage to put those needles on my face. Not just for skin problems and conditions, everybody should try this. My friends won&#x27;t stop complimenting me</li>
            <li> Before trying this I used the 0.5 derma roller but it wasn&#x27;t doing much so I switched to this one. Because I&#x27;m not that young it seem it took a bit longer than the average time for results to show up. In general I&#x27;m really satisfied with my choice - the quality, the looks and the customer service are superb. Will be ordering again</li>
            <li> Found this to be very useful!  Great design and the customer service was kind and helpful. I used it very gently at first and after I got the hang of it I used slight force and it wasn&#x27;t bad at all. It did wonders on my chest and face. The area generated new skin and looks much better.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t believe in serums or any kind of lotions  before ( because they didn&#x27;t work without the derma roller) but after the second time I used the dermaroller i realized that I have to...Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy one - it doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars ! Thank you</li>
            <li> very good. ..and quality of this product. ..I&#x27;m happy with my item..</li>
            <li> Great quality product compared to others previously purchased. My prior experience has included the 0.5mm and with that size I experienced pin point bleeding.  It has been a year since I have used the dermaroller due to medical reasons and decided to upgrade. .I have had great success in the past and was looking forward to returning to the fantastic benefits associated with microneedling. Using the product greatly  enhances  the penetration of your products immensely. The luminosity of the skin quickly returns, fine lines diminsh and the price point of your products decrease. No more need to invest in expensive ingredients. Utilizing the proper skincare with hylauronic acid, peptides, vit c and A is sufficent.  I used the device for the first time this evening. Surprisingly, there was no bleeding only redness. I am very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend. Thank you</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think that this would work but it did. 4 times a week should do the work just fine. It totally healed my acne scars and the skin just looks much younger ! Be paciant it takes about 1.5 weeks until you start seeing results..Defenetly worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ify on exactly how many times your supposed to use it but I&#x27;m happy with this product. Came on time, isn&#x27;t cheapy and works great</li>
