            <li>so glad to find it on Amazon and not have to spend the time trying to look for it.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed receiving this package.</li>
            <li>My husband likes it too but agreed it would be much better for our evenings out.</li>
            <li>Price was okay.</li>
            <li>:) ha</li>

            <li>Love the scent, not over powering.</li>
            <li>I love this smell...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I am suspicious about the reviewers because almost everyone said it is fresh and smells really good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like getting it for FREE!</li>
            <li>Not at all satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I do have to say that the scent was however quite refreshing.</li>
            <li>This is one of the parfum more cheaper of the Amazon Store.</li>
            <li>Love when my husband wears this.</li>
            <li>i am not a strict person about perfumes and i even think that the cheaper adidas perfume is much better than this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure he will though.</li>
            <li>It smells great, but it wears off too fast.</li>
            <li>Nautica Voyage is better but thats why it costs more</li>
            <li>Probably using it as air freshener &#x3D;)))</li>
            <li>Extremely satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>the fact that I cannot return the product makes me even more upset.</li>
            <li>I got it for a gift for my boyfriend for Valentines day, and hopefully he will like it &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I find it excellent for a daily use product at this price</li>
            <li>it is much better than a deodrant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this scent for many many years.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S OKAY</li>
            <li>husband really likes this, great scent</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok to start off</li>
            <li>I say more?  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, but no staying power.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite Colon for men.</li>
            <li>I love the way my husband smells when he wears this.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s original and it is surely genuine.</li>
            <li>The price is too good to be true because the cologne doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour.</li>
            <li>Amazing price for a classic cologne, can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>Have purchased more since first purchase.</li>
            <li>Very sexy and masculine.</li>
            <li>Bought as a gift they love it, thanks!</li>
            <li>Packing and bottle was original, but cologne was just an liquid with a bit fragrance.</li>
            <li>Original one which i got it from store stays 6-8 hours.</li>
            <li>It came in the original box.</li>
            <li>The original Nautica is a bit stronger.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find this as I believe it&#x27;s no longer in production.</li>
            <li>bueno el producto 100% original</li>
            <li>So as long as this is NOT your \\&quot;GO TO\\&quot; cologne for nights out and/or dates,then it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>Musky and rich.</li>
            <li>Just like the original</li>
            <li>The sillage is minimal to fair, but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Well priced, clean, brisk fragrance which I had purchased as a gift--</li>
            <li>There is a reason why this cologne is so cheap, its because it does not smell good and does not last.</li>
            <li>It has a clean aroma and does not overpower.</li>
            <li>Not too overpowering but just a clean smell.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this colonge not to strong and smells fresh</li>
            <li>The aroma is not too strong and gives off just the right amount.</li>
            <li>Now i wouldn&#x27;t use this for a special occasion, i would use this if i needed to run an errand</li>
            <li>Price right also!</li>
            <li>, it is a clean and nice masculine scent, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering it&#x27;s a clean light fresh scent.</li>

            <li>It comes in a cool looking bottle too.</li>
            <li>Gave it 5 stars for complements and a nice classy scent.</li>
            <li>Smells good , but smell does not last.</li>
            <li>and i was convinced it was good enough.</li>

            <li>Love it and highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>Satisfied with the product, fast delivered.</li>
            <li>My son loved his Christmas present!!</li>
            <li>For the price that I paid, it was obvious it wasn&#x27;t going to be a good smell.</li>
            <li>Full my expectatativas with respect to the product.</li>
            <li>I really like Drakkar, significantly better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from the scent, I love the design of the bottle - reminds me of modern architecture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good smell, but does not last at all.</li>
            <li>and i was convinced it was good enough.  </li>
            <li>used to wear this back in the day and loved it.</li>
            <li>It is fruity some say to sweet</li>
            <li>and I feel cool as the breeze.</li>
            <li>Good, however does not last.  </li>
            <li>this nautica Eau de toilette is a good choice for a travel fragancy with low price, I completly recommend it.</li>
            <li>too.would definitely recommend  good value for money.</li>
            <li>It comes in a cool looking bottle too.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Not bad but would recommend Voyage instead.</li>
            <li>For the price, not bad.</li>
            <li>This is a mild fragrance and is a good one for the regular use.&lt;br /&gt;I used 1 bottle and hence reordered.</li>
            <li>I mean I think its a great deal for that price!</li>
            <li>I had originally gotten one of this by my aunt as a christmas present, and then I decided to buy another one - Extremely pleased :)</li>
            <li>And I have a pretty strong sense of smell</li>
            <li>The BLUE variety smelled fresh and clean, and my wife and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>Changed and started using other colonies like Happy for Men.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, this cologne would smell really great</li>
            <li>Clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Nautica cologne has a clean, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Clean, fresh scent, discount price.</li>
            <li>clean, and fresh scent, and draws compliments from people in the office.  </li>
            <li>This smells so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Inexpensive and has a fresh, clean smell.</li>
            <li>but I pull it off nicely clean out the shower fresh t-shirt couple of sprays</li>
            <li>It has a clean and fresh scent about it that lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>be back more often :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always enjoyed that smell of Nautica&#x27;s first crisp burst out the bottle, landing onto my skin.</li>
            <li>It is a good one (considering the price), can be worn daily and has a fresh scent to it.</li>
            <li>I ordered it for Christmas and it came quickly.</li>
            <li>IT EVAPORATES TO QUICK</li>
            <li>he loves its mild  fragrance .</li>
            <li>but it wears off quickly.  </li>
            <li>Love Nautica Classic for Men</li>
            <li>and i needed to quickly freshen up.</li>
            <li>So daily morning when he starts off to office i don&#x27;t feel like fighting with a man wearing such a manly cologne...and the best part is..</li>
            <li>It is so mild that it is equivalent to 10 ml of perfume with 90 ml of water.</li>
            <li>Worthy of my selection.</li>
            <li>but it does wear off quickly.</li>
            <li>Cologne has a very nice scent and long lasting  I would recommend it to anyone plus its at an amazing price</li>
            <li>This scent is clean and refreshing but also very masculine.</li>
            <li>nothing special of course, just smth fresh, it&#x27;s not for going out or smth.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing last about 1-2 hour</li>
            <li>As with most calognes that I do buy, I don&#x27;t normally buy specifically for events or time of the day.  </li>
            <li>excellent water tualet liked my dad is fanatic and is always the same</li>
            <li>its soft and i love the design of the bottle, its unique.</li>
            <li>But the bottle is very pretty.</li>
            <li>A good size bottle that lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>This cologne is perfect for casual outings and every day use (but everyone knows your not supposed to use the same cologne every day lol)</li>
            <li>and there but its cool still worth the money</li>
            <li>Good deal, delivery, it&#x27;s about getting a large bottle of a very solid, familiar scent from years ago.</li>
            <li>however, I am honest and absolutely could not do that to a decent seller.</li>
            <li>Nice, simple and clean perfume.</li>
            <li>such a classic scent and for a great price</li>
            <li>however, I am honest and absolutely could not do that to a decent seller.</li>
            <li>This scent has a decent life as well..but smells better on fresh skin than on the clothes.</li>
            <li>This cologne has a pretty good flowery scent, but it&#x27;s not as good as the Nautica Voyage in my Opinon, and it doesn&#x27;t last as long either.</li>
            <li>Even as Nautical introduces new additions to their line, my boys stick with their favorite.  </li>
            <li>This cologne smells so much better than the new line they make.</li>
            <li>I really like the light and fresh, clean scent of this cologne.</li>
            <li>Based on my first and only experience with this seller, I would select it before others listed, and I can in good conscience recommend it to anyone looking for a quality product and prompt service.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to a friend, family member, any guy that wants to smell good, or anyone in general.</li>
            <li>Dily member, any guy that wants to smell good, or anyone in general.</li>
            <li>The cologne smells pretty good, I&#x27;ll use it occasionally for work.</li>
            <li>After using it, there was a bright light shining down as if the Heavens had opened up and blessed me.</li>
            <li>Awesome cologne, especially given the brand-name, low price and fast shipping with Amazon!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Received this item exactly as described and exceeds expectations!  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s more concentrated than cheaper perfumes, it&#x27;s important to remember that less is more (and the scent lasts longer, as well.)  </li>
            <li>but this type is very good at least for me.</li>
            <li>Classic cool Nautica scent never goes out of style!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping it since it was cheap, and the scent really doesn&#x27;t suit me well anymore anyway.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good-sized bottle of cologne from a designer brand for cheap.</li>
            <li>so I buy it on amazon where its cheap and fast ship.</li>
            <li>Great smelling everyday cologne</li>
            <li>great cologne for everyday use.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great without having that &amp;#34;generic cologne base&amp;#34; smell that every low price cologne manufacturer thinks smells masculine.</li>
            <li>Nice box, overall felt this was worth the price</li>
            <li>Worth the money.showered</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fresh and not overpowering as some colognes are.  </li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>DEF WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li>fresh, approachable scent</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>it holds on all day long.i used to get compliments about how nice it smells when I last had this.</li>
            <li>The price was well worth it.</li>
            <li>smells fresh and like out-of-the-shower.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re golden though.</li>
            <li>worth</li>
            <li>the smell is so nice and last longer.</li>
            <li>so i contacted amazon right away &amp; they shipped out another bottle free of charge &amp; told me to dispose of the other bottle or do with it as i pleased!</li>
            <li>i wanted to find the old school nautica and was very excited to find it here</li>
            <li>and it disappears pretty quickly after that.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate that Nautica makes a cologne that is clean, light yet still masculine.  </li>
            <li>This one is right for me.</li>
            <li>The price was right and this is my husband&#x27;s every day fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Throw it on right as you&#x27;re about to go out</li>
            <li>It was the right size and it looked just as how it is shown online.</li>
            <li>so i know this can&#x27;t be right.</li>
            <li>Right?</li>
            <li>The smell is classic and smooth.</li>
            <li>The Fragrance is not bad but it doesn&#x27;t last more than 10 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>Great for pretty much all ages above freshmen year high school ......</li>
            <li>and thats all that really matters right?!??</li>
            <li>I have to go and check in the local stores regarding the smell which is very mild and light.</li>
            <li>i have been using it for the last 6 months and feel this is very soft in terms smell and a good one that could be used for all occasions.</li>
            <li>its ok i m goin to order it more in near future....</li>
            <li>if completely fulfilled my expectations, and I go back to place another order for future purchases with these excellent merchandise</li>
            <li>Worth buying, I like it so much!</li>
            <li>Good delivery with an average product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s salty, light, and very fresh, but isn&#x27;t as sweet or cool as other aquatics.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s salty, light, and very fresh, but isn&#x27;t as sweet or cool as other aquatics.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s salty, light, and very fresh, but isn&#x27;t as sweet or cool as other aquatics.</li>
            <li>I use this cologne when Im on the go and dont want to smell like smoke, pretty cheap and has a decent smell thats not overbearing.</li>
            <li>Large bottle!</li>
            <li>It was the right time when Amazon reached out to when my first bottle was finished.</li>
            <li>The classic has a pleasant, fresh scent, like fresh out of the shower and is not very strong or will it offend others like some cologne&#x27;s do.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the on time delivery, I get to smell great everyday.</li>
            <li>I received the cologne quick and fast.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s disgusting, Lol :D</li>
            <li>My hubby love it, big size fresh and just in time for Father&#x27;s Day</li>
            <li>.....to me it smells more like freshly washed clothes hung outside on a sunny day.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and as described.  </li>
            <li>I really should have bought more bottles, but I was not thinking clearly.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of the cologne, not too strong not too soft.</li>
            <li>In short, Nautica BLUE &#x3D; GREAT....</li>
            <li>I like the smell and the beautiful container, but the smell doesn&#x27;t stay very long, only like one or two days...</li>
            <li>i RECOMMENDED IT VERY MUCH</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and the item that came to me was not the true Nautica Classic.</li>
            <li>Nautica Classic for Men by Nautica 3.4 oz 100ml EDT Spray  not a bad</li>
            <li>Came in fast and is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>It is a clean, fresh, smell that is masculine.  </li>
            <li>most likely wont buy again</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable, the package wrapped well for protection &amp; and service was prompt!</li>
            <li>one to shop online at all, first experience with amazon</li>
            <li>My first perfume purchase with Amazon</li>
            <li>Exactly what he wanted.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what you would buy in the stores for 1/3 of the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering, nor is it the first thing you&#x27;ll notice when a man walks into a room.  </li>
            <li>I have a friend that&#x27;s a girl that just happens to absolutely love the Nautica Blue cologne</li>
            <li>I have a friend that&#x27;s a girl that just happens to absolutely love the Nautica Blue cologne</li>
            <li>Very pissed with my order!</li>
            <li>ok smell but not lasting</li>
            <li>He likes this frange, was our first time.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not expensive</li>
            <li>Long lasting, quality bottle with a great presentation. .</li>
            <li>It stays on all day, and everyone I know smells me and they keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li>the bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li>I decided to go for this fragance as a gift, it arrived on time, the perfume was exactly what i was expecting.</li>
            <li>At first it&#x27;ll be &amp;#34;sweet,&amp;#34; somewhat unisex, once it settles</li>
            <li>Girlfriend can&#x27;t get enough :)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be certain that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Nautica or not, but the price is right.</li>
            <li>Masculine, but light.</li>
            <li>lovely scents which last all day</li>
            <li>I got it on sale and it was a really deal!</li>
            <li>My wife and I could not believe the price of this product, we have seen this same product in stores for $20 more.</li>
            <li>Love the scent,but it does not last all day.</li>
            <li>Normally use Tommy, Cool Water, etc.  </li>
            <li>This is bit stronger and a routine fragrance that will make others aware that you are wearing something stronger.</li>
            <li>was wondering how amazon is able to sell 100 ml bottle lesser than the price of 50 ml bottle ....  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is just enough and he was very pleased with it and will enjoy using it for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>Well, pretty content with purchase for the price.</li>
            <li>The product was just as we expected and we liked to use it.</li>
            <li>Plus you really get a bang for your buck with a price like this!</li>
            <li>This is a close second to my favorite, PURO PURO CAFE.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This is more for a daily use.</li>
            <li>I just wish that the smell lasted longer than six hours, especially when I work eight hours or more.</li>
            <li>so i wasn&#x27;t using up my HIGHER priced cologne.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as I bought it</li>
            <li>Exactly what i was expecting.</li>
            <li>And came fast!</li>
            <li>I have tried other Nautica perfumes before but this one in particular is not that good.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too strong which is nice, but it also doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>It smells like some kind of cheap incense and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Nautica Classic for Men is a fresh scent and it blends well with the body chemistry</li>
            <li>i got this cologne for my brother and he loves it so much he wears it everyday his girlfriend tried to streal it its really good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for a solid 6-8 hours, but this will obviously not be the case if you perspire a lot or go for a dip in the water.</li>
            <li>To top it off, everything I ate that afternoon tasted like I washed it down with a glass of cool gasoline.</li>
            <li>I bought some cologne and got half  and paid more!.</li>
            <li>I have always received a lot of positive attention while wearing Nautica Clasic, so I am reluctant to switch to something else.  </li>
            <li>Once on Amazon, I noticed that there were several other brands with great reviews,</li>
            <li>So pretty much that&#x27;s what it is to me.</li>
            <li>Lasts for 8 hours easily and smells clean and sharp.</li>
            <li>nothing heavy, love it every morning, works for me, i like clean scents, freshness is all</li>
            <li>The smell can be described as fresh, clean, reminiscent of shower or sail.  </li>
            <li>This has a classic, masculine, light scent.</li>
            <li>Now, it seems that Nautica classic no longer pleasantly lingers into the evening as it once did in the past.</li>
            <li>It has a good, long lasting smell.</li>
            <li>Scent is light, fresh and very cerebral.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was decent enough, padded envelope and the box is pretty straight</li>
            <li>Not too strong, and last for hours after use.</li>
            <li>It certainly smells like it should...</li>
            <li>a knowing how large certain ounce amounts are.</li>
            <li>The prices on certain items on Amazon continue to amaze us.  </li>
            <li>Smart purchase.</li>
            <li>Smells good for the price ;dont last that long as other reviews said; however i am pretty much satisfied..</li>
            <li>This is his second bottle of Nautica, the first one was the blue scent, we really liked that as well.</li>
            <li>I purchased it for a gift because its very reasonably priced, my family members have used it and highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>Always been a Nautica Fan and this classic is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a classic!</li>
            <li>Overall the price was right and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>Good gift for any guy friends that are hard to shop for.</li>
            <li>an everyday cologne for a man, it is hard to beat this combination of a respectable cologne at an even more respectable price.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it and u can&#x27;t beat the price for the size bottle you get.</li>
            <li>The real problem is the cologne itself.  </li>
            <li>I bought this colgone for my husband and he really loves it.</li>
            <li>It is reasonable for its price.</li>
            <li>and I was very apply with this purchase</li>
            <li>Thanks oxkom and Amazon</li>
            <li>Quality was better than i expected since alot of reviews said theirs smelled like alcohol</li>
            <li>I bought this because I had once owned a type of Nautica cologne before, this was not it, but I do really like the smell of this as well.</li>
            <li>I got it for my husband for Christmas and he really like it.</li>
            <li>I think i will be buying this again very soon.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;Smells very well,</li>
            <li>The REAL product lasts all day and then some.</li>
            <li>However, it does smell like the real thing.</li>
            <li>Its cost is very high.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>The quality was more than expected.</li>
            <li>thanks amazon</li>
            <li>I really like Nautica but not this one</li>
            <li>My father is a very picky person .</li>
            <li>Thanks anyway.</li>
            <li>going very well alone</li>
            <li>Husband really likes this scent.  </li>
            <li>I but this for a friend and he really like it</li>
            <li>Seems to like it almost as much.</li>
            <li>The presentation is a very practical size for charging.</li>
            <li>I bought for my husband since very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I keep it in my gym bag and just a touch up after the showers and I am ready for a night out in town.</li>
            <li>Ordered this as a replacement for my empty bottle :)</li>
            <li>It came fast.</li>
            <li>When I went to the mailbox my whole mailbox box like cologne.  </li>
            <li>but for the price ($12) can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>shipped fast and was packaged well</li>
            <li>I have known of this colon for years and the smell is fresh and masculine.</li>
            <li>but I got it at very cheaper price so cant complain.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s cheap enough to wear every day.</li>
            <li>Did not smell like the real thing</li>
            <li>really like the bottle design.</li>
            <li>This really meets my requirement.</li>
            <li>and no matter how much you put it</li>
            <li>He absolute loves it.  </li>
            <li>thanks, every things it&#x27;s excellent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li>I wonder if it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>gift for my son&#x27;s 47th Birthday, and yes I might purchase it again, the cost was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s fresh, yet with a sober scent to it.</li>
            <li>It has too much alcohol in</li>
            <li>fast shipping and quality product.</li>
            <li>And the product price is very affordable.</li>
            <li>But the biggest critic has weighed in and she (My wife) really loves the sent.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>the real deal.</li>
            <li>and my wife loves it just as much.</li>
            <li>Thanks oxkom and Amazon</li>
            <li>Reasonable quality while affordable.</li>
            <li>It seems to have natural scent similar to that of body wash l which for me feel refreshing.</li>
            <li>3.4 oz is a pretty big bottle, not bad for what I paid for it ($12) which is a crazyyy deal.</li>
            <li>real nice cologne that you can sport when in jeans and T-shirt for a cook-out, or even when you sporting a casual suit to a concert.</li>
            <li>Nautica Classic has a fresh smell to it, a little soapy at first, but then fades out clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I bought one for my little brother and He is happy because this lotion is fresh and sport for active men.</li>
            <li>Of course, opinions differ greatly on scent, due to personal taste and how a perfume blends with the body&#x27;s natural chemistry.  </li>
            <li>the fragnance is strong just the way i like it, but doesn&#x27;t stay for long...</li>
            <li>Not too strong and lasts long.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong but lasts long.</li>
            <li>Husband loved it though I found the fragrance similar to any other Men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing John Varvatos for some time and decided to make a purchase via Amazon as the prices are much better than in Sephora and other stores.  </li>
            <li>After a while wanted something different but familiar.</li>
            <li>Neither he nor I were familiar with this fragrance prior to my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I remember when i was younger i always thought it was nautica original that smelt bomb.</li>
            <li>It is not an original product, the fragrance does not last</li>
            <li>just out of the shower clean smell to the next level.</li>
            <li>Simple and clean.</li>
            <li>The CLASSIC (this one) smelled very chemical-like and not at all what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>Good rapid and serious</li>
            <li>although this smells amazing it does not last very long 1-2 hours max</li>
            <li>not only did it arrive super fast, but the box it came in was official.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommended for those looking for a classic, clean scent.</li>
            <li>prefer this for daytime wear (work typically) and is a masculine scent that possesses a blend of lemon, sage, rose and jasmine accompanied by moss and sandalwood.  </li>
            <li>not only did it arrive super fast, but the box it came in was official.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The fragrance is not over-powering and doesn&#x27;t carry too long given a light usage.  </li>
            <li>It smells good enough, but it only lasts for a short while.  </li>
            <li>not the greatest by very watered down scent goes away after 5 minutes have to really put on a lot to get it this last for a few minutes</li>
            <li>great gift for a teenager as it&#x27;s not cheap, but not terribly high priced.</li>
            <li>If you are short on cash but want a cologne that won&#x27;t smell like pure junk, this may be worth looking at.</li>
            <li>It was a gift for someone and they live it!</li>
            <li>It is okay if you only need to small nice for a short time.</li>
            <li>most is that its price and shipping and handling all together was less than what I saw at the store.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better price either, way less than retail.</li>
            <li>More like half a day,</li>
            <li>If you are looking for the Classic, go elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Nautica Classic being one of them.  </li>
            <li>IMO that one&#x27;s a classic &amp;</li>
            <li>However, the classic looking bottle is one of my all time favorites.</li>
            <li>Classic scent at an unbeatable price point.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic ad a deal</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll wear a particular calogne depending on how I feel that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nautica Classic for Men by Nautica  </li>
            <li>the scent is classic</li>
            <li>NAUTICA CLASSIC FOR MEN BY NAUTICA 3.4 OZ  </li>
            <li>scent that lasts for a decent period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always like this classic sent on my husband.</li>
            <li>The Nautica Classic smells like it should.</li>
            <li>It sprays so your hands stay free of it and use very little so last a good long while</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>also i would say the recommended age for this is  High</li>
            <li>high quality product nominate everyone to use.</li>
            <li>I bought this item for him as I find that Nautica makes high quality products.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this men&#x27;s fragrance...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for fight-free family..</li>
            <li>high quality</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I highly recommend for anybody who even came across this cologne to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting this if your a guy.</li>
            <li>Subtle and very refreshing.</li>
            <li>better cologne fragrances out there but just needed a little something rather than nothing</li>
            <li>this smell soft and gentle.</li>
            <li>It is a very youthful scent, I recommend it for young man.</li>
            <li>Its soft but very manly.</li>
            <li>Great cologne, don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li>Love the smell, although it doesn&#x27;t last that long at all.</li>
            <li>I normally use the Voyage, but decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>But no, this smells more like a heavy, pungent, smack you in the face smell.</li>
            <li>Got a few family guy members they think it ok</li>
            <li>It smells nice but only lasts less than a hour.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to be able to buy such a large bottle for such a little cost!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an old scent, goes all the way back to 1992 (again along the lines of CK Eternity which is still a classic and rarely goes on sale)</li>
            <li>the packaging was very large, I would like the package to be smaller</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t​ believe it is oil based, so it probably won&#x27;t last you ALL DAY, but it does stick to clothing very well and can last a full work day or night out.</li>
            <li>an old favorite , long lasting</li>
            <li>The smell is nice but it does not last long enough.</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim, because it was inexpensive and I was looking for a new cologne.</li>
            <li>New in box</li>
            <li>no nothing as we say in New York.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found the same product cheap in a different store</li>
            <li>I have big hands and it required both hands to properly hold and feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>My authentic one could last for a day on clothes or skin but this certainly not.</li>
            <li>This a very mature scent, probably something a teenager or clubber type would be put off by.</li>
            <li>Same exact smell from the 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>In all honesty it&#x27;s not terrible but it&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m usually looking to go with.</li>
            <li>My teenage son&#x27;s first cologne.  </li>
            <li>This was my first cologne when I was younger.  </li>
            <li>if u put it on ur hoodie the next day u really don&#x27;t need to spray anymore because it&#x27;s still there!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Its totally unique to other cologne I have every smelled.</li>
            <li>When I received it, it was sealed in the original box and packaged in a larger size box with a larger type of bubble wrap around to protect it.</li>
            <li>Same exact smell from the 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Was at a hotel lobby around thanksgiving and a stranger walked past smelling sexy, I had to ask what colone he had on.  </li>
            <li>Empty or full, one of the two, depends on who is doing the throwing.</li>
            <li>It is large, so a normal sized human like me cannot hold it in one hand.</li>
            <li>I had Nautica Blue for awhile, but I think I like the Classic a little better.  </li>
            <li>Cheap but seems to last a long time,</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, smells as expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten lots of EXTREMELY positive compliments over the Blue</li>
            <li>; is becoming more difficult to find in local markets.</li>
            <li>but the 3.4 oz actually is quite large (the $40-$50 one at stores).</li>
            <li>Either Nautica changed their formula a little bit or this company is selling cheap look-a-likes (</li>
            <li>Long lasting, clean smell....</li>
            <li>Hard to find, as it&#x27;s being phased out in most retail shops, unless you can find it at one of the TJX discount stores.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to find sometimes, much better price.</li>
            <li>but i clearly selected it was a gift and was expecting the note to be printed as it said</li>
            <li>my friend has the same one but his is smaller and really the scent is a lot stronger with the real one</li>
            <li>smells just like the old nautica</li>
            <li>early 2000&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Ever since I bought this cologne my life has changed completely.</li>
            <li>5 minutess after u spray it ,tha smell is completely gone.</li>
            <li>My husband loves cologne and this is an old standby.</li>
            <li>nearly 2 decades&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I used it  frequently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this about five times so far and will probly continue to re purchase.</li>
            <li>Never gets old.</li>
            <li>This one is one that can be found at retail for considerably more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product help for complete anything.</li>
            <li>Classy.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 15 year old nephew.</li>
            <li>THE PERFUM IS TO SOFT.</li>
            <li>Out of 3 this was his least favorite.</li>
            <li>This really DOES smell like the fresh, open waters of the sea (minus all the fishy smells and sea dung)</li>
            <li>Product is completely underwhelming.  </li>
            <li>cologne scent doesn&#x27;t last very long&lt;</li>
            <li>wow.  </li>
            <li>because i know the scent should last more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li>GOOD FAKE FRAGANCE</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t like having to type more than i want to, so please remove that requirement very soon as its irritating.</li>
            <li>Nice look, but poor fragrance.</li>
            <li>The shipping was good, arrived on time as expected, but the bottle of water (i mean perfume as claimed by amazon) does not have any smell.</li>
            <li>thing is it does not last that long, but based on the price, it is worthy.</li>
            <li>and I only paid a very small price for this bottle, but it is for sure not the real product.</li>
            <li>The other Nautica brand (blue in color) have better milder fragrance for daily wear.  </li>
            <li>The scent is still a very subtle oceanic and people comment on how nice I smell when they give me a hug early in the night.</li>
            <li>if your younger than a freshmen in high school your to young to be spending money on cologne anyway.</li>
            <li>The cologne is not unique nor special.</li>
            <li>Too subtle for summer/hot days and wanes off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even find this particular scent in the larger size in the stores!</li>
            <li>Nautica CLASSIC &#x3D; GROSS!</li>
            <li>i mean the scent is a sorta fresh man scent like what a guy wud weat to his first date....</li>
            <li>i am sorry i didnt buy 2.came packaged nicely box was new</li>
            <li>Huge bottle for a small price.</li>
            <li>These days, however, I have to really DOUSE my body in this stuff to maintain any long term effect.</li>
            <li>A light fragance that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>but I got exactly what I expected from the add in your store.</li>
            <li>Use It everyday for work, just cool.</li>
            <li>The smell don&#x27;t last.. if the perfume is original Nautica must have been turn down the quality..</li>
            <li>have ordered this from Amazon to check how amazon is able to sell this in less than 60% price compared to any other site.</li>
            <li>but I really think that it might be watered down because the smell does not last more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>But this product is great,My wife love&#x27;s it scent as well as a few other young ladies.</li>
            <li>Packaging was protective and the actual package it came in was also sealed and in new condition.</li>
            <li>The only way this stuff will last is if you spray so much you stain your shirt with it.</li>
            <li>The scent is pretty long lasting as well!</li>
            <li>EXACTLY what I expected!</li>
            <li>No sure where it bought it originally.  </li>
            <li>Its not expensive like other brands.</li>
            <li>Discovered Amazon and found prices to be as much as 90% below retail outlets for scents that are either a few years old or relatively new.  </li>
            <li>clean, not sure how else to describe it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m fairly certain it smells how it smells for a reason after careful research, trial &amp; error, &amp; hours of marketing research.</li>
            <li>The smell when first applied it weird, after about 5 minutes it does smell like the original, however, the smell is COMPLETELY gone within 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Nautica Classic (this scent) when I ran out of the Nautica Blue that I ordered a while back.  </li>
            <li>This is a LARGE bottle that will last a long time.</li>
            <li>id wear for a date or a special occasion, though it&#x27;s definitely something I&#x27;d wear for an everyday activity.</li>
            <li>On the other hand... All the positive attention I get from women may have nothing to do with it at all.  </li>
            <li>I generally order it during deal  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s close, but it really doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>When he opened I was surprised how big it was for some reason</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve received several compliments so far.</li>
            <li>The scent is barely noticeable and goes away in 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li>I used to use this when I was a young stud!Great smell brings me back.....</li>
            <li>...could barely smell it .. no exaggeration.</li>
            <li>If applied a little more heavily, this one can be worn in almost all seasons except maybe winter.</li>
            <li>If applied a little more heavily, this one can be worn in almost all seasons except maybe winter.</li>
            <li>If applied a little more heavily, this one can be worn in almost all seasons except maybe winter.</li>
            <li>Nautica is very much a classic of men&#x27;s colognes, widely regarded as attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>people have complained about the smell, saying it is unoriginal and a waste of glass and alcohol, i think it smells great.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s been sitting around to long as it smells like its old.</li>
            <li>That means not long, because it gets thrown away.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been looking for it for a long time and was surprised i found it.</li>
            <li>This is pretty much my go to, everyday spray.  </li>
            <li>Smells cheap, not pleasant.</li>
            <li>Some have complained that the scent wears off quickly.</li>
            <li>I definitely think it&#x27;s worth the money if not more.</li>
            <li>Not very long lasting</li>
            <li>Scent and i was skeptical at first compared to other 3.4oz bottles i&#x27;ve seen this one is HUGE</li>
            <li>Again, most of this perfums is not original, last time to order this staff, a least I can use as alcohol.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this product would seem not original, because the smell tends to fade fast, I&#x27;ve tried several people in the household and it&#x27;s the same thoughts about Alcohol</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am suspicious about the reviewers because almost everyone said it is fresh and smells really good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like getting it for FREE!</li>
            <li> Not at all satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I do have to say that the scent was however quite refreshing.</li>
            <li> This is one of the parfum more cheaper of the Amazon Store.</li>
            <li> Love when my husband wears this.</li>
            <li> i am not a strict person about perfumes and i even think that the cheaper adidas perfume is much better than this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure he will though.</li>
            <li> It smells great, but it wears off too fast.</li>
            <li> Nautica Voyage is better but thats why it costs more</li>
            <li> Probably using it as air freshener &#x3D;)))</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> the fact that I cannot return the product makes me even more upset.</li>
            <li> I got it for a gift for my boyfriend for Valentines day, and hopefully he will like it &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I find it excellent for a daily use product at this price</li>
            <li> it is much better than a deodrant.</li>

            <li> IT&#x27;S OKAY</li>
            <li> husband really likes this, great scent</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok to start off</li>
            <li> I say more?  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this brand of cologne for years, love the fresh shower clean scent.</li>
            <li> I love this items fresh and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s original and it is surely genuine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s original and it is surely genuine.</li>
            <li> The price is too good to be true because the cologne doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour.</li>
            <li> Amazing price for a classic cologne, can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Have purchased more since first purchase.</li>
            <li> Very sexy and masculine.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift they love it, thanks!</li>
            <li> Packing and bottle was original, but cologne was just an liquid with a bit fragrance.</li>
            <li> Original one which i got it from store stays 6-8 hours.</li>
            <li> It came in the original box.</li>
            <li> The original Nautica is a bit stronger.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find this as I believe it&#x27;s no longer in production.</li>
            <li> bueno el producto 100% original</li>
            <li> So as long as this is NOT your \\&quot;GO TO\\&quot; cologne for nights out and/or dates,then it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Musky and rich.</li>
            <li> Just like the original</li>
            <li> The sillage is minimal to fair, but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Well priced, clean, brisk fragrance which I had purchased as a gift--</li>
            <li> There is a reason why this cologne is so cheap, its because it does not smell good and does not last.</li>
            <li> It has a clean aroma and does not overpower.</li>
            <li> Not too overpowering but just a clean smell.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this colonge not to strong and smells fresh</li>
            <li> The aroma is not too strong and gives off just the right amount.</li>
            <li> Now i wouldn&#x27;t use this for a special occasion, i would use this if i needed to run an errand</li>
            <li> Price right also!</li>
            <li> , it is a clean and nice masculine scent, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering it&#x27;s a clean light fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Very large bottle, very clean, fresh, scent.  </li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my father who had recently bought another scent that seemed to be a good deal, but when it came it was just a sample size tube.</li>
            <li> It comes in a cool looking bottle too.</li>
            <li> Gave it 5 stars for complements and a nice classy scent.</li>
            <li> Smells good , but smell does not last.</li>
            <li> and i was convinced it was good enough.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of cool summer nights.</li>
            <li> Love it and highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the product, fast delivered.</li>
            <li> My son loved his Christmas present!!</li>
            <li> For the price that I paid, it was obvious it wasn&#x27;t going to be a good smell.</li>
            <li> Full my expectatativas with respect to the product.</li>
            <li> I really like Drakkar, significantly better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from the scent, I love the design of the bottle - reminds me of modern architecture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good smell, but does not last at all.</li>
            <li> and i was convinced it was good enough.  </li>
            <li> used to wear this back in the day and loved it.</li>
            <li> It is fruity some say to sweet</li>
            <li> and I feel cool as the breeze.</li>
            <li> Good, however does not last.  </li>
            <li> this nautica Eau de toilette is a good choice for a travel fragancy with low price, I completly recommend it.</li>
            <li> too.would definitely recommend  good value for money.</li>
            <li> It comes in a cool looking bottle too.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Not bad but would recommend Voyage instead.</li>
            <li> For the price, not bad.</li>
            <li> This is a mild fragrance and is a good one for the regular use.&lt;br /&gt;I used 1 bottle and hence reordered.</li>
            <li> I mean I think its a great deal for that price!</li>
            <li> I had originally gotten one of this by my aunt as a christmas present, and then I decided to buy another one - Extremely pleased :)</li>
            <li> And I have a pretty strong sense of smell</li>
            <li> The BLUE variety smelled fresh and clean, and my wife and I loved it.  </li>
            <li> Changed and started using other colonies like Happy for Men.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, this cologne would smell really great</li>
            <li> Clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Nautica cologne has a clean, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> Clean, fresh scent, discount price.</li>
            <li> clean, and fresh scent, and draws compliments from people in the office.  </li>
            <li> This smells so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Inexpensive and has a fresh, clean smell.</li>
            <li> but I pull it off nicely clean out the shower fresh t-shirt couple of sprays</li>
            <li> It has a clean and fresh scent about it that lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> be back more often :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always enjoyed that smell of Nautica&#x27;s first crisp burst out the bottle, landing onto my skin.</li>
            <li> It is a good one (considering the price), can be worn daily and has a fresh scent to it.</li>
            <li> I ordered it for Christmas and it came quickly.</li>
            <li> IT EVAPORATES TO QUICK</li>
            <li> he loves its mild  fragrance .</li>
            <li> but it wears off quickly.  </li>
            <li> Love Nautica Classic for Men</li>
            <li> and i needed to quickly freshen up.</li>
            <li> So daily morning when he starts off to office i don&#x27;t feel like fighting with a man wearing such a manly cologne...and the best part is..</li>
            <li> It is so mild that it is equivalent to 10 ml of perfume with 90 ml of water.</li>
            <li> Worthy of my selection.</li>
            <li> but it does wear off quickly.</li>
            <li> Cologne has a very nice scent and long lasting  I would recommend it to anyone plus its at an amazing price</li>
            <li> This scent is clean and refreshing but also very masculine.</li>
            <li> nothing special of course, just smth fresh, it&#x27;s not for going out or smth.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing last about 1-2 hour</li>
            <li> As with most calognes that I do buy, I don&#x27;t normally buy specifically for events or time of the day.  </li>
            <li> excellent water tualet liked my dad is fanatic and is always the same</li>
            <li> its soft and i love the design of the bottle, its unique.</li>
            <li> But the bottle is very pretty.</li>
            <li> A good size bottle that lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> This cologne is perfect for casual outings and every day use (but everyone knows your not supposed to use the same cologne every day lol)</li>
            <li> and there but its cool still worth the money</li>
            <li> Good deal, delivery, it&#x27;s about getting a large bottle of a very solid, familiar scent from years ago.</li>
            <li> however, I am honest and absolutely could not do that to a decent seller.</li>
            <li> Nice, simple and clean perfume.</li>
            <li> such a classic scent and for a great price</li>
            <li> however, I am honest and absolutely could not do that to a decent seller.</li>
            <li> This scent has a decent life as well..but smells better on fresh skin than on the clothes.</li>
            <li> This cologne has a pretty good flowery scent, but it&#x27;s not as good as the Nautica Voyage in my Opinon, and it doesn&#x27;t last as long either.</li>
            <li> Even as Nautical introduces new additions to their line, my boys stick with their favorite.  </li>
            <li> This cologne smells so much better than the new line they make.</li>
            <li> I really like the light and fresh, clean scent of this cologne.</li>
            <li> Based on my first and only experience with this seller, I would select it before others listed, and I can in good conscience recommend it to anyone looking for a quality product and prompt service.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to a friend, family member, any guy that wants to smell good, or anyone in general.</li>
            <li> Dily member, any guy that wants to smell good, or anyone in general.</li>
            <li> The cologne smells pretty good, I&#x27;ll use it occasionally for work.</li>
            <li> After using it, there was a bright light shining down as if the Heavens had opened up and blessed me.</li>
            <li> Awesome cologne, especially given the brand-name, low price and fast shipping with Amazon!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Received this item exactly as described and exceeds expectations!  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s more concentrated than cheaper perfumes, it&#x27;s important to remember that less is more (and the scent lasts longer, as well.)  </li>
            <li> but this type is very good at least for me.</li>
            <li> Classic cool Nautica scent never goes out of style!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping it since it was cheap, and the scent really doesn&#x27;t suit me well anymore anyway.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good-sized bottle of cologne from a designer brand for cheap.</li>
            <li> so I buy it on amazon where its cheap and fast ship.</li>
            <li> Great smelling everyday cologne</li>
            <li> great cologne for everyday use.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great without having that &amp;#34;generic cologne base&amp;#34; smell that every low price cologne manufacturer thinks smells masculine.</li>
            <li> Nice box, overall felt this was worth the price</li>
            <li> Worth the money.showered</li>
            <li> The fragrance is fresh and not overpowering as some colognes are.  </li>
            <li> Worth</li>
            <li> DEF WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li> fresh, approachable scent</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> it holds on all day long.i used to get compliments about how nice it smells when I last had this.</li>
            <li> The price was well worth it.</li>
            <li> smells fresh and like out-of-the-shower.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re golden though.</li>
            <li> worth</li>
            <li> the smell is so nice and last longer.</li>
            <li> so i contacted amazon right away &amp; they shipped out another bottle free of charge &amp; told me to dispose of the other bottle or do with it as i pleased!</li>
            <li> i wanted to find the old school nautica and was very excited to find it here</li>
            <li> and it disappears pretty quickly after that.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate that Nautica makes a cologne that is clean, light yet still masculine.  </li>
            <li> This one is right for me.</li>
            <li> The price was right and this is my husband&#x27;s every day fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Throw it on right as you&#x27;re about to go out</li>
            <li> It was the right size and it looked just as how it is shown online.</li>
            <li> so i know this can&#x27;t be right.</li>
            <li> Right?</li>
            <li> The smell is classic and smooth.</li>
            <li> The Fragrance is not bad but it doesn&#x27;t last more than 10 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> Great for pretty much all ages above freshmen year high school ......</li>
            <li> and thats all that really matters right?!??</li>
            <li> I have to go and check in the local stores regarding the smell which is very mild and light.</li>
            <li> i have been using it for the last 6 months and feel this is very soft in terms smell and a good one that could be used for all occasions.</li>
            <li> its ok i m goin to order it more in near future....</li>
            <li> if completely fulfilled my expectations, and I go back to place another order for future purchases with these excellent merchandise</li>
            <li> Worth buying, I like it so much!</li>
            <li> Good delivery with an average product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s salty, light, and very fresh, but isn&#x27;t as sweet or cool as other aquatics.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s salty, light, and very fresh, but isn&#x27;t as sweet or cool as other aquatics.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s salty, light, and very fresh, but isn&#x27;t as sweet or cool as other aquatics.</li>
            <li> I use this cologne when Im on the go and dont want to smell like smoke, pretty cheap and has a decent smell thats not overbearing.</li>
            <li> Large bottle!</li>
            <li> It was the right time when Amazon reached out to when my first bottle was finished.</li>
            <li> The classic has a pleasant, fresh scent, like fresh out of the shower and is not very strong or will it offend others like some cologne&#x27;s do.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the on time delivery, I get to smell great everyday.</li>
            <li> I received the cologne quick and fast.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s disgusting, Lol :D</li>
            <li> My hubby love it, big size fresh and just in time for Father&#x27;s Day</li>
            <li> .....to me it smells more like freshly washed clothes hung outside on a sunny day.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and as described.  </li>
            <li> I really should have bought more bottles, but I was not thinking clearly.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of the cologne, not too strong not too soft.</li>
            <li> In short, Nautica BLUE &#x3D; GREAT....</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the beautiful container, but the smell doesn&#x27;t stay very long, only like one or two days...</li>
            <li> i RECOMMENDED IT VERY MUCH</li>
            <li> Thank you very much</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and the item that came to me was not the true Nautica Classic.</li>
            <li> Nautica Classic for Men by Nautica 3.4 oz 100ml EDT Spray  not a bad</li>
            <li> Came in fast and is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> It is a clean, fresh, smell that is masculine.  </li>
            <li> most likely wont buy again</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable, the package wrapped well for protection &amp; and service was prompt!</li>
            <li> one to shop online at all, first experience with amazon</li>
            <li> My first perfume purchase with Amazon</li>
            <li> Exactly what he wanted.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what you would buy in the stores for 1/3 of the price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering, nor is it the first thing you&#x27;ll notice when a man walks into a room.  </li>
            <li> I have a friend that&#x27;s a girl that just happens to absolutely love the Nautica Blue cologne</li>
            <li> I have a friend that&#x27;s a girl that just happens to absolutely love the Nautica Blue cologne</li>
            <li> Very pissed with my order!</li>
            <li> ok smell but not lasting</li>
            <li> He likes this frange, was our first time.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not expensive</li>
            <li> Long lasting, quality bottle with a great presentation. .</li>
            <li> It stays on all day, and everyone I know smells me and they keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li> the bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li> I decided to go for this fragance as a gift, it arrived on time, the perfume was exactly what i was expecting.</li>
            <li> At first it&#x27;ll be &amp;#34;sweet,&amp;#34; somewhat unisex, once it settles</li>
            <li> Girlfriend can&#x27;t get enough :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be certain that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Nautica or not, but the price is right.</li>
            <li> Masculine, but light.</li>
            <li> lovely scents which last all day</li>
            <li> I got it on sale and it was a really deal!</li>
            <li> My wife and I could not believe the price of this product, we have seen this same product in stores for $20 more.</li>
            <li> Love the scent,but it does not last all day.</li>
            <li> Normally use Tommy, Cool Water, etc.  </li>
            <li> This is bit stronger and a routine fragrance that will make others aware that you are wearing something stronger.</li>
            <li> was wondering how amazon is able to sell 100 ml bottle lesser than the price of 50 ml bottle ....  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is just enough and he was very pleased with it and will enjoy using it for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Well, pretty content with purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> The product was just as we expected and we liked to use it.</li>
            <li> Plus you really get a bang for your buck with a price like this!</li>
            <li> This is a close second to my favorite, PURO PURO CAFE.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is more for a daily use.</li>
            <li> I just wish that the smell lasted longer than six hours, especially when I work eight hours or more.</li>
            <li> so i wasn&#x27;t using up my HIGHER priced cologne.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as I bought it</li>
            <li> Exactly what i was expecting.</li>
            <li> And came fast!</li>
            <li> I have tried other Nautica perfumes before but this one in particular is not that good.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too strong which is nice, but it also doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> It smells like some kind of cheap incense and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Nautica Classic for Men is a fresh scent and it blends well with the body chemistry</li>
            <li> i got this cologne for my brother and he loves it so much he wears it everyday his girlfriend tried to streal it its really good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for a solid 6-8 hours, but this will obviously not be the case if you perspire a lot or go for a dip in the water.</li>
            <li> To top it off, everything I ate that afternoon tasted like I washed it down with a glass of cool gasoline.</li>
            <li> I bought some cologne and got half  and paid more!.</li>
            <li> I have always received a lot of positive attention while wearing Nautica Clasic, so I am reluctant to switch to something else.  </li>
            <li> Once on Amazon, I noticed that there were several other brands with great reviews,</li>
            <li> So pretty much that&#x27;s what it is to me.</li>
            <li> Lasts for 8 hours easily and smells clean and sharp.</li>
            <li> nothing heavy, love it every morning, works for me, i like clean scents, freshness is all</li>
            <li> The smell can be described as fresh, clean, reminiscent of shower or sail.  </li>
            <li> This has a classic, masculine, light scent.</li>
            <li> Now, it seems that Nautica classic no longer pleasantly lingers into the evening as it once did in the past.</li>
            <li> It has a good, long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> Scent is light, fresh and very cerebral.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was decent enough, padded envelope and the box is pretty straight</li>
            <li> Not too strong, and last for hours after use.</li>
            <li> It certainly smells like it should...</li>
            <li> a knowing how large certain ounce amounts are.</li>
            <li> The prices on certain items on Amazon continue to amaze us.  </li>
            <li> Smart purchase.</li>
            <li> Smells good for the price ;dont last that long as other reviews said; however i am pretty much satisfied..</li>
            <li> This is his second bottle of Nautica, the first one was the blue scent, we really liked that as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for a gift because its very reasonably priced, my family members have used it and highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> Always been a Nautica Fan and this classic is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a classic!</li>
            <li> Overall the price was right and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Good gift for any guy friends that are hard to shop for.</li>
            <li> an everyday cologne for a man, it is hard to beat this combination of a respectable cologne at an even more respectable price.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it and u can&#x27;t beat the price for the size bottle you get.</li>
            <li> The real problem is the cologne itself.  </li>
            <li> I bought this colgone for my husband and he really loves it.</li>
            <li> It is reasonable for its price.</li>
            <li> and I was very apply with this purchase</li>
            <li> Thanks oxkom and Amazon</li>
            <li> Quality was better than i expected since alot of reviews said theirs smelled like alcohol</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had once owned a type of Nautica cologne before, this was not it, but I do really like the smell of this as well.</li>
            <li> I got it for my husband for Christmas and he really like it.</li>
            <li> I think i will be buying this again very soon.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;Smells very well,</li>
            <li> The REAL product lasts all day and then some.</li>
            <li> However, it does smell like the real thing.</li>
            <li> Its cost is very high.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is more than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> The quality was more than expected.</li>
            <li> thanks amazon</li>
            <li> I really like Nautica but not this one</li>
            <li> My father is a very picky person .</li>
            <li> Thanks anyway.</li>
            <li> going very well alone</li>
            <li> Husband really likes this scent.  </li>
            <li> I but this for a friend and he really like it</li>
            <li> Seems to like it almost as much.</li>
            <li> The presentation is a very practical size for charging.</li>
            <li> I bought for my husband since very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I keep it in my gym bag and just a touch up after the showers and I am ready for a night out in town.</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a replacement for my empty bottle :)</li>
            <li> It came fast.</li>
            <li> When I went to the mailbox my whole mailbox box like cologne.  </li>
            <li> but for the price ($12) can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> shipped fast and was packaged well</li>
            <li> I have known of this colon for years and the smell is fresh and masculine.</li>
            <li> but I got it at very cheaper price so cant complain.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s cheap enough to wear every day.</li>
            <li> Did not smell like the real thing</li>
            <li> really like the bottle design.</li>
            <li> This really meets my requirement.</li>
            <li> and no matter how much you put it</li>
            <li> He absolute loves it.  </li>
            <li> thanks, every things it&#x27;s excellent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li> I wonder if it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> gift for my son&#x27;s 47th Birthday, and yes I might purchase it again, the cost was reasonable.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s fresh, yet with a sober scent to it.</li>
            <li> It has too much alcohol in</li>
            <li> fast shipping and quality product.</li>
            <li> And the product price is very affordable.</li>
            <li> But the biggest critic has weighed in and she (My wife) really loves the sent.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> the real deal.</li>
            <li> and my wife loves it just as much.</li>
            <li> Thanks oxkom and Amazon</li>
            <li> Reasonable quality while affordable.</li>
            <li> It seems to have natural scent similar to that of body wash l which for me feel refreshing.</li>
            <li> 3.4 oz is a pretty big bottle, not bad for what I paid for it ($12) which is a crazyyy deal.</li>
            <li> real nice cologne that you can sport when in jeans and T-shirt for a cook-out, or even when you sporting a casual suit to a concert.</li>
            <li> Nautica Classic has a fresh smell to it, a little soapy at first, but then fades out clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I bought one for my little brother and He is happy because this lotion is fresh and sport for active men.</li>
            <li> Of course, opinions differ greatly on scent, due to personal taste and how a perfume blends with the body&#x27;s natural chemistry.  </li>
            <li> the fragnance is strong just the way i like it, but doesn&#x27;t stay for long...</li>
            <li> Not too strong and lasts long.</li>
            <li> It is not too strong but lasts long.</li>
            <li> Husband loved it though I found the fragrance similar to any other Men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing John Varvatos for some time and decided to make a purchase via Amazon as the prices are much better than in Sephora and other stores.  </li>
            <li> After a while wanted something different but familiar.</li>
            <li> Neither he nor I were familiar with this fragrance prior to my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I remember when i was younger i always thought it was nautica original that smelt bomb.</li>
            <li> It is not an original product, the fragrance does not last</li>
            <li> just out of the shower clean smell to the next level.</li>
            <li> Simple and clean.</li>
            <li> The CLASSIC (this one) smelled very chemical-like and not at all what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> Good rapid and serious</li>
            <li> although this smells amazing it does not last very long 1-2 hours max</li>
            <li> not only did it arrive super fast, but the box it came in was official.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommended for those looking for a classic, clean scent.</li>
            <li> prefer this for daytime wear (work typically) and is a masculine scent that possesses a blend of lemon, sage, rose and jasmine accompanied by moss and sandalwood.  </li>
            <li> not only did it arrive super fast, but the box it came in was official.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The fragrance is not over-powering and doesn&#x27;t carry too long given a light usage.  </li>
            <li> It smells good enough, but it only lasts for a short while.  </li>
            <li> not the greatest by very watered down scent goes away after 5 minutes have to really put on a lot to get it this last for a few minutes</li>
            <li> great gift for a teenager as it&#x27;s not cheap, but not terribly high priced.</li>
            <li> If you are short on cash but want a cologne that won&#x27;t smell like pure junk, this may be worth looking at.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for someone and they live it!</li>
            <li> It is okay if you only need to small nice for a short time.</li>
            <li> most is that its price and shipping and handling all together was less than what I saw at the store.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better price either, way less than retail.</li>
            <li> More like half a day,</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the Classic, go elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Nautica Classic being one of them.  </li>
            <li> IMO that one&#x27;s a classic &amp;</li>
            <li> However, the classic looking bottle is one of my all time favorites.</li>
            <li> Classic scent at an unbeatable price point.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classic ad a deal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll wear a particular calogne depending on how I feel that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nautica Classic for Men by Nautica  </li>
            <li> the scent is classic</li>
            <li> NAUTICA CLASSIC FOR MEN BY NAUTICA 3.4 OZ  </li>
            <li> scent that lasts for a decent period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always like this classic sent on my husband.</li>
            <li> The Nautica Classic smells like it should.</li>
            <li> It sprays so your hands stay free of it and use very little so last a good long while</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> also i would say the recommended age for this is  High</li>
            <li> high quality product nominate everyone to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for him as I find that Nautica makes high quality products.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this men&#x27;s fragrance...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for fight-free family..</li>
            <li> high quality</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I highly recommend for anybody who even came across this cologne to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting this if your a guy.</li>
            <li> Subtle and very refreshing.</li>
            <li> better cologne fragrances out there but just needed a little something rather than nothing</li>
            <li> this smell soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> It is a very youthful scent, I recommend it for young man.</li>
            <li> Its soft but very manly.</li>
            <li> Great cologne, don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> Love the smell, although it doesn&#x27;t last that long at all.</li>
            <li> I normally use the Voyage, but decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> But no, this smells more like a heavy, pungent, smack you in the face smell.</li>
            <li> Got a few family guy members they think it ok</li>
            <li> It smells nice but only lasts less than a hour.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to buy such a large bottle for such a little cost!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an old scent, goes all the way back to 1992 (again along the lines of CK Eternity which is still a classic and rarely goes on sale)</li>
            <li> the packaging was very large, I would like the package to be smaller</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t​ believe it is oil based, so it probably won&#x27;t last you ALL DAY, but it does stick to clothing very well and can last a full work day or night out.</li>
            <li> an old favorite , long lasting</li>
            <li> The smell is nice but it does not last long enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, because it was inexpensive and I was looking for a new cologne.</li>
            <li> New in box</li>
            <li> no nothing as we say in New York.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found the same product cheap in a different store</li>
            <li> I have big hands and it required both hands to properly hold and feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> My authentic one could last for a day on clothes or skin but this certainly not.</li>
            <li> This a very mature scent, probably something a teenager or clubber type would be put off by.</li>
            <li> Same exact smell from the 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> In all honesty it&#x27;s not terrible but it&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m usually looking to go with.</li>
            <li> My teenage son&#x27;s first cologne.  </li>
            <li> This was my first cologne when I was younger.  </li>
            <li> if u put it on ur hoodie the next day u really don&#x27;t need to spray anymore because it&#x27;s still there!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Its totally unique to other cologne I have every smelled.</li>
            <li> When I received it, it was sealed in the original box and packaged in a larger size box with a larger type of bubble wrap around to protect it.</li>
            <li> Same exact smell from the 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Was at a hotel lobby around thanksgiving and a stranger walked past smelling sexy, I had to ask what colone he had on.  </li>
            <li> Empty or full, one of the two, depends on who is doing the throwing.</li>
            <li> It is large, so a normal sized human like me cannot hold it in one hand.</li>
            <li> I had Nautica Blue for awhile, but I think I like the Classic a little better.  </li>
            <li> Cheap but seems to last a long time,</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, smells as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten lots of EXTREMELY positive compliments over the Blue</li>
            <li> ; is becoming more difficult to find in local markets.</li>
            <li> but the 3.4 oz actually is quite large (the $40-$50 one at stores).</li>
            <li> Either Nautica changed their formula a little bit or this company is selling cheap look-a-likes (</li>
            <li> Long lasting, clean smell....</li>
            <li> Hard to find, as it&#x27;s being phased out in most retail shops, unless you can find it at one of the TJX discount stores.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find sometimes, much better price.</li>
            <li> but i clearly selected it was a gift and was expecting the note to be printed as it said</li>
            <li> my friend has the same one but his is smaller and really the scent is a lot stronger with the real one</li>
            <li> smells just like the old nautica</li>
            <li> early 2000&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Ever since I bought this cologne my life has changed completely.</li>
            <li> 5 minutess after u spray it ,tha smell is completely gone.</li>
            <li> My husband loves cologne and this is an old standby.</li>
            <li> nearly 2 decades&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I used it  frequently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this about five times so far and will probly continue to re purchase.</li>
            <li> Never gets old.</li>
            <li> This one is one that can be found at retail for considerably more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product help for complete anything.</li>
            <li> Classy.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 15 year old nephew.</li>
            <li> THE PERFUM IS TO SOFT.</li>
            <li> Out of 3 this was his least favorite.</li>
            <li> This really DOES smell like the fresh, open waters of the sea (minus all the fishy smells and sea dung)</li>
            <li> Product is completely underwhelming.  </li>
            <li> cologne scent doesn&#x27;t last very long&lt;</li>
            <li> wow.  </li>
            <li> because i know the scent should last more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> GOOD FAKE FRAGANCE</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like having to type more than i want to, so please remove that requirement very soon as its irritating.</li>
            <li> Nice look, but poor fragrance.</li>
            <li> The shipping was good, arrived on time as expected, but the bottle of water (i mean perfume as claimed by amazon) does not have any smell.</li>
            <li> thing is it does not last that long, but based on the price, it is worthy.</li>
            <li> and I only paid a very small price for this bottle, but it is for sure not the real product.</li>
            <li> The other Nautica brand (blue in color) have better milder fragrance for daily wear.  </li>
            <li> The scent is still a very subtle oceanic and people comment on how nice I smell when they give me a hug early in the night.</li>
            <li> if your younger than a freshmen in high school your to young to be spending money on cologne anyway.</li>
            <li> The cologne is not unique nor special.</li>
            <li> Too subtle for summer/hot days and wanes off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even find this particular scent in the larger size in the stores!</li>
            <li> Nautica CLASSIC &#x3D; GROSS!</li>
            <li> i mean the scent is a sorta fresh man scent like what a guy wud weat to his first date....</li>
            <li> i am sorry i didnt buy 2.came packaged nicely box was new</li>
            <li> Huge bottle for a small price.</li>
            <li> These days, however, I have to really DOUSE my body in this stuff to maintain any long term effect.</li>
            <li> A light fragance that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> but I got exactly what I expected from the add in your store.</li>
            <li> Use It everyday for work, just cool.</li>
            <li> The smell don&#x27;t last.. if the perfume is original Nautica must have been turn down the quality..</li>
            <li> have ordered this from Amazon to check how amazon is able to sell this in less than 60% price compared to any other site.</li>
            <li> but I really think that it might be watered down because the smell does not last more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> But this product is great,My wife love&#x27;s it scent as well as a few other young ladies.</li>
            <li> Packaging was protective and the actual package it came in was also sealed and in new condition.</li>
            <li> The only way this stuff will last is if you spray so much you stain your shirt with it.</li>
            <li> The scent is pretty long lasting as well!</li>
            <li> EXACTLY what I expected!</li>
            <li> No sure where it bought it originally.  </li>
            <li> Its not expensive like other brands.</li>
            <li> Discovered Amazon and found prices to be as much as 90% below retail outlets for scents that are either a few years old or relatively new.  </li>
            <li> clean, not sure how else to describe it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m fairly certain it smells how it smells for a reason after careful research, trial &amp; error, &amp; hours of marketing research.</li>
            <li> The smell when first applied it weird, after about 5 minutes it does smell like the original, however, the smell is COMPLETELY gone within 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Nautica Classic (this scent) when I ran out of the Nautica Blue that I ordered a while back.  </li>
            <li> This is a LARGE bottle that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> id wear for a date or a special occasion, though it&#x27;s definitely something I&#x27;d wear for an everyday activity.</li>
            <li> On the other hand... All the positive attention I get from women may have nothing to do with it at all.  </li>
            <li> I generally order it during deal  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s close, but it really doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> When he opened I was surprised how big it was for some reason</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve received several compliments so far.</li>
            <li> The scent is barely noticeable and goes away in 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li> I used to use this when I was a young stud!Great smell brings me back.....</li>
            <li> ...could barely smell it .. no exaggeration.</li>
            <li> If applied a little more heavily, this one can be worn in almost all seasons except maybe winter.</li>
            <li> If applied a little more heavily, this one can be worn in almost all seasons except maybe winter.</li>
            <li> If applied a little more heavily, this one can be worn in almost all seasons except maybe winter.</li>
            <li> Nautica is very much a classic of men&#x27;s colognes, widely regarded as attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> people have complained about the smell, saying it is unoriginal and a waste of glass and alcohol, i think it smells great.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s been sitting around to long as it smells like its old.</li>
            <li> That means not long, because it gets thrown away.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been looking for it for a long time and was surprised i found it.</li>
            <li> This is pretty much my go to, everyday spray.  </li>
            <li> Smells cheap, not pleasant.</li>
            <li> Some have complained that the scent wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> I definitely think it&#x27;s worth the money if not more.</li>
            <li> Not very long lasting</li>
            <li> Scent and i was skeptical at first compared to other 3.4oz bottles i&#x27;ve seen this one is HUGE</li>
            <li> Again, most of this perfums is not original, last time to order this staff, a least I can use as alcohol.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this product would seem not original, because the smell tends to fade fast, I&#x27;ve tried several people in the household and it&#x27;s the same thoughts about Alcohol</li>
            <li> Smell is not bad, but not good enough.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a good value and works well as an everyday, casual scent...</li>
            <li> Spray on for casual outing but stay on for more hours.</li>
            <li> It lasts alright, not strong, not weak, and overall is alright</li>
            <li> Does not last as long as say Aramis, but only a 3rd of the price.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for active young me..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put some nasty things in my mouth but this mouthwash was easily one of the most offensive tasting of all.</li>
            <li> It does not last long.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s IF the smell lasts long enough.</li>
            <li> And as long as this price stays low, I will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please take note that this is an eau de toilette, not a cologne, so the scent will not last as long as a cologne.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t quite agree with some customers saying it is a long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> I like this long lasting spray...</li>
            <li> it does not last that long.</li>
            <li> it last long i still smelt it in me after 4-5hrs(and</li>
            <li> i can even smell it in the evening (long lasting scent)....</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> Smell does not last long!</li>
            <li> BUT DOES NOT LAST like the other more expensive version I had purchased in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> However it doesn&#x27;t last for very long.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I smell like a toilet when wearing this.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I &#x27;d like or as long as it used to.</li>
            <li> I dont know if the other reviewers are right or not when it comes to whether or not this is the real deal but it works and smells just like the expensive stuff at the store.</li>
            <li> but the box and the bottle looks like a fake and doesn&#x27;t last much!!!</li>
            <li> I like it because it&#x27;s not sweet or too loud.</li>
            <li> Nautica classic is subtle allowing only those close to you to detect the fragrance rather than leaving a cologne trail for 20 minutes after you&#x27;ve left a room.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft and a little citric...</li>
            <li> I bought the lotion came out very poor quality, the scent does not last in the body, as if it were an original product, this product Stand to be overcome or a fabrication of a long time.</li>
            <li> This has been my husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s fragrance of choice for as long as I can recall.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have to wait long for it to be delivered either.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> Holds the scent for a long time.</li>
            <li> Everybody at work likes it, it lasts for a long time</li>
            <li> It lasts long too.</li>
            <li> Its smell is soft and not strong.</li>
            <li> It seems like imitation, because it smell does not last long</li>
            <li> I feel that it has a \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scent that&#x27;s a tad mellow while a tad sharp at the same time.</li>
            <li> and I definitely recommend it to other people .....</li>
            <li> You only spent 10 dollars!</li>
            <li> I use this fragrance daily.&lt;br /&gt;Compared with other fragrances in the same range, is good.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Therefore I can&#x27;t have people thinking ive been drinking, in other words it can easily give off the wrong vibe</li>
            <li> I hope it never runs dry.</li>
            <li> The Nautica Classic, at least to me, DOES in fact remind me of the ocean &amp;/ or sailing.</li>
            <li> We have tried a few different others, but we keep coming back to the Nautica.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite disappointed because the scent is far away from the original one especially in term of long-lasting.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long, just less than an hour</li>
            <li> I will not order more cologne online as I am disappointed in how long this does last.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed by the smell</li>
            <li> and it smells not bad but weird.</li>
            <li> The box was sealed and when I opened it and pumped the spray nozzle a couple of times to charge the line and the fluid just flowed down the sides of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It seems this is watered down quite a bit and the smell dissipates after a short time.</li>
            <li> The bottle shape takes some time to get used to and the scent doesn&#x27;t tend to linger as long as other $50-150 colognes</li>
            <li> It simply is old or a fake, and the scent doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me to get to the elevator.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for something a little stronger and longer lasting.</li>
            <li> Early morning to late afternoon.</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected for this product.</li>
            <li> I expected a lot on this</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not really recommended.</li>
            <li> calification is because the sell went as i expected to be</li>
            <li> The smell lasts only for few minutes</li>
            <li> Basically, the scent is so light/subtle that you WILL become used to it and mentally block it out</li>
            <li> I bought this for Christmas present and one from my son everyday use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moderately flowery nature makes it nearly ambiguous in terms of sexuality, and it has fairly poor longevity, but it&#x27;s uniqueness and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; aroma make up for these shortcomings.</li>

            <li> by the way it takes little long to deliver but</li>
            <li> Trust the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea what these other people are talking about.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not overly sharp.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s my mind playing tricks on me or filling in the blanks due to the Nautica logo</li>
            <li> anniversary along with other gifts.&lt;br /&gt;He</li>
            <li> One way or the other...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that other find it doesn&#x27;t hold, but I&#x27;ve not found that to be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, and I won&#x27;t be trying anymore extreme value colognes.</li>
            <li> I end up resting it on my chest to hold the bottle with one hand, use my chest for support, and squirt using my other hand.&lt;br /&gt;...</li>
            <li> I have no idea what these other people are talking about.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s old or a fake, but it&#x27;s not the same scent (I still have some left in another bottle to compare).  </li>
            <li> Did I receive an imitation cologne?</li>
            <li> i had this cologne years ago and gave it to my little cousin when it was down to its very last few sprays.</li>
            <li> i had this cologne years ago and gave it to my little cousin when it was down to its very last few sprays.  </li>
            <li> i came on here to try to buy it again and after reading the reviews i was scared because i didnt want a fake version or a version that smelled different or didnt last long.</li>
            <li> i was scared because i didnt want a fake version or a version that smelled different or didnt last long.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but Nautica&#x27;s \\&quot;classic\\&quot; cologne does not pleasantly linger on your body as long as it once used to, back in the 1990s/</li>
            <li> I even said some of the other reviewers may have been exaggerating about the this being watered down</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to purchase this cologne due to the price, although, it&#x27;s the real deal.  </li>
            <li> it is really bad and smells like combination of cheap chemicals but not fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is a below average cologne.</li>
            <li> I wear men&#x27;s medium clothing, so I guess I am an average man.</li>
            <li> No a great smell, reminds me of old spice yuk.</li>
            <li> However, this one has been watered down or something....</li>
            <li> I bought it and was hopeful it wouldn&#x27;t be watered down.</li>
            <li> It seems watered down.</li>
            <li> in stronger, I mean that it should last longer.  </li>
            <li> Not real didn&#x27;t like it!!</li>
            <li> Not very strong or overpowering.</li>
            <li> lasts less than an hour...</li>
            <li> But, I was expecting less price.</li>
            <li> Bottle is a tad bit oddly shaped though.</li>
            <li> Bought this one for my sons (3 and 1), used and applied it sometimes and slightly to their cloths.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Water down don&#x27;t even waste your money</li>
            <li> I hate to say it, but once this settles it smells like strong Body Odor.  </li>
            <li> its one of the worst purchase with them&lt;br /&gt;This does not seem to be a genuine product, is heavily diluted, and the fragrance lasts for barely 15 to 30</li>
            <li> not sure what versions the other people were getting</li>
            <li> not sure what versions the other people were getting</li>
            <li> This bottle is going to last a while to say the least!</li>
            <li> I have never used Nautica colognes before and was a little worried about buying this without having any idea of what it would smell like....</li>
            <li> Was a little unsure about this as I had never smelt it before purchasing.</li>
            <li> Smell really cheap and lasts only for a few minutes would not recommend very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but in a few minutes it disappears.</li>
            <li> Ever thought that may be why you &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; you don&#x27;t smell it after a few hours?</li>
            <li> some was missing</li>
            <li> so now I tried to get the green one.  </li>
            <li> Use it everyday to work.</li>
            <li> I placed my order, but I had to leave home for a few months when I get home</li>
            <li> Waste your money on the eau de cologne, or something else.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this for a Christmas present and it arrived broken.</li>
            <li> He makes it a habit to wear this fragrance everyday before school.</li>
            <li> this is the wrong cologn if your under 60 years old</li>
            <li> and you can use it for everyday</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money as I did.</li>
            <li> DONT WASTED YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t smell it after a few hours?</li>
            <li> The bad reviews are right.</li>
            <li> I hate it, it has probably the worst longevity and it has a strong alcohol smell to it which I really don&#x27;t like because I&#x27;m often in a professional environment.</li>
            <li> i tame</li>
            <li> This product is of poor quality, I buy a gift for my husband and not smell anything or is very old and the smell dissipated or is an imitation, so I&#x27;m upset buy two perfumes that are useless</li>
            <li> and it got delivered a little bit late</li>
            <li> This bottle of Nautica Classic for Men by Nautica 3.4 oz is useless with a broken spray nozzle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it, but it has an almost floral scent without smelling like it should be for women.</li>
            <li> i am using this past one month, till now i didnt felt the fragrance.</li>
            <li> My hubby&#x27;s everyday scent !</li>
            <li> I was not sure while ordering this perfume</li>
            <li> I recall coming across it in some random department store one day at a local mall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the deal is</li>
            <li> and I am not sure about the quality.</li>
            <li> This is just green water, that&#x27;s all!</li>
            <li> No more mall shopping for overpriced cologne.</li>
            <li> Not really appropriate for nightlife or dinner gatherings.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this especially with the price.</li>
            <li> This product arrived broken and completely empty</li>
            <li> and i use it just to alternate with at casual uses</li>
            <li> This was less expensive than the other lines</li>
            <li> I always buy this cologne, because it isn&#x27;t too hard on the nose, and lasts for quite a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite hard to describe what this smells like.</li>
            <li> For the price it was hard to beat.  </li>
            <li> I like this sent because I don&#x27;t feel like a &amp;#34;sleezy ball&amp;#34; that is trying to hard</li>
            <li> shape of the bottle is cumbersome and hard to hold but that&#x27;s the least of the problem...</li>
            <li> because I&#x27;m not looking to be that pretentious.</li>
            <li> of knockoffs, some people have complained</li>
            <li> If he sprays it on at eight in the morning then the scent is gone by late afternoon.</li>
            <li> is a late Spring and Summer cologne.</li>
            <li> I mean it literally has a \\&quot;fruity\\&quot; type smell to it &amp;</li>
            <li> However, it did not arrive as it was supposed to due to poor service from Amazon, and NOT the shipping company!</li>
            <li> Smells manly but subtle.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overpowering it is subtle, but it takes that</li>
            <li> The amount you get for the price is also ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It was dramatically less expensive to buy on Amazon than in the store.</li>
            <li> Seriously  You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> It was one added cologne to his collection and for only 11.00... was not that bad</li>
            <li> All the perfumes are fake if they sold at half-price, believe me they are waste of money</li>
            <li> People you are nose blind after smelling it for a few hours.</li>
            <li> After u spray the smell is gone not good stuff</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s fake, it smells when you put a few seconds but does not smell at all.</li>
            <li> NOT A GOOD Perfume.</li>
            <li> Not good as I thought</li>
            <li> IS NOT GOOD.</li>
            <li> People you are nose blind after smelling it for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to write to Amazon about this, but there is NO place I can write this complaint!</li>
            <li> The scent is weak and it reeks of alcohol.</li>
            <li> It is not too bad, thought i would have expected a stronger scent, since it was from Nautica.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be some bootleg bologna product</li>
            <li> Amazon must stop this fake selling on its site and the customers must complaint about this</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be some bootleg bologna product</li>
            <li> in my opinion it is false</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected, I was disappointed with its smell.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very subtle though it projects, a combo that I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what they changed besides coloring, but this green one stinks like $#!</li>
            <li> My wife was shocked because we usually get it around $30 from the store.  </li>
            <li> I cant believe i wasted my money on what appears to be 90% water !!!!</li>
            <li> Useless product..</li>
            <li> The cologne is a fake .</li>
            <li> All the ones I&#x27;ve bought were fake ones.</li>
            <li> It is fake.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually one to never complain about something I bought, but I was disappointed with this cologne.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a FAKE item.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this fragrance.</li>

            <li> casual wear for casual day.</li>
            <li> It has a bit of a dirty smell to it.</li>
            <li> I got it for my dad while he had a cold..</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong?!</li>
            <li> Very forgettable...</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s why there is all these bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Apparently I&#x27;m bad</li>
            <li> bad product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but maybe I got a bad batch?</li>
            <li> I like this stuff regardless of some reviews bad ratings.</li>
            <li> its not that bad but eh.</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s why there is all these bad reviews.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m just so disappointed with this</li>
            <li> and I got disappointed and is not up to the mark.</li>
            <li> disappointed</li>
            <li> The size for the price is what drew me to this option, but ultimately I&#x27;m disappointed in how the fragrance lasts.</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend who is very unhappy with the results.</li>
            <li> all the while cursing the bottle, the designer, the contents, the company, and my stupid decision to purchase this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you hate yourself.</li>
            <li> and I hate to say that</li>
            <li> This stuff is worthless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every morning when I use this bottle I curse the idiot who designed the bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a worthless purchase.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the service and</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the worst cologne that I have used ever.</li>
            <li> I tried it on the moment it got to my house and the smell was terrible.</li>
            <li> , its so disgusting.</li>

            <li> the fragnance is strong just the way i like it, but doesn&#x27;t stay for long... but then u get what u pay for... I would rate it 4 stars for the price it comes for...</li>
            <li> i wanted to find the old school nautica and was very excited to find it here it smells exactly like i remember great product at a good price</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband! I found it way cheaper online then it is in the stores and I am very pleased with the product and he is too!</li>
            <li> More better smelling than I thought- Had used about two years ago</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift about 2 years ago. I hate it, it has probably the worst longevity and it has a strong alcohol smell to it which I really don&#x27;t like because I&#x27;m often in a professional environment. Therefore I can&#x27;t have people thinking ive been drinking, in other words it can easily give off the wrong vibe, that&#x27;s IF the smell lasts long enough.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this! It&#x27;s the cologne my boyfriend has used for a couple of years-he noticed his bottle was very low so I came on Amazon to see about replacing it and it was listed at a great price! I was so excited to be able to buy such a large bottle for such a little cost! It really smells delicious, too.</li>
            <li> My husband loves smelling good and this is just a great scent for any occasion for men. Very pleased with it!</li>
            <li> This product is my husband&#x27;s favorite.  The price was reasonable, the package wrapped well for protection &amp; and service was prompt! Will reorder again when it&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne!! And as long as this price stays low, I will continue to purchase it. A good size bottle that lasts for a long time. Thanks to the on time delivery, I get to smell great everyday.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great without having that &amp;#34;generic cologne base&amp;#34; smell that every low price cologne manufacturer thinks smells masculine. I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it, but it has an almost floral scent without smelling like it should be for women. On my skin, it lasts about 8 hours. The sillage is minimal to fair, but that&#x27;s okay because I&#x27;m not looking to be that pretentious. My girlfriend always tells me how good I smell on days I am wearing this. For the money, you cant lose.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, although it doesn&#x27;t last that long at all. You have to be up close to smell anything.</li>
            <li> i am using this past one month, till now i didnt felt the fragrance. i hope others will feel it. sometimes i assume this is manufactured defect. any way i have move on. so using it</li>
            <li> I am happy with this item. It is very useful and practical. Good quality. I recommend it. Great job. Thank you.</li>
            <li> great size, nice smell</li>
            <li> It kinda smells like detergent...i did not like it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classic , love this cologne!</li>
            <li> Great value! I purchased this for my son for Christmas and it has a really nice scent.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my father who had recently bought another scent that seemed to be a good deal, but when it came it was just a sample size tube. This bottle contains 3.4oz, a generous volume that will last for a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please take note that this is an eau de toilette, not a cologne, so the scent will not last as long as a cologne.  This is not to say that this Nautica E.de T. doesn&#x27;t last, just adjust your expectation to that fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, this is a perfect daytime spray, also good for summer evenings - clean, crisp smell, not musky at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> This has been my husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s fragrance of choice for as long as I can recall.  Even as Nautical introduces new additions to their line, my boys stick with their favorite.  Hard to find, as it&#x27;s being phased out in most retail shops, unless you can find it at one of the TJX discount stores.  This was a great deal.  Hope it&#x27;s availabl again when they need more.</li>
            <li> Water down don&#x27;t even waste your money my friend has the same one but his is smaller and really the scent is a lot stronger with the real one</li>
            <li> Has a good fragrance and doesn&#x27;t bothers people around, because the odor is nice and soft. And best of all is the price, a lot of liquid at a low cost.</li>
            <li> Almost doesnt smell to anything, dont lose your money</li>
            <li> Amazing, can&#x27;t beat the price anywhere else! Have purchased more since first purchase.</li>
            <li> This has got to be colored water with a touch of maybe lemon or well, I don&#x27;t know what it smells like.  The one things I have learned from this experience is never, ever buy anything made by COTY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shape of the bottle is cumbersome and hard to hold but that&#x27;s the least of the problem... The real problem is the cologne itself.  Could it be that it was made in Taiwan or Africa?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t buy it you hate yourself.</li>
            <li> I bought this colgone for my husband and he really loves it.</li>
            <li> The smell is very good, durable and of excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep looking sheltering.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this perfume</li>
            <li> Had a bit of a difference then in the ones we get From the mall...not sure why. Still smells good.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Excellent Fragrance, good deal</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT SERVICE!!!</li>
            <li> this was my dad&#x27;s gift for xmas and he absolutely loved it!!</li>
            <li> excellent product recommend 100%</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for day to day cologne.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt my favorite cologne I have ever had. It&#x27;s smells extremely sexy and gives me the confidence boost I am looking for. It comes in a cool looking bottle too. it&#x27;s very affordable too, the perfect cologne for any man</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas this year. When he opened I was surprised how big it was for some reason lol! I had seen how big my brother&#x27;s bottle was &amp; thought it would be a medium size. To my surprise it was the large bottle &amp; for this price you can&#x27;t beat this anywhere else!!! I am very happy with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> Its smell is soft and not strong. It doesn&#x27;t last long, just less than an hour and I have to spray again. It is reasonable for its price.</li>
            <li> Smells good for the price ;dont last that long as other reviews said; however i am pretty much satisfied..</li>
            <li> Actually it smells like a shampoo.</li>
            <li> It certainly smells like it should...but I really think that it might be watered down because the smell does not last more than a few minutes.  When you first put it on it smells great...but in a few minutes it disappears.</li>
            <li> an old favorite , long lasting</li>
            <li> just like the nautica i bought many years ago. smells just like the old nautica but this time its $10 instead of $80. been wearing this stuff since the 90&#x27;s and still love it.......nice fresh scent that i get compliments on to this day.</li>
            <li> Smell really cheap and lasts only for a few minutes would not recommend very disappointed.  Did not see genuine sticker that would indicate authenticity.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I brought this as a gift for my boyfriend for fathers day and he loves the scent. Its light and refreshing and it smells great on him!</li>
            <li> Good deal, delivery, it&#x27;s about getting a large bottle of a very solid, familiar scent from years ago. Will order again...</li>
            <li> The odor is bit milder that what I was led on to believe. Still like my CK Be and Drakkar Noir better.</li>
            <li> I just bought this and it&#x27;s the worst cologne that I have used ever. The Fragrance is not bad but it doesn&#x27;t last more than 10 minutes or so. Useless product..</li>
            <li> I have tried other Nautica perfumes before but this one in particular is not that good. It smells more like sandal wood.</li>
            <li> Very Satisfied with this product! Didn&#x27;t have to wait long for it to be delivered either.&lt;br /&gt;Great Scent and i was skeptical at first compared to other 3.4oz bottles i&#x27;ve seen this one is HUGE and i LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;bought it as a christmas gift for my cousin and my husband saw it and wanted one too lol&lt;br /&gt;Not one to shop online at all, first experience with amazon and it was great.&lt;br /&gt;will be back more often :)</li>
            <li> Perfect perfume to my BF... He loves it!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s old or a fake, but it&#x27;s not the same scent (I still have some left in another bottle to compare).  It&#x27;s close, but it really doesn&#x27;t last long.  Trust the other reviews.  If you are looking for the Classic, go elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I use, but it smells delicious.</li>
            <li> Smells super great. The girls love it when I wear this. I become a magnet for women.</li>
            <li> Nice box, overall felt this was worth the price and I was very apply with this purchase and I love the smell for my guy..</li>
            <li> Great product. Got it on time!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service this product smells superior.</li>
            <li> Very good product, recommended 100 %.</li>
            <li> looks to be a nockoff</li>
            <li> Excellent seller recommend 100%</li>
            <li> The scent is rather overwhelming and it doesn&#x27;t seem to diminish over time. Think it is a use sparingly kind of thing.</li>
            <li> Great price.... Very clean scent....</li>
            <li> I have had this product before  my wife like the smell of it  so this purchase was a no brainer</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband an he loves it an will continue to buy more from you</li>
            <li> Excellent if you want a cologne that smells for just 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the smell, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The smell is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t quite agree with some customers saying it is a long lasting smell. It is the only thing that I wish to be improved.</li>
            <li> All the perfumes are fake if they sold at half-price, believe me they are waste of money</li>
            <li> Really is a great every day scent!!</li>
            <li> Smells great on my husband . I love my man smelling good in and out of bed. All the time. Get it!.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for several years.  this bottle no different</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD, GET IT SELLS FAST. FRAGRANCE IS A GREAT, LOVED.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband. We both love the fragrance. Very sexy and masculine. We will defiantly get it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad for Christmas and he loved it! What I like about it most is that its price and shipping and handling all together was less than what I saw at the store.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift they love it, thanks!</li>
            <li> Been wearing this for 20 years, always a winner and still get compliments.  Just don&#x27;t tell my wife.</li>
            <li> This cologne is great.  I appreciate that Nautica makes a cologne that is clean, light yet still masculine.  Too many men&#x27;s frangrances are musky, overpowering smells that remind me of my dad&#x27;s medicine cabinet.  Nautica classic is subtle allowing only those close to you to detect the fragrance rather than leaving a cologne trail for 20 minutes after you&#x27;ve left a room.  Overall the price was right and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> This bottle of Nautica Classic for Men by Nautica 3.4 oz is useless with a broken spray nozzle. The box was sealed and when I opened it and pumped the spray nozzle a couple of times to charge the line and the fluid just flowed down the sides of the bottle. The spray nozzle was cracked. Gave it three stars because it is a good cologne. I will find a spray nozzle somewhere to make it work.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Nautica Classic Men&#x27;s Cologne! It is by far my most favorite of all time! Seller was awesome and I received my product in a timely manner!</li>
            <li> came quick and was authentic.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle for a small price. This was a perfect stocking stuffer  for my guys.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.showered and it is still smelling. So mild and girls love it. 100% satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I am a man for good cologne.</li>
            <li> Chicks dig it. Need I say more? One shot to the chest is all you need.</li>
            <li> My hubby&#x27;s everyday scent ! We love it</li>
            <li> Love the sent and do do others who smell it.</li>
            <li> Product came as expected and was a great deal!! Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but Nautica&#x27;s \\&quot;classic\\&quot; cologne does not pleasantly linger on your body as long as it once used to, back in the 1990s/early 2000&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve always enjoyed that smell of Nautica&#x27;s first crisp burst out the bottle, landing onto my skin. These days, however, I have to really DOUSE my body in this stuff to maintain any long term effect. The scent is still a very subtle oceanic and people comment on how nice I smell when they give me a hug early in the night. Now, it seems that Nautica classic no longer pleasantly lingers into the evening as it once did in the past. Anyone else? Either Nautica changed their formula a little bit or this company is selling cheap look-a-likes (which I can not prove and doubt to be the case).</li>
            <li> My first perfume purchase with Amazon and I hate to say that its one of the worst purchase with them&lt;br /&gt;This does not seem to be a genuine product, is heavily diluted, and the fragrance lasts for barely 15 to 30 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if Amazon verfies the authenticity of the suppliers that they deal with. Customers buy products based on the confidence that they repose with Amazon and I have to admit that I am dissappointed.</li>
            <li> very good product is just what I expected for the price we paid, satisfied with the purchase, and would recommend to buy!</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband this Christmas. The cologne has a very light and clean scent. It is one of my husbands favorites! Great price as well!</li>
            <li> I have no idea what these other people are talking about. I got mine from oxkom and fulfilled by amazon. I was expecting it to be some bootleg bologna product but figured I&#x27;d risk it for 12 bucks. Glad I did. Same exact smell from the 90&#x27;s. I almost didn&#x27;t want to say anything because I perfectly plan to buy a bottle every month to stock up until they are gone. Maybe that&#x27;s why there is all these bad reviews. People wanting it to their selves. Me however, I am honest and absolutely could not do that to a decent seller. Awesome product. Can still smell it on my clothes the next day as I&#x27;m throwing them in the washer. People you are nose blind after smelling it for a few hours. Ever thought that may be why you &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; you don&#x27;t smell it after a few hours? It&#x27;s original and it is surely genuine. Thanks oxkom and Amazon</li>
            <li> good will have this arden beauty Elisabeth arden for women</li>
            <li> Product arrived as promised. Both my wife and I like the scent.</li>
            <li> After u spray the smell is gone not good stuff</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the beautiful container, but the smell doesn&#x27;t stay very long, only like one or two days...but still, it is a very good deal!</li>
            <li> I bought the cologne for my teenage son. I think it&#x27;s been sitting around to long as it smells like its old.</li>
            <li> awesome smell but some was missing so i contacted amazon right away &amp; they shipped out another bottle free of charge &amp; told me to dispose of the other bottle or do with it as i pleased! Quality was better than i expected since alot of reviews said theirs smelled like alcohol i was worried, but to my surprise it smelled really nice! And the packaging was in nice condition. Box had no rips  or dirt. It arrived in a standard brown box with bubble wrap surrounding the actual colonge box.</li>
            <li> Smell does not last long!</li>
            <li> Exactly what he wanted. Couldn&#x27;t beat the price and the product came packaged very nicely. Really a good deal for the money. Would pay much more in department store.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had once owned a type of Nautica cologne before, this was not it, but I do really like the smell of this as well.</li>
            <li> Holds the scent for a long time. again complemented on this scent.. Gave it 5 stars for complements and a nice classy scent.</li>
            <li> Too subtle for summer/hot days and wanes off pretty quickly. Otherwise, it is great for dinner or going out in the evening.</li>
            <li> Just what I was expecting!!!</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite of my husband&#x27;s colognes. It is the perfect combination of manly and musky and fresh. Plus, so inexpensive!</li>
            <li> Nautica Classic for Men is a fresh scent and it blends well with the body chemistry I will definitely purchase this cologne again.</li>
            <li> not the greatest by very watered down scent goes away after 5 minutes have to really put on a lot to get it this last for a few minutes</li>
            <li> This was a product that was given as a gift to my Dad!&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered ahead of schedule and well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;I did not open it because it was a gift.&lt;br /&gt;However, if the internal packaging matched the timeliness i was blessed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think ordering a cologne off of Amazon would be a good idea but it turned out to be. Smells manly but subtle.</li>
            <li> I want to give a star review I just dont want to write alot  if I give it a 5 star review that means I love it and would recommend it. thank you</li>
            <li> It is exactly what you would buy in the stores for 1/3 of the price.  It is a great buy.</li>
            <li> This is a very sweet scent. The bottle is perfect for carrying easily. I would recommend this scent. Nice buy!</li>
            <li> all in all, a nice smelling cologne  but&lt;br /&gt;my #1 is AQUA DI GIO by George Armani&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;beware of knockoffs, some people have complained</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my teenage son. He loves it. I received the cologne quick and fast. I will recommend this product to friends and family members.</li>
            <li> Does not smell good. Very disappointed. Buy a different cologne.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and it smells great as well. Will definitely order again and recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing John Varvatos for some time and decided to make a purchase via Amazon as the prices are much better than in Sephora and other stores.  Once on Amazon, I noticed that there were several other brands with great reviews, Nautica Classic being one of them.  Based on the price, I figured I would try it out and I do not regret this decision.  The fragrance is fresh and not overpowering as some colognes are.  I will definitely purchase again and recommend this to everyone.  Packaging was protective and the actual package it came in was also sealed and in new condition.</li>
            <li> Was pleased with product when I received.  I was delighted I did not have to go to the mall to purchase and did it from the comfort of my home.</li>
            <li> real nice cologne that you can sport when in jeans and T-shirt for a cook-out, or even when you sporting a casual suit to a concert. Females love the smell either way.</li>
            <li> I always buy this cologne, because it isn&#x27;t too hard on the nose, and lasts for quite a while. This one is right for me.</li>
            <li> Nautica cologne has a clean, fresh scent.  It&#x27;s not overpowering, nor is it the first thing you&#x27;ll notice when a man walks into a room.  Of course, opinions differ greatly on scent, due to personal taste and how a perfume blends with the body&#x27;s natural chemistry.  That being said, I think that a person should have to get close to an individual to smell his/her scent of choice.  Nautica fulfills that requirement.  Because it&#x27;s more concentrated than cheaper perfumes, it&#x27;s important to remember that less is more (and the scent lasts longer, as well.)  I was very satisfied with this seller.  I received the package three days after ordering it, and that was with regular shipping.  It was in a wrapped box, which is important to me, as I want to ensure the integrity and safety of any product I buy.  Based on my first and only experience with this seller, I would select it before others listed, and I can in good conscience recommend it to anyone looking for a quality product and prompt service.</li>
            <li> people have complained about the smell, saying it is unoriginal and a waste of glass and alcohol, i think it smells great.</li>
            <li> Very large bottle, very clean, fresh, scent.  It isn&#x27;t overpowering it is subtle, but it takes that just out of the shower clean smell to the next level.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the smell of this fragrance. I love the way it smells on him. This is a great cologne .</li>
            <li> Great smell, but it wears off shortly after putting in it on.</li>
            <li> Ever since I bought this cologne my life has changed completely. After using it, there was a bright light shining down as if the Heavens had opened up and blessed me. The aroma is not too strong and gives off just the right amount. 60% of the time, it works every time.</li>
            <li> All I can say is Mmmmm good! I just love this cologne on my husband. It lasts all day and it&#x27;s his favorite too.</li>
            <li> Great product , excellent price , amazon shipped next day without prime nice</li>
            <li> It is very good~ Love it . The flavor is either too strong nor too light for me, it&#x27;s Amazing</li>
            <li> thanks for good product and quick shiping</li>
            <li> Great scent.Not too strong and lasts long.</li>
            <li> love it only scent that smells good on me</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful for great price. I got it for my husband for Christmas and he really like it. I also picked up a couple for stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> I like this long lasting spray...&lt;br /&gt;Nice - I will go for it again and again.. ...&lt;br /&gt;Good for gift as well</li>
            <li> Good smell! Price right also!</li>
            <li> Bought  it for my Fianc&amp;egrave; for Valentine&#x27;s day and he loves it. Could not be more satisfied with how much he likes it. Might get him another bottle soon.</li>
            <li> It is not too bad, thought i would have expected a stronger scent, since it was from Nautica. Smells good , but smell does not last.</li>
            <li> a gift for my brother love your gift</li>
            <li> Already had a boat, sailed by Coast beaches Bag-If, hope your color that reflects Wed Apr navgue surprise me with that smell of sea breeze felt that one day. Young and gentlemen because &amp;#34;it is good to die at Sea in the warm water of the sea&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The product was like what anyone would get from Macy&#x27;s or Dillard. I am very pleased. I have already talked about my experienced with friends and family.</li>
            <li> Nice perfume for Men. I was not sure while ordering this perfume but I am totally satisfied with the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislike: Nothing</li>
            <li> Impressed by the price...  Doesn&#x27;t last for longer..  lasts less than an hour... don&#x27;t buy this... highly disappointed with the perfume...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my uncle for Christmas and he loves it. It has a good, long lasting smell. Its authentic. And the box came in perfect condition. Not smashed or anything.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price and it last all day im very pleased.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and work just as describe by the manufacture. I would recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne off Amazon a few weeks ago &amp; I&#x27;m very happy that I did. I recall coming across it in some random department store one day at a local mall. IIRC they were asking $50 for a 3.4oz bottle which is a joke! I&#x27;ve bought MANY bottles of cologne off Amazon for myself &amp; for friends &amp; family &amp; also a bottle of perfume or two for a girlfriend off Amazon. Excellent shopping experience every single time &amp; no complaints, whatsoever. The 1st Nautica cologne I ever got my hands on (also purchased off Amazon after testing in a Nautica store) was Nautica Blue. IMO that one&#x27;s a classic &amp; this one&#x27;s just a compliment to my cologne collection after going through a bottle or two of the Nautica Blue. I&#x27;ve gotten lots of EXTREMELY positive compliments over the Blue so I figured I&#x27;d get another Nautica cologne product. It&#x27;s quite hard to describe what this smells like. I feel that it has a \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scent that&#x27;s a tad mellow while a tad sharp at the same time. But it&#x27;s not overly sharp. It&#x27;s a great contrast to those fruity smelling colognes. I bought a bottle of Kenneth Cole T-Shirt once at the recommendation of an ex-girlfriend. That one is MEGA fruity! I mean it literally has a \\&quot;fruity\\&quot; type smell to it &amp; IMO it&#x27;s disgusting, Lol :D In all honesty it&#x27;s not terrible but it&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m usually looking to go with. The Nautica Classic, at least to me, DOES in fact remind me of the ocean &amp;/ or sailing. Perhaps it&#x27;s my mind playing tricks on me or filling in the blanks due to the Nautica logo but I&#x27;m fairly certain it smells how it smells for a reason after careful research, trial &amp; error, &amp; hours of marketing research. For ~$17 it&#x27;s a steal &amp; I will TOTALLY buy another one when this one runs out. Adding to what I was saying earlier... When I smell this cologne it reminds me of those times I go out looking GOOD! wearing a nice buttoned down shirt, nice jeans, nice shoes, etc. It has kind of a nice \\&quot;proper, neat\\&quot; smell to it. I would recommend this product to a friend, family member, any guy that wants to smell good, or anyone in general. I have a friend that&#x27;s a girl that just happens to absolutely love the Nautica Blue cologne so I ended up buying her one as a gift. I&#x27;d bet that she&#x27;d like this one, too... :Dily member, any guy that wants to smell good, or anyone in general. I have a friend that&#x27;s a girl that just happens to absolutely love the Nautica Blue cologne so I ended up buying her one as a gift. I&#x27;d bet that she&#x27;d like this one, too... :D</li>
            <li> I love Nautica, have been using it for years.  I always got the blue color bottle so now I tried to get the green one.  I have no idea what they changed besides coloring, but this green one stinks like $#!+! My kids and wife said it&#x27;s ok, so I&#x27;ll give it 2 stars instead of 1.</li>
            <li> I think i will be buying this again very soon. I love this smell. I&#x27;ve had compliments on this one. I think i will get it for my brother.</li>
            <li> I do love this spray, lovely spray. Use it everyday to work. I would definitely recommend this to others for purchase and use.</li>
            <li> I like it for tge price i paid its good.</li>
            <li> thank you for this i tame i like it&lt;br /&gt;it was very nice thank you for every thing  good e time</li>
            <li> This cologne has a pretty good flowery scent, but it&#x27;s not as good as the Nautica Voyage in my Opinon, and it doesn&#x27;t last as long either.</li>
            <li> a good price, and smell really good. i buy for my dad and he love that perfume it&#x27;s soft and a little citric...</li>
            <li> Great price and fast service !</li>
            <li> i like this perfume, smell is good and its very cheap.... by the way it takes little long to deliver but its ok i m goin to order it more in near future....</li>
            <li> My teenage son&#x27;s first cologne.  He likes it, it is a clean and nice masculine scent, not too overpowering. Good value on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. I bought it for my husband as a stocking stuffer. Apparently I&#x27;m bad a knowing how large certain ounce amounts are. This is a LARGE bottle that will last a long time. It&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
            <li> Packing and bottle was original, but cologne was just an liquid with a bit fragrance. It just stays for couple of minutes. Original one which i got it from store stays 6-8 hours. Have decided not to take any cologne going forward online. For sure not through ebay or Amamzon.</li>
            <li> It was very nice. I like it.</li>
            <li> I love the price and the product! However, it did not arrive as it was supposed to due to poor service from Amazon, and NOT the shipping company! the product arrived on time and in perfect condition, however, it was supposed to be gift wrapped, but it was NOT! It was a gift, and I added a note, but the note was NOT printed! I have been trying to write to Amazon about this, but there is NO place I can write this complaint!</li>
            <li> i had this cologne years ago and gave it to my little cousin when it was down to its very last few sprays. oh how ive missed the scent. i came on here to try to buy it again and after reading the reviews i was scared because i didnt want a fake version or a version that smelled different or didnt last long. so i risked it just to see what would happen. not only did it arrive super fast, but the box it came in was official. so far so good. so i went ahead and sprayed a misty test spray on my wrist to test the duration of the scent, which was everything i hoped it would be. 5 minutes went by, still smelled it strong 30 mins went by still smelled strong 2 hours went by, stilled smelled it strong so i stopped smelling it and i was convinced it was good enough. i went to bed and woke up and still smelled the scent fresh and strong as if i had just sprayed it! not sure what versions the other people were getting but this was legit.</li>
            <li> This was my first cologne when I was younger.  It reminds me of my grandfather and wanted to buy this as a throwback.  It simply is old or a fake, and the scent doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me to get to the elevator.  I&#x27;m keeping it since it was cheap, and the scent really doesn&#x27;t suit me well anymore anyway.  However, the classic looking bottle is one of my all time favorites.</li>
            <li> Very pissed with my order! The cologne is a fake . 5 minutess after u spray it ,tha smell is completely gone. I cant believe i wasted my money on what appears to be 90% water !!!! Guess i&#x27;ll purchase a AUTHENIC bottle from Cvs or Walmrr next time ... #UnhappyCustomer</li>
            <li> EXACTLY what I expected!</li>
            <li> excelente producto 100% recomendado</li>
            <li> I loved this fresh, clean scent and used for years.  Changed and started using other colonies like Happy for Men.  After a while wanted something different but familiar. Saw Nautica 3.4 oz. For about $10. I bought 2 bottles at that great price. Same great scent BUT DOES NOT LAST like the other more expensive version I had purchased in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not purchase again -Dissapointed</li>
            <li> Nice and light fragrance. Reminds me of cool summer nights.</li>
            <li> I gifted this to my husband on o&lt;br /&gt;ur anniversary along with other gifts.&lt;br /&gt;He liked it very much.. It smells awesome and lasts long.</li>
            <li> ok smell but not lasting</li>
            <li> He likes this frange, was our first time. Very good</li>
            <li> Great Classic Colonge</li>
            <li> If you guys like to have an everyday cologne, this is your best option. It smells pretty good and it&#x27;s not expensive</li>
            <li> Product as described! Great Buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just so disappointed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Smells very well, but the box and the bottle looks like a fake and doesn&#x27;t last much!!!</li>
            <li> Been using this for over 10 years. Great scent! Fantastic price!</li>
            <li> I love Nautica cologne and have owned many varieties of the product. However, this one has been watered down or something....it only lasts a very short time. The REAL product lasts all day and then some. I&#x27;m not sure what the deal is and I only paid a very small price for this bottle, but it is for sure not the real product. I will not order more cologne online as I am disappointed in how long this does last. However, it does smell like the real thing. It is okay if you only need to small nice for a short time.</li>
            <li> I like this product, Im from Peru and Its cost is very high.&lt;br /&gt;I cant write about the service, because my friend received my orders in USA.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s fake, it smells when you put a few seconds but does not smell at all. in my opinion it is false</li>
            <li> Its very good i liked it i lovvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvve ittttttttttttttttttttttttttt i advice everyone to buy it its a good deal for mens</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this one</li>
            <li> I got it for my husband for valentines day and he loved it. I bought it just from reading the reviews online not really knowing what it smelled like and when it came in the mail, I was extremely happy with it! Love it and highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> Came in fast and is exactly what I wanted! 👍</li>
            <li> ive been using this cologne for years and i love the smell and the product is not over powering which i love, its a great smell for a guy and i have gotten many many compliments for the many years i have used it.</li>
            <li> I normally use the Voyage, but decided to give this a try. It is a good one (considering the price), can be worn daily and has a fresh scent to it. But I&#x27;ll stick with Voyage.</li>
            <li> It is perfect, It had a good price, and my girlfriend loves how it smells. So, overall, it is a win.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product. I hadn&#x27;t tried this product before but I got exactly what I expected from the add in your store.</li>
            <li> okay product. delivered as promised. Doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> Classic scent at an unbeatable price point.  This is pretty much my go to, everyday spray.  Definitely recommended for those looking for a classic, clean scent.</li>
            <li> excellent product, fit this classification because it seems a good product and I definitely recommend it to other people .....</li>
            <li> Great deal on Cologne love the way it smells, using as xmas gift came wrapped in original package! Thank you!</li>
            <li> It is more than I expected.  For the price it was hard to beat.  Refreshing nautical fragrance.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves cologne and this is an old standby. It isnt overpowering unless you take a bath in it. This scent has a decent life as well..but smells better on fresh skin than on the clothes. The amount you get for the price is also ridiculous. I bought some cologne and got half  and paid more!. This is a good value and works well as an everyday, casual scent...</li>
            <li> One of my favorites, a quality product and a great smell. Long lasting, quality bottle with a great presentation. .</li>
            <li> Large bottle! It smells good and my husband was happy! I ordered it for Christmas and it came quickly. It&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
            <li> Cologne has a very nice scent and long lasting  I would recommend it to anyone plus its at an amazing price</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the product, fast delivered. Smells great, I bought it for my son and he loves it! Is perfect for any occasion.</li>
            <li> excellent smell!!!!great Price</li>
            <li> My son loved his Christmas present!!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells delicious, it has always been one of my all-time favorite colognes for men to wear. 3.4 oz is a pretty big bottle, not bad for what I paid for it ($12) which is a crazyyy deal. This bottle would cost $60-80 in a Walgreens, CVS etc. Buy it !!</li>
            <li> Again, most of this perfums is not original, last time to order this staff, a least I can use as alcohol.</li>
            <li> It is a very cool fragrance and for the price there is no way you are going to beat its value. If you like a medium to light fragrance at an excellent price. You should get it.</li>
            <li> Great cologne. I have tried many different kinds but have found this to be the best. I get a lot of compliments about it and have been asked many times what I have on. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am pleased in the shipment, price and value. I received my item and they were very nice. The quality was more than expected.</li>
            <li> it was perfect for a Christmas gift. my father satisifed, smells delicious .. I came in perfect condition. recommend this product</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected for this product. It seems like imitation, because it smell does not last long</li>
            <li> i love it. it is wonderfull. it is my favorite. i use it every day. it is excelllent. i recommend it</li>
            <li> Great...product got this for a Christmas gift. I know my uncle will love this .. thanks amazon I definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> Great smell, price and service by Amazon Prime!  It&#x27;s a classic ad a deal and I plan on getting more of this and/or like this.</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing this for nearly 2 decades&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorites for his collection of colognes. An all around cologne, not only to be worn in a white collar environment&lt;br /&gt;Fresh scent without being overpowering&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34; is becoming more difficult to find in local markets. so nice to find it here still</li>
            <li> I ordered this via Amazon for my son for Christmas.  He seems highly pleased by it.  It arrived in a timely fashion and it was packed securely.  I recommend this for anyone needing to buy a man&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> if completely fulfilled my expectations, and I go back to place another order for future purchases with these excellent merchandise</li>
            <li> Normal perfume have a nice smell and it is pleasant, this one smell mmm let&#x27;s say good but IT WON&#x27;T make a girl to stick at you and say your that essence is great. IT EVAPORATES TO QUICK, that means it contains a lot of alcohol and beacause of that... NOT A GOOD Perfume.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like this cologne since I have always used Dracan Noir but this type is very good at least for me.</li>
            <li> It smells beyond amazing. the moment i smelled it i was astonished by how pleasant it was. The smell was not emanating around the rooms so the strength is perfect (3 sprays) and does what its supposed to only those who came in close contact noticed and complemented me; and girls and guys that walked by me in the street as well. This cologne is perfect for casual outings and every day use (but everyone knows your not supposed to use the same cologne every day lol) also i would say the recommended age for this is  High School+. Great for pretty much all ages above freshmen year high school ...... if your younger than a freshmen in high school your to young to be spending money on cologne anyway. Another thing although this smells amazing it does not last very long 1-2 hours max</li>
            <li> i am very glad by quality product and amazon treatment. the smell is so strong in this fragance but is so good to me.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Excellent stuff!!! Worth it&#x27;s price. I will by again.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the citrus like scent!</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance for the guy who wants to smell great without smelling like he&#x27;s wearing his cologne. Subtle and very refreshing. All the guys in my family love this.</li>
            <li> I dont know if the other reviewers are right or not when it comes to whether or not this is the real deal but it works and smells just like the expensive stuff at the store.</li>
            <li> Great smelling Colonge! Not too strong and it has a sweet scent to it that women like. I don&#x27;t​ believe it is oil based, so it probably won&#x27;t last you ALL DAY, but it does stick to clothing very well and can last a full work day or night out. I would definitely recommend this to any guy.</li>
            <li> I really like Nautica but not this one this one smells like a can of bug spray maybe this cologne you can wear in the woods to keep the bugs off</li>
            <li> I was looking for a perfume i could use in the mornings, and i found it. Everybody at work likes it, it lasts for a long time</li>
            <li> Smell like you just got out of shower. Very refreshing last about 1-2 hour</li>
            <li> I expected a lot on this and I got disappointed and is not up to the mark. Getting the same for $8 in ebay and I am not sure about the quality. I have to go and check in the local stores regarding the smell which is very mild and light.</li>
            <li> the perfume i have been looking for all my life. the scent is too good .</li>
            <li> I bought them for gifts. They loved them. It&#x27;s a great fragrance for men. Very fresh &amp; clean!</li>
            <li> I placed my order, but I had to leave home for a few months when I get home, I found my package was sealed, but incomplete, was not the nautica perfume had asked you biusque communicate with amazon, but does not give me the option to submit claim or tell me how to communicate with the provider</li>
            <li> Amazing deal and amazing product, bought 3 so far.</li>
            <li> purchased for my son.</li>
            <li> Not good as I thought</li>
            <li> YES!!! Love it! Longevity is 7/10 but I spray it kinda a lot to make it about 9/10 lol...if u put it on ur hoodie the next day u really don&#x27;t need to spray anymore because it&#x27;s still there! DEF WORTH THE PRICE AND THE BOTTLE IS HUGE! Way bigger Then the pic u see!</li>
            <li> This is a very good-sized bottle of cologne from a designer brand for cheap. What&#x27;s not to like? The smell is light and not at all overpowering. Definitely recommend to anyone looking to add to their collection.</li>
            <li> i bought it for my husband as a gift. he loves its mild  fragrance . its a perfect gift for men.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like many fragrances. Nautica is one of them. I like it because it&#x27;s not sweet or too loud.</li>
            <li> What can I say - nice smell, (my wife loves it:)) and twice cheaper as it is in Ross store, where all of the colognes are already cheaper then Mall prices.. I bought my first bottle at Ross and then found that great deal at Amazon. I ordered 2 bottles for the price of one. The bottle shape takes some time to get used to and the scent doesn&#x27;t tend to linger as long as other $50-150 colognes but hey! - you can&#x27;t beat he price.</li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;m very impressed with this cologne.  I&#x27;ve re-ordered once already!</li>
            <li> Great scent for my hubby!</li>
            <li> Nautica Classic has a fresh smell to it, a little soapy at first, but then fades out clean and fresh. It is excellent for mornings or when at home and feeling like wearing a fresh cologne... It lasts alright, not strong, not weak, and overall is alright and i use it just to alternate with at casual uses so you don&#x27;t have to use up your more expensive designer perfumes... i will not buy again however as i am not that impressed by it.</li>
            <li> Excellent, i like this product</li>
            <li> 100% recomended. It&#x27;s smells AMAZING. It stays on all day, and everyone I know smells me and they keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li> My father is a very picky person . It isnt easy to buy something he will for sure like. But i gave him this cologne and he loved it!</li>
            <li> Long lasting, clean smell....not overbearing at all... packaging is just fine..great for all skin types. At this price its a deal!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It smells so good and the bottle is huge. It came in the original box. My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Smell wears off after 1 hour.  Did I receive an imitation cologne? Good thing it does not cost much. Thanks anyway.</li>
            <li> Just want to thank you guys on the prompt delivery . Scent is great although a bit soft for my taste its perfect for my scope of practice not over powering but the girls get the breeze of my scent.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and I really enjoy it but it wears off quickly.  It&#x27;s a great value at this price and works well for short outings.</li>
            <li> i have been using it for the last 6 months and feel this is very soft in terms smell and a good one that could be used for all occasions. if you are kind of someone who like strong perfumes then this is not for you. this smell soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> Have never had anyone tell me I was over scented. It is very mid and just adds that extra air to your presents. Just give it a shot. It sprays so your hands stay free of it and use very little so last a good long while</li>
            <li> fresh, approachable scent nothing heavy, love it every morning, works for me, i like clean scents, freshness is all</li>
            <li> Very sweet scent! My mom loves to use this on special occasions!</li>
            <li> First i was not so much impressed but then My mother complimented the smell. And that was all i ever wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product in low price.</li>
            <li> Awesome smelling cologne.  Smells really sexy on my friend.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good! My expectations have been surpassed. It also came earlier than it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> Bought it for hubby. Excellent price available on amazon. Hubby likes it</li>
            <li> My hubby love it, big size fresh and just in time for Father&#x27;s Day I will keep ordering this every time he runs out.</li>
            <li> Love Nautica Classic for Men</li>
            <li> I like this sent because I don&#x27;t feel like a &amp;#34;sleezy ball&amp;#34; that is trying to hard and I often forget I have it on...until someone tells me I smell good.</li>
            <li> The price is excellent and this is a scent that my husband loves. It is a staple in our house.</li>
            <li> This smell is something I would wear when I&#x27;m not trying to be too fancy or up close with a person, but rather going to a meeting or class or something. It has a bit of a dirty smell to it. It is an ok cologne.</li>
            <li> The cologne smells pretty good, I&#x27;ll use it occasionally for work. It&#x27;s nothing id wear for a date or a special occasion, though it&#x27;s definitely something I&#x27;d wear for an everyday activity. You get good value for your money with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Attractively packaged men&#x27;s cologne. Well priced, clean, brisk fragrance which I had purchased as a gift--one sniff and I kept it for myself!</li>
            <li> The price was right and this is my husband&#x27;s every day fragrance.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> Cologne fragrance Excellent ..! for use alone or combine it with another colony of your choice ..!&lt;br /&gt;my going very well alone and when combine with another colony of wonder.!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it 100% you will not regret ...</li>
            <li> I been so happy with it and I will like some promotions on deal on all the deals that you have</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother, he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I think is a god smell for a good price, smells fresh and clean besides the bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li> the smell fades out in 1 or 2 hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its ok for the price you have paid.</li>
            <li> The product fulfilled expectations. excellent</li>
            <li> Husband really likes this scent.  This is his second bottle of Nautica, the first one was the blue scent, we really liked that as well.</li>
            <li> high quality product nominate everyone to use. Suitable for all times . The brand already set their quality .very good</li>
            <li> For the price that I paid, it was obvious it wasn&#x27;t going to be a good smell. But I decided to take my chances. For the price that I paid, it was the smell that I got.</li>
            <li> Great deal and smells great :).</li>
            <li> It is exactly the perfiun what I wanted, good price and good quality, the order arrived faster than I thought that I liked a lot</li>
            <li> arrive in very good conditions</li>
            <li> Like this one a lot, will buy agine.</li>
            <li> Great cologne, not overpowering and a nice alternative to Nautica Blue</li>
            <li> Worth buying, I like it so much!</li>
            <li> Excellent product worth what you pay for, I am satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li> Wow!  What a great buy!  I can&#x27;t believe how big of a bottle this is and that it was only 12 bucks!  Way to go Amazon!</li>
            <li> I decided to go for this fragance as a gift, it arrived on time, the perfume was exactly what i was expecting. Haven&#x27;t heard yet what the person thinks about it but i clearly selected it was a gift and was expecting the note to be printed as it said and it didnt come with the product!!</li>
            <li> The size of the bottle is perfect and I love the smell.  It is not too strong but lasts long.</li>
            <li> Smells bueno, good for the price , whenever I wear it im guaranteed to get in them panties , no what im saying</li>
            <li> satisfied with the quality of prducto.</li>
            <li> I smell like a toilet when wearing this. Buy the blue one!</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Original Nautica has always been a hit-or-miss smell for many people, since it goes to great pains to smell of the sea. It&#x27;s salty, light, and very fresh, but isn&#x27;t as sweet or cool as other aquatics. It&#x27;s moderately flowery nature makes it nearly ambiguous in terms of sexuality, and it has fairly poor longevity, but it&#x27;s uniqueness and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; aroma make up for these shortcomings. If applied a little more heavily, this one can be worn in almost all seasons except maybe winter.</li>
            <li> This perfume is really very nice and my friend liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> It smells nice but only lasts less than a hour. I&#x27;d had good experiences with amazon except for the fragances. All the ones I&#x27;ve bought were fake ones. Amazon must stop this fake selling on its site and the customers must complaint about this</li>
            <li> very good product thank you very much</li>
            <li> I but this for a friend and he really like it</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed by the smell</li>
            <li> Husband needed more of this cologne...so glad to find it on Amazon and not have to spend the time trying to look for it.  No sure where it bought it originally.  He has used it for several years since Nautica got rid of its Longitude/Latitute cologne. Seems to like it almost as much.</li>
            <li> This smells great! My husband loves it and so do I. It&#x27;s not overpowering like some others and is what I consider a &amp;#34;professional scent&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It is fake.  Just water.  If I spray 10 times more than a good perfume  then within 10 minutes someone can smell&lt;br /&gt;something very mild  if he touch his nose to my shirt &amp; smell.</li>
            <li> arrived in good condition, and it was what was advertise.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT NEVER ARRIVED ME, JUST CAME IN THE BOX ONE PERFUME</li>
            <li> Classic cool Nautica scent never goes out of style! Love this and love a man smelling like this!!! C&#x27;mon who doesn&#x27;t?!</li>
            <li> This is a scent that I wear only to work. Nice pleasant scent but nothing to really write home about. Very forgettable...</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed receiving this package. The package was well derived on date. Great!!</li>
            <li> I prefer Nautica Voyage, but original is good too. The original Nautica is a bit stronger.</li>
            <li> has cheap look and smell. Did not like it at all. Don&#x27;t buy this</li>
            <li> Perfume packed perfectly and very quickly!</li>
            <li> I got this cologne for my Dad last Christmas. We all loved the beautiful bottle it came in. The smell is classic and smooth. Definitely a must have.</li>
            <li> It is a very youthful scent, I recommend it for young man. The presentation is a very practical size for charging.</li>
            <li> Good price.  No a great smell, reminds me of old spice yuk.</li>
            <li> This spray smells so wonderful. Its totally unique to other cologne I have every smelled. Its soft but very manly. Its a large bottle that looks great on any fragrance shelf.</li>
            <li> This is a very clean scent. I wanted to get an inexpensive cologne for any occasion, be it a family outing, around the house, etc. This is what i went with.  At first it&#x27;ll be &amp;#34;sweet,&amp;#34; somewhat unisex, once it settles it&#x27;s very subtle though it projects, a combo that I have been looking for. It lasts around 5-6 hours, though that&#x27;s perfectly fine for what i am using this for; an any occasion cologne.  Now i wouldn&#x27;t use this for a special occasion, i would use this if i needed to run an errand and i needed to quickly freshen up. All in all it is a great buy. If you end up not liking it, hey! You only spent 10 dollars! Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Nice and known fragrance at a great price!</li>
            <li> THE UPS TRACK APPEARS AS IT HAD ARRIVED ON SEPTEMBER THE 13TH BUT IT NEVER CAME TO MY FRONT DOOR</li>
            <li> Great cologne, don&#x27;t get me wrong but I was expecting a lighter scent. My husband likes it too but agreed it would be much better for our evenings out.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great but does not mix well with cigarette smoke and sweat, as I could imagine no cologne or perfume would. However, my husband is a cigarette smoker that uses this cologne to cover up the smell and it makes me want to throw the cologne out the window. Other than that, this cologne would smell really great</li>
            <li> I bought for my husband since very inexpensive. Cant say I was impressed. However.. It was one added cologne to his collection and for only 11.00... was not that bad</li>
            <li> My son loves Nautica so i bought it for him for christmas. i buy this every christmas. He loves it</li>
            <li> great price, 100% original, awesome delivery service</li>
            <li> Smells like it used to which is good, but lasts like a beer in the parking lot of my AA meeting. That means not long, because it gets thrown away. Empty or full, one of the two, depends on who is doing the throwing. Waste your money on the eau de cologne, or something else.  The only way this stuff will last is if you spray so much you stain your shirt with it. Maybe just drink it. That might work. One way or the other...</li>
            <li> Easy to use and store. Smells good</li>
            <li> Great scent cool looking bottle</li>
            <li> Husband loved it though I found the fragrance similar to any other Men&#x27;s cologne. Price was okay.</li>
            <li> great price...great product!</li>
            <li> Good quality and presentation</li>
            <li> wth. I bought this and it got delivered a little bit late but amazon treated me well on some items. Well to the point. I open the box and the smell lasted for like 5 seconds then it was gone. I spray it on my shirt and it last like 1 hour and it smells not bad but weird. It smells like &#x27;fabuloso&#x27;, which is a liquid which you use to mop the floor with. So pretty much that&#x27;s what it is to me.</li>
            <li> Loooove the smell of this stuff, and so does my girlfriend and thats all that really matters right?!?? :) ha</li>
            <li> a christmas present for my son. this is his favorite and got a good price on it</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my father and he loved it.  Neither he nor I were familiar with this fragrance prior to my purchase.  I bought this item for him as I find that Nautica makes high quality products.  Once again, they did not disappoint.  This cologne is also nicely packaged and has an attractive bottle.  Great find!</li>
            <li> Good value for Money.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not that strong.&lt;br /&gt;But it does not last that long. As we all know you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Good fragrance, I bought it to be given it my son and he like it, it uses it daily, but he told me that it was not their favorite one.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much! I got it on time and its a great product! good quality and beautiful! I liked it very much! I got it on time and its a great product! good quality and beautiful!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine gifted to me. It was the right time when Amazon reached out to when my first bottle was finished.</li>
            <li> Nothing too fancy. its good for an evening out. A day of activity though and well yh it vanishes. Not very long lasting but then again for the price its okay</li>
            <li> Nice colonge for the price. I brought for gifts they love the scent. will bu mor. keep them coming.</li>
            <li> This Cologne smells so good, makes me want to bite my husband. I hope it never runs dry. He loved it too.</li>
            <li> This was for my girlfriends birthday and she is picky on smells so if she likes it then its a good product thank you</li>
            <li> smells cheap. personal opinion, just wasnt for me</li>
            <li> This scent is clean and refreshing but also very masculine. This is one of my favorite scents that my husband wears. It isn&#x27;t too strong which is nice, but it also doesn&#x27;t last very long. If he sprays it on at eight in the morning then the scent is gone by late afternoon.</li>
            <li> I bought one for my little brother and He is happy because this lotion is fresh and sport for active men. I recommend buy it. :)</li>
            <li> Smells great but the smell last about 30mins</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, smells as expected.</li>
            <li> I loved it was great and would recommend to all if interested...Was worth the money and the price was fair</li>
            <li> This is an awesome deal for those who love the classic Nautica scent. How can you go wrong?! Clean, fresh scent, discount price.</li>
            <li> Nice, simple and clean perfume. Spray on for casual outing but stay on for more hours. Nice pef for the price. Just try it out!</li>
            <li> I tried this colon just now because I&#x27;m going out tonight and i love the smell this colon is really good amazon rules</li>
            <li> It was a gift, but he loved it.  Loves the scent.</li>
            <li> It is a very good perfume, a bit spoiled in the packaging but recomended is very good and the girls love it</li>
            <li> Nice presentation and  fragance. I used it  frequently. The smell  doesn&#x27;t last, just an hour, I think. People most be so close to You to feel it.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, because it was inexpensive and I was looking for a new cologne. Both my wife and I love the scent and I&#x27;ve received several compliments so far. Definitely a keeper, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> i always buy this, this was just a good price</li>
            <li> the product is very good</li>
            <li> Smells like victory!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a Christmas present and it arrived broken.</li>
            <li> The smell don&#x27;t last.. if the perfume is original Nautica must have been turn down the quality..</li>
            <li> Full my expectatativas with respect to the product.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, not over powering. Great price for decent size bottle. I&#x27;ve purchased this about five times so far and will probly continue to re purchase. Very satisfied with this purchase start to finish.</li>
            <li> I love this smell...Never gets old. Girlfriend can&#x27;t get enough :)</li>
            <li> Nice product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> very good I recommend it</li>
            <li> Smells cheap, not pleasant. I use it sometimes to be an air freshener for the bathroom because while it&#x27;s not the best smell it is still better than feces. I really like Drakkar, significantly better.</li>
            <li> La caja vino un poco da&amp;ntilde;ada, menos mal no era para vender, hubiera perdido la inversion.</li>
            <li> this  cologne is great, I bought some of this 2 years ago from a department store at the cost of 54 dollars.it was great then and it&#x27;s still great to me now at a lot lees than 54 dollars :)) it holds on all day long.i used to get compliments about how nice it smells when I last had this. haven&#x27;t used  this fragrance in over two years and I decided to wear it last week.and I had 3 people to ask me what it was because it smells really nice. so to guy on a budget, and don&#x27;t have 100 bucks to drop on an over priced department cologne,this Is a good one to consider..</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Can&#x27;t beat the price and it smells great. I keep it in my gym bag and just a touch up after the showers and I am ready for a night out in town. It&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually one to never complain about something I bought, but I was disappointed with this cologne. I am suspicious about the reviewers because almost everyone said it is fresh and smells really good. It is a below average cologne. The cologne is not unique nor special. I guess you get what you pay for because it&#x27;s a relatively cheap cologne. The scent is barely noticeable and goes away in 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li> I sampled some of it at my local Walgreens. The scent is weak and it reeks of alcohol. I would skip it.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is definitely great for lovers of good smell, quality highlights in the duration in the body and maintains its scent for many hours, recommended</li>
            <li> The prices on certain items on Amazon continue to amaze us.  We used to spend at minimum $1,000.00 per year on mens, and womens calognes and parfumes from retail stores.  Discovered Amazon and found prices to be as much as 90% below retail outlets for scents that are either a few years old or relatively new.  This one is one that can be found at retail for considerably more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an old scent, goes all the way back to 1992 (again along the lines of CK Eternity which is still a classic and rarely goes on sale) however you won&#x27;t find anything about this scent old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this for daytime wear (work typically) and is a masculine scent that possesses a blend of lemon, sage, rose and jasmine accompanied by moss and sandalwood.  As with most calognes that I do buy, I don&#x27;t normally buy specifically for events or time of the day.  I&#x27;ll wear a particular calogne depending on how I feel that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very clean, and fresh scent, and draws compliments from people in the office.  I&#x27;ve read that other find it doesn&#x27;t hold, but I&#x27;ve not found that to be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the scent, I love the design of the bottle - reminds me of modern architecture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short - this is a great scent, and the price is unbeatable on Amazon and with Amazon Prime - it&#x27;s like getting it for FREE!</li>
            <li> They changed the formula a little bit from 10 years ago but great great scent. Best brand nautical has to offer</li>
            <li> Not at all satisfied with the product. Seems to be a FAKE item. after applying the perfume it doesn&#x27;t stay for even 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put some nasty things in my mouth but this mouthwash was easily one of the most offensive tasting of all. To top it off, everything I ate that afternoon tasted like I washed it down with a glass of cool gasoline. I do have to say that the scent was however quite refreshing.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my dad and he liked it!</li>
            <li> I used to use this when I was a young stud!Great smell brings me back.....</li>
            <li> This is one of the parfum more cheaper of the Amazon Store. Have a great smell and it&#x27;s a good choice to full your Amazon Shooping Car.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of cologne so its good that this is so inexpensive. I use tons of it so I buy it on amazon where its cheap and fast ship.</li>
            <li> Love when my husband wears this.</li>
            <li> I dislike the smell of this product. I tried it on the moment it got to my house and the smell was terrible. It wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> Always been a Nautica Fan and this classic is exactly what I needed. Ordered this as a replacement for my empty bottle :)</li>
            <li> This is a very very good cologne and for the price is awesome. I jump on my man every time he puts this one.</li>
            <li> it is really bad and smells like combination of cheap chemicals but not fragrance. i would not recommend it at all! trust me. you will regret your money. i am not a strict person about perfumes and i even think that the cheaper adidas perfume is much better than this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Nautica Classic Men&#x27;s Cologne! It is by far my most favorite of all time! Seller was awesome and I received my product in a timely manner!</li>
            <li> Nephew wanted cologne for Christmas. My boyfriend recommended this scent, hope he just loves it! I&#x27;m sure he will though.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find this as I believe it&#x27;s no longer in production. I bought two for good measure!</li>
            <li> this product is interesting and good product. good factory. this product help for complete anything. is important have this product</li>
            <li> Saved big.It is hard to find sometimes, much better price. It came fast. Will buy here again This is the only spay my wife likes</li>
            <li> Nautica smell&lt;br /&gt;the smell is,ant what i thought it was  it smells different from what i thought it smells like&lt;br /&gt;i won&#x27;t recommend it to nobody</li>
            <li> It smells great, but it wears off too fast. I mean I think its a great deal for that price!</li>
            <li> this cologne smells pretty good. It makes you smell like you just got out of the shower and you used really nice soap! Nautica Voyage is better but thats why it costs more</li>
            <li> It was a good gift for Christmas</li>
            <li> When I went to the mailbox my whole mailbox box like cologne.  The packaging is all torn up in the cologne bottle had burst open..  I am very disappointed with the service and quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want my money back now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent just was not doing it for me either</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite disappointed because the scent is far away from the original one especially in term of long-lasting. My authentic one could last for a day on clothes or skin but this certainly not. Probably using it as air freshener &#x3D;)))</li>
            <li> huge bottle great price</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be certain that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Nautica or not, but the price is right. I thought for under $15 I was getting the smaller size (the $25 one at stores) but the 3.4 oz actually is quite large (the $40-$50 one at stores). Extremely satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is just green water, that&#x27;s all!</li>
            <li> wonderful savings on good producy</li>
            <li> Great smell and last about 6-hours. One of the best Nautica scent that I have, light but powerful I receive compliments each time I wear the cologne.</li>
            <li> There is a reason why this cologne is so cheap, its because it does not smell good and does not last. Better off spending a couple of extra bucks and get something good!</li>
            <li> excellent water tualet liked my dad is fanatic and is always the same</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and the item that came to me was not the true Nautica Classic. I don&#x27;t know what it is, but it smells like $%!&amp;. I almost threw-up when I sprayed it on in the morning and the fact that I cannot return the product makes me even more upset. I do not recommend buying this product ever to anyone.</li>
            <li> I got it for a gift for my boyfriend for Valentines day, and hopefully he will like it &#x3D;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s okay so that&#x27;s all that matters!</li>
            <li> i got this cologne for my brother and he loves it so much he wears it everyday his girlfriend tried to streal it its really good</li>
            <li> Good value buy for the price. I find it excellent for a daily use product at this price it is much better than a deodrant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this scent for many many years.  Never fails, always smells wonderful and consistently a great product!  Also at these great prices, BUY IT!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this fragrance. It&#x27;s not overpowering and I love the way it mixes with my BF&#x27;s body chemistry to create a unique scent. Masculine, but light.</li>
            <li> Great smelling everyday cologne</li>
            <li> I am quite happy with this purchase. It seems to have natural scent similar to that of body wash l which for me feel refreshing.</li>
            <li> Great price and prompt delivery</li>
            <li> I like the scent but you have to literally spray a lot to make the scent stand out and it doesn&#x27;t last for 30 mins!</li>
            <li> very satisfied with my article for the good price and the quality he has is the best buy thanks alot</li>
            <li> My son is 13 and loves this product to no end. He makes it a habit to wear this fragrance everyday before school. I would recommend for active young me..</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day.  We are both picky about his cologne.  This is a keeper.  Lots of reviews say the scent doesn&#x27;t last but I can smell it on him all day.  It is a nice clean scent.  Great buy for us!</li>
            <li> My Dad like it. But, I was expecting less price. I found the same product cheap in a different store</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this men&#x27;s fragrance...&lt;br /&gt;Notice the size of this bottle 3.4 oz...you can&#x27;t beat it&lt;br /&gt;Ref. Nautica Classic for Men by Nautica  3.4 oz  100ml  EDT Spray&lt;br /&gt;The aroma is excellent...buy it</li>
            <li> Great smell and very great price. I would probably by again for sure! Got this as a gift &amp; wouldn&#x27;t mind another.</li>
            <li> Nice clean manly scent. Great gift. Classy. My grandson loved it and I was very happy that he did. Smart purchase.</li>
            <li> the scent is classic&lt;br /&gt;only thing is it does not last that long, but based on the price, it is worthy.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S OKAY&lt;br /&gt;IS A GOOD FAKE FRAGANCE&lt;br /&gt;BUT IS FAKEE&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I use this cologne when Im on the go and dont want to smell like smoke, pretty cheap and has a decent smell thats not overbearing.</li>
            <li> Great smell. This product was a gift for my husband and he loves it. Will definitely buy again. Great price also.</li>
            <li> Was my grandfather&#x27;s reaction when I gave this to him - but that&#x27;s not the company&#x27;s fault at all! It smells like the store copy, and the packaging was great, so there was no threat of the bottle breaking.</li>
            <li> I remember when i was younger i always thought it was nautica original that smelt bomb. I ordered this and just gave it to my nephew. To him anything smells cool.(hes 11) this is the wrong cologn if your under 60 years old</li>
            <li> excellent and very good</li>
            <li> husband really likes this, great scent</li>
            <li> Nautica Classic for Men by Nautica 3.4 oz 100ml EDT Spray  not a bad but it&#x27;s ok to start off</li>
            <li> lovely scents which last all day, it&#x27;s scent is not the choking type, its soft and i love the design of the bottle, its unique.</li>
            <li> bad product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product would seem not original, because the smell tends to fade fast, I&#x27;ve tried several people in the household and it&#x27;s the same thoughts about Alcohol</li>
            <li> This cologne smells amazing, and has a very cool bottle shape.  The person I bought this gift for was very happy to recieve it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favourite scents. The size of the product was great for the price. Great value for money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother. I&#x27;m dissapointed. I thought an expensive perfume would smell better. Honestly it smells, well.....cheap. But that&#x27;s my opinion. Maybe its just not my type. I prefer a softer aeromatic smell. I thought a sea inspired perfume would have such a smell. But no, this smells more like a heavy, pungent, smack you in the face smell. But the bottle is very pretty.</li>
            <li> Original Nautica has always been a hit-or-miss smell for many people, since it goes to great pains to smell of the sea. It&#x27;s salty, light, and very fresh, but isn&#x27;t as sweet or cool as other aquatics. It&#x27;s moderately flowery nature makes it nearly ambiguous in terms of sexuality, and it has fairly poor longevity, but it&#x27;s uniqueness and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; aroma make up for these shortcomings. If applied a little more heavily, this one can be worn in almost all seasons except maybe winter.</li>

            <li> Chicks dig it.  Need I say more?  One shot to the chest is all you need.</li>
            <li> It has a clean aroma and does not overpower. I do think of ocean scents when I wear it and I keep coming back to it.</li>
            <li> Good smell, but does not last at all. disappointed</li>
            <li> NAUTICA CLASSIC FOR MEN BY NAUTICA 3.4 OZ  LOTION FOR MEN.  I ORDERED FOR A GIFT.</li>
            <li> Great price for this size of Nautica and my husband loves it..Delivered on time, no delays..</li>
            <li> Its actually njce.....i mean the scent is a sorta fresh man scent like what a guy wud weat to his first date....its really nice...of course not everyone will like it but.....it last long i still smelt it in me after 4-5hrs(and i work inna food place so u know how my clothes&amp;me smells of oil).......i am sorry i didnt buy 2.came packaged nicely box was new</li>
            <li> its very good for the price.... couldnt have chose better than this for the orice i got it for.it really awesome.</li>
            <li> This is the best Nautica men&#x27;s cologne out there. Voyage is a bit stronger and last longer but doesn&#x27;t quite smell as nice, while Blue is a bit \\&quot;chemically\\&quot; smelling and artificial. The classic has a pleasant, fresh scent, like fresh out of the shower and is not very strong or will it offend others like some cologne&#x27;s do. This is probably the best aquatic scent out there.</li>
            <li> This is not your $100 a bottle stuff. I doubt many people would think it was expensive. It is, however, a pleasant, sort of summery (beachy?) scent that lasts for a decent period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an everyday cologne for a man, it is hard to beat this combination of a respectable cologne at an even more respectable price. If you are short on cash but want a cologne that won&#x27;t smell like pure junk, this may be worth looking at.</li>
            <li> in stronger, I mean that it should last longer.  I spray it in the morning and it disappears pretty quickly after that.  I love the smell, but no staying power.  but for the price ($12) can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> such a classic scent and for a great price where can you go wrong.  shipped fast and was packaged well</li>
            <li> This cologne is very smooth and a nice clean scent. The price was well worth it. Not very strong or overpowering. Simple and clean.</li>
            <li> As soon as I placed order it was shipped asap. Including the giftwrap. My dad was super happy with his new perfume.</li>
            <li> I got it on sale and it was a really deal! My dad loves the spray. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> smell is way too strong</li>
            <li> It is what it is if this is what you want</li>
            <li> Bought this cologne for a great price but as soon as I put it on its &amp;#34; gone with the wind &amp;#34; lol.&lt;br /&gt;Wear at own risk..smh</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price.  I have to receive an extra spray or two though to be thoroughly fumigated!</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Nautica Classic Men&#x27;s Cologne! It is by far my most favorite of all time! Seller was awesome and I received my product in a timely manner!</li>
            <li> excelente fragancia a muy buen precio, me siento feliz de habe comprado esta fragancia, se ha convertido en unas de mis preferidas y a un costo excelente</li>
            <li> Bought for my dad he loves it its def not a girly smell hes an exmarine and he loves it I took a chance buying a fragrance I never smelled turned out great!</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the price like 10 bucks and took a chance. I didn&#x27;t like the smell so I gave it away.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Colon for men. I have known of this colon for years and the smell is fresh and masculine. I gave these away as Christmas gifts</li>
            <li> i had this cologne years ago and gave it to my little cousin when it was down to its very last few sprays.  oh how ive missed the scent.  i came on here to try to buy it again and after reading the reviews i was scared because i didnt want a fake version or a version that smelled different or didnt last long.  so i risked it just to see what would happen.  not only did it arrive super fast, but the box it came in was official. so far so good.  so i went ahead and sprayed a misty test spray on my wrist to test the duration of the scent, which was everything i hoped it would be.  5 minutes went by, still smelled it strong... 30 mins went by... still smelled strong... 2 hours went by, stilled smelled it strong so i stopped smelling it and i was convinced it was good enough.  i went to bed and woke up and still smelled the scent fresh and strong as if i had just sprayed it!  not sure what versions the other people were getting but this was legit.</li>
            <li> I love the way my husband smells when he wears this. He has been wearing this cologne since we met 10 years ago and I love it.</li>
            <li> As advertised and Herself likes the scent.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 15 year old nephew. Great price and he loved it...great gift for a teenager as it&#x27;s not cheap, but not terribly high priced.</li>
            <li> This is the cologne that my husband wore when we met over 10 years ago and I got him a bottle for Christmas and we both still LOVE the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp; it&#x27;s a great value for the amount that you get.  This bottle is going to last a while to say the least!</li>
            <li> Even the preferered to me is the Voyage, Classic is a very good one just to have another options as a Nautica lover.</li>
            <li> thank you very much i love this product i recommended a 100% to everyone need a fragance for use in any ocassion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this brand of cologne for years, love the fresh shower clean scent. It&#x27;s definitely a classic! It was great to see it in the larger size too. When I received it, it was sealed in the original box and packaged in a larger size box with a larger type of bubble wrap around to protect it. I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better price either, way less than retail. I can&#x27;t even find this particular scent in the larger size in the stores! Thank you, that you carry it!&lt;br /&gt;I have and will continue to order this cologne again and again</li>
            <li> My wife and I could not believe the price of this product, we have seen this same product in stores for $20 more. My wife loves this on me so no complaints here. No more mall shopping for overpriced cologne.</li>
            <li> I never had Nautica classic before so bought it, well the smell isn&#x27;t so great. but I got it at very cheaper price so cant complain.</li>
            <li> I have to really spray alot on to keep smelling nice. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I &#x27;d like or as long as it used to. Maybe they changed it....</li>
            <li> very very very very  very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very good, purchase arrived well and were as esperaa lotions that fuecen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;regards</li>
            <li> Excellent, heavy fragance</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Not really recommended.</li>
            <li> bueno el producto 100% original</li>
            <li> Great gift, love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great price, good deal.</li>
            <li> Good smelling cologne that&#x27;s cheap enough to wear every day. This isn&#x27;t my finest, but it&#x27;s something to spray every day without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> Cheap and you can use it for everyday</li>
            <li> nunca llego al distino</li>
            <li> My husband loves this colonge not to strong and smells fresh hes a waiter at the Hyatt and people always say he smells great!</li>
            <li> Love the scent,but it does not last all day. More like half a day,but I get plenty of compliments on it at work when I wear it. So as long as this is NOT your \\&quot;GO TO\\&quot; cologne for nights out and/or dates,then it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Excelente producto de acuerdo a lo esperado, el env&amp;iacute;o fue acorde a la fecha se&amp;ntilde;alada, estoy muy satisfecha con el producto, lo recomiendo</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle from Amazon. I really like the light and fresh, clean scent of this cologne. Great for every day use.</li>
            <li> Good ole classic, been using for a while.</li>
            <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I used to wear this back in the day and loved it. I read the reviews and saw some said it was a fake but there were good reviews as well. Against my better judgement I ordered it. The bad reviews are right. The smell when first applied it weird, after about 5 minutes it does smell like the original, however, the smell is COMPLETELY gone within 30 minutes. This stuff truly doesnt last at all. 30 minutes is NOT an exaggeration. Please don&#x27;t waste your money as I did. This stuff is worthless. So dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for a gift because its very reasonably priced, my family members have used it and highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but not so strong</li>
            <li> smells fresh and like out-of-the-shower. cheap cologne but doesn&#x27;t smell cheap. most people say this is a fake, no it&#x27;s not. i have been looking for this in the Philippines and hey I found it here so i hope Amazon doesn&#x27;t stop reselling these. thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and I love the way it smells on him. It&#x27;s not overpowering it&#x27;s a clean light fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son for Christmas.  Was worried it would be a tiny bottle because of the $12 price tag.  Nope, full sized bottle!  New in box, great buy!</li>
            <li> Awesome cologne, especially given the brand-name, low price and fast shipping with Amazon!  The smell can be described as fresh, clean, reminiscent of shower or sail.  Nautica is very much a classic of men&#x27;s colognes, widely regarded as attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is not over-powering and doesn&#x27;t carry too long given a light usage.  If sprayed in the morning, expect to update in the evening.  Wife was surprised at how attractive this is.  Normally use Tommy, Cool Water, etc.  Nautica is right up there with the others (but at a much better price point).  Five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received this item exactly as described and exceeds expectations!  Larger product size (3.4oz) provides great value for the price.  Shipped in a box within a box, with the inner box (retail type) factory-wrapped in a plastic seal.  Packing materials assured no risk of damage in transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to order this cologne as one of several maintained on-hand.</li>
            <li> IS NOT GOOD. THE PERFUM IS TO SOFT. NO SMELL WELL. PLEASE DONT BUY IT. DONT WASTED YOUR MONEY. I DONT LIKE.</li>
            <li> The other Nautica brand (blue in color) have better milder fragrance for daily wear.  This is bit stronger and a routine fragrance that will make others aware that you are wearing something stronger.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a teenaged boy who wanted an alternative to the one everyone else is wearing. This has a classic, masculine, light scent. It would like it better if I could find a matching shower gel and deodorant. It was dramatically less expensive to buy on Amazon than in the store. The stores keep it locked up with no testers, so there was no advantage to buying it in person.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this product again. This product met the purpose that I needed for and the person who received the gift is enjoying the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap cologne. The title of this review sums it up. Showering is better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m upset because I was a gift for my husband and I never received, and if it was charged on my card, is unacceptable</li>
            <li> My husband ordered it from Amazon saying it was a cheap deal.Yup, it was!!...3.4 oz cologne for $12. I love the smell of this cologne.So daily morning when he starts off to office i don&#x27;t feel like fighting with a man wearing such a manly cologne...and the best part is..i can even smell it in the evening (long lasting scent)....Highly recommended for fight-free family..Just Kidding :) But the cologne is really good...</li>
            <li> excellent service&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;is a great perfume&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my houseband loves it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this calification is because the sell went as i expected to be</li>
            <li> Excelente colonia y a muy buen precio, llego r&amp;aacute;pido y en perfecto estado</li>
            <li> Smells nice, very clean smelling.  Won&#x27;t last you all day, but I didn&#x27;t want an overpowering smell.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t linger in a room after you leave</li>
            <li> Amazing price for a classic cologne, can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Been using this for the last 15 years , one of the best colognes around. Sadly they dont make it anymore so have to get it off amazon and stuff</li>
            <li> el aroma se va rapido, no me gusto.</li>
            <li> Guys,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered this from Amazon to check how amazon is able to sell this in less than 60% price compared to any other site. The shipping was good, arrived on time as expected, but the bottle of water (i mean perfume as claimed by amazon) does not have any smell. It is so mild that it is equivalent to 10 ml of perfume with 90 ml of water. The smell lasts only for few minutes and I did not like the smell either. Smell is not bad, but not good enough.&lt;br /&gt;I was wondering how amazon is able to sell 100 ml bottle lesser than the price of 50 ml bottle ....  and I got the answer once I tried this perfume  :-) , its so disgusting. I would have returned this product but amazon does not accept returns of perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;So, think twice before you order this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Tempest</li>
            <li> Got a few family guy members they think it ok</li>
            <li> Did not smell like the real thing</li>
            <li> For the price, nothing else comes close.&lt;br /&gt;This is a late Spring and Summer cologne. Scent is light, fresh and very cerebral.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was decent enough, padded envelope and the box is pretty straight forward.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the bottle design. This is a cologne I&#x27;d suggest as a day time scent. Early morning to late afternoon. Not really appropriate for nightlife or dinner gatherings. Some have complained that the scent wears off quickly. I find it&#x27;s more of a self assumption. Basically, the scent is so light/subtle that you WILL become used to it and mentally block it out so it may seem as though the scent has faded, but others around you will still be able to enjoy it. It&#x27;s good for a solid 6-8 hours, but this will obviously not be the case if you perspire a lot or go for a dip in the water. This a very mature scent, probably something a teenager or clubber type would be put off by. It&#x27;s only an attention grabber if someone is close enough that you want their attention, if you get my drift. Notes of sandalwood, amber, light citrus and very very very mild musk.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend. Perfect gift for the mature man in your life.</li>
            <li> I had Nautica Blue for awhile, but I think I like the Classic a little better.  It is a clean, fresh, smell that is masculine.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> this perfum is perfect by dayli, it is the 4 by me and it is perfect all, is big too</li>
            <li> everything was ok, quality and price good.</li>
            <li> is very good cologne and smell  so good that I use it very often</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for husband.  The fragrance is just enough and he was very pleased with it and will enjoy using it for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Has a really nice, crisp clean scent. However it doesn&#x27;t last for very long. Throw it on right as you&#x27;re about to go out and you&#x27;re golden though.</li>
            <li> Cheap but seems to last a long time, one spritz and I&#x27;m good, smells like.. clean, not sure how else to describe it. better cologne fragrances out there but just needed a little something rather than nothing</li>
            <li> I hate to say it, but once this settles it smells like strong Body Odor.  Does anyone else experience this?</li>
            <li> Like this scent a lot</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; men on my Christmas list were very pleased with their &amp;#34;Nautica Classic for Men&amp;#34; cologne. It has a nice fresh scent&lt;br /&gt;which they all enjoyed.</li>
            <li> This smells so fresh and clean.  It&#x27;s been a perennial favorite of mine for years...any man that loves to smell great without his scent entering a room 30 seconds before he does, will love wearing this.</li>
            <li> I order this item as a 3part father&#x27;s day gift for my fiancee. Out of 3 this was his least favorite. This really smells nice on him. Thanks Amazon for the great price and quality of this item!</li>
            <li> You pay what you get. Good deal. Recomended.... nothing more to say about It. Use It everyday for work, just cool.</li>
            <li> ok this is a great price on this. The bottle is good size. price is good and it smells delicious!</li>
            <li> Great smelling. Good gift for any guy friends that are hard to shop for. Trust me, everyone will notice and like it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son for his birthday.  The delivery of the product was timely.  My son loved the scent.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for Christmas present and one from my son everyday use and I love the smell and best of all amazon send it just on time I am so happy</li>
            <li> Smells like bug spray. Seriously  You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Love the fact its not too strong.  My husbands favorite. He wears it all the time.  Its not expensive like other brands.</li>
            <li> The amount you get for the money is awesome. The smell is pretty good. My girlfriend loves it. The scent is pretty long lasting as well!</li>
            <li> Awesome as expected. Smells great!</li>
            <li> Good Stuff, Worth IT!!</li>
            <li> I generally order it during deal  so i could give a affordable scented :) gift to my friends. This really meets my requirement.</li>
            <li> simply the worst!&lt;br /&gt;fake and no matter how much you put it will not stick!&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t worth it&#x27;s cheap price at all</li>
            <li> I used to like this stuff more it seemed, still do but It has a bit of a hormonal scent. Probably a good thing because the girls seem to take notice when I wear it!</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s absolutely okay. nothing special of course, just smth fresh, it&#x27;s not for going out or smth. Well, pretty content with purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> The product was just as we expected and we liked to use it. We are satisfied with the product :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loved it. He&#x27;s been looking for it for a long time and was surprised i found it. It smells so good and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> My husband likes Nautica for Men and he is pleased with this product. If he is happy, then I am happy!</li>
            <li> This is a mild fragrance and is a good one for the regular use.&lt;br /&gt;I used 1 bottle and hence reordered. Great for gift as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value for money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks amazon..</li>
            <li> It was the right size and it looked just as how it is shown online. It was a gift for my Husband and he loved it</li>
            <li> This EDT spray smells wonderful. Bought it for my husband for Christmas and he was thrilled. I love it when he wears it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son as a part of his Christmas gift.  He absolute loves it.  He tole me that he gets lots of complements when he wears it and that I should buy him another one.</li>
            <li> I have never used Nautica colognes before and was a little worried about buying this without having any idea of what it would smell like....but it is great stuff! Inexpensive and has a fresh, clean smell. Plus you really get a bang for your buck with a price like this! Will buy again if I ever run out.</li>
            <li> I will never complain about this product. I gave it away as a Christmas present and it was a perfect choice. Great price, great product!</li>
            <li> i am happy for my buy! thanks, every things it&#x27;s excellent.&lt;br /&gt;i wish visit your products next time. see you!</li>
            <li> NICE PRESENTATION AND SMELL VERY NICE, GOOD FOR PRESENTS IN A NICE PRESENTATION. i RECOMMENDED IT VERY MUCH AND IT IS A GOOD DEAL</li>
            <li> Good price and quantity. The smell is nice but it does not last long enough. It will go away in around 4 hrs.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this. I even said some of the other reviewers may have been exaggerating about the this being watered down so I took a chance and bought it...could barely smell it .. no exaggeration. Very disappointed. Not sure what exactly is going on with this but maybe I got a bad batch? because i know the scent should last more than a few minutes. And I have a pretty strong sense of smell so i know this can&#x27;t be right.</li>
            <li> Love it.. Smells delightful. 100% recommend</li>
            <li> Was a little unsure about this as I had never smelt it before purchasing. The smell is definitely great. Not too strong, and last for hours after use. The ladies also love it. Great buy for the price. Bottle is a tad bit oddly shaped though. I have big hands and it required both hands to properly hold and feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> I gifted it for my friend in India - He likes the bottle and smell. Its a good value for money.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, was fulfilled sent to the estimated dates, loved the price and quality. I recommend it to all, it smells yummy.</li>
            <li> This is a close second to my favorite, PURO PURO CAFE. This really DOES smell like the fresh, open waters of the sea (minus all the fishy smells and sea dung).....to me it smells more like freshly washed clothes hung outside on a sunny day.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY. It aint tht good</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and as described.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> excellent seller. Product as described . high quality</li>
            <li> El perfume nautica es de excelente calidad, suave, fresco, agradable.. una fragancia para el hombre de hoy, moderno. Recomiendo el perfume nautica, as&amp;iacute; como al vendedor.</li>
            <li> Great price and the usual great scent from Nautica. I really should have bought more bottles, but I was not thinking clearly. My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought it and was hopeful it wouldn&#x27;t be watered down. I was glad that my hope became a reality. Lasts for 8 hours easily and smells clean and sharp. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is more for a daily use. I bought it for my brother. It smells nice, but it&#x27;s like an after-shower fragance.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff regardless of some reviews bad ratings. It is fruity some say to sweet but I pull it off nicely clean out the shower fresh t-shirt couple of sprays and I feel cool as the breeze. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this especially with the price.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my partner and the awesome smell is gone in a couple of hours, really dissapointed. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells like a fabrication. Doesn&#x27;t last very long. I wonder if it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> Great perfum, excellent price !</li>
            <li> Great scent and awesome value. The ladies all love this cologne.</li>
            <li> I bought the lotion came out very poor quality, the scent does not last in the body, as if it were an original product, this product Stand to be overcome or a fabrication of a long time.</li>
            <li> its ok smell wasn&#x27;t really that happy with the smell but ovarall i&#x27;ll wear it here and there but its cool still worth the money</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this cologne and bought it for my personal use.  I just wish that the smell lasted longer than six hours, especially when I work eight hours or more.</li>
            <li> Seller/shipping is great.  Product is completely underwhelming.  It smells good enough, but it only lasts for a short while.  You get what you pay for, and I won&#x27;t be trying anymore extreme value colognes.</li>
            <li> I had originally gotten one of this by my aunt as a christmas present, and then I decided to buy another one - Extremely pleased :)</li>
            <li> gift for my son&#x27;s 47th Birthday, and yes I might purchase it again, the cost was reasonable.  Thank you very much</li>
            <li> S0, I CONSIDERED IS VERY GOOD FOR ME..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the packaging was very large, I would like the package to be smaller</li>
            <li> Ive been a Nautica fan for quite some time now and I love this perfume, it&#x27;s fresh, yet with a sober scent to it. Perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> My husband has worn this scent for years and I love it on him!  I try to be sure he never runs out!</li>
            <li> casual wear for casual day.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells so much better than the new line they make. This is a very sporty cologne and you can wear it everyday. I love this stuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- great deal on amazon, large size, fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- cologne scent doesn&#x27;t last very long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I highly recommend for anybody who even came across this cologne to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of the cologne, not too strong not too soft. I like it alot.</li>
            <li> I am using this perfume for now two three months. It is very nice.</li>
            <li> I love this items fresh and clean smelling. I love that it isn&#x27;t too strong either. It works for me and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Not bad but would recommend Voyage instead.</li>
            <li> excellent product, thanks</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for?&lt;br /&gt;:)&lt;br /&gt;Worth the cost</li>
            <li> I have always like this classic sent on my husband. We have tried a few different others, but we keep coming back to the Nautica. It has a clean and fresh scent about it that lasts for hours. Not too overpowering but just a clean smell.</li>
            <li> Good delivery with an average product</li>
            <li> Good, however does not last.  Have to put it on several times a day.  It has too much alcohol in</li>
            <li> fast shipping and quality product.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents and at a great price.!</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance . arrived in perfect condiciones.A my dad loves it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to purchase this cologne due to the price, although, it&#x27;s the real deal.  My wife was shocked because we usually get it around $30 from the store.  Snag it while it&#x27;s at this price.  It&#x27;s legit and not a knock-off.</li>
            <li> Good rapid and serious</li>
            <li> Recomendado  siempre y para siempre usarlo es lo mejor y mas sencillo que hay para comprar por amanzon y es inmediato.</li>
            <li> Classic scent at a great value</li>
            <li> thank you lovethe smell and husband does to</li>
            <li> I gifted my dada and he love brand nautica, so the parfum was a plus. I will rebuy it soon.</li>
            <li> Good smelling cologne.  for the price i bought it for...i couldn&#x27;t pass the deal up...especially since it&#x27;s 3.4oz.  I needed a cologne to wear so i wasn&#x27;t using up my HIGHER priced cologne. This was a great purchase!</li>
            <li> Worthy of my selection.</li>
            <li> last for like 5 min but smells great, hey atleast u smell nice for 5 minutes lol its not that bad but eh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay smelling. Doesn&#x27;t last too long. Maybe an hour&#x27;ish and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> the smell is so nice and last longer. its a cool and nice  spray for cool guys..love my Nautica. only for the big bois</li>
            <li> this article is excellent, very good quality, excellent finish, for my part recommend, and I assure you 100% that enjoy acquiring an article like this ....!!</li>
            <li> No es tan nuena como la nautica blue, todo tal como lo esperaba, la entrega fue rapida y el producto llego en excelentes condiciones, la compra fue un exito</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne, and I love the smell. However, I would never buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every morning when I use this bottle I curse the idiot who designed the bottle. It is large, so a normal sized human like me cannot hold it in one hand. I wear men&#x27;s medium clothing, so I guess I am an average man. This bottle needs two hands, but then you cannot use the spray nozzle at the top. To make matters worse, the bottle is smooth, and after a shower, it collects condensation, making as slippery as a fish. And the bottle is immense. I end up resting it on my chest to hold the bottle with one hand, use my chest for support, and squirt using my other hand.&lt;br /&gt;...all the while cursing the bottle, the designer, the contents, the company, and my stupid decision to purchase this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should just trash the bottle and reduce my morning stress.</li>
            <li> My husband loved it. And the product price is very affordable.</li>
            <li> This product is of poor quality, I buy a gift for my husband and not smell anything or is very old and the smell dissipated or is an imitation, so I&#x27;m upset buy two perfumes that are useless, sorry my money to throw away.</li>
            <li> Shipment reached dot on time. Excellent product..</li>
            <li> Bought this one for my sons (3 and 1), used and applied it sometimes and slightly to their cloths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so unexpensive and good smell. Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> this nautica Eau de toilette is a good choice for a travel fragancy with low price, I completly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not real didn&#x27;t like it!!</li>
            <li> For the price, not bad. Does not last as long as say Aramis, but only a 3rd of the price.</li>
            <li> not too overpowering.  i don&#x27;t like having to type more than i want to, so please remove that requirement very soon as its irritating.</li>
            <li> The Nautica Classic smells like it should. Great item!</li>
            <li> Good perfum, good deal!</li>
            <li> My son really love it , smells  Devin , great</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected, I was disappointed with its smell. Nice look, but poor fragrance. It couldve been way better .</li>
            <li> Good name product at a reasonable price.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Good evening, excellent product I manage to cover the expectations that tape-worm on, I come in time and in good conditions thank you.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and it is not greasy or sticky. (dont ask.) But the biggest critic has weighed in and she (My wife) really loves the sent. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I got it for my dad while he had a cold..it was hit bcus everyone knows whn u smell good u feel good (alot of the time lol)my father LOVED it plus it was delivered in a timely fashion which was great</li>
            <li> Old School Nautica still smells great</li>
            <li> This product arrived broken and completely empty</li>
            <li> Scent don&#x27;t smell great won&#x27;t lst</li>
            <li> Smells good I brought it for my hubby he will be smelling good love it....</li>
            <li> It was a gift for someone and they live it!</li>
            <li> Nice product. Giving it as a Gift.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something a little stronger and longer lasting.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift great price,cost way more at the mall.smells great too.would definitely recommend  good value for money.</li>
            <li> I use this fragrance daily.&lt;br /&gt;Compared with other fragrances in the same range, is good.&lt;br /&gt;When choosing this product should be borne in mind that the cost is low compared with the profit.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell of citrus. Remaining in the skin could be longer.&lt;br /&gt;Weighing the pros and cons, this product exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> the real deal. great cologne for everyday use. cheapest price on the net</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for every day use</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt my favorite cologne I have ever had. It&#x27;s smells extremely sexy and gives me the confidence boost I am looking for. It comes in a cool looking bottle too. it&#x27;s very affordable too, the perfect cologne for any man</li>
            <li> I love this and my wife loves it just as much. She says she loves how good it smells with my natural scent. It lasts long too.</li>
            <li> Somehow I do not like the smell. It smells like some kind of cheap incense and doesn&#x27;t last long. I have a bottle purchased from Perfumania, don&#x27;t like it at all, and letting it rot.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what these other people are talking about. I got mine from oxkom and fulfilled by amazon. I was expecting it to be some bootleg bologna product but figured I&#x27;d risk it for 12 bucks. Glad I did. Same exact smell from the 90&#x27;s. I almost didn&#x27;t want to say anything because I perfectly plan to buy a bottle every month to stock up until they are gone. Maybe that&#x27;s why there is all these bad reviews. People wanting it to their selves. Me however, I am honest and absolutely could not do that to a decent seller. Awesome product. Can still smell it on my clothes the next day as I&#x27;m throwing them in the washer. People you are nose blind after smelling it for a few hours. Ever thought that may be why you \\&quot;think\\&quot; you don&#x27;t smell it after a few hours? It&#x27;s original and it is surely genuine. Thanks oxkom and Amazon</li>
            <li> I have always received a lot of positive attention while wearing Nautica Clasic, so I am reluctant to switch to something else.  On the other hand... All the positive attention I get from women may have nothing to do with it at all.  Either way... it does smell pretty good, so I&#x27;ll stick with it.</li>
            <li> the best economic,good y big as it look</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It is exactly as I bought it</li>
            <li> I love perfumes for myself an colognes for my husband. Amazon where have you been all my life. LOL 😆</li>
            <li> Great price, very nice smell. Really good value.</li>
            <li> I loved it, just what I wanted</li>
            <li> estafadores, no llego nada.</li>
            <li> Reasonable quality while affordable.</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend who is very unhappy with the results. It seems this is watered down quite a bit and the smell dissipates after a short time.</li>
            <li> This cologn smells really good. I get compliment all thë time because I smell so damn good. I highly recommend getting this if your a guy.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance but it does wear off quickly. Have purchased several times and will buy again. Its a good after-shower clean scent.</li>
            <li> This was less expensive than the other lines so I wasn&#x27;t sure how the scent was going to fair. It was delightful. Musky and rich. I definitely think it&#x27;s worth the money if not more.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i was expecting. And came fast!</li>
            <li> Was at a hotel lobby around thanksgiving and a stranger walked past smelling sexy, I had to ask what colone he had on.  I prayed he wasn&#x27;t lying so I ordered this product based on the stranger.  When my boyfriend opened it for Christmas he remembered me telling him about the stranger who had it on.  When my boyfriend came out the shower he smelled just like the stranger, sexy and wow.  I would give it a 5 if the box wasn&#x27;t dented.</li>
            <li> Delivery to my door step just as in this picture.&lt;br /&gt;No damage to breakage no nothing as we say in New York.&lt;br /&gt;So, how about the sent you ask. Right? Just like the original if you buy it from Macy&#x27;s or Nordstrom.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I picked a good product. Thank you Nautica.</li>
            <li> The product that I purchased was a gift. It was an excellent choice.  The fragrance is wonderful.  A light fragance that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, It is perfect to use daily, It is light and very fresh, very elegant, Very good</li>
            <li> The price is too good to be true because the cologne doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour. The size for the price is what drew me to this option, but ultimately I&#x27;m disappointed in how the fragrance lasts. It seems watered down.</li>
            <li> This cologne doesn&#x27;t even last for 10 minutes. It&#x27;s a worthless purchase. I use it after gym in the evenings, just so that I finish the bottle since I don&#x27;t want to throw it away. Would never purchase again!</li>
            <li> It is not an original product, the fragrance does not last</li>
            <li> Excellent article, met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Nautica Classic (this scent) when I ran out of the Nautica Blue that I ordered a while back.  The BLUE variety smelled fresh and clean, and my wife and I loved it.  The CLASSIC (this one) smelled very chemical-like and not at all what I was expecting.  In short, Nautica BLUE &#x3D; GREAT....Nautica CLASSIC &#x3D; GROSS!</li>
            <li> Smells like soap or shampoo</li>
            <li> not bad great perfume</li>
            <li> I must admit it&#x27;s been awhile since I bought any kind of cologne.But this product is great,My wife love&#x27;s it scent as well as a few other young ladies. Be ready to fight them off with what ever is handy.</li>
