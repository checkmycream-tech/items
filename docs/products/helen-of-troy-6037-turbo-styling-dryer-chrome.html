            <li>I love Helen of Troy hair tools.</li>
            <li>The air blown added static to hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be giving this to Goodwill and getting a better one.</li>
            <li>I have had many brands of hair dryers over the years</li>
            <li>but this is truly the most quiet and the best drying one I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask more from a hair dryer</li>
            <li>It is a good looking dryer and it seems to fit the hand very comfortably with its special grip handle.  </li>

            <li>Love how powerful it is,</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I bought another,</li>
            <li>Works fast nice product</li>
            <li>First let me say, they don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like they used to, but this is a pretty good one.</li>
            <li>dries it SUPER quick!</li>
            <li>It was kind of too loud.</li>
            <li>This is my second Helen of Troy product and I am very satisfied with the performance.</li>
            <li>I needed a good hairdryer with a long electrical cord, and this dryer did the trick.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight but powerful.  </li>
            <li>So I was pleased to read several reviews that stated the Helen of Troy dryers did the job quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>As a couple of others noted, the concentrator attachment doesn&#x27;t fit snuggly and doesn&#x27;t stay on very well, which is most likely why the one I purchased was returned.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is easy to use and I especially like the Cool Shot to lock in hair style.</li>
            <li>I am so far so impressed with this hair dryer that I am also seriously considering purchasing a Helen of Troy travel style model.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>My first Helen of troy died after a year.  </li>
            <li>A little more money but worth it!</li>
            <li>I received the hair dryer very quickly and from the several times</li>
            <li>Love my new hairdryer and would definitely recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It dries my hair faster and its not as frizzy as normal!</li>
            <li>I have to say that this particular dryer met 99% of my expectations...</li>
            <li>and I give the seller high remarks</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I paid a little more than half price for an open-box item and it is a great little blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I had heard something to the effect through the years that these hair dryers hold up real well and can truly be considered to be a professional&#x27;s choice.  </li>
            <li>It finally died right at the 30 year mark and my replacement nightmare began.</li>
            <li>When we went on vacation and took only his dryer to share, I really could tell the difference how this model of the Helen of Troy dried my hair much quicker and made the styling of my hair better.  </li>
            <li>the second one stopped blowing hot air after 2 months.  </li>
            <li>I dry my hair and it is so hot</li>
            <li>They last long and are powerful.  </li>
            <li>If you are thinking about buying a new hair dryer, well look no further!  </li>
            <li>When compared to salon-quality dryers it doesn&#x27;t dry quite as fast, thus the 4-star rating instead of 5.  </li>
            <li>My old one broke after several years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Having said all that, I would definitely recommend this styling dryer based on its smaller physical size, the styling features it offers, its pleasant-looking design and its overall price.</li>

            <li> There is  lot of blowing power behind this dryer and it does  a fine job completely blowing my hard to dry hair in a timely yet gentle manner.  </li>
            <li> Watt Professional Hair Dryer #6037, as I had gone through a number of other brand hair dryers of recent and never owned a Helen of Troy product.  </li>
            <li> Extra long cord.</li>
            <li> You could hardly tell it was blowing when it was on high</li>
            <li> but I suspect it will last a while due to previous reviewer comments.</li>
            <li> figured maybe we were just rough on it.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> After 5 minutes, my hair was still wet.</li>
            <li> I have to use my other hand to slide the switch up to the desired setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wanted to stay away from expensive, bulky and heavy type dryers while still considering visual appeal, drying features and overall price.</li>
            <li> I have really long and thick hair and this hair dryer</li>
            <li> This time I tried a little Con-air portable that sounded like it was breaking every time you folded/</li>
            <li> There is also a cold shot button which really aids to setting any curl or waves you may want to place in your hair.  </li>
            <li> It also runs a bit hot, which is bad for your hair.</li>
            <li> No love lost though.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it just the design or if mine is faulty.</li>
            <li> I am not a weakling, but my arms get really tired when I&#x27;m using this dryer.</li>
            <li> You will NOT go wrong ordering this.</li>
            <li> It was mediocre and way under powered.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as its replacement and haven&#x27;t been disappointed.  </li>

            <li> Switch broke after 2 months. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of the Helen of Troy hair dryers for years.  My old one broke after several years.  I have been very happy with this hair dryer and the placement of the on-off buttons.  I read someone&#x27;s review which lead me to purchase this model.  You will be happy with this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I love Helen of Troy hair tools. My last hair dryer gave out after 3 years of use. I replaced it with this one and I LOVE it! It dries my hair faster and its not as frizzy as normal! I have really long and thick hair and this hair dryer dries it SUPER quick! Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> It was kind of too loud. The air blown added static to hair. I ended up returning this item.</li>
            <li> Great product better and cheaper than expectations good shipping and I give the seller high remarks</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Helen of Troy Chrome 1875 Watt Professional Hair Dryer #6037, as I had gone through a number of other brand hair dryers of recent and never owned a Helen of Troy product.  I had heard something to the effect through the years that these hair dryers hold up real well and can truly be considered to be a professional&#x27;s choice.  So with this in mind, I went ahead with my purchase.  I received the hair dryer very quickly and from the several times I have used it already, I am very impressed.  It is a good looking dryer and it seems to fit the hand very comfortably with its special grip handle.  There is  lot of blowing power behind this dryer and it does  a fine job completely blowing my hard to dry hair in a timely yet gentle manner.  I am so far so impressed with this hair dryer that I am also seriously considering purchasing a Helen of Troy travel style model.  There is also a cold shot button which really aids to setting any curl or waves you may want to place in your hair.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an excellent quality hair dryer at a somewhat reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I am not a weakling, but my arms get really tired when I&#x27;m using this dryer. It also runs a bit hot, which is bad for your hair. I&#x27;ll be giving this to Goodwill and getting a better one.</li>
            <li> I used my last Helen of Troy hairdryer for ten years, I was bummed when it finally quit on me.  I purchased this as its replacement and haven&#x27;t been disappointed.  Good air flow, dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Love how powerful it is, its lite weight and the cool setting is awesome would recommend to everyone that is looking for a blow dryer that lasts.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is easy to use and I especially like the Cool Shot to lock in hair style. I bought a ceramic brush and they work well together. The concentrator is an essential. You will NOT go wrong ordering this.</li>
            <li> After reviewing myriad hand-held hair dryer products and what fellow consumers had to say about performance/price/problems, I made the low risk decision to buy the Helen of Troy Styling Dryer (model 6037).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to stay away from expensive, bulky and heavy type dryers while still considering visual appeal, drying features and overall price. I have to say that this particular dryer met 99% of my expectations...the only drawback it has for me (but perhaps not for others) is that the power on/blower speed switch is a slider type found at the narrowest front part of the handle which slides upward to operate the dryer. Perhaps its the size of my hands that don&#x27;t let me turn it on using one hand motion...I have to use my other hand to slide the switch up to the desired setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all that, I would definitely recommend this styling dryer based on its smaller physical size, the styling features it offers, its pleasant-looking design and its overall price.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer.  My husband had bought this style of dryer and I was using another type.  When we went on vacation and took only his dryer to share, I really could tell the difference how this model of the Helen of Troy dried my hair much quicker and made the styling of my hair better.  I would recommend this dryer to anyone.</li>
            <li> great dryer i own two.</li>
            <li> My first Helen of troy died after a year.  I liked it so much that I bought another, figured maybe we were just rough on it.  the second one stopped blowing hot air after 2 months.  I will never buy another.</li>
            <li> It meets all my expectations.</li>
            <li> Love my new hairdryer and would definitely recommend it.  Can&#x27;t beat cost vs. quality.  I have only been using it for a few weeks now but I suspect it will last a while due to previous reviewer comments.</li>
            <li> Very good airflow and not too loud. Very comfortable to hold as well. This is my second Helen of Troy product and I am very satisfied with the performance.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 of these through the years and I still have not found a dryer that has enough blowing power and this one.</li>
            <li> Works fast nice product</li>
            <li> First let me say, they don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like they used to, but this is a pretty good one. I had an 80&#x27;s era, monster Con-air blow dryer that I received for my birthday...30+ years ago. I loved that thing! It finally died right at the 30 year mark and my replacement nightmare began. So I bought a Vidal Sassoon that lasted me almost 3 years before quitting. No love lost though. It was mediocre and way under powered. This time I tried a little Con-air portable that sounded like it was breaking every time you folded/un-folded the handle. You could hardly tell it was blowing when it was on high and there was almost no heat. I am a lady with a super-short boy cut. After 5 minutes, my hair was still wet. That one went back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading reviews on several blow dryers here on Amazon, it seems the under-powered problem abounds everywhere nowadays. So I was pleased to read several reviews that stated the Helen of Troy dryers did the job quickly and efficiently. I paid a little more than half price for an open-box item and it is a great little blow dryer. As a couple of others noted, the concentrator attachment doesn&#x27;t fit snuggly and doesn&#x27;t stay on very well, which is most likely why the one I purchased was returned. It&#x27;s still not 80&#x27;s, big-hair wonderful, but it&#x27;s still pretty good.</li>
            <li> I needed a good hairdryer with a long electrical cord, and this dryer did the trick.  It does its job well.  When compared to salon-quality dryers it doesn&#x27;t dry quite as fast, thus the 4-star rating instead of 5.  When compared to consumer-grade dryers, it is a great dryer!</li>
            <li> One of the best hair driers ever love it cost handling are wonderful</li>
            <li> The dryer has 3 speeds and modes.  It is lightweight but powerful.  Highly recommended.  Try it and you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I have had many brands of hair dryers over the years but this is truly the most quiet and the best drying one I&#x27;ve purchased.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.  A little more money but worth it!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask more from a hair dryer</li>
            <li> If you are thinking about buying a new hair dryer, well look no further!  This is our second Helen of Troy and we bought this one so we could have one upstairs and another downstairs.  It&#x27;s the BEST!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Extra long cord.</li>
            <li> My last two hair dryers have been Helen of Troy.  They last long and are powerful.  This one doesn&#x27;t dissappoint either but I didn&#x27;t give five stars because the attachment that fits on the end falls off everytime I dry my hair and it is so hot i cant put it back on.  Not sure if it just the design or if mine is faulty.</li>
            <li> Good performance and durability to date</li>
    </ol>
