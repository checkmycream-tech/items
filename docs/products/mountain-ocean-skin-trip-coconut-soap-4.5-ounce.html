            <li>The difference is that this soap feels amazing on your skin in the shower and then continues to moisturize and smell fantastic when you get out of the shower and dry off.</li>
            <li>It is top quality natural soap.</li>
            <li>It lathers well, smells good but not overpowering and leaves a nice fragrance behind on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the squeaky clean feeling and shy away from body washes and this soap is the best bar soap I have found.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, but leaves it nicely moisturized.  </li>
            <li>My face loves this very much.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 3 years and often wonder if the compliments I receive about how young I look can be attributed to this quality face soap.</li>
            <li>I wish they made a natural oil scent you can wear.</li>
            <li>This soap is not super cheap considering that you can get 2 things of Dove soap for about the same price.</li>
            <li>I found this soap to be very helpful with my dry skin, and had no issues using it on my face as well.</li>
            <li>It does not dry your skin out or make it feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>It feels really pure and has enough scent that you can tell you are \\&quot;clean\\&quot; but isn&#x27;t too perfumy or heavy feeling.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN AND OR ARE ALLERGIC TO FRAGRANCE DO NOT USE. TERRIBLE ON THE EYES. I just had to pay 150.00 for an eye perscription to get rid of the allergies brought on by this soap!!</li>
            <li> This soap is not super cheap considering that you can get 2 things of Dove soap for about the same price. The difference is that this soap feels amazing on your skin in the shower and then continues to moisturize and smell fantastic when you get out of the shower and dry off. I prefer the squeaky clean feeling and shy away from body washes and this soap is the best bar soap I have found. It feels really pure and has enough scent that you can tell you are \\&quot;clean\\&quot; but isn&#x27;t too perfumy or heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic soap. I even use it to wash my hair. It leaves it soft and shiny. My face loves this very much.</li>
            <li> This soap is very easy on the skin.  It lathers well, smells good but not overpowering and leaves a nice fragrance behind on your skin.  It also makes your skin feel good, not drying at all.  I would rate it as a very good thing to use in your shower.</li>
            <li> It is nice but a bit pricey. We wouldn&#x27;t buy it again unless the price comes down.</li>
            <li> The soap arrived quickly after I ordered it.  This was at the last of Christmas rush. I opened it this month and have been very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Great lather and nice fragrance.  keeps my skin moisturized and free of BO.&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this soap.  It is mild, yet leaves the skin clean.  One bar lasts about 3-4 months. It lathers nicely and washes off with no residue.  Having sensitive skin is a challenge when it comes to what product to use.  I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 3 years and often wonder if the compliments I receive about how young I look can be attributed to this quality face soap.</li>
            <li> This Skin Trip Coconut soap is more than just great smelling. It is top quality natural soap. I highly recommend this soap to all Coconut lovers. If you love the smell of Coconut then this product is for you!!</li>
            <li> This is a really great product and smells so good!  It does not dry your skin out or make it feel greasy.  After you use it, you smell so good all day.</li>
            <li> Great product I loved the lotion had to try the soap very gentle and what a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I love the Skin Trip moisturizer so I thought the soap would be great too.  It was so stinky I had to throw it out after using it a couple of times.  Maybe I got a bar from a bad batch, I don&#x27;t know, but I won&#x27;t be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Have used this product since the 70&#x27;s  Love It!</li>
            <li> I just started using the creamy coconut Skin Trip soap and I absolutely love it!  It smells terrific and feels great to the skin.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, but leaves it nicely moisturized.  It has quickly becomy my favorite soap.</li>
            <li> This soap is very gentle for sensitive skin, non-drying, with a wonderful lather.  Also, I asked the company and they said:  \\&quot;None of our products are made in China or made with ingredients imported from China.\\&quot;  So you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about all the toxic ingredients in OTHER soaps that do import ingredients from China.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It is natural, lathers well and has a wonderful coconut scent. I like the other products as well.</li>
            <li> Great long-lasting coconut scent and a nice, creamy lather.  I found this soap to be very helpful with my dry skin, and had no issues using it on my face as well.</li>
            <li> This soap seems to never melt. It&#x27;s fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;Use with the Skin Trip Coconut Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I love Coconut Skin Trip anything! This soap smells good enough to eat and leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this soap! It is the only one that I use that doesn&#x27;t have the residue feel. Plus, the scent is wonderful! I wish they made a natural oil scent you can wear.</li>
            <li> Several years ago, I picked up a bottle of Skin Trip Moisture lotion to use for after-sun care on a beach vacation. The product worked so well on my sensitive, fair, easily-sunburned skin that I came to Amazon to see if the company made any other skin care products. Since then, Skin Trip coconut soap has been part of my beauty routine, not just at the beach house during the summers but in my shower all year long. Keep it dry between uses; don&#x27;t allow it to sit in a soggy soap box. That&#x27;s the key to getting the longest use out of each delightful bar.</li>
            <li> If my wife happens to drop a bar of this soap in the shower....  Needn&#x27;t say much more, need I?</li>
