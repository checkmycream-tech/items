            <li>My sister told me to get this brand because she really liked it.</li>
            <li>it makes perfect straight lines</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and control.</li>
            <li>I do a nice wing on each eye to work as an accountant :)</li>
            <li>On the plus side it&#x27;s very easy to wash off - most of the time</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s even better is that if I accidentally rub my eye (which I do often) it won&#x27;t smudge at all - that is,</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li>I wear contact lenses and I am constantly refreshing them.  </li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner</li>
            <li>love the product.</li>
            <li>Easy and quick to use and goes on perfect the first time; dries quickly, which is a must and have great coverage the first swipe around</li>
            <li>The price was right, and I am very satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>This is one product that proves the validity of that, for sure!</li>
            <li>i love this product, and it&#x27;s super inexpensive !</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, fantastic makeup at a fantastic price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised how great this eyeliner is considering</li>
            <li>and i loved it so much</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot from this brand because it was relatively cheap but decided to give it a try and have loved this eyeliner ever since.</li>
            <li>And smooth swipe effect..</li>
            <li>Fantastic results</li>
            <li>Great long brush applicator.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smear very easily and it lasts a long time so you aren&#x27;t buying more eyeliner every month.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the best things aren&#x27;t the most expensive.</li>
            <li>It works fine on top of my lid, and as for the wing I use my last liquid liner brush in this one, because it is thinner and has a point.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner is easy to apply (although the brush is a bit long)</li>
            <li>is my first time ever using liquid eyeliner, and so far I like it much better than pencil or gel.</li>
            <li>i love the shape the brush has, and i love the intensity of the black.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted I&#x27;m going to keep buying it</li>
            <li>Of all the liquid liners I&#x27;ve used the last 10 years this is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>but tht&#x27;s just my sensitivity to certain makeup...</li>
            <li>The top ten has mostly high-priced products but it mentioned Maybelline New York Eye Studio gel (it actually is a soft solid).</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t that much of an inconvenience for me</li>
            <li>i love wet n</li>
            <li>wild for having great quality and not to hard on the pockets... definitely gonna keep ordering.</li>
            <li>I ordered it the first time hoping that it wasnt wattery but didn&#x27;t dry out fast either</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, it does cause a tiny bit of irritation when it first goes on, but it goes away within minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too runny or thick, and it&#x27;s easy to control because of the brush tip.</li>
            <li>The only thing that is kind of tedious is that when im removing it at the end of the day, it&#x27;s really smudgy and gets all over my eyes, but it&#x27;s not a big deal</li>
            <li>its really hard to put on and its cheap.</li>
            <li>It is soft and flexible, allowing you to easily create winged looks or just a casual every-day line.</li>

            <li> It is soft and flexible, allowing you to easily create winged looks or just a casual every-day line.</li>
            <li> The price is right and it seemed other women caught on because the black was out of stock at several places.  </li>
            <li> It took me at least a half hour to apply, clean up the smudges, reapply and so on.  </li>
            <li> I only need a wet washcloth</li>
            <li> so I will update later down the line.</li>

            <li> The brush is a little bigger than I&#x27;m use to and doesn&#x27;t taper at the end into a point.  </li>
            <li> The tube seems endless too.</li>
            <li> While it does dull out, it&#x27;s like most eye products - after a few hours, it might need to be touched up, but nothing crazy.</li>
            <li> It stays just as dark as the time I put it on.</li>
            <li> it makes u look like u have a black eye[:-</li>
            <li> With the eyeliner I was using, it would be a drippy, black mess all over my face.</li>
            <li> This little tube of smudge proof eyeliner did the trick.  </li>
            <li> i still like it.started to burn a little</li>
            <li> Liquid eyeliner is a messy job.  </li>
            <li> I can finally make a thin line or even thick line.</li>
            <li> The applicator isn&#x27;t hard and doesn&#x27;t leave harsh marks like some others.</li>
            <li> Hard to apply because of shape of tube and applicator.</li>
            <li> Because I have shaky hands, I have my roommate apply my eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> this sucks so bad!</li>
            <li> Poor product, it smears terribly</li>

            <li> My sister told me to get this brand because she really liked it. And I must say, for the price point I&#x27;m blown away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time ever using liquid eyeliner, and so far I like it much better than pencil or gel. This kind specifically is amazing. It&#x27;s not too runny or thick, and it&#x27;s easy to control because of the brush tip. It goes on shiny but dries matte, which I like. I put on two layers and I don&#x27;t have to touch it for the rest of the day. It stays just as dark as the time I put it on. It&#x27;s awesome! What&#x27;s even better is that if I accidentally rub my eye (which I do often) it won&#x27;t smudge at all - that is, unless i manage to rub a tear in it, which doesn&#x27;t happen that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that this is NOT waterproof. At all. One drop of water and it dissolves away. This isn&#x27;t that much of an inconvenience for me but it could be for others. On the plus side it&#x27;s very easy to wash off - most of the time I only need a wet washcloth and it comes off clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, it does cause a tiny bit of irritation when it first goes on, but it goes away within minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, fantastic makeup at a fantastic price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised how great this eyeliner is considering it&#x27;s so cheap! It doesn&#x27;t smear very easily and it lasts a long time so you aren&#x27;t buying more eyeliner every month.</li>
            <li> Poor product, it smears terribly</li>
            <li> I wear contact lenses and I am constantly refreshing them.  With the eyeliner I was using, it would be a drippy, black mess all over my face. This little tube of smudge proof eyeliner did the trick.  The price was right, and I am very satisfied with my purchase.  Yes, I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> this sucks so bad! its really hard to put on and its cheap. it makes u look like u have a black eye[:-((]</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot from this brand because it was relatively cheap but decided to give it a try and have loved this eyeliner ever since. The applicator isn&#x27;t hard and doesn&#x27;t leave harsh marks like some others. It is soft and flexible, allowing you to easily create winged looks or just a casual every-day line. The tube seems endless too. I&#x27;ve had this for a little while and even when I expect to run out, there is still some left. While it does dull out, it&#x27;s like most eye products - after a few hours, it might need to be touched up, but nothing crazy. Great product for a beginner liquid eyeliner user. Very easy to use and control.</li>
            <li> i like it..... it makes perfect straight lines...thought it was thinner but either way i still like it.started to burn a little but tht&#x27;s just my sensitivity to certain makeup...overall i like it.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT use it every day!!  I do a nice wing on each eye to work as an accountant :)</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner it does a good job even though i buy it at .99c stores</li>
            <li> Of all the liquid liners I&#x27;ve used the last 10 years this is my absolute favorite. Easy and quick to use and goes on perfect the first time; dries quickly, which is a must and have great coverage the first swipe around so you don&#x27;t have to keep applying; also it lasts about all day. Through work and even when I sweat it&#x27;s there when I get home and looking good until I take it off before bed. And, for that price, I&#x27;m ecstatic. Sometimes the best things aren&#x27;t the most expensive. This is one product that proves the validity of that, for sure!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted I&#x27;m going to keep buying it</li>
            <li> It works, it does what it should, but it takes me about three layers to get it black; to actually cover my skin.  The brush is a little bigger than I&#x27;m use to and doesn&#x27;t taper at the end into a point.  It works fine on top of my lid, and as for the wing I use my last liquid liner brush in this one, because it is thinner and has a point.</li>
            <li> I ordered it the first time hoping that it wasnt wattery but didn&#x27;t dry out fast either... and i loved it so much i ordered it again, ITS awesome. Great long brush applicator. And smooth swipe effect.., GREATLY RECOMMEND THIS EYELINER... i love wet n wild for having great quality and not to hard on the pockets... definitely gonna keep ordering.</li>
            <li> I had gotten this when it was one in stock left and it got delievered on time and it looks nice on me, i just need makeup remover and might have to buy another one because my sister claims she didnt steal it !</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner is easy to apply (although the brush is a bit long) The line on my eyes lasts for almost 10 hours!   I think I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good , it does what eyeliners are supposed to . I have to master it myself but if you&#x27;re a makeup wearer , this is good</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner!</li>
            <li> love the product. will buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I really love this eyeliner! i love the shape the brush has, and i love the intensity of the black. It&#x27;s not felt tip which is perfect for me. The only thing that is kind of tedious is that when im removing it at the end of the day, it&#x27;s really smudgy and gets all over my eyes, but it&#x27;s not a big deal and i can just remove it with makeup remover. i love this product, and it&#x27;s super inexpensive !</li>
            <li> I like the thinness of the brush and how it applies on my eyelids. I can finally make a thin line or even thick line. I just got it so I don&#x27;t know if it dries out so I will update later down the line. I am happy with the packaging, and also the delivery was what it state.</li>
            <li> Because I have shaky hands, I have my roommate apply my eyeliner.  Liquid eyeliner is a messy job.  It took me at least a half hour to apply, clean up the smudges, reapply and so on.  I did some research on the best eyeliners.  The top ten has mostly high-priced products but it mentioned Maybelline New York Eye Studio gel (it actually is a soft solid). BINGO!  Fantastic results and I can apply it myself!  The price is right and it seemed other women caught on because the black was out of stock at several places.  GREAT stuff..you will never use liquid eyeliner again!</li>
            <li> Hard to apply because of shape of tube and applicator.</li>
