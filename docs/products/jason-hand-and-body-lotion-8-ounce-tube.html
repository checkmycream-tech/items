            <li>Of course when I needed to get more, I checked Amazon and found this 3-pack for a great price and auto-ship!  </li>
            <li>Then I put on Jason&#x27;s and it felt so good.</li>
            <li>I sure hope Amazon sellers continue to sell this great product.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is amazing for sun burbs.</li>
            <li>The combination of healing aloe and moisturizing lotion really works great!  </li>
            <li>An excellent, reasonably priced, non-greasy soothing lotion without an overwhelming scent .</li>
            <li>It absorbs very easy and yet is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is perfect, spreading easily and absorbing fully.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is very good lotion for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is more like a cream than a gel and can be used year around, not just on the beach.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this gel for seven years, and it&#x27;s simply the best.     </li>
            <li>This item can get pricey at upscale retailers, but you save here on Amazon and you can save even more at iHerb, where first-time customers who enter \\&quot;XAY240\\&quot; get five bucks off, no strings attached.  </li>
            <li>One more tip: Keep a bottle of this gel in your fridge.</li>
            <li>This product is so soothing and healing; I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion and will use it forever.</li>
            <li>I use to love this.</li>
            <li>The added ingredients I suppose make it feel extra creamy and delightful on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because it is OK</li>
            <li>I ordered more.</li>
            <li>I love this product..</li>
            <li>Scent not as appealing.</li>
            <li>and I loved the lotion soo much</li>
            <li>but like it, it is not greasy and goes on easily.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find the scent strong at all.  </li>
            <li>This lotion absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
            <li>I have huge aloe plants and could have easily rubbed the slimy stuff on my arms</li>
            <li>I still use this product, it is the best I have found, but I wish I could go back to the old product.</li>
            <li>It tones your face and leaves you feeling cool and hydrated.</li>
            <li>better tan the highly advertised lotion on T.V.!.</li>
            <li>It is full of known toxins and carciogens.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and soaks in right away.  </li>
            <li>It hydrates, relieves sunburn, soothes irritated skin and best of all (in my case) repairs cracked, dry feet better than harsh products designed for \\&quot;problem\\&quot; feet.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel amazing, but the smell is just gross.</li>
            <li>It was a bit pricey but thought it was worth a try with the amount of Aloe Vera in it.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try a lotion with more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It soothes, soaks right in and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>while being super gentle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and like it very much.  </li>
            <li>Jaason always has the best products, even if they are expensive.</li>
            <li>I was out on a boat for most of a weekend and didn&#x27;t realize how burnt I had gotten, until the next day.  </li>
            <li>I much preferred when I could see the attractive, clear green gel inside.    </li>
            <li>I put just some aloe on at first, but it didn&#x27;t really give me any relief.</li>
            <li>I tend to have dry skin and this works better than any I have tried---</li>
            <li>However, I would recommend the healing ability of this Jason product over anything else I have ever tried, even pure aloe gel.</li>
            <li>My one complaint is that Jason recently switched from a nice clear bottle to a solid white/yellowish one that I don&#x27;t find attractive.</li>
            <li>My mom is 92 and really loves this lotion.</li>
            <li>Southwest cracked hands is a real problem...  </li>
            <li>I just sent some to my sister who is very restricted as to what she can use.  </li>
            <li>The delivery time was reasonable and product well packaged.</li>
            <li>It is thicker than some &#x27;lotions&#x27; but provides a much deeper level of protection and comfort.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is very soothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I accidentally ordered it when really searching for 100% Aloe Vera gel.</li>
            <li>I have very itchyspots on my arms and after using this just a few days they were completely better.  </li>
            <li>As far as its overall moisturizing abilities, I think that this product does an okay job, but that plain old [[ASIN:B0034F9K36 Jergens]] does one better.</li>
            <li>So when I finished up the large tube that was 15 years old</li>
            <li>This seems to be good quality, but smells quite different than the exact same lotion we previously bought from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I tried it three times and it made my whole face red like sunburn and the first time it lasted about an hour</li>
            <li>Well, I put this on right after my shower and don&#x27;t have to reapply until the next shower!  </li>
            <li>They are all natural, and high quality.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to scents</li>
            <li>Plus iHerb lets you select a free sample of their other natural products each time you order.     </li>
            <li>I found the first of three tubes to be only about half full.  </li>
            <li>I will not use this product again and am disappointed because I loved the original formula and never had issues.</li>
            <li>so fixed my awfully dry skin in one week, it doesnt leave you feeling greasy, it has more aloe than any other product.</li>
            <li>I however am sensitive to the fragrance used in it.</li>
            <li>All I have to say is go to Natural Skincare Authority website and read the review there.</li>
            <li>I picked this up from a clearance rack at Walgreens because they were getting rid of an old package design.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten mild sunburn a few times so far this Spring.  </li>
            <li>It is very soothing if your skin is dry, like mine and even relieves any itch.  </li>
            <li>I think the last tube might just be half full also.</li>
            <li>I had never heard of it before, but was intrigued by a lotion with 84% aloe, and it has not disappointed in the least.  </li>

            <li> I had never heard of it before, but was intrigued by a lotion with 84% aloe, and it has not disappointed in the least.  </li>
            <li> Within a couple of weeks this settled down, but I was surprised at the initial reaction.</li>
            <li> Also the bottle is small so if you are using it as an all over lotion, you will go through it really fast.</li>
            <li> At times it IS the only lotion that can handle super tough dry skin issues on faces (and scalp for you men)</li>
            <li> This is not exactly the same formula.</li>
            <li> I had a dry, itchy rash on my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> and after that it lasted for at least a day and my face was sensitive for several days.  </li>
            <li> No greasy mess left on my skin to get all over my clothes.  </li>
            <li> I prefer it to other hand creams.  </li>
            <li> would not give it to my family members who have chronic allergies, however, due to the additives, including the scent.  </li>
            <li> I compared the labels and there are only small differences but for me it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and even to soften my very rough heals.</li>
            <li> Other brands tend not to absorb as well, leaving a \\&quot;mask\\&quot; that weighs you down.     </li>
            <li> I did that for the next 4 days and while my husband was peeling like crazy, I barely peeled at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not available in stores in my area, and it&#x27;s a staple in our home.  </li>
            <li> My rash,probably stress-related, went away with a few days</li>
            <li> I was worried that my sunburn prone pale skin would freak out during the six weeks of treatment.  </li>
            <li> I used aloe vera plant juice on sunburn and insecct bites in the past</li>
            <li> On each occasion, I applied this lotion no more than twice, and my burns healed themselves!  </li>
            <li> I slathered (seriously)</li>
            <li> It has a weird after smell, it&#x27;s hard to explain, but def not something you want to smell all day.</li>
            <li> Buy it as a gift set and it doesn&#x27;t seem as expensive.</li>
            <li> Recently recommended it to someone who used it on his face after shaving and said it stung horribly.</li>
            <li> I had this horrible rash on my wrist and arms, which was not identifiable by my doctor.</li>
            <li> Nothing relieves sunburn like COLD aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li> She loves this product and was disappointed when she could no longer get it at her drug store.</li>
            <li> Radiation burns can be very painful.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very good moisturizer cream.</li>
            <li> Aloe is the best moisturizer there is, and this product has been my favorite for years. It is more like a cream than a gel and can be used year around, not just on the beach. I wish it came in bigger units.</li>
            <li> Jaason always has the best products, even if they are expensive. My mom is 92 and really loves this lotion. Buy it as a gift set and it doesn&#x27;t seem as expensive. I recommend all Jaason products. They are all natural, and high quality.</li>
            <li> Here in the desert Southwest cracked hands is a real problem...  but not with Jason&#x27;s usage...its the best I;ve tried...Aveno nothwithstanding....</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and ran out so I found it on Amazon.  I see by the package that it has improved its formula.  I tried it three times and it made my whole face red like sunburn and the first time it lasted about an hour and after that it lasted for at least a day and my face was sensitive for several days.  I will not use this product again and am disappointed because I loved the original formula and never had issues.</li>
            <li> Ok, min word count, i cant just say AWESOME.... so fixed my awfully dry skin in one week, it doesnt leave you feeling greasy, it has more aloe than any other product. I hope this is enough words to convey TRY IT!</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing for sun burbs. Sets the sun burn in about a day. Awesome stuff.</li>
            <li> works well . o k   I am on the second tube of this product. I found the first of three tubes to be only about half full.  now the second tube has the same problem. judging from the hand weight I am looking at I think the last tube might just be half full also. I have a problem with this product for that reason. beware of what you buy from JASON .   RICHARD DODSON</li>
            <li> I am always looking for the perfect lotion that doesn&#x27;t wear off 2 hours after applying and I found it in this product!  I ran out of lotion while in Florida vacationing and found this in Publix.  It was a bit pricey but thought it was worth a try with the amount of Aloe Vera in it.  Well, I put this on right after my shower and don&#x27;t have to reapply until the next shower!  It goes on so smooth and soaks in right away.  No greasy mess left on my skin to get all over my clothes.  Of course when I needed to get more, I checked Amazon and found this 3-pack for a great price and auto-ship!  Another winner product provided by Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for seven years, and it&#x27;s simply the best.     The consistency is perfect, spreading easily and absorbing fully. It tones your face and leaves you feeling cool and hydrated. Other brands tend not to absorb as well, leaving a \\&quot;mask\\&quot; that weighs you down.     I spread this gel over my face and even my eyelids without a worry because it never stings or irritates. It hydrates, relieves sunburn, soothes irritated skin and best of all (in my case) repairs cracked, dry feet better than harsh products designed for \\&quot;problem\\&quot; feet.  Just use this aloe regularly.    My one complaint is that Jason recently switched from a nice clear bottle to a solid white/yellowish one that I don&#x27;t find attractive. I much preferred when I could see the attractive, clear green gel inside.    This item can get pricey at upscale retailers, but you save here on Amazon and you can save even more at iHerb, where first-time customers who enter \\&quot;XAY240\\&quot; get five bucks off, no strings attached.  Plus iHerb lets you select a free sample of their other natural products each time you order.     One more tip: Keep a bottle of this gel in your fridge. Nothing relieves sunburn like COLD aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mom. She loves this product and was disappointed when she could no longer get it at her drug store. She is very happy to hear I found it on Amazon. She loves that it is 84% aloe. I however am sensitive to the fragrance used in it.</li>
            <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever had.  I have very itchyspots on my arms and after using this just a few days they were completely better.  It absorbs very easy and yet is not greasy.  I also use it on my face.  I just sent some to my sister who is very restricted as to what she can use.  I am very sensitive to scents but I&#x27;m amazed that anyone on here would say this is smelly.  I don&#x27;t find the scent strong at all.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I sure hope Amazon sellers continue to sell this great product.  It&#x27;s just not available in stores in my area, and it&#x27;s a staple in our home.  Jason&#x27;s Aloe Lotion is excellent.</li>
            <li> This product is so soothing and healing; I love it.  It is very soothing if your skin is dry, like mine and even relieves any itch.  The delivery time was reasonable and product well packaged.</li>
            <li> This lotion was given to me to combat radiation burns for my after-surgery cancer treatment.  Radiation burns can be very painful.  It is thicker than some &#x27;lotions&#x27; but provides a much deeper level of protection and comfort.  I love this lotion and will use it forever.</li>
            <li> I was out on a boat for most of a weekend and didn&#x27;t realize how burnt I had gotten, until the next day.  I put just some aloe on at first, but it didn&#x27;t really give me any relief. Then I put on Jason&#x27;s and it felt so good. I did that for the next 4 days and while my husband was peeling like crazy, I barely peeled at all. It&#x27;s a great product.  Now, I&#x27;m going to start using it after my morning shower, to lock in the moisture.</li>
            <li> An excellent, reasonably priced, non-greasy soothing lotion without an overwhelming scent .</li>
            <li> This lotion is very soothing and moisturizing.I wanted to try a lotion with more natural ingredients. I will definitely be purchasing this item again!</li>
            <li> I have eczema and like to layer a water based lotion underneath Shea butter as a sealant. This lotion absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
            <li> I use to love this. The formula has been changed and I can no longer use it. The fragrance/smell has changed so dramatically that I am now an owner of three bottles of this stuff that I would not even give away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior-&lt;br /&gt;This is very good lotion for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product is 84% Aloe Vera.  I accidentally ordered it when really searching for 100% Aloe Vera gel. The added ingredients I suppose make it feel extra creamy and delightful on the skin.  I prefer it to other hand creams.  I use it for my hands and face because I like the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not give it to my family members who have chronic allergies, however, due to the additives, including the scent.  I gave it 4 stars because it is OK but I can&#x27;t rate it a 5 because of the additives.  Also, the tubes are not refillable.</li>
            <li> I have not used a lot of this over the years but like it, it is not greasy and goes on easily. So when I finished up the large tube that was 15 years old I ordered more. This is not exactly the same formula. I compared the labels and there are only small differences but for me it makes a difference. I still use this product, it is the best I have found, but I wish I could go back to the old product.</li>
            <li> I had a dry, itchy rash on my arms and legs.  This product relieved all my symptoms and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I love this product..it softens my skin without leaving a greasy feel. I also like it because it can be used to help heal sunburns if needed, without feeling greasy. I use this on my face and even to soften my very rough heals. Great product.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel amazing, but the smell is just gross. It has a weird after smell, it&#x27;s hard to explain, but def not something you want to smell all day. Also the bottle is small so if you are using it as an all over lotion, you will go through it really fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had nothing but wonderful experiences with this lotion over the years. At times it IS the only lotion that can handle super tough dry skin issues on faces (and scalp for you men) while being super gentle. Recently recommended it to someone who used it on his face after shaving and said it stung horribly. I could see the redness reaction. Within a couple of weeks this settled down, but I was surprised at the initial reaction. Speaks to the necessity of a regular moisturizing regime for anyone, I suppose.</li>
            <li> This is the best body lotion I have found. I used aloe vera plant juice on sunburn and insecct bites in the past so I tried thiis as a body loton.  It soothes, soaks right in and is not greasy. I tend to have dry skin and this works better than any I have tried---better tan the highly advertised lotion on T.V.!.</li>
            <li> This seems to be good quality, but smells quite different than the exact same lotion we previously bought from Amazon. Scent not as appealing.</li>
            <li> I had this horrible rash on my wrist and arms, which was not identifiable by my doctor. I have huge aloe plants and could have easily rubbed the slimy stuff on my arms but I wanted the coolness with out all of the sticky-ness. I headed to the drugstore and picked up a tube of this. My rash,probably stress-related, went away with a few days and I loved the lotion soo much, I buy it exclusively. Wish it came in a 32oz tub though.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is go to Natural Skincare Authority website and read the review there. It may change your mind.  It is full of known toxins and carciogens. I will NEVER use any of Jason&#x27;s products again!</li>
            <li> This lotion was recommended by the radiation nurse at the cancer clinic that treated my breast cancer.  I was worried that my sunburn prone pale skin would freak out during the six weeks of treatment.  I slathered (seriously) the Jason lotion on the radiated area twice daily and escaped with no burn blisters.  Happy dance.</li>
            <li> I picked this up from a clearance rack at Walgreens because they were getting rid of an old package design.  I had never heard of it before, but was intrigued by a lotion with 84% aloe, and it has not disappointed in the least.  I&#x27;ve gotten mild sunburn a few times so far this Spring.  On each occasion, I applied this lotion no more than twice, and my burns healed themselves!  The combination of healing aloe and moisturizing lotion really works great!  As far as its overall moisturizing abilities, I think that this product does an okay job, but that plain old [[ASIN:B0034F9K36 Jergens]] does one better. However, I would recommend the healing ability of this Jason product over anything else I have ever tried, even pure aloe gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and like it very much.  It can be used on and around your eyelids and does not migrate into the eye itself.</li>
