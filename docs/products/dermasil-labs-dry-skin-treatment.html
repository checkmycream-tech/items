            <li>This is the best lotion ever!</li>
            <li>And the best price.</li>
            <li>This is a really great all around lotion.</li>
            <li>it is a great product, but people go to the Dollartree.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still a great product.</li>
            <li>Also a great price.</li>
            <li>I have just started using this product, but it is great</li>
            <li>I docked a star for pricing...just an fyi dollar tree sells these 10 oz bottles.... for $1, lol.</li>
            <li>Great product though.</li>
            <li>this stuff works great.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone needing a good all around lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for all over</li>
            <li>girlfriend - much, much more experienced than</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for people with fragrance allergies who aren&#x27;t able to use the smelly products.</li>
            <li>then this is a really great, cheap lotion to have.</li>
            <li>This is simply the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more watery</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Have been using this cream for 20 years, nothing is better.  </li>
            <li>The BEST Hand Cream for Dry Skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost as good as the very pricey lotion I buy from the Body Shop.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hands feeling smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not scented so far as I can tell, and smells pretty neutral (important for me, as sometimes strong scents can aggravate my migraines).</li>
            <li>The tubes are just the right size for the desk at work, and the nightstand at home.</li>
            <li>The tube is easy to squeeze lotion out of, right up to the last drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it really helps.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s incredibly effective, and not really cheap feeling at all</li>
            <li>Like others here, we&#x27;ve found that you can purchase these for $1 at the dollar store, or in a case of 12 on Dollar Tree&#x27;s website (for $12, naturally); the pricing here isn&#x27;t really all that competitive.</li>
            <li>(having a 2 year old really makes you wash hands a lot).</li>
            <li>Not oily, absorbs well &amp; quickly, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Other than that I would give more stars if possible.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of all the Dermasil products I have tried so far, and with this one being my least favorite</li>
            <li>Goes on without leaving your hands feeling greasy or oily but keeps them moist and soft.</li>
            <li>The tube I got was too big to carry but in a small bottle as a hand lotion it would probably work much better.</li>
            <li>The tube is large and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>This product works very well for dry skin issues.</li>
            <li>This cream seems to really work on dry skin...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had any issues with it, and it certainly does work as well as any other lotion I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have a problem in that I have no less than 5 bottles of lotion next to my couch.  </li>
            <li>* (including her face, which I&#x27;ve thus far avoided), multiple times a day, and we&#x27;ve gotten in the habit of buying several of these at a time.</li>
            <li>If you have dry, sensitive skin</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I never used to use any moisturizing lotion of any sort. Then I moved to Utah with my girlfriend, and winters here changed everything - they&#x27;re so insanely dry, and this stuff is a lifesaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s incredibly effective, and not really cheap feeling at all - the lotion is surprisingly thick. It&#x27;s not scented so far as I can tell, and smells pretty neutral (important for me, as sometimes strong scents can aggravate my migraines). I&#x27;ve never had any issues with it, and it certainly does work as well as any other lotion I&#x27;ve used. The tube is easy to squeeze lotion out of, right up to the last drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend - much, much more experienced than I with such products - sings it&#x27;s praises all the time. She uses this *everywhere* (including her face, which I&#x27;ve thus far avoided), multiple times a day, and we&#x27;ve gotten in the habit of buying several of these at a time. Like others here, we&#x27;ve found that you can purchase these for $1 at the dollar store, or in a case of 12 on Dollar Tree&#x27;s website (for $12, naturally); the pricing here isn&#x27;t really all that competitive.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the s***.  I have a problem in that I have no less than 5 bottles of lotion next to my couch.  This is simply the best.</li>
            <li> This is a really great all around lotion. I have used it on my face, neck and entire body. I have very sensitive skin but this product does not irritate my skin or make it greasy. If you have dry, sensitive skin then this is a really great, cheap lotion to have. You can get this wonderful lotion for $1 at Dollar Tree...</li>
            <li> You can get the 10 Fl OZ (296ml) at the Dollar Tree for $ 1.  I have been buying Dermasil there for at least 2 years....it is a great product, but people go to the Dollartree.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of all the Dermasil products I have tried so far, and with this one being my least favorite it&#x27;s still a great product. It&#x27;s more watery than I would like compared to the body lotion, and didn&#x27;t feel like the moisture would lay as long. The tube I got was too big to carry but in a small bottle as a hand lotion it would probably work much better. I may just put it in travel bottles and use it that way since I still like it overall.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion! It works well but not greasy.I would recommend it to anyone with dry skin. Also a great price.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for dry skin issues. We both have these little areas of dry skin, in several spots, that we use this product on. Dermasil dry skin treatment helps keep the bodies moisture in and block the loss of moisture too. I bought it for my wife and I use it too. No more dry skin problems now.  :)</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product, but it is great is you have dry rough hands. I would recommend this to anyone needing a good all around lotion.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever! And the best price. The dermatologist recommended it for me and I love it. I have dry skin and it really helps. It&#x27;s good for all over although I don&#x27;t recommend it for the face. It doesn&#x27;t hurt the face but the dermatologist said you needed a facial moisturizer for your face. Other than that I would give more stars if possible.</li>
            <li> Have been using this cream for 20 years, nothing is better.  Goes on without leaving your hands feeling greasy or oily but keeps them moist and soft.</li>
            <li> This is about the only hand cream that helps with my dry skin.  The tubes are just the right size for the desk at work, and the nightstand at home.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hands feeling smooth as silk. It&#x27;s a great product for people with fragrance allergies who aren&#x27;t able to use the smelly products. The tube is large and lasts a long time. I keep one on my desk at the office, one in the glove compartment of my car and one at home.  I also buy the bottled version to fill the lotion dispensers in my bathrooms and by my kitchen sink.  It&#x27;s almost as good as the very pricey lotion I buy from the Body Shop.</li>
            <li> I docked a star for pricing...just an fyi dollar tree sells these 10 oz bottles.... for $1, lol. Great product though. I use this for my dry face.</li>
            <li> have dry hands &amp; feet from diabetes.  this stuff works great.</li>
            <li> This cream seems to really work on dry skin...</li>
            <li> The BEST Hand Cream for Dry Skin I&#x27;ve ever used!  Not oily, absorbs well &amp; quickly, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble with dry itchy skin on the backs on my hands. I get chapped between the fingers from handwashing (having a 2 year old really makes you wash hands a lot). I couldn&#x27;t find a product that lasted a while. This product sinks in and I can go 2-3 hand washes before I need to reapply. I also use it on my body after a shower.</li>
