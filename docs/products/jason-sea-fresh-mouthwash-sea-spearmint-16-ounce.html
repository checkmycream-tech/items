    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best way to describe it is salty spearmint flavored vinegar.  </li>
            <li>This mouthwash is best diluted 1:1, as the label states that it is concentrated 2:1 in the package.</li>
            <li>Jason products are always great!</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>It has a great taste that does not leave a lingering aftertaste in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The reason I give it five stars is because I LOVE how it makes my mouth feel!!</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li>you experience, which is almost pleasant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite :D &amp; love their toothpaste too!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t nearly as good as Orange cinnamint or cinnamon clove.</li>
            <li>I hope to eventually get through whatever is making that one spot in my gum sore, but until then, this is a good help.</li>
            <li>It has a good taste.</li>
            <li>Price is elevated, but it&#x27;s  a good product.</li>
            <li>but the taste is good</li>
            <li>Kind of an herbal flavor (I don&#x27;t mind it), and teeth feel great afterwards.</li>
            <li>but I was very glad it was gone.&lt;br /&gt;Still,</li>
            <li>Love this product, works  great.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>The best I could describe it when I first tried it was &amp;</li>
            <li>I generally love Jas√∂n products, but not this!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Effective, and probably a healthy option, but hardly pleasant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been weirdly effective for me</li>
            <li>use there toothpaste as well and that works nice to.</li>
            <li>This makes it feel clean and healthy!!</li>
            <li>The taste was really good, but really strong.</li>
            <li>So far it is the best we&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>it is the best I had so far.</li>
            <li>It makes your breath smell good and mouth clean.</li>
            <li>a I love are more of a tingle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Answer PerioWash: another favorite.  </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I LOVE mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Like, I keep a bottle of it on my desk at work love it.</li>
            <li>Love the non chemical ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I like swishing it around knowing it&#x27;s a truly healthy choice of mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the feel of my mouth after I have used this product.  </li>
            <li>The taste is not my favorite at all.</li>
            <li>The diluted wash is more bearable, and it still gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>But the longer you swish it around the more the bile/vomit flavor comes out.</li>
            <li>I might try another of the company&#x27;s flavors, but I sure won&#x27;t try this one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this mouth wash</li>
            <li>A wonderful line of personal products.</li>
            <li>and the aftertaste is greatly diminished...making it decent instead of bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth fresh but not burning like Listerine!!</li>
            <li>still think I&#x27;ll keep looking for something more refreshing but am not unhappy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Good taste and decent strength    </li>
            <li>so I need strong stain resistence and whitening...</li>
            <li>and you get used to the taste quickly!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to say that this stuff is a miracle mouthwash or that it has the actual ability to do any of these things (because the FDA will come after me), but this stuff worked great for me and now that I&#x27;m done with the bottle</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with this brand and will probably stick with them.</li>
            <li>It is alcohol free but has a burn to it.  </li>
            <li>I find products like this, by Jason, are healthy, taste and smell yummy, feel good, help with my issues, benefit the environment, and don&#x27;t endanger human or animals.</li>
            <li>The mild mint is very mild in flavor.  </li>
            <li>It has strong minty flavor (it is concentrated, thus can be diluted to your liking) but the flavor is pleasant overall and does feel like my mouth is clean after using it.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased so far and looking forward to training their toothpaste as wall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling to find a mouthwash that is organic that actually tastes good....</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Makes my mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Essence (Tea Tree Oil): mild, funky taste and</li>
            <li>It may take some getting used to at first, but the flavor is pleasant overall in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Overall, despite the higher price tag and vinegar-like taste, this has become one of my favorite natural mouthwashes that is strong, effective, and free of unwanted ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Without diluting the mouthwash, the flavor was much too strong for me.</li>
            <li>leaves my mouth fresh, doesn&#x27;t kick in the a.m., and feels healthier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are many products out there that aren&#x27;t actually natural.</li>
            <li>Even though the taste may take a bit of getting used to, I believe it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>We use this mouthwash along with the Sea fresh toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth fresh.</li>
            <li>I wish it had 100% organic ingredients, but it is definitely a more natural alternative to your leading brand mouthwashes.</li>
            <li>I love that the ingredients are all natural, and no sugars like some of the leading brands.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care for this flavor and it kind of made my mouth burn, but I do LOVE the other flavors of the orange mint and the cinnamon clove healthy mouth made by the same brand.</li>
            <li>We have purchased other Jason products and they are exceptional as well.</li>
            <li>This has a funky taste and its very salty tasting but it has the benefit of leaving your mouth feeling fresh and clean much longer than chemical mouthwashes up to 6 hours(depending on what you eat/smoke/drink).</li>
            <li>Toothpaste and brushing doesn&#x27;t seem to help very much...</li>
            <li>I think it is well worth it, my mouth feels very clean and fresh for a long time after using this mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>but when I use Jason&#x27;s Healthy Mouth, the soreness and puffiness is somehow gone by the next day.</li>
            <li>Will most likely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works pretty well</li>
            <li>It has bitter and kind of oily aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That was my first impression of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>JASON was one of the few ones I found, and it&#x27;s been pretty good.</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle of Jason, and I have grown to love it.  </li>
            <li>The taste can be off-putting at first.  </li>
            <li>I like this mouthwash more than the generic kinds sold in pharmacies / retail.</li>
            <li>The quality and innovation is first rate.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep database gives this product a score of 1 (on a scale of 0-10, with 0 being the safest and 10 being the most toxic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product, overall.</li>
            <li>I love Listerine and all those other mouthwashes that seem like they will burn your mouth off, but I wanted to make the switch to a product that isn&#x27;t tested on animals as well as being more natural.</li>
            <li>Also, it left my mouth feeling very clean but, sometimes</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those seeking a strong, natural mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>pleasant, mild taste but too weak for my liking  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Jason Sea Fresh Mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I feel clean and stay clean for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Love the taste and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>Jason&#x27;s products (all that I have tried) are amazing and work extremely well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found plenty of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products that aren&#x27;t very effective and used a lot of painful mouthwashes, but this one has been really good so far.</li>
            <li>This makes your mouth feel fresh, new, and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>My whole mouth feels refreshed.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t mind this mouth-wash so much</li>
            <li>I really wish I can find a peppermint mouthwash, for now, this will do.</li>
            <li>but flavor is really bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used ACT Fluoride mouthwash my whole life...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the aftertaste, really -</li>
            <li>Alcohol based ones make your mouth feel clean, but it feels like your mouth has been completely stripped of moisture and any protective film that may be natural.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I must say that the flavor, to me, is kind of bad - average at best.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t made with alcohol, but it&#x27;s still potent (without the burning feeling that you get with other brands).</li>
            <li>This definitely does have a unique taste...</li>
            <li>My mouth didn&#x27;t feel clean, it felt like I had rinced with toilet water.</li>
            <li>I might go with something more \\&quot;normal\\&quot; next time, but I would recommend this to anyone looking to try something different.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Jason Mouthwash is refreshing and can support healing within the mouth, gums due to its natural antibacterial qualities.  </li>
            <li>but fluoride is bad for you (though great for your teeth!).</li>
            <li>I like the fact this mouthwash is alchol free because I dislike the bitter taste of alchol mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals/alcohols like most retail mouthwashes.</li>
            <li>After a few uses I noticed it said it was 2x concentrated and that dilution might be better for some.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and am very excited about the safety of the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be completely honest, I only tried this stuff because one of my old coworkers left it in their locker after they left the company</li>
            <li>Just as strong and minty without all the harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>-It is a little disappointing that many of these great natural brands get acquired by large companies (Tom&#x27;s of Maine by Colgate-Palmolive &amp; Jason by Hain Celestial), but it is still a solid choice when it comes to natural products.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Listerine for decades, and previously used the original yellow flavor, so I&#x27;m used to some pretty noxious</li>
            <li>: the Icy Mint flavor is nice (a slight burn) and works well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it several times now, and each time it brought the inflammation down pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>-For a natural mouthwash</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done a lot of research on natural mouthwash products.</li>
            <li>A natural mouthwash.</li>
            <li>but I find myself using very little because of how strong and concentrated it is.  </li>
            <li>but instead just take a small amount to swish around and as such, one bottle can last a good long time.</li>
            <li>, it is very strong and works well in controlling bad breath and leaving your mouth feel clean.    </li>
            <li>If you have trouble with inflammation even after regularly brushing really well, this could be well worth a try.</li>
            <li>how many good reviews there are, this is just terrible.</li>
            <li>Not funny tasting, very minty and works!</li>
            <li>Since it double concentrated you only need a 1/2 cap full (fill the other 1/2 of the cap with tap water).</li>
            <li>It was hard to find a cruelty and fluoride free mouth-wash that didn&#x27;t have cinnamon.  </li>
            <li>Not really a vinegar taste like others described, but certainly unusual.  </li>
            <li>I have receiding gums, TMJ - therefore sensitive teeth, but am also a coffee and red wine drinker</li>
            <li>It is difficult for me to know how effective it is in terms of enamel for teeth and all...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a frequent Listerine user looking for something a little more natural and a little less toxic.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I am skeptical of products because they don&#x27;t really seem to work, but this one has done better than I expected at helping me to recover health bit by bit...</li>
            <li>For the first few seconds it&#x27;s just the mint</li>
            <li>I was a little strange at first because it&#x27;s so much different than traditional mouthwashes, but I think it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s all natural incredients and not a bunch of chemicals.</li>
            <li>In addition to being a mouthwash with a rather pleasant flavor (and it doesn&#x27;t cause the same painful tingling of some mouthwashes which makes it easier to use), it also does seem to help keep the mouth healthier.</li>
            <li>I will say thank you Jason for creating mouthwashes that are alchol free and donot taste bitter either or at least not this one.</li>

            <li> I think it is well worth it, my mouth feels very clean and fresh for a long time after using this mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> but when I use Jason&#x27;s Healthy Mouth, the soreness and puffiness is somehow gone by the next day.</li>
            <li> Will most likely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works pretty well</li>
            <li> It has bitter and kind of oily aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That was my first impression of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> JASON was one of the few ones I found, and it&#x27;s been pretty good.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of Jason, and I have grown to love it.  </li>
            <li> The taste can be off-putting at first.  </li>
            <li> I like this mouthwash more than the generic kinds sold in pharmacies / retail.</li>
            <li> The quality and innovation is first rate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep database gives this product a score of 1 (on a scale of 0-10, with 0 being the safest and 10 being the most toxic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product, overall.</li>
            <li> I love Listerine and all those other mouthwashes that seem like they will burn your mouth off, but I wanted to make the switch to a product that isn&#x27;t tested on animals as well as being more natural.</li>
            <li> Also, it left my mouth feeling very clean but, sometimes</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those seeking a strong, natural mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> pleasant, mild taste but too weak for my liking  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Jason Sea Fresh Mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I feel clean and stay clean for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Love the taste and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Jason&#x27;s products (all that I have tried) are amazing and work extremely well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found plenty of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products that aren&#x27;t very effective and used a lot of painful mouthwashes, but this one has been really good so far.</li>
            <li> This makes your mouth feel fresh, new, and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> My whole mouth feels refreshed.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t mind this mouth-wash so much</li>
            <li> I really wish I can find a peppermint mouthwash, for now, this will do.</li>
            <li> but flavor is really bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used ACT Fluoride mouthwash my whole life...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the aftertaste, really -</li>
            <li> Alcohol based ones make your mouth feel clean, but it feels like your mouth has been completely stripped of moisture and any protective film that may be natural.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I must say that the flavor, to me, is kind of bad - average at best.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t made with alcohol, but it&#x27;s still potent (without the burning feeling that you get with other brands).</li>
            <li> This definitely does have a unique taste...</li>
            <li> My mouth didn&#x27;t feel clean, it felt like I had rinced with toilet water.</li>
            <li> I might go with something more \\&quot;normal\\&quot; next time, but I would recommend this to anyone looking to try something different.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Jason Mouthwash is refreshing and can support healing within the mouth, gums due to its natural antibacterial qualities.  </li>
            <li> but fluoride is bad for you (though great for your teeth!).</li>
            <li> I like the fact this mouthwash is alchol free because I dislike the bitter taste of alchol mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals/alcohols like most retail mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> After a few uses I noticed it said it was 2x concentrated and that dilution might be better for some.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and am very excited about the safety of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be completely honest, I only tried this stuff because one of my old coworkers left it in their locker after they left the company</li>
            <li> Just as strong and minty without all the harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> -It is a little disappointing that many of these great natural brands get acquired by large companies (Tom&#x27;s of Maine by Colgate-Palmolive &amp; Jason by Hain Celestial), but it is still a solid choice when it comes to natural products.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Listerine for decades, and previously used the original yellow flavor, so I&#x27;m used to some pretty noxious</li>
            <li> : the Icy Mint flavor is nice (a slight burn) and works well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it several times now, and each time it brought the inflammation down pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> -For a natural mouthwash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a lot of research on natural mouthwash products.</li>
            <li> A natural mouthwash.</li>
            <li> but I find myself using very little because of how strong and concentrated it is.  </li>
            <li> but instead just take a small amount to swish around and as such, one bottle can last a good long time.</li>
            <li> , it is very strong and works well in controlling bad breath and leaving your mouth feel clean.    </li>
            <li> If you have trouble with inflammation even after regularly brushing really well, this could be well worth a try.</li>
            <li> how many good reviews there are, this is just terrible.</li>
            <li> Not funny tasting, very minty and works!</li>
            <li> Since it double concentrated you only need a 1/2 cap full (fill the other 1/2 of the cap with tap water).</li>
            <li> It was hard to find a cruelty and fluoride free mouth-wash that didn&#x27;t have cinnamon.  </li>
            <li> Not really a vinegar taste like others described, but certainly unusual.  </li>
            <li> I have receiding gums, TMJ - therefore sensitive teeth, but am also a coffee and red wine drinker</li>
            <li> It is difficult for me to know how effective it is in terms of enamel for teeth and all...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a frequent Listerine user looking for something a little more natural and a little less toxic.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I am skeptical of products because they don&#x27;t really seem to work, but this one has done better than I expected at helping me to recover health bit by bit...</li>
            <li> For the first few seconds it&#x27;s just the mint</li>
            <li> I was a little strange at first because it&#x27;s so much different than traditional mouthwashes, but I think it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s all natural incredients and not a bunch of chemicals.</li>
            <li> In addition to being a mouthwash with a rather pleasant flavor (and it doesn&#x27;t cause the same painful tingling of some mouthwashes which makes it easier to use), it also does seem to help keep the mouth healthier.</li>
            <li> I will say thank you Jason for creating mouthwashes that are alchol free and donot taste bitter either or at least not this one.</li>
            <li> After learning that nearly every brand of mouth wash tests on animals (not necessarily tests mouthwash, but other products they make), I decided to switch brands.</li>
            <li> Also it goes twice as far as other mouthwashes as it is 2x concentrated.</li>
            <li> More expensive than your conventional mouthwash (Listerine, Scope, ACT),</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and there is no bitter after taste.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to rinse my mouth for more than a few seconds.</li>
            <li> The company tricks you into thinking so with their clever marketing, but when you actually read the ingredients you&#x27;re annoyed.  </li>
            <li> JASON&#x27;s Deep Sea Spearmint has never let me down.</li>
            <li> you have working tastebuds, you might want to try a different product than this one; I&#x27;m dumping mine down the drain.</li>
            <li> You usually expect that natural stuff to fall a little short</li>
            <li> but I prefer to use a very small amount about 1/2 oz is enough to leave your mouth clean for at least a few hours.</li>
            <li> I prefer Icy Mint.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like or worried about the taste of this mouthwash, I would recommend Nature&#x27;s Answer PerioWash or TheraBreath (Icy Mint) instead.</li>
            <li> thanks to Jason, I can take the guessing game out of it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Jason Powersmile cinnamon flavor from last few months</li>
            <li> Anyway, I expected it to taste terrible and not be that great...</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way as other reviewers noted.</li>
            <li> The other two flavor</li>
            <li> -This is free of alcohol, saccharin, sodium lauryl sulfate, flouride, artificial coloring/sweeteners that are typically found in other conventional mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li> its substantially less weird than it sounds, and who wastes a nearly full bottle of anything?)</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to people who don&#x27;t like using the regular retail mouthwashes with the harsh chemicals or harsh alcohols etc.</li>
            <li> On the other hand there are some natural products that really are natural, no gimmick, but don&#x27;t work, taste terrible, or a combination.</li>
            <li> I now use this wash twice a day, and I use half a capful + the other half capful of water.  </li>
            <li> This makes your mouth feel really clean afterwards and doesn&#x27;t have a bad taste.</li>
            <li> The aftertaste is a little odd, but my mouth does feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that other problems I had seemed to be bettered: the tooth sensitivity gone, a sensitive part of my gums that bled for no apparent reason after brushing, and the bad breath.</li>
            <li> Has a little off taste, but you get use it.</li>
            <li> I figured that a mouthwash called \\&quot;Sea Fresh\\&quot; would be a little bit funky, and it is.</li>
            <li> , it left my teeth feeling a little weak.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also going to let you in on a secret, I never actually dilute it.</li>
            <li> Just received this a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some health problems, and lately, once a week or so, even with carefully cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li> The taste is harsh.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m just not a huge fan of &amp;#34;spearmint&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The flavor is a little minty, a little herbal, and something else that is hard to put your finger on.</li>
            <li> , I will find a small, sore, puffy spot on the inside of my gums.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re supposed to dilute it (DUH).</li>
            <li> I take about 1/2 a tablespoon in my mouth and swish it around for at least a minute (or until the mint makes your mouth/nose so tingly you cant stand it) and then spit it out...</li>
            <li> While traveling I went back to the old stuff out of availability and couldn&#x27;t believe how disgusting it was!</li>
            <li> It was such a bad taste.</li>
            <li> I like the sea fresh spearmint toothpaste, but this product is awful.  </li>
            <li> also relatively weak  -TheraBreath</li>
            <li> I have a weak stomach, and I didn&#x27;t have any issues with this flavor.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that it is gross, or horrible, or anything of that sort.</li>
            <li> and I like it now because it will annihilate bad breath.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t taste bad after you get use to it.</li>
            <li> But not as bad as Listerine</li>
            <li> However, after diluting, it isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> stops bad breathe etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too bad until you spit it out.</li>
            <li> Jason, you disappointed me with this mouthwash.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tastes awful.  </li>
            <li> It tasted absolutely awful.  </li>
            <li> It tastes SO bad!!!!</li>
            <li> I was expecting something spearminty, but this mouthwash leaves a disgusting taste that lingers for 20 minutes before a hint of anything mint.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had to work up to it with this flavor. It isn&#x27;t nearly as good as Orange cinnamint or cinnamon clove. Towards the end I didn&#x27;t have to dilute it but I was very glad it was gone.&lt;br /&gt;Still, leaves my mouth fresh, doesn&#x27;t kick in the a.m., and feels healthier.&lt;br /&gt;It does burn a bit though.... The other two flavor a I love are more of a tingle.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t compare it on how it improves the health of your mouth because I was using the Orange cinnamint at work 1x a day and this one at home 1x a day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite :D &amp; love their toothpaste too! My whole mouth feels refreshed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling to find a mouthwash that is organic that actually tastes good....Jason&#x27;s products (all that I have tried) are amazing and work extremely well! I will be buying Jason&#x27;s from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be completely honest, I only tried this stuff because one of my old coworkers left it in their locker after they left the company (I work at a summer camp so its substantially less weird than it sounds, and who wastes a nearly full bottle of anything?) Anyway, I expected it to taste terrible and not be that great... but I was sorely mistaken. The taste did take a while to get used to, it also helps when you realize that it is concentrated and you&#x27;re supposed to dilute it (DUH). So after a week or so, I noticed that a tooth I had reconstructed about 6 months prior (the tooth is like 70% filling material remade because the tooth broke and I was not keen on getting a root canal). I also noticed that other problems I had seemed to be bettered: the tooth sensitivity gone, a sensitive part of my gums that bled for no apparent reason after brushing, and the bad breath. I&#x27;m not going to say that this stuff is a miracle mouthwash or that it has the actual ability to do any of these things (because the FDA will come after me), but this stuff worked great for me and now that I&#x27;m done with the bottle I&#x27;m definitely ordering one to replace it. I&#x27;m also going to let you in on a secret, I never actually dilute it. I take about 1/2 a tablespoon in my mouth and swish it around for at least a minute (or until the mint makes your mouth/nose so tingly you cant stand it) and then spit it out... no rinse and no water for around a 1/2 hour to let it sink in, similar to how you&#x27;d treat a fluoride rinse (only this is WAY better).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to start trying J√ÖS√ñN products, damn.</li>
            <li> PROS:  -This is free of alcohol, saccharin, sodium lauryl sulfate, flouride, artificial coloring/sweeteners that are typically found in other conventional mouthwashes.  -For a natural mouthwash, it is very strong and works well in controlling bad breath and leaving your mouth feel clean.    CONS:  -Cost.  More expensive than your conventional mouthwash (Listerine, Scope, ACT), but I find myself using very little because of how strong and concentrated it is.  -Taste.  The best way to describe it is salty spearmint flavored vinegar.  I personally got used to it and I like it now because it will annihilate bad breath.  -It is a little disappointing that many of these great natural brands get acquired by large companies (Tom&#x27;s of Maine by Colgate-Palmolive &amp; Jason by Hain Celestial), but it is still a solid choice when it comes to natural products.    COMPARISONS:  -Tom&#x27;s of Maine: pleasant, mild taste but too weak for my liking  -Desert Essence (Tea Tree Oil): mild, funky taste and also relatively weak  -TheraBreath: the Icy Mint flavor is nice (a slight burn) and works well.  The mild mint is very mild in flavor.  I prefer Icy Mint.  This one is also one of my favorites.  -Nature&#x27;s Answer PerioWash: another favorite.  Good taste and decent strength    Overall, despite the higher price tag and vinegar-like taste, this has become one of my favorite natural mouthwashes that is strong, effective, and free of unwanted ingredients.  Highly recommended for those seeking a strong, natural mouthwash.  If you don&#x27;t like or worried about the taste of this mouthwash, I would recommend Nature&#x27;s Answer PerioWash or TheraBreath (Icy Mint) instead.</li>
            <li> Just received this a few days ago. Seems to be just what we were looking for. A little goes a long way as other reviewers noted. So far it is the best we&#x27;ve found. We have purchased other Jason products and they are exceptional as well.</li>
            <li> In addition to being a mouthwash with a rather pleasant flavor (and it doesn&#x27;t cause the same painful tingling of some mouthwashes which makes it easier to use), it also does seem to help keep the mouth healthier. Sometimes I am skeptical of products because they don&#x27;t really seem to work, but this one has done better than I expected at helping me to recover health bit by bit... I&#x27;ve had some health problems, and lately, once a week or so, even with carefully cleaning my teeth, I will find a small, sore, puffy spot on the inside of my gums. Toothpaste and brushing doesn&#x27;t seem to help very much... but when I use Jason&#x27;s Healthy Mouth, the soreness and puffiness is somehow gone by the next day. I&#x27;ve tried it several times now, and each time it brought the inflammation down pretty quickly. It&#x27;s been weirdly effective for me and I try to remember to use it every day to keep my gums healthier. I&#x27;ve found plenty of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products that aren&#x27;t very effective and used a lot of painful mouthwashes, but this one has been really good so far. I hope to eventually get through whatever is making that one spot in my gum sore, but until then, this is a good help. If you have trouble with inflammation even after regularly brushing really well, this could be well worth a try.</li>
            <li> I like the fact this mouthwash is alchol free because I dislike the bitter taste of alchol mouthwashes.  I will say thank you Jason for creating mouthwashes that are alchol free and donot taste bitter either or at least not this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a lot of research on natural mouthwash products. There are many products out there that aren&#x27;t actually natural. The company tricks you into thinking so with their clever marketing, but when you actually read the ingredients you&#x27;re annoyed.  On the other hand there are some natural products that really are natural, no gimmick, but don&#x27;t work, taste terrible, or a combination. JASON&#x27;s Deep Sea Spearmint has never let me down. Since it double concentrated you only need a 1/2 cap full (fill the other 1/2 of the cap with tap water). It isn&#x27;t made with alcohol, but it&#x27;s still potent (without the burning feeling that you get with other brands). It also has a pleasant taste. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I LOVE mouthwash. Like, I keep a bottle of it on my desk at work love it. After learning that nearly every brand of mouth wash tests on animals (not necessarily tests mouthwash, but other products they make), I decided to switch brands. This is by far the best I&#x27;ve had. I was a little strange at first because it&#x27;s so much different than traditional mouthwashes, but I think it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s all natural incredients and not a bunch of chemicals. While traveling I went back to the old stuff out of availability and couldn&#x27;t believe how disgusting it was! Not only have I become accustomed to this taste, but now I prefer it!</li>
            <li> Has a little off taste, but you get use it. Doesn&#x27;t taste bad after you get use to it. It makes your breath smell good and mouth clean. A natural mouthwash. Will most likely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use there toothpaste as well and that works nice to. Overall I am happy with this brand and will probably stick with them.</li>
            <li> Just as strong and minty without all the harsh chemicals.  You usually expect that natural stuff to fall a little short but this one didn&#x27;t.  It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this flavor and it kind of made my mouth burn, but I do LOVE the other flavors of the orange mint and the cinnamon clove healthy mouth made by the same brand.</li>
            <li> Love the non chemical ingredients.  Not really a vinegar taste like others described, but certainly unusual.  I would get again.  Leaves your mouth fresh but not burning like Listerine!!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Tastes awful.  But not as bad as Listerine and it doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> No complaints. I like swishing it around knowing it&#x27;s a truly healthy choice of mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;I like my breath afterwards &#x3D;}</li>
            <li> I purchased this mouthwash from a local health food store. Some things I like to look at in person before buying, for whatever reason. I figured that a mouthwash called \\&quot;Sea Fresh\\&quot; would be a little bit funky, and it is. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it is gross, or horrible, or anything of that sort. It just takes some getting used to. This mouthwash is best diluted 1:1, as the label states that it is concentrated 2:1 in the package. Without diluting the mouthwash, the flavor was much too strong for me. It was difficult to rinse my mouth for more than a few seconds. However, after diluting, it isn&#x27;t bad. The flavor is a little minty, a little herbal, and something else that is hard to put your finger on. That must be the sea vegetables. I have a weak stomach, and I didn&#x27;t have any issues with this flavor. I might go with something more \\&quot;normal\\&quot; next time, but I would recommend this to anyone looking to try something different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m veryyyy picky about what I brush my teeth with and what chemicals come in contact with my body... thanks to Jason, I can take the guessing game out of it. I have receiding gums, TMJ - therefore sensitive teeth, but am also a coffee and red wine drinker so I need strong stain resistence and whitening... I find products like this, by Jason, are healthy, taste and smell yummy, feel good, help with my issues, benefit the environment, and don&#x27;t endanger human or animals. LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Love the taste and how long it lasts. A little goes a long way, and there is no bitter after taste.</li>
            <li> Jason Mouthwash is refreshing and can support healing within the mouth, gums due to its natural antibacterial qualities.  Even though the taste may take a bit of getting used to, I believe it is well worth it.  I highly recommend Jason Sea Fresh Mouthwash.</li>
            <li> It was such a bad taste. My mouth didn&#x27;t feel clean, it felt like I had rinced with toilet water. Really gross. I tossed it after one attempted use.</li>
            <li> This makes your mouth feel really clean afterwards and doesn&#x27;t have a bad taste.</li>
            <li> It was hard to find a cruelty and fluoride free mouth-wash that didn&#x27;t have cinnamon.  (I can eat cinnamon but any chewing gum, tooth-paste or mouthwash I&#x27;m allergic too.)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind this mouth-wash so much, I&#x27;m just not a huge fan of &amp;#34;spearmint&amp;#34;.  I really wish I can find a peppermint mouthwash, for now, this will do.</li>
            <li> We use this mouthwash along with the Sea fresh toothpaste. It has a good taste. Leaves your mouth fresh. I wish it had 100% organic ingredients, but it is definitely a more natural alternative to your leading brand mouthwashes. Its concentrated so it lasts awhile. I give it 4 stars because its not certified organic &amp; I think it used to be at one point.</li>
            <li> I have been using Jason Powersmile cinnamon flavor from last few months but Since I wanted to try different flavor I ordered this one.&lt;br /&gt;It works pretty well but flavor is really bad.&lt;br /&gt; It has bitter and kind of oily aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;I will stick to the Powersmile.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the flavor and the fact that its color was a yellow tint I threw it away. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> It has a great taste that does not leave a lingering aftertaste in your mouth. It does not burn, but tingles in the beginning. Price is elevated, but it&#x27;s  a good product.</li>
            <li> Yuk!! That was my first impression of this stuff.  It tasted absolutely awful.  Over time, I did get used to it.  The reason I give it five stars is because I LOVE how it makes my mouth feel!! This makes your mouth feel fresh, new, and rejuvenated. Alcohol based ones make your mouth feel clean, but it feels like your mouth has been completely stripped of moisture and any protective film that may be natural.  This makes it feel clean and healthy!! Just don&#x27;t expecting this to taste like candy.</li>
            <li> I like the sea fresh spearmint toothpaste, but this product is awful.  It is alcohol free but has a burn to it.  I had to rush to rinse out my mouth with water because I thought I would vomit from the lingering taste.  I don&#x27;t care how many good reviews there are, this is just terrible.</li>
            <li> The taste is harsh.  I love the feel of my mouth after I have used this product.  The taste is not my favorite at all.</li>
            <li> It is difficult for me to know how effective it is in terms of enamel for teeth and all...but the taste is good and I like the idea of using a product without all the harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love Listerine and all those other mouthwashes that seem like they will burn your mouth off, but I wanted to make the switch to a product that isn&#x27;t tested on animals as well as being more natural. JASON was one of the few ones I found, and it&#x27;s been pretty good. The aftertaste is a little odd, but my mouth does feel cleaner. Even my picky husband uses it and doesn&#x27;t complain, so must be working well!</li>
            <li> This definitely does have a unique taste... The best I could describe it when I first tried it was &amp;#34;grapefruit cough syrup!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Keep using it and you get used to the taste quickly!  I think it is well worth it, my mouth feels very clean and fresh for a long time after using this mouthwash.  I love that the ingredients are all natural, and no sugars like some of the leading brands.  Definitely give it a try, and if you don&#x27;t like the taste, you can try diluting it with some water.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of Jason, and I have grown to love it.  In my quest to rid myself and my home of chemical-ly, unnatural products, I came across this mouthwash.  The taste can be off-putting at first.  It&#x27;s like eating chocolate your entire life and then biting a head of broccoli.  I now use this wash twice a day, and I use half a capful + the other half capful of water.  The diluted wash is more bearable, and it still gets the job done.  My mouth feels cleaner, and it does the job without all of the fluoride, chemicals, and unnatural flavors you don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> I generally love Jas√∂n products, but not this!  It tastes SO bad!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a frequent Listerine user looking for something a little more natural and a little less toxic. I&#x27;ve been using Listerine for decades, and previously used the original yellow flavor, so I&#x27;m used to some pretty noxious mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Jason Deep Sea Spearmint takes the cake, though. It has a flavor that I&#x27;d describe as minty bile. For the first few seconds it&#x27;s just the mint you experience, which is almost pleasant. But the longer you swish it around the more the bile/vomit flavor comes out. It&#x27;s truly noxious. You&#x27;re left with a mouth that&#x27;s minty and tingly but an aftertaste that&#x27;s similar to what you&#x27;d get after losing your lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effective, and probably a healthy option, but hardly pleasant. I might try another of the company&#x27;s flavors, but I sure won&#x27;t try this one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. Jason recommends diluting this stuff 2:1 with water. I tried it both ways. Same effect.</li>
            <li> Love this mouth wash it is the best I had so far. I feel clean and stay clean for a long time.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I like this mouthwash more than the generic kinds sold in pharmacies / retail. It has strong minty flavor (it is concentrated, thus can be diluted to your liking) but the flavor is pleasant overall and does feel like my mouth is clean after using it. It doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals/alcohols like most retail mouthwashes. I don&#x27;t feel the need to dilute it but instead just take a small amount to swish around and as such, one bottle can last a good long time. I would recommend this to people who don&#x27;t like using the regular retail mouthwashes with the harsh chemicals or harsh alcohols etc. It may take some getting used to at first, but the flavor is pleasant overall in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Jason products are always great! Not funny tasting, very minty and works! Will continue purchasing!</li>
            <li> Makes my mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Love this product, works  great.</li>
            <li> This has a funky taste and its very salty tasting but it has the benefit of leaving your mouth feeling fresh and clean much longer than chemical mouthwashes up to 6 hours(depending on what you eat/smoke/drink). Also it goes twice as far as other mouthwashes as it is 2x concentrated. The label says you can dilute it but I prefer to use a very small amount about 1/2 oz is enough to leave your mouth clean for at least a few hours.</li>
            <li> Kind of an herbal flavor (I don&#x27;t mind it), and teeth feel great afterwards.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something spearminty, but this mouthwash leaves a disgusting taste that lingers for 20 minutes before a hint of anything mint.  Jason, you disappointed me with this mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;If you have working tastebuds, you might want to try a different product than this one; I&#x27;m dumping mine down the drain.</li>
            <li> A wonderful line of personal products. The quality and innovation is first rate. I am very pleased so far and looking forward to training their toothpaste as wall.</li>
            <li> I used ACT Fluoride mouthwash my whole life...but fluoride is bad for you (though great for your teeth!). So I switched to Listerine...but alcohol can cause mouth cancer. Now I&#x27;m looking for the next replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and am very excited about the safety of the product. It works...stops bad breathe etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep database gives this product a score of 1 (on a scale of 0-10, with 0 being the safest and 10 being the most toxic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I must say that the flavor, to me, is kind of bad - average at best. It&#x27;s the aftertaste, really - it&#x27;s not too bad until you spit it out. After a few uses I noticed it said it was 2x concentrated and that dilution might be better for some. I can definitely say that a ratio of 1:1 mouthwash to water improves it quit a bit. I still feel like it&#x27;s working and the aftertaste is greatly diminished...making it decent instead of bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still think I&#x27;ll keep looking for something more refreshing but am not unhappy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product, overall. The taste was really good, but really strong. Also, it left my mouth feeling very clean but, sometimes, it left my teeth feeling a little weak. I don&#x27;t know how to describe the feeling but it was only occasionally. The bottle lasted me about 1.5 months at 2x rinses per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I recommend this product to anyone wanting fresher breath.</li>
