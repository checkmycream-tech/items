            <li>Prior to this brush I would of laughed at you if you told me to get a brush for curly hair.</li>
            <li>fast arrival, brand new, love this item!</li>
            <li>This really is a great brush for little girls hair.</li>
            <li>This brush has saved us time getting ready in the mornings, helped us get through summer swim team, and allows her (6 yrs old) to start learning to brush her own hair.</li>
            <li>A friend mentioned this brush was the only one her daughter liked, so i gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>this brush glides right through without pulling on your strands and breaking any ends.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t like the larger brush, but I think it just has more bristles to touch her scalp.</li>
            <li>The The Wet Brush; Shine brush is nice, too.</li>
            <li>This brush is SO much better than my last brush.</li>
            <li>This is the exact review from my 11 year old daughter who I purchased these brushes for: &amp;#34;The brushes are so amazing that it only takes me 1 stroke to get through my hair.</li>
            <li>She has really fine hair and the Smaller brush</li>
            <li>When some of the little nubs came off the brush wasn&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li>They really work.</li>
            <li>And my sensitive snarly haired daughter too loves this gentle glider brush.</li>
            <li>They both have straight hair, but very tender heads and can&#x27;t stand regular brushes.  </li>
            <li>Definitely better on wet hair than a regular adult Walmart brush.</li>
            <li>My daughter does not have a sensitive head, but why cause discomfort if not necessary.  </li>

            <li> BEST PRODUCT EVER! fast arrival, brand new, love this item!</li>
            <li> Perfect for fine hair.  I don&#x27;t have much and can&#x27;t afford to lose too many strands.  I have no intetest in sporting a comb-over.  This does not pull out my hair.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Wonder product- my snarly hair feels like smooth butter while effortlessly brushing. And my sensitive snarly haired daughter too loves this gentle glider brush.</li>
            <li> It works better than cheaper brushes, but it&#x27;s not the magic brush it claims to be.  There are still tangles and knots that you&#x27;ll need to brush carefully and repeatedly to get out.</li>
            <li> for long thick wet.straight. hair this brush glides right through without pulling on your strands and breaking any ends. Just pay attention to the ends of the bristles. When some of the little nubs came off the brush wasn&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li> game changer! love this brush</li>
            <li> It does the job of getting through my thick hair even when wet. Sometimes I do have to start at the ends of my hair and work up but it takes much less time compared to combs and other brushes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have to admit - it actually works for my daughter. She has really fine hair and the Smaller brush doesn&#x27;t make her cry. She doesn&#x27;t like the larger brush, but I think it just has more bristles to touch her scalp. I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
            <li> 2nd order of these brushes!  They really work.</li>
            <li> Definitely better on wet hair than a regular adult Walmart brush.</li>
            <li> My dd and I have long curly hair. This brush has saved us time getting ready in the mornings, helped us get through summer swim team, and allows her (6 yrs old) to start learning to brush her own hair. Prior to this brush I would of laughed at you if you told me to get a brush for curly hair. Go, buy it now. The The Wet Brush; Shine brush is nice, too.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have long hair and she always used to say ow mommy when I used to brush her hair out after a shower!! Not anymore!! This is the best brush set ever!! No more hair pulling, it just glides through wet hair!! Def worth the purchase!! 😊</li>
            <li> My children LOVE these brushes.  They both have straight hair, but very tender heads and can&#x27;t stand regular brushes.  Love the metallic look of the purple colored one.  The travel size is great for purses or backpacks, too.</li>
            <li> The best brush ever!!! We love it !</li>
            <li> We love these...we have one in each bathroom and a mini for travel</li>
            <li> These are the best adult and child brushes!</li>
            <li> I had a brush that was my daughters favorite that we really liked (tangle teezer i think its called).  I also bought the Knot Genie previously (did not like that one at all, the bristles are super hard).  A friend mentioned this brush was the only one her daughter liked, so i gave it a try.  it is a great brush. My daughter does not have a sensitive head, but why cause discomfort if not necessary.  Anyway, i did a blind brush test with her to see which brush she preferred.  This brush won.  This really is a great brush for little girls hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush ever!  I have bought several and given them as gifts and everyone loves them.</li>
            <li> This is the exact review from my 11 year old daughter who I purchased these brushes for: &amp;#34;The brushes are so amazing that it only takes me 1 stroke to get through my hair. This brush is SO much better than my last brush. With my old brush, it took me 20 minutes to get through my hair and now with the Wet Brush, it only takes 20 seconds. I recommend it to all ages!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  I have fine, ever-tangled hair and this brush works wonders!  I may never use another kind.</li>
            <li> I now LOVE brushing my hair! No more dreading the brush!</li>
