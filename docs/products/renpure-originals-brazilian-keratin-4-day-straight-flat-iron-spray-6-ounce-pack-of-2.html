    <ol>
            <li>I also ran out of my pureshine brilliant blowout product.  </li>
            <li>Great for the price as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:) one of my GoTo products!!</li>
            <li>Hope it delivers what it states, has a good smell.</li>
            <li>They love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even nice just as a finishing</li>
            <li>and two bottles are more than amazing.</li>
            <li>It looks good at first but within a couple of hours it gets lots of flyaways and kind of bushy.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this spray.</li>
            <li>so was pleased to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>That being said it helps my hair stay healthy.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>It has great hold, you need to play around with it to determine how much you need.</li>
            <li>I love the smell as well.</li>
            <li>hope this review helps. :)</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t seem to find too many products that DO what they claim on the package.</li>
            <li>(Depending on what I&#x27;m doing with my hair) its awesome, I&#x27;ve bought this several times&amp; recipient it to EVERYONE</li>
            <li>So my hair frizzes easily in humidity or moist air.</li>
            <li>Like the spray bottle its easy to use and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Secondly my hair looked great and stayed looking great from day one and lasted an extra day or two.</li>
            <li>It IS true to its word.</li>
            <li>I have a very curly hair, latina style, and this product help me to get very straight hair, smooth and keep me frizz free for days.</li>
            <li>Within one or two passes I had the super shiny, super straight (like relaxed hair)</li>
            <li>My hair is very easy to straighten and generally will stay that way all day (unless its very humid or rainy!).</li>
            <li>Nice flat iron spray.</li>
            <li>the ingredients are easy to pronounce, and natural meaning it is not ladden with carcinogenic chemicals estrogen mimickers.</li>
            <li>And lastly it had a pleasant yet not overpowering scent, a major plus in my book.</li>
            <li>Once I sleep on it my hair looks great for at least two days.</li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t, it does give your hair a wonderful scent of coconut and leaves hair very shiny and straight, not greasy at all, very light feeling, but it definitely does not last a four days, does not last after shampoo not even a whole day, perhaps its only to protect hair from heat damage?</li>
            <li>I love it SO much that I try to only buy it in the 2-packs.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to use on wet hair first, then again for the iron</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not taking very hot showers, or getting water near my hair.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>but this one just didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>anyways, if you are looking to buy this product with hopes of getting your hair straight for 4 days, forget about it, its not going to happen.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to real keratin treatments, then don&#x27;t use this stuff.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t know how it is on people with much thicker hair.</li>
            <li>So, this product kept my hair straight for 7 days.</li>
            <li>And it kept it straight for 7 days until I washed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I will say I really like about this, is that it does not smell.</li>
            <li>I towel dry my hair for a good 5 minutes, use this spray about 5-10 times around my hair (even my bangs) and then blow dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to minimize the flat iron use due to damage while I get my hair to a length it can look good curly or straight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I avoid sweating or high heat</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It came within E.T.A., brand new condition &amp; packaged so it didn&#x27;t leak or get crunched.</li>
            <li>First of all I can air or blow dry my hair before straightening making it a real time saver.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine textured yet very thick and somewhere between curly and full of body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little bit sticky, apply lightly.</li>
            <li>thought this might help me have a shot at second day hair by keeping my hair straight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also recommended it to family and friends who are natural sisters.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t color my hair and I have naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li>This keeps my hair soft and moisturized without making your hair oily.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get my hair as straight, bouncy, and shiny initially or on 1st passing like the Organix BKT line.</li>
            <li>(I have 4b natural hair).</li>
            <li>You have to try it and experience the silkyness, smoothness and shine that this inexpensive product imparts to my Natural hair.</li>
            <li>I feel complete control with this two superstar items.&lt;br /&gt;Camille</li>
            <li>The first time, I used as per directions on my dry (blown out) hair.</li>
            <li>4 Day Straight Flat Iron Spray, 6 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li>I do very much like the other products in this line</li>
            <li>Then I used a blow dryer and brush to blow dry my hair straight.</li>
            <li>Daily showers make my hair pretty dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m between treatments, although my hair hasn&#x27;t reverted back to natural.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me; it may, however, be better for someone with thin, curly hair.</li>
            <li>Keeps your hair straight enough but also leaves it feeling very dry.  </li>
            <li>there are other factors that I think could have helped keep my hair straight</li>
            <li>A dab of coconut oil is enough for me and leaves my hair soft even after using a flat iron and it stays straight until I sweat or get it wet.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an African American natural woman.</li>
            <li>(I modify the insructions to fit my needs) allow my hair to air dry 80%, blow dry minimally and flat iron with my Babyliss nanotitanium.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I generally let my hair dry naturally then use a straightening iron.</li>
            <li>This Organics Spray not only smells like you just got off the beach, but it makes your hair soft and silky after you flat iron it.</li>
            <li>I have almost shoulder length fine, thin, wavy hair (2C/3A underneath).</li>

            <li> It slightly changed my dry time by making it a bit easier to manage.</li>

            <li> Mine is really thin and not dyed.</li>
            <li> It hardens your hair, but doesn&#x27;t look fake or stale.</li>
            <li> need to visit salons for expensive, damaging keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> and I straightened my very thin hair using it.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually impossible to make it that way.</li>

            <li> I have almost shoulder length fine, thin, wavy hair (2C/3A underneath). I used this spray on one side to see how it did. My hair is very easy to straighten and generally will stay that way all day (unless its very humid or rainy!). After sleeping on it though it ends up with waves and odd pieces sticking out which means I never get second day hair. Bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this might help me have a shot at second day hair by keeping my hair straight. No such luck. It didn&#x27;t. Same old slightly wavy in the morning meaning yet another flat iron round or pulling it back by headband. I&#x27;m trying to minimize the flat iron use due to damage while I get my hair to a length it can look good curly or straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not soak my hair with this but sprayed as directed. I do very much like the other products in this line but this one just didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t, it does give your hair a wonderful scent of coconut and leaves hair very shiny and straight, not greasy at all, very light feeling, but it definitely does not last a four days, does not last after shampoo not even a whole day, perhaps its only to protect hair from heat damage? anyways, if you are looking to buy this product with hopes of getting your hair straight for 4 days, forget about it, its not going to happen.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair frizzy and heavy, not straight.  I had to flat iron it every day, which I never have to do.

A dab of coconut oil is enough for me and leaves my hair soft even after using a flat iron and it stays straight until I sweat or get it wet.  This product was recommended to me; it may, however, be better for someone with thin, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this spray. I&#x27;m an African American natural woman. So my hair frizzes easily in humidity or moist air. So this spray is a godsend to me. I&#x27;ve also recommended it to family and friends who are natural sisters. They love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  A little hard to find in the retail stores so was pleased to find it on Amazon.  This product makes my hair a little smoother and makes it lie a little straighter and flatter across my back without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African-American woman with a relaxer in my hair. Using this product helps the relaxer last longer, where I don&#x27;t need to get a touch-up as often. That being said it helps my hair stay healthy.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. It has great hold, you need to play around with it to determine how much you need. It&#x27;s a little bit sticky, apply lightly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t color my hair and I have naturally wavy hair. I shower every day after I sweat a lot after the gym. Daily showers make my hair pretty dry. I towel dry my hair for a good 5 minutes, use this spray about 5-10 times around my hair (even my bangs) and then blow dry.  This keeps my hair soft and moisturized without making your hair oily.  I love the smell as well. I definitely reccommend this!!!</li>
            <li> Waist money - it doesn&#x27;t do the promised job</li>
            <li> I do 30 day keratin treatments at home.  I&#x27;m between treatments, although my hair hasn&#x27;t reverted back to natural. I also ran out of my pureshine brilliant blowout product.  I saw this Renpure flat iron spray on the store shelf yesterday and decided to try it.  Absolutely horrible.  My hair looks and feels like straw.  It&#x27;s dry and stiff. The iron dragged across my hair. No silkiness or movement whatsoever.  If you&#x27;re used to real keratin treatments, then don&#x27;t use this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product works! I had to go to a wedding and I straightened my very thin hair using it. It was rainy and humid all day (though cold), and my hair stayed put. It&#x27;s usually impossible to make it that way. It hardens your hair, but doesn&#x27;t look fake or stale. I wouldn&#x27;t know how it is on people with much thicker hair. Mine is really thin and not dyed.</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair straight enough but also leaves it feeling very dry.  Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li> So, this product kept my hair straight for 7 days. BUT, This was not without trial and error. The first time, I used as per directions on my dry (blown out) hair. Then I flat ironed it in. It did not recommend a temperature, so I just used around 350 degrees. It didn&#x27;t get my hair as straight, bouncy, and shiny initially or on 1st passing like the Organix BKT line. So I went throughout the day and in a little bit of humidity my hair started to frizz and revert back to curly. (I have 4b natural hair). So next day or so, I started over. I added it to my wet hair. This time I SATURATED the product in my hair. Like I used A LOT. Then I used a blow dryer and brush to blow dry my hair straight. It slightly changed my dry time by making it a bit easier to manage. Then I applied the flat iron @ 400-410 degrees in very small sections, and passed the iron slowly. Within one or two passes I had the super shiny, super straight (like relaxed hair), look that I wanted. And it kept it straight for 7 days until I washed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Now there are other factors that I think could have helped keep my hair straight so long.&lt;br /&gt;1. It is fall/autumn so the weather is not hot or humid&lt;br /&gt;2. I avoid sweating or high heat&lt;br /&gt;3. I&#x27;m not taking very hot showers, or getting water near my hair.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will say I really like about this, is that it does not smell. Some BKT&#x27;s have an odor when you sweat or wet your hair. This just seems to \\&quot;wash out\\&quot; when you wet your hair and doesn&#x27;t smell during flat ironing or blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps. :)</li>
            <li> You have to try it and experience the silkyness, smoothness and shine that this inexpensive product imparts to my Natural hair. Aaamazing! the ingredients are easy to pronounce, and natural meaning it is not ladden with carcinogenic chemicals estrogen mimickers. No formaldehyde, no parabens. Just fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I cleanse my hair twice a week and apply it consistantly to my wet hair (I modify the insructions to fit my needs) allow my hair to air dry 80%, blow dry minimally and flat iron with my Babyliss nanotitanium.&lt;br /&gt;No need to visit salons for expensive, damaging keratin treatment. I feel complete control with this two superstar items.&lt;br /&gt;Camille</li>
            <li> Hope it delivers what it states, has a good smell. and two bottles are more than amazing. Like the spray bottle its easy to use and comfortable.</li>
            <li> This Organics Spray not only smells like you just got off the beach, but it makes your hair soft and silky after you flat iron it. It&#x27;s even nice just as a finishing spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it. Great for the price as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINALLY...a product that works.</li>
            <li> Nice flat iron spray.</li>
            <li> Works well. Just be sure to use on wet hair first, then again for the iron</li>
            <li> My hair is fine textured yet very thick and somewhere between curly and full of body. I generally let my hair dry naturally then use a straightening iron. It looks good at first but within a couple of hours it gets lots of flyaways and kind of bushy. Once I sleep on it my hair looks great for at least two days. So.... in the past I had to do my hair at least a day in advance of when I wanted it straight. Until I tried Renpure . First of all I can air or blow dry my hair before straightening making it a real time saver. Secondly my hair looked great and stayed looking great from day one and lasted an extra day or two. Goodbye bushy hair! And lastly it had a pleasant yet not overpowering scent, a major plus in my book.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It IS true to its word. I don&#x27;t seem to find too many products that DO what they claim on the package. This one DOES (for me!) It does NOT make my hair Greasy or slimy. I like the way you use it to straighten your hair&amp; it LASTS ME 3-4DAYS!! (Depending on what I&#x27;m doing with my hair) its awesome, I&#x27;ve bought this several times&amp; recipient it to EVERYONE I know! I love it SO much that I try to only buy it in the 2-packs. I hope it works as well for you as it does for me! It came within E.T.A., brand new condition &amp; packaged so it didn&#x27;t leak or get crunched. I would(&amp;DO!) refer my friends &amp; family &amp; I would(&amp;Have!) Buy again from this Seller!! :) one of my GoTo products!!</li>
            <li> I have a very curly hair, latina style, and this product help me to get very straight hair, smooth and keep me frizz free for days. me encanta.[[ASIN:B005I0JWUQ Renpure Organics Brazilian Keratin 4 Day Straight Flat Iron Spray, 6 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> The product helps manage fly-aways and make my hair smoother.  I don&#x27;t care for the coconut smell but it doesn&#x27;t linger long.</li>
            <li> seems to dry my hair out a bit</li>
