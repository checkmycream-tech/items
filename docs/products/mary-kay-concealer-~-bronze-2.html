            <li>~bronze 2,just love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I decided on the Bronze 2.</li>
            <li>I love the Mary Kay concealer because it doubles as a concealer and foundation.  </li>
            <li>I love Mary Kay products.</li>
            <li>I love using Bronze 2 concealer as a foundation.</li>
            <li>, I love Mary Kay.  </li>
            <li>You just have to make sure you dot it on.  </li>
            <li>I will order more for me and my mother.</li>
            <li>but I prefer just to use it as what it is  concealer for highlighting  my MK consultant moved and while I can order from her website this 2 day shipping is a lot better. ..</li>
            <li>Its better than foundation.</li>
            <li>I love this concealer.</li>
            <li>I love not having to go through a MK rep. for my favorite product.</li>
            <li>Love It.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase from her:)</li>
            <li>Delivery time,even better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only a perfect cover over areas of imperfection, but when used as a foundation and set with a loose powder, my skin looks flawless!!</li>
            <li>Great coverage, good for dry shin, spot on color match</li>
            <li>I love this product and it does exactly what it was designed to do, however I have been purchasing it more and more and the price which is supposed to beat the manufacturer is now more than the manufacturer price</li>
            <li>Pink Sunshine is the BEST.</li>
            <li>but if your skin matches bronze 1 perfectly like mine does, then this will be too dark for you.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery too!  </li>
            <li>Dermablend cost more but it is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>sound like a review for Dermablend</li>
            <li>Got it just in time to try it on for an important event.</li>
            <li>I like this product, because it covers my blemishes, and makes my face look smooth, and blemish free.</li>
            <li>This is by far superior.  </li>
            <li>I use it for the first time and boy do i love the results.</li>
            <li>The yield of content is more and the quality is superior than other distributors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting ready to order some more when I finish typing this.</li>
            <li>Luckily it was just the box that suffered the damage.</li>
            <li>It works great to cover my dark circles under my eyes &amp; blemishes.</li>
            <li>I love it and can live without it.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I love to use thank you Mary Kay!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothe and blends VERY well!!</li>
            <li>it always give a finish of blending into the skin to give a refined more natural look and not as if a mask was made and placed on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found any other makeup that gives you such a natural-looking yet flawless finish.</li>
            <li>Mary Kay has the right type of products that work for me.</li>
            <li>The price is right and the products never disappoint.</li>
            <li>She is Always right on time with my order.</li>
            <li>now it sinks into my skin and something magical happens !</li>
            <li>I knew exactly what I wanted and opted to go with this seller</li>
            <li>I really dont know how I made it before you could really use this as a full face foundation</li>
            <li>This was the exact color I needed and ordered.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>First, I use a primer...</li>
            <li>Yes, if you have the type of job that demands you wear make up daily, it could become costly, but for me, the look of perfection I get with it is worth the cost!!</li>
            <li>I have used Mary Kay concealer in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li>Then I started using Dermablend for the past 10 years, I decided to give Mary Kay concealer another chance, it is cheaper than Dermablend and is a good product.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have been using mary kay concealer for years now and really like it.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is extremely reasonable and I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li>I live in an extremely hot and humid country.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for over 10 years, it&#x27;s great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>but Bronze 2 is the same color as the original Signature Bronze.</li>
            <li>this concealer is really great, small and easy to carry it last a long time and gives an even finish.</li>
            <li>The seller shipped it very fast but this product was old and made my face itch.</li>
            <li>texture was exactly how I expected it to be.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved it super fast.</li>
            <li>Makes my face look natural!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be on the lookout the next time I order any makeup ;)</li>
            <li>i always find myself coming back to buy this because its great...covers really well...</li>
            <li>Concealer matches my complexion and is not heavy feeling on my face.</li>
            <li>it is worth the price that I paid for it and is less than getting it from a consult online is cheaper</li>
            <li>When I opened it the whole box was crushed to a pulp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had trouble getting the RIGHT concealer for me.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this to women with age spots, and other blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;gggreen</li>
            <li>so it only takes a little to do your whole face.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble getting the RIGHT concealer for me.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this to women with age spots, and other blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;gggreen</li>
            <li> so it only takes a little to do your whole face.  </li>
            <li> It works so well that I don&#x27;t need to use foundation, and a little really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> product doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> My dark complexion has presented several challenges when searching for affordable solutions for personal enhancement.</li>
            <li> Unlike other make-up lines/brands, Mary-Kay keeps it simple.</li>
            <li> On my casual days, I use this product to cover a few minor imperfections, throw some mineral powder on top, &amp; run out the door.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay concealer is thicker and feels a bit heavier on my face than Dermablend and was harder to take off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected it in 5 days, it came in</li>
            <li> ,i used the entire tube and it faded quite a few marks</li>
            <li> I use it on days with no other foundation, just a little on the dark circles under my eyes and a couple other imperfections, a little powder on my forehead and nose</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Mary kay is my beauty line for foundation, concealer and powder, the best! it always give a finish of blending into the skin to give a refined more natural look and not as if a mask was made and placed on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LUB MARY KAY!!!</li>
            <li> Makes my face look natural!</li>
            <li> Mary Kay Concealer~bronze 2,just love it i have never used concealer before so i buy MK concealer because i am useing Mk products.I use it for the first time and boy do i love the results.</li>
            <li> I went back and forth trying to decide on the Bronze 1 or 2. I&#x27;m so glad I decided on the Bronze 2. It matches my medium-deep brown skin tone perfectly. I use it on days with no other foundation, just a little on the dark circles under my eyes and a couple other imperfections, a little powder on my forehead and nose and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li> I use it daily.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this concealer and it made my skin look awful.  I always give a product a chance to see but this one is not for me.  At the end of the day of wearing this concealer and foundation it literally slide down to my jaw line when I look in the mirror yikes!  I will never purchase this concealer again.</li>
            <li> I love the Mary Kay concealer because it doubles as a concealer and foundation.  It&#x27;s light and provides great coverage.  The only downside is the small tubing....product doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 10 years, it&#x27;s great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I guess I should have paid more attention to the label of this product when it said bronze! I bought it thinking it was equivalent to a medium color and it turned out to be too dark for a medium. It&#x27;s a shame, I would have loved it! I&#x27;ll be on the lookout the next time I order any makeup ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but if your skin matches bronze 1 perfectly like mine does, then this will be too dark for you.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I had already reviewed this product with a five based on I always use this product from Mary Kay. I love Mary Kay products. The seller shipped it very fast but this product was old and made my face itch.</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay concealer in the past and loved it. Then I started using Dermablend for the past 10 years, I decided to give Mary Kay concealer another chance, it is cheaper than Dermablend and is a good product. Mary Kay concealer is thicker and feels a bit heavier on my face than Dermablend and was harder to take off.&lt;br /&gt; Dermablend is lighter and comes off easier even if I don&#x27;t have the Dermablend remover. Dermablend cost more but it is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;This sound like a review for Dermablend but I just wanted you to know since I have used both products which one I prefer. They both give excellent coverage but I don&#x27;t like that sticky thick feeling that Mary Kay concealer gives my face. I will use it on other parts of my body but not my face.</li>
            <li> I love this Mary kay concealer! Coves great.</li>
            <li> Love this concealer - perfect match for me and blends beautifully!</li>
            <li> it is worth the price that I paid for it and is less than getting it from a consult online is cheaper</li>
            <li> It was an nice concealer it was just a little too dark for my skin tone but over all a good product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble getting the RIGHT concealer for me. Mary Kay Products always seem to work best and the Concealer is absolutely AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product and it does exactly what it was designed to do, however I have been purchasing it more and more and the price which is supposed to beat the manufacturer is now more than the manufacturer price</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is perfection. Bronze 2  ( I have medium dark skin with golden/warm undertones)&lt;br /&gt;Awesome coverage... Right now I am in a losing battle with the bad habit of picking my face and after this... you couldnt even tell.&lt;br /&gt;The texture was exactly how I expected it to be.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved it super fast. I expected it in 5 days, it came in 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;This is a small package ( it doesnt take alot to get the job done but I am still expecting to have to replace this sooner than Id like.&lt;br /&gt;Poor packaging... When I opened it the whole box was crushed to a pulp. I was terrified that my make up would be all over the place or be used and dried and cracked. Luckily it was just the box that suffered the damage. I took away a star because my make up quite obviously could have been damaged and came very close to coming to me in a disgusting mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to my friends and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love using Bronze 2 concealer as a foundation. It&#x27;s not only a perfect cover over areas of imperfection, but when used as a foundation and set with a loose powder, my skin looks flawless!! Yes, if you have the type of job that demands you wear make up daily, it could become costly, but for me, the look of perfection I get with it is worth the cost!!</li>
            <li> Other than whatever chemical they use that may be carcinogen, etc., I love Mary Kay.  I haven&#x27;t found any other makeup that gives you such a natural-looking yet flawless finish. I have scars on my face from a burn I received as a baby, and the concealing does a very good job of minimizing the scars. You just have to make sure you dot it on.  If you try to rub it on, you&#x27;ll rub it away.</li>
            <li> Great coverage, good for dry shin, spot on color match</li>
            <li> Excellent product and price can&#x27;t be beat. I only order this way from now on.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!! It works great to cover my dark circles under my eyes &amp; blemishes. It works well with their foundation or CC cream.</li>
            <li> Best concealer in the world.  If you have tried everything else.....like I did...stop it!  I don&#x27;t use any foundation, just my Mary Kay Concealer and get tons of compliments!  It covers every imperfection!  Order it now....except leave the Bronze 2 for me!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since 7th grade..im in college now...no matter which makeup brand i buy...i always find myself coming back to buy this because its great...covers really well...but i mix this with bronze two because this color is too dark for me. im brown skin and when i mix the two it match perfectly</li>
            <li> My dark complexion has presented several challenges when searching for affordable solutions for personal enhancement. Mary Kay has the right type of products that work for me. The price is right and the products never disappoint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mary Kay bronze 2 concealer for over three years. It&#x27;s the only concealer  I trust on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so impress with how quickly I get my orders from you, keep up the good work...a customer for life!</li>
            <li> I always buy this product and use it for a highlighter. This is the only product I love to use thank you Mary Kay! It shipped on time and the price is very nice thank you seller!</li>
            <li> I have loved these products for many years and the coverage is excellent. I will order more for me and my mother.</li>
            <li> Speed on service is good and delivery is always on  time.The yield of content is more and the quality is superior than other distributors. After experimenting this purchase by ||Amazon I have not regretted!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! It goes on smoothe and blends VERY well!! I knew exactly what I wanted and opted to go with this seller and I am VERY GLAD I did! I received the item promptly and did I mention, I LOVE IT! Unlike other make-up lines/brands, Mary-Kay keeps it simple. It&#x27;s a good, clean brand that just speaks for itself! I LOVE IT! Great price and I will be ordering many more!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!  Ive been using it for months now it sinks into my skin and something magical happens ! I really dont know how I made it before you could really use this as a full face foundation but I prefer just to use it as what it is  concealer for highlighting  my MK consultant moved and while I can order from her website this 2 day shipping is a lot better. ..thank you</li>
            <li> At age 46, I paint the barn (i.e. apply makeup) daily. So, I&#x27;m not one to be without my Mary Kay concealer. My concealer was delivered promtply and I am grateful. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This color is a perfect for me.  On my 2nd tube.  Its better than foundation.</li>
            <li> Color was awesome and matched.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer. I use it as a highlighter. It doesn&#x27;t crease</li>
            <li> This was the exact color I needed and ordered.</li>
            <li> This is a really great concealer and very light weight.  It is the only concealer that I have found that can match my complexion and undertones.</li>
            <li> I finally found it !!. Hope you keep it in stock. The perfect concealer for my skin type. Got it just in time to try it on for an important event. Worked great. Thanks</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great price, and excellent concealer! I&#x27;ve used Mary Kay for about a year now and it evens my skin tone, it&#x27;s nit heavy.</li>
            <li> the best concealer I know...will always buy this in fact I&#x27;m getting ready to order some more when I finish typing this.</li>
            <li> I rate it 5 stars cause it is a good product an I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> It was great. I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Perfect! I love not having to go through a MK rep. for my favorite product.</li>
            <li> I use it as my foundation. It&#x27;s thick so it only takes a little to do your whole face.  I&#x27;ve found that you get away with using less product if you use a brush instead of a sponge.</li>
            <li> Love It. I hate that Mary Kay no longer makes the Signature Concealer anymore but Bronze 2 is the same color as the original Signature Bronze. Unfortunately the new version the one here is not as thick as the signature one. I love it and can live without it.</li>
            <li> this concealer is really great, small and easy to carry it last a long time and gives an even finish.</li>
            <li> I have been using mary kay concealer for years now and really like it. The tube is smaller than before but the product is the same.</li>
            <li> I am forever a fan of this product. I discovered it about 10 years ago and I have been using it since then! I live in an extremely hot and humid country. This product does not run or fade. The price on Amazon is extremely reasonable and I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Everything was great!  Quick delivery too!  I no longer have to wait on my Marykay lady for this item.</li>
            <li> this works okay,i used the entire tube and it faded quite a few marks but i wouldn&#x27;t say that this product alone did it.</li>
            <li> I like this product, because it covers my blemishes, and makes my face look smooth, and blemish free. Would highly recommend this to women with age spots, and other blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;gggreen</li>
            <li> I have been using E-Lauder for years and stumbled upon this concealer.  This is by far superior.  The coverage is amazing and the color is perfect.  I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> This concealer covers all flaws big or small.  On my casual days, I use this product to cover a few minor imperfections, throw some mineral powder on top, &amp; run out the door. A must have!</li>
            <li> Pink Sunshine is the BEST. She is Always right on time with my order. I love the Mary Kay concealer, it has great coverage. I will continue to purchase from her:)</li>
            <li> Perfect match to my skin tone!!</li>
            <li> Concealer matches my complexion and is not heavy feeling on my face. Worked great with powder foundation. Price is great. Delivery time,even better.</li>
            <li> I would suggest getting very good coverage</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It works so well that I don&#x27;t need to use foundation, and a little really does go a long way. First, I use a primer...then I apply the concealer with a beauty blender, followed by milani multitasker face powder to set it and I get loads of compliments on how great my skin looks. I definitely recommend this product, as I am sold on the results.</li>
            <li> this product recently changed and while some think it&#x27;s the same thing packaged differently it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  It now comes in a lip gloss type applicator and is not of the consistency as the one pictured here.  So I&#x27;ve been scouring stores and trying on concealer to find something that works again.  I kind of feel if it&#x27;s not broke don&#x27;t fix it, but such is life.  I&#x27;ve been using Mary Kay for many years for their concealer, but this good thing has come to an end.</li>
