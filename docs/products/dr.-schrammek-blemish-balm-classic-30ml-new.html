            <li>so you can decide depending on your skin to use makeup on top or just concealer on the areas that need it</li>
            <li>Shipped very fast and good package.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I use this entire product line and love everything about it.</li>

            <li>Calms my skin and leaves it looking smooth and natural.</li>
            <li>and i LOVE that it comes in different shades.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>But this cream offers fabulous coverage for my red skin, feels super light, and leaves my skin glowing and looking natural.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t spread on the skin like the real dr. schrammek bb cream.</li>
            <li>to get the most natural and even coverage possible.</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be sensitive and prone to acne, so this product helps to sooth my skin after hot showers and exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is a little more thick than I would have imagined, but can easily be diluted with a serum or fluid of any kind to get that elusive &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Use to give my face a little color, protect from pimples, and lightly cover fresh pimples..</li>
            <li>Its not like normal foundation.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a new item.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34; color seems fine for my on-the-pale-side Korean skin, but maybe a little on the beige side (again, easily remedied by diluting it by half with serum).</li>
            <li>I have also used it to calm sunburn, clear up itchy dry patches, and treated razor burn with it.      </li>
            <li>but since I use this one never had that problem.&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommending to people who has sensitive skins &amp; acne troubles.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little surprised with how thick it was, but after blended it looks really nice.</li>
            <li>unlike the other ones ive used that make me too light or even grey.</li>
            <li>This product will not dry up acne, but it will help calm it down somewhat.  </li>
            <li>I had never heard of Dr. Schrammek before, but after reading all the other positive reviews on Amazon I decided to go for it.</li>
            <li>Her last facial was a little more intense than usual</li>
            <li>I find this goes very well with my mineral foundation and can use less foundation as a result.  </li>

            <li> According to the Schrammek site, this product was developed to sooth skin after their green peel treatment.  Over the years, people have found other uses for it, so Schrammek made it part of their \\&quot;Regulating Care\\&quot; line of products, which are used to balance the skin and reduce inflamation.    My skin tends to be sensitive and prone to acne, so this product helps to sooth my skin after hot showers and exfoliation.  Its \\&quot;classic\\&quot; tint also assists by helping to even out any red areas caused by acne.  However, this is not makeup, so it will not cover like a foundation does.  I use this product as a primer for my makeup under my BareMineral foundation. I find this goes very well with my mineral foundation and can use less foundation as a result.  I also find it soothes skin irritations resulting from acne, dry skin and other environmental irritants, helping my skin to heal faster than without it.      Since discovering this product in April 2009, it has become a staple in my beauty routine.  A little does go a long way and it is nice that you can build it up starting with a thin layer.  Most often, I use it in during the day, but will use it at night as a spot treatment for skin irritation on my face or anywhere on my body.  This product will not dry up acne, but it will help calm it down somewhat.  I have also used it to calm sunburn, clear up itchy dry patches, and treated razor burn with it.      This is really a wonderful product that serves multiple purposes!</li>
            <li> My favorite bb cream! coverage is good and I use as foundation. Shipping was fast and I love the price too.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I was introduced to this product by a makeup artist for my blemish control. I&#x27;ve been using this product as an alternative to foundation - excellent coverage and controls blemishes well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!</li>
            <li> I used this product a lot after having the Green Peel.It helps when my break outs are emerging and it dries them up.I use it every now and again when I break out.Overall I can say I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I love the coverage on this. Unfortunately this made me break out the same day I put it on my face. Contains oil so it was not good on my already oily face. Tried it a second time with same results.</li>
            <li> Better than any BB Cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I use this entire product line and love everything about it. But this cream offers fabulous coverage for my red skin, feels super light, and leaves my skin glowing and looking natural. A VERY little goes a long way so it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Works really well on blemishes!</li>
            <li> I was recommended to buy this from my facialist. I had never heard of Dr. Schrammek before, but after reading all the other positive reviews on Amazon I decided to go for it. The consistency is a little more thick than I would have imagined, but can easily be diluted with a serum or fluid of any kind to get that elusive &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;. The &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34; color seems fine for my on-the-pale-side Korean skin, but maybe a little on the beige side (again, easily remedied by diluting it by half with serum). I was a little disappointed that the actual product is very small (1.0 fluid oz) but I was actually recommended a BB cream that was twice this price by my facialist initially. I was initially a little worried about putting &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34; on my skin after a facial but she assured me the Dr. Schrammek&#x27;s would actually speed up the healing. Her last facial was a little more intense than usual but I do feel like the cream helped with the scarring.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different products to try to heal/ conceal my acne. At first I was a little surprised with how thick it was, but after blended it looks really nice. Calms my skin and leaves it looking smooth and natural. Conceals blemishes while simultaneously healing them. Not oily. Can wear alone or as a base for powder. Before, I seemed to always have a several blemishes on my face, now my breakouts are minimal and far in between. This small bottle lasted me four months (with usage almost every single day). This is my miracle cream and I will continue to buy this product. A+++</li>
            <li> good product with good price.    delivered with good condition.    I like this BB, and I will order again!!</li>
            <li> A great product. Good price compared to what I paid at the Naturopathic practitioner. Thank u</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! Doesn&#x27;t make me break out! Great coverage without making me look like I&#x27;m wearing lots of foundation</li>
            <li> Shipped very fast and good package.&lt;br /&gt;It came as they are.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I had so trouble w/ any facial BB cremes, but since I use this one never had that problem.&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommending to people who has sensitive skins &amp; acne troubles.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a new item. Instead of the official factory seal, it had a serial number and bar code printed by the seller (sticky paper material). The bb cream showed separation with oil and it didn&#x27;t spread on the skin like the real dr. schrammek bb cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this years ago when i lived in germany, but I had kind of forgot about it since then. It is great for my super acne prone/oiy skin and i LOVE that it comes in different shades. unlike the other ones ive used that make me too light or even grey. Im glad i stumbled upon it again! :) Just remember to use very little and pat it on to blend (Dont smear!) to get the most natural and even coverage possible. Its not like normal foundation.</li>
            <li> This is the best BB cream I have tried and I use it every morning over my sunscreen and under the makeup. It feels light and non-greasy and really works to make skin feel healthier.  It does not provide a lot of coverage and that is what BB creams do so you can decide depending on your skin to use makeup on top or just concealer on the areas that need it</li>
            <li> amazing product, would not be without this! Calms redness, great cover for blemishes and more.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Very nice!</li>
            <li> I use classic and color matches my skin tone perfectly. Little pricey but works well.</li>
            <li> Pat on blemished face after washing it . Use to give my face a little color, protect from pimples, and lightly cover fresh pimples..</li>
