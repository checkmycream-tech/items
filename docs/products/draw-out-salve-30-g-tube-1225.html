            <li>I am impressed.  </li>
            <li>AWESOME product!!!  </li>
            <li>This product is wonderful, our pharmacy has carried it for over 30 years.</li>
            <li>This product is great to use to get rid of warts also.  </li>
            <li>I GIVE IT 5 STARS FOR SURE!!</li>
            <li>This is supposed to be for drawing out splinters, but it&#x27;s really good on any wound.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have bought many items from Amazon and this is a good source.</li>
            <li>Around six that evening, I was able to put the splinter out.</li>
            <li>My dad was in the army many years ago</li>
            <li>But it does work its better than using a safety pin to dig your sticker or thorn out.</li>
            <li>When I removed it in the morning, the boil had come to a head and all was well again:)</li>
            <li>It works better than anything I have ever seen or used for getting rid of warts.  </li>
            <li>So glad I was able to find it on Amazon (not at the grocery store, or Rite-Aid or CVS).</li>
            <li>Within two days I was able to remove with tweezers.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to purchase this at Eckerd, but when they were bought out, i have not been able to find it anywhere else except Amazon and Wonder laboratories.</li>
            <li>It had opened up more</li>
            <li>MORE PAIN!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic.  </li>
            <li>This was supposed to be the newest incarnation of \\&quot;Wonderful Dream Salve\\&quot; which the same company made many years ago.  </li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with their service and the price was very affordable.</li>
            <li>Super product!</li>
            <li>Just found this at my local CVS which is great because I am in pain NOW</li>
            <li>Draw out salve by wonderlabs is a great product especially if you order it from wonderlabs.  </li>
            <li>wonder laboratories sent the item right on time.</li>
            <li>I received it right away</li>
            <li>Was very happy to be able to ship it to RI and the infection opened within 1 day, giving the relief that was badly needed.</li>
            <li>A MIRACLE!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had lots of boils &amp; this is the first time I have ever tried this.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works and does what the doctors would not attempt.  </li>
            <li>This boil was very infected and after months of digging and puncturing with a needle, I purchase a tube of this salve.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Put on a lite amount, bandage it, and overnight much of the infection is gone.</li>
            <li>There is so much relief for me when that happens.   </li>
            <li>The other, however, didn&#x27;t keep it on during the day and it took 2 more days to be rid of the warts.  </li>
            <li>Really did have high hopes for this stuff.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use a band aid, because it is dark and will stain your cloth.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had a thorn on TOP of my little toe that I had tried unsuccessfully to remove for 3 weeks  </li>
            <li>Just apply and put bandaid on and leave on for a few days or more and it will draw out the sticker.</li>
            <li>Amazingly the pain and swelling went down by the next morning.</li>
            <li>I called right back (accidents happen), and again could not get anyone on the phone.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I decided to try some of this on my sons feet and in less than a week, both of them were completely free of warts.  </li>
            <li>I used it for 2 days &amp; put it on in in the morning &amp; in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days it looked like it was almost ready to pop, so I poked a hole in the center of it with a straight pin to ease the pressure.</li>
            <li>I had a boil that was well over 2 weeks old and refused to come to a head.</li>
            <li>But over night when I use it, it drains really well the next morning.</li>
            <li>I put the ointment on again the next morning &amp; by that evening it was ready to pop.</li>
            <li>By the 4th day it went away completely.</li>
            <li>I saw a little pus, but I still could not pop it because it was really sore &amp; it wasn&#x27;t ready.</li>
            <li>So I am happy with the wonderlab product, very unhappy and would never order from DHMedical again.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s ingredient Ichmanthol ( spelling) has a odd ( bad) smell, but it&#x27;s effect is great.</li>
            <li> They had gotten them from using the same shower that my neice used and she always has warts on her feet and has for a really long time.  </li>
            <li> Old school black salve like your grandparents kept in their medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit offensive and it&#x27;s dark green and very sticky but it does work.</li>
            <li> the 3/8\\&quot; long splinter came out!  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone with problem warts, boils or other infections.</li>
            <li> I was applying the salve at night and covering with a band-aid, but it seemed not much was happening</li>
            <li> From what I gather, the salve drew out the mess and the boil is now gone, leaving only a slight skin raise where it once was.</li>
            <li> ICHTHAMMOL softens the skin and allows the foreign object to come out.  </li>
            <li> My oldest son had his frozen and tried other things that didn&#x27;t work until</li>
            <li> I have used other products and it takes for days to work.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but was really hoping this stuff would work for my boils!  </li>
            <li> Especially warts that are hard to get rid of any other way.  </li>
            <li> and he had a tube of ointment called ichthammol which was a black tar looking substances.</li>
            <li> stuff smells like road asphalt and black in color.</li>
            <li> I tried for a day and a half.</li>
            <li> Smells and looks kind of awful (dark brown, tar-like substance) and used to be sold everywhere.  </li>
            <li> [I could feel a little tingling, but that&#x27;s all].</li>
            <li> All we did was put the ointment on the wart, sort of in a small blob and then cover with duct tape.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a small town pharmacy where I work.</li>
            <li> did a search and find this product draw out salve its the same stuff and still smells bad.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this product anywhere at the drugstores in this state or even back in RI where it was badly needed for infected toenails.</li>
            <li> Costs $4 there &amp; you have to ask for it as they have it behind the counter in the pharmacy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He was so relieved and had no more painful warts.  </li>
            <li> I used this on a boil when all else failed.</li>
            <li> Have tried to get my sister and mother to use this stuff on my neice&#x27;s warts and they seem to be afraid to use it.  </li>
            <li> But smelled bad.</li>
            <li> We have used it since 1950 when a druggest used it on a bad knee infection I had.</li>
            <li> It may smell awful but this item works!</li>

            <li> I had a splinter in my finger that was swollen and infected.  I got the cream, put it on the sore about noon.  Around six that evening, I was able to put the splinter out. Amazingly the pain and swelling went down by the next morning.</li>
            <li> I was working with a wooden ladder around the house and occasionally get splinters in my hands.  Sometime I have to soak them out.  Three weeks ago, I got a splinter that would not come out.  I went to urgent care and they could not remove it.  I started to get a fever from the infection and went back to urgent care.  They said go to a hand specialist.  Next I called the emergency room to see if they could help and they could not say.  As a last resort I tried ICHTHAMMOL and within 24 hours the 3/8\\&quot; long splinter came out!  I am impressed.  This stuff really works and does what the doctors would not attempt.  ICHTHAMMOL softens the skin and allows the foreign object to come out.  I recommend your purchase of this product.  I have bought many items from Amazon and this is a good source.</li>
            <li> My dad was in the army many years ago and he had a tube of ointment called ichthammol which was a black tar looking substances. It helped draw out stickers or thorns in your skin. But smelled bad. And my parents still have it to this day and it still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a search and find this product draw out salve its the same stuff and still smells bad. But it does work its better than using a safety pin to dig your sticker or thorn out. Just apply and put bandaid on and leave on for a few days or more and it will draw out the sticker. I highly recommend this product. It works for me and my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> After doing some research online, I found this \\&quot;drawing salve.\\&quot; I had an ingrown hair on my neck which turned into a very deep boil. This boil was very infected and after months of digging and puncturing with a needle, I purchase a tube of this salve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stuff smells like road asphalt and black in color. I was applying the salve at night and covering with a band-aid, but it seemed not much was happening [I could feel a little tingling, but that&#x27;s all]. I would wash it off the next morning before going to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions - apply morning and night and cover with a bandage [essentially wearing it 24 hours a day]. I did that on the following weekend and on Sunday morning, the boil surfaced and I removed it. Super product!</li>
            <li> I used this on a boil when all else failed. The smell is a bit offensive and it&#x27;s dark green and very sticky but it does work. I had a boil that REFUSED TO GO AWAY so I put a glob of this stuff on and covered it with a bandaid and left it alone overnight. When I removed it in the morning, the boil had come to a head and all was well again:)</li>
            <li> Old school black salve like your grandparents kept in their medicine cabinet. Smells like road tar, but will draw out whatever ails you.</li>
            <li> I had a boil that was well over 2 weeks old and refused to come to a head. I had even taken RX antibiotics and the thing didn&#x27;t shrink. Searched online for some \\&quot;home remedies\\&quot; and came upon a page where some folks insisted that this product would indeed take care of the problem boil. Decided to order from Amazon (it arrived promptly) and put it to the test. Used (without bandages because the boil was in a \\&quot;bendy\\&quot; place) for about a week, applying at night; because yes this stuff smells like road tar. From what I gather, the salve drew out the mess and the boil is now gone, leaving only a slight skin raise where it once was. It may smell awful but this item works!</li>
            <li> This product is great to use to get rid of warts also.  Both of my sons had warts on their feet.  They had gotten them from using the same shower that my neice used and she always has warts on her feet and has for a really long time.  Anyways, I decided to try some of this on my sons feet and in less than a week, both of them were completely free of warts.  All we did was put the ointment on the wart, sort of in a small blob and then cover with duct tape.  One son wore the ointment and duct tape to school during the day and his warts were gone in 3 days.  The other, however, didn&#x27;t keep it on during the day and it took 2 more days to be rid of the warts.  It&#x27;s seems to suffocate the warts and softens them and they tend to end up falling out of your skin.  AWESOME product!!!  Have tried to get my sister and mother to use this stuff on my neice&#x27;s warts and they seem to be afraid to use it.  Why, I don&#x27;t know.  It works better than anything I have ever seen or used for getting rid of warts.  Especially warts that are hard to get rid of any other way.  My oldest son had his frozen and tried other things that didn&#x27;t work until this and 3 days was all it took.  He was so relieved and had no more painful warts.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone with problem warts, boils or other infections.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t blame the product for not doing it&#x27;s job because my ingrown hair is in a tricky spot. It doesn&#x27;t allow me to keep it covered throughout the day. But over night when I use it, it drains really well the next morning. Can&#x27;t wait for it to work its way out.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be for drawing out splinters, but it&#x27;s really good on any wound.  Softens the edges and promotes healing.  Smells and looks kind of awful (dark brown, tar-like substance) and used to be sold everywhere.  So glad I was able to find it on Amazon (not at the grocery store, or Rite-Aid or CVS).</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000QWLOCK Draw OUT Salve 1 Oz Tube #1225]]  This product works wonders on any type infection. We have used it since 1950 when a druggest used it on a bad knee infection I had. It&#x27;s ingredient Ichmanthol ( spelling) has a odd ( bad) smell, but it&#x27;s effect is great. Put on a lite amount, bandage it, and overnight much of the infection is gone.</li>
            <li> I had a thorn on TOP of my little toe that I had tried unsuccessfully to remove for 3 weeks  Everytime I attempted to dig it out I only ended up making it go deeper  I thought I would give the salve a try before going to the Dr.. Within two days I was able to remove with tweezers. This stuff works!</li>
            <li> This it the only product that works well on my cysts.  I have used other products and it takes for days to work. Draw out Salve works overnight. There is so much relief for me when that happens.   I used to be able to purchase this at Eckerd, but when they were bought out, i have not been able to find it anywhere else except Amazon and Wonder laboratories. wonder laboratories sent the item right on time. I was very satisfied with their service and the price was very affordable. I bought five. I wont have to search for this product anymore.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful, our pharmacy has carried it for over 30 years. I purchased this product for a small town pharmacy where I work. After two weeks I still hadn&#x27;t received the product. I called to check the status of my order and couldn&#x27;t get anyone on the phone (in any department). I tried for a day and a half. I finally spoke to someone who put me on hold for ten minutes, then was disconnected. I called right back (accidents happen), and again could not get anyone on the phone. I have yet to get information on my order. Our drugstore makes numerous purchases with independent pharmaceutical companies, we will never use this company again!!!!</li>
            <li> Sorry, but was really hoping this stuff would work for my boils!  Nada!  Back to Boil Ease.  Really did have high hopes for this stuff.</li>
            <li> Just found this at my local CVS which is great because I am in pain NOW &amp; I can not wait for shipping. Costs $4 there &amp; you have to ask for it as they have it behind the counter in the pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS STUFF IS A MIRACLE!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had lots of boils &amp; this is the first time I have ever tried this. It works by softening the skin alowing the puss inside to come to a head. I used it for 2 days &amp; put it on in in the morning &amp; in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days it looked like it was almost ready to pop, so I poked a hole in the center of it with a straight pin to ease the pressure. I saw a little pus, but I still could not pop it because it was really sore &amp; it wasn&#x27;t ready. I put the ointment on again the next morning &amp; by that evening it was ready to pop. It had opened up more so I squeezed it &amp; released the core &amp; lots of puss. It was such a relief!! NO MORE PAIN!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use this again &amp; again &amp; order it from Amazon when I start to run low. I GIVE IT 5 STARS FOR SURE!!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this product anywhere at the drugstores in this state or even back in RI where it was badly needed for infected toenails. Was very happy to be able to ship it to RI and the infection opened within 1 day, giving the relief that was badly needed.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my dog Kandee. She had a boil or cyst on her foot and antibiotics didn&#x27;t work for her. So I thought I&#x27;d give this salve a try. I put it on twice and covered it each time overnight. By the 4th day it went away completely. This product is amazing. I received it right away and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> My mother and grandmother have always used and recommended the pine gum salve. It works wonders.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic.  It removes infections over night.  Make sure to use a band aid, because it is dark and will stain your cloth.  My dad has been using this product for 40 years.  It is an oldie, but goody.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the claims of what it would do.  This product did not do what it was claimed to do.  This was supposed to be the newest incarnation of \\&quot;Wonderful Dream Salve\\&quot; which the same company made many years ago.  It&#x27;s not even close to that product, in performance or appearance.    The price was low, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Draw out salve by wonderlabs is a great product especially if you order it from wonderlabs.  Do no order it from DHMedical, even though they are cheaper on the tube price.  What they send you is not the same product.  It says draw out salve but it is by another company, not wonderlabs and nowhere does it say it is 20% ichthammol ointment.  Not the same thing even though they show it as the same on line.  You almost can&#x27;t get ahold of DHMedical, by phone or email.  They do not return your calls or emails.  So I am happy with the wonderlab product, very unhappy and would never order from DHMedical again.</li>
            <li> Ichthammol use to be sold in drug stores and pharmacies.  Why they stopped carrying it I&#x27;ll never know.  In any event, the product WORKS. I&#x27;ve had several infections from a hang nail.  Several fingers became infected and I applied the ointment.  Between one and two days the infection cleared up.  I am currectly using the product for another infection and it is doing what it&#x27;s claimed to do.</li>
