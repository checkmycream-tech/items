            <li>After having this product for while I have determined that it&#x27;s not that great.  </li>
            <li>Gelish is a great gel polish brand...</li>
            <li>Works great not to mention you will save $$.</li>

            <li>I am so happy with this kit, great buy :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done 2 manicures and both have held up fairly well.  </li>
            <li>good starter kit.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s part of the process of looking good..</li>
            <li>Also, SH products are generally good, so I preferred to go with the brand</li>
            <li>She loved it too.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look as good as to the nail salon I been going to.  </li>
            <li>Nails come out looking gorgeous</li>
            <li>Hoping that the lights stay good for a while</li>
            <li>Merchant made good on my purchase thank you</li>
            <li>It looks as good as a salon no-chip manicure.</li>
            <li>Price was good, I might try another brand.</li>
            <li>Good starter kit</li>
            <li>otherwise it&#x27;s still a good starter kit that comes with what you need.</li>
            <li>but I gave it to my mother and she loved it.</li>
            <li>I used three times with good results.  </li>
            <li>But, I love the convenience and how beautiful the nails are when they are done...</li>
            <li>SUPER!!!</li>
            <li>Still, 5 days with colour that looks perfect is rare for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still happy. :)</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own nails for some tome using good quality polishes.</li>
            <li>My nails turned out beautifully, have lasted for 10 days, and still going strong.  </li>
            <li>It works - notning more to say!</li>
            <li>Im in love with this product!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to see it here now!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Love everything about it!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I LOVE MY KIT!</li>
            <li>Love this home gel nail polish system!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Amazing colors will occur.  </li>
            <li>It works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>This kit is amazing ...</li>
            <li>The light work great for two applications after that</li>
            <li>It looked amazing, I couldn&#x27;t believe the shine, almost looks like plastic nails.</li>
            <li>My nails did not come out nice at all.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product and thought it was a great value....</li>
            <li>this setup is WELL worth it!!!  </li>
            <li>I found OPI and Mode (a super cheap polish) to be the best wearing.</li>
            <li>If you have a steady hand and are good at painting your nails yourself, it goes on beautifully.</li>
            <li>I bought this at Rite Aid, and am happy to see it available on Amazon too :).</li>
            <li>This stuff looks as good as the salon stuff and works as easily as it claims.</li>
            <li>Very easy.  </li>
            <li>it was very easy to do.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>If they do bubble and peel like mine did, it is very easy to redo.</li>
            <li>But so far everything is great!</li>
            <li>I love doing my own nails.  </li>
            <li>I say, just make sure you have nice hygiene</li>
            <li>The polish peels off the nails really easy!  </li>
            <li>But I followed the easy directions, and had no problem!</li>
            <li>But if you can apply nail polish cleanly and evenly, this is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>if you aren&#x27;t good at applying nail polish in a clean fashion, this won&#x27;t help you, try the strips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both the gel polish that comes with the kit and my own regular nail polish, and both work great!</li>
            <li>exactly what was advertised of shown on the website, packaging was good, very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>in all for a first timer it was a great result.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was great, however, I don&#x27;t even use it anymore</li>
            <li>It works just fine for that!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and looks nice, no peeling, and is shiny.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve found that curing the product for longer than the directions say helps to get a better cure.  </li>
            <li>I went to the salon once and got the shellac and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>It worked and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise it may have taken me more like 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll try this again when I have more time</li>
            <li>and I am not as skilled as the manicurist at the salon.</li>
            <li>and I love the color.  </li>
            <li>I love having this product to do at home when it works around my schedule.  </li>
            <li>I totally LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I teach ofr a lving and one of my students nails were looking so cute</li>
            <li>When applying the top gel, the color of the nail polish comes off a bit.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>The top gel is sticky even after curing.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>I wish there was more variety in colors.</li>
            <li>i have been buying more colors since i got this.</li>
            <li>Once I got the hang of it, I came to love this gel mani kit.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a more purple tone, but</li>
            <li>Also I did do nail stamping after doing the top coat</li>
            <li>I then put the top coat over and cured.</li>
            <li>One stone popped off because the top coat peeled off the end and the stone came with it.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>purchases, using OPI top coat I could get a week, sometimes</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d decided to invest in a gel kit as they prices have dropped dramatically with more and more kits entering the market.</li>
            <li>, you get a better finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Lovely color.</li>
            <li>I love these Sally Hansen products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the Sally Hansen kit for about three months and love it.  </li>
            <li>And the more I use it, the better I&#x27;m getting at it.  </li>
            <li>You will be wasting your money and will not be satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love getting Shellac/Gel manicures but paying $20-$40</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more time consuming to remove them</li>
            <li>Is worth the investment if you want your nails to look good for two weeks without the worry of chipping.</li>
            <li>is a tip to safe some money from this product.</li>
            <li>I love gel nails but who has time to go to the salon?</li>
            <li>So I like the fact that I was able to redo that one nail by my self, took me about 5min.</li>
            <li>I so love it</li>
            <li>even my husband said, that I am doing a better job than a salon...</li>
            <li>I love Shellac manicures.</li>
            <li>Will be trying another brand of the gel polish in hopes for better results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mixed, MAINLY GREAT, experience; my toe nails lasted 3 weeks!!!  </li>
            <li>As of 03-2013, Target has this product for $65; a much better deal, in-store or online.</li>
            <li>This was simple to use, long-lasting, beautiful shine and color!  </li>
            <li>and they have more colors options.</li>
            <li>I love the look of no-chip</li>
            <li>I love when my nails are done.  </li>
            <li>This product does an okay job.  </li>
            <li>I love the gel/shellac look.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of being able to do it at home at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the gel nails and saves me from going to the manicurist.  </li>
            <li>I wish it came with separate primer, because that keeps the polish more intact for a longer time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better with time</li>
            <li>( rubbing) your nails will last great!</li>
            <li>I have never ever been able to keep polish on and unchipped for even 24 hours.</li>
            <li>I typically cute my polish for double the time the instructions say, and i have had perfect results every time</li>
            <li>My favorite is the wine color.  </li>
            <li>I read so many reviews on this starter kit and decided to buy it.</li>
            <li>Hopefully more colors will be available soon!</li>
            <li>For the price, I am okay with that.</li>
            <li>Use two coats of the polish and then one coat of the top sealer.  </li>
            <li>I love this n</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li>, I did it twice to make sure.</li>
            <li>I know and love Sally Hansen products</li>
            <li>I have shared my love of this product with everyone.</li>
            <li>Would buy again :]</li>
            <li>bought two more colors yesterday and tried one of them out tonight.</li>
            <li>top coat followed by light;&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Perfect red color for my skin tone, had a nice sheen and looked clean (no bubbles).</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t glob it on, the color is very rich and you apply two layers.</li>
            <li>So when I saw this kit, I was very excited.</li>
            <li>So far so good!&#x27;</li>
            <li>It works great and has helped me to keep my nails at a decent length.  </li>
            <li>I already owned one exactly like this one, loved it and bought this one as a Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li>I absolutey loved this product for the first couple weeks.</li>
            <li>Looks so wonderful and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>and I think it came out pretty good</li>
            <li>Tip for removing, if you use finger condom instead of foil paper, it is much, much easy and better.</li>
            <li>, I like the polish color included better and the LED Light was much better.  </li>
            <li>The polish and the strips are long wearing and look very nice on my nails!  </li>
            <li>Love love love how super shiny my nails are.</li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s my own polish, it&#x27;s super easy to fix a nail when I get home.</li>
            <li>This product has the potential to be very good.  </li>
            <li>I have given myself 4 manicures so far and they have all turned out great.</li>
            <li>best thing about this kit is that it works with my other nail polishes.  </li>
            <li>Finally, an at-home product that is just as good as the salon!  </li>
            <li>easy steps 123</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and dries in 30 seconds as described.</li>
            <li>but I found it easy, once I started peeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Obviously this is great, because the gel colours don&#x27;t come in a lot of options and they cost more than my favourite brands (Essie and OPI).  </li>
            <li>And once it&#x27;s chipped you can&#x27;t easily touch it up.  </li>
            <li>It peels off easily and does not protect my nails.</li>
            <li>so the polish can hold longer, if not peels off too easily</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to figure out</li>
            <li>Keeps nails shiny and strong for weeks.</li>
            <li>All in all, I have to say I&#x27;m amazed and very pleased with the whole</li>
            <li>Follow the directions exactly, and you will get a nice, shiny, long-lasting manicure.</li>
            <li>Just used it for the first time and am thrilled.</li>
            <li>My nails turned out to be shiny, but not as shiny as I hoped they&#x27;d be, but nevertheless, the shine was present and beautiful.</li>
            <li>And you do it yourself and it looks just like a professional job (if you are decent at painting your own nails), and it lasts !!!</li>
            <li>so with this product my nails look flawless for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly fine, and all 10 nails have held up well since.</li>
            <li>The box was a bit damaged, but everything inside seemed to be perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>so 7 days wear is fine by me.  </li>
            <li>I wish they could invent a new product that doesn&#x27;t cause this issue!!!!!</li>
            <li>It makes my nails strong and it looks great while it&#x27;s on, but it does NOT last.</li>
            <li>The polishes are awesome and it even comes with nail polish remover and little strips to take the topping of.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s accurate.  </li>
            <li>The light works great, no need to spend 100 dollars on something that works the same.</li>
            <li>The instructions say put your fingers under the LED light twice for 30 seconds...</li>
            <li>My left hand looked great until today (6 days</li>
            <li>Just tried this out after hearing fantastic things from my friend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Comes with a LED light instead of a UV light.</li>
            <li>UV light causes you skin to tan, age and might result in skin cancer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Polish dries within 3 minutes under the light.</li>
            <li>it seems quite light weight</li>
            <li>Another reviewer recommended putting this into a spray bottle and then wiping your nails with a cloth.this is a great tip which I will do in future.</li>
            <li>Overall the nail polish is shiny and looks great..</li>
            <li>I have shiny, fantastic looking nails for weeks without worry about chips or dullness.  </li>
            <li>but I have to place them under the light about 6 times per layer.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this it was not yet available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It is important that none of the polish gets on ur skin.</li>
            <li>Soaked the gel off (takes the 15 minutes, as advised), and after a nice scrubbing and some lotion, my nails seem to be no worse for the wear.  </li>
            <li>Light stopped working after 4th use.  </li>
            <li>Since this item is not returnable I went to Wal-Mart to see if I could just buy a replacement light.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions on the kit and my manicures turn out fabulous.  </li>
            <li>if I do light work with my hands.</li>
            <li>: the plug on the cord to the light has come apart, exposing the wiring inside, after two uses.  </li>
            <li>I hope they come out with many more colors and make the replacement pads/alcohol reasonable.</li>
            <li>Once I figured out how to work with the product it became super easy.</li>
            <li>I bought one for myself and it is quick and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Fun product, and it saves money from having to go to the spa!</li>
            <li>Works great for an at home kit and such a good price compared to the same product in store.</li>
            <li>and I downgraded to 4 stars from my original 5 star ranking.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited</li>
            <li>For the cost of 1.5 salon gel manicures, it is way worth it!</li>
            <li>It comes exactly as advertised and is super easy for a beginner to use!</li>
            <li>as far as the uv light, your better off using the sun!</li>
            <li>First just let me say that I love this product.</li>
            <li>First of all, I love the color (Wine Not).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this product is worth the money!</li>
            <li>Use the buffer on your nails, clean them, then finish with the alcohol- you can use what you have at home</li>
            <li>This product generates a nice look but does not last more than 1 week on my nails.  </li>
            <li>My first try was with the beautiful blue to go with my uniform.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous for a quick nail treatment.</li>
            <li>Love this kit, do my own nails all the time and this lasts as long or longer then the $30 salon job, easy and quick to do so don&#x27;t be intimidated.</li>
            <li>If your gel polish is falling off, you&#x27;re probably not applying it right!</li>
            <li>She was SO right!</li>
            <li>This is very easy to use and like normal nail polish.</li>
            <li>Some of that could be my own error since I&#x27;m not a pro, but the cost savings pretty much out weighs the fact that the manicure doesn&#x27;t hold up as long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time that I used the gel nails they looked great but started peeling off the second day.  </li>
            <li>But so far looks amazing .</li>
            <li>Then approach the application full of knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so there definitely wasnt any good reason why this was happening..</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t plan to because I&#x27;m not concerned with getting a full two weeks of wear and i would just rather not.</li>
            <li>This is a true nude, even after 3 coats I could still see my nail underneath.</li>
            <li>I am ready to buy more colors.</li>
            <li>I love to have my nails done but don&#x27;t go very often because of the expense.  </li>
            <li>and I decided to try again, thinking that I only needed my nails to look good for one night.  </li>
            <li>After nearly 2 weeks my nails are still nice.</li>
            <li>Otherwise the polish lasts almost 2 full weeks or longer</li>
            <li>No wonder it was such a good price.</li>
            <li>But for the price not bad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad color but not as pictured.</li>
            <li>It takes me 30 minutes to do a complete manicure but the best part is my nails are completely dry as soon as I am done!  </li>
            <li>The alcohol pads were used up quickly on the first application, but they are easily replaced.</li>
            <li>super easy this was my first try</li>
            <li>other that that great product</li>
            <li>I wish they&#x27;d come up with an easier way to get it off, but other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
            <li>But I use it with other nail colours and the results are always great.</li>
            <li>Was lucky if the nails lasted three days.  </li>
            <li>Follow directions and you will have salon worthy gel manicure.</li>
            <li>I love the results, especially since these kits sell for more than this at drugstores.</li>
            <li>It actually stays perfect for ten days with no chipping, etc.  </li>
            <li>Push your cuticles back, lightly file the surfaces(I use one of those fine grit blocks from Salles and just run it over the top once or twice.</li>
            <li>My bare nails break very easily, but with the gel on, I&#x27;ve been able to grow them much longer.  </li>
            <li>Very worth paying a few $$ more!!</li>
            <li>you follow the instructions carefully and do exactly as it specifies, your nails will come out great.</li>
            <li>It comes with everything that you need, and even had coupons (not sure if they were expired or not since it was a gift, lol) and the polish at Wal-Mart is available for about 10 dollars or so.</li>
            <li>Peels off easily when you are ready to take it off.</li>
            <li>If they look this good my first time using it, I can only assume I&#x27;ll get better/faster at it.</li>
            <li>Very classy and elegant.</li>
            <li>said, be aware that doing a gel manicure yourself is time consuming!  </li>
            <li>so I quickly did the right</li>
            <li>Now I just need to get a few more colors! :)</li>
            <li>I will recommend to spend a little more for a better light</li>
            <li>The Sally Hansen Salon Pro Gel Kit is amazing and so simple.  </li>
            <li>Very shiny and smooth; I get lots of compliments on them.</li>
            <li>You will absolutely enjoy this product so much.</li>
            <li>What I really like is the polish doesnt set without the light,</li>
            <li>It is so nice to finally have nails again.  </li>
            <li>I am honestly going to say it was me for the following reasons: I had no idea</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice because I can find a variety of colors to purchase at my local Meijer!</li>
            <li>I now use clear nail polish that has an hardening and it is much better on my nails</li>
            <li>We are women and we&#x27;re worth it!&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>so I could have the convenience of fresh looking polish without doing them twice a week.</li>
            <li>I have saved a bundle doing my own nails and it does last!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely keep experimenting with it, but I have to be honest.  </li>
            <li>The removal process is kind of a pain (only because it takes about 15 minutes of soaking the nail in the acetone remover)</li>
            <li>, so this is definitely worth it to me.</li>
            <li>ONLY downfall is that the colors on their own are too pricey.  </li>
            <li>When I saw this, I thought it was worth a try, even if it saved me two trips to the salon it would have paid for itself.</li>
            <li>The removal process can be a bit of a pain but still worth it.</li>
            <li>BUT the damage I did to my nails trying to scrape it off wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>You will be pleased with the professional looking job when you&#x27;re done.  </li>
            <li>In order for the manicure to last, you have to make sure you paint the free edge of the nail but not the skin underneath.  </li>
            <li>For $30.00 this is a very nice little kit.</li>
            <li>This system (I&#x27;m sure it has more to do with the paint not being salon quality or the prep prior to paint) doesn&#x27;t peel my nail bed layers to the same extent, which to me seems like a more sustainable way to have pretty nails.</li>
            <li>I also followed a trick my manicurist uses to do a quick pass over the tips to seal them - this really helps to avoid any chips!</li>
            <li>, though, she seems quite satisfied with it and gets numerous compliments on it daily on how beautiful and professionally done it looks.</li>
            <li>I wish there were more color choices in the starter kits; you get either really dark or really light (too light) colors to chose from.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even have to push it off, it just came right off when I applied a bit of pressure while pulling the foil off.</li>
            <li>Just my right thumb polish chipped on the edges.</li>
            <li>The UV light is not as strong as a professional one, naturally, but it was easy to compensate by setting the color with two or three times under the light - and the result is the same as from the salon!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands, and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I rarely make it more than 24 hours with regular nail polish.</li>
            <li>Cheap price, but the only functional item in the set is the light.</li>
            <li>I had put too much polish on them, and it did not stick well (obviously) plus the polish kind of looked \\&quot;bubbled\\&quot; under the polish.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this home kit until one of my friends did my nails with it and the polish was beautiful was almost 3 full weeks!</li>
            <li>So I removed the gel on these nails following the instructions (super easy) and reapplied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as hard to the touch as the UV cured gel but still a great product.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m extremely pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I love the constant shine!</li>
            <li>a word of caution: Follow the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li>This was my first try with the gel nail polishes.</li>
            <li>I never seen my nails look so pretty.</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying more upfront as the kit only includes 10.</li>
            <li>Will def purchase it again, and will purchase more colors from this same brand name</li>
            <li>Nail polish never last on my nails for more than a couple of hours</li>
            <li>This was my first ever experience with a soak off gel manicure</li>
            <li>Now there are a couple of caveats because this was my first time ever doing a gel a manicure</li>
            <li>Also the color looks nothing like the box, much more like the color on the actual cap.</li>
            <li>I actually feel that the results from this polish are better than some of my salon gel manicures - the coat looks like glass and no chips 4 days in.</li>
            <li>product is shiny, but not a shiny as OPI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use regular nail polish between the top and bottom coats.</li>
            <li>recommend watching the SH instructional you tube video before your first application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel that for the price, consideration should have been given to better design of the box so that it could have been used for regular storage of the kit.</li>
            <li>But in the future when I get more colors I have to be aware it may not always match.</li>
            <li>Scuffing up your polish with a nail file first helps, but it still takes 15 minutes or so to dissolve.  </li>
            <li>The gels definitely looked better for longer, though I started to peel off the colour after about 5 days.  </li>
            <li>I definitely like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>(i had to put on a different top coat to stop this).</li>
            <li>This color lasted exactly 2 weeks then when it began chipping</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>first time I did my nails I used the color that came with the box and</li>
            <li>and I removed the first application...</li>
            <li>I also found more colors to try locally</li>
            <li>but overall I really love my nail gel polish...</li>
            <li>so I get a chance to try out some of the different colors I bought :)</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>My first gel mani set.</li>
            <li>It looks and feels exactly like a salon gel manicure.  </li>
            <li>I am an avid shellac/gel polish user.</li>
            <li>The gel/shellac mani&#x27;s are far better than a normal mani b/c in 1 day</li>
            <li>For all my frugal fashionistas I highly recommend this product but YOU MUST FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!!</li>
            <li>The first one lasted through 4 bathroom cleanings, 8 bags of pulled ivy, mowed and trimmed the yard, 5 tax returns,</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first.  </li>
            <li>This is the same kit sold in stores at a much better price.  </li>
            <li>Way better than regular polish and cheaper than a salon.  </li>
            <li>Can use the same top sealer with all the colors so only need to purchase one bottle of sealer and then a couple of your favorite colors.  </li>
            <li>5 minutes after finishing my manicure I was in the basement rearranging furniture- not so much as a smudge!  </li>
            <li>your time evening it out, even on the second coat and top coat.</li>
            <li>First time, start to finish in under one hour.  </li>
            <li>I plug this up to use for the first time and the lamp did not work.</li>
            <li>Just used my kit for the first time.  </li>
            <li>first</li>
            <li>The Wine Not color is more of a fire engine red than a wine.  </li>
            <li>I ran out of the cleanser pads and removal a long time ago but found suitable</li>
            <li>only lasts a week when I&#x27;m told I should be able to get 2 weeks wear our of it.  </li>
            <li>I am new to doing my own gel manicures and was reluctant to try, but based on several reviews chose this kit to get started.</li>
            <li>The process of putting it on is easy, and the removal (which is what I was really worried about) has so far been a breeze.</li>
            <li>At that point the polish becomes very easy to pull off because it&#x27;s a little more rubbery than the professional stuff.</li>
            <li>Such a great starter for my entrance to the gel manicure, as a warning I found I needed two of the alcohol swabs to make it through a single application.</li>
            <li>The light cures beautifully however the quality of the base and top coat does not give you the salon finish that gelish provides.</li>
            <li>The instructions tell you flat out that it will lift or cause problems if it cures while touching your nail or cuticle.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t bother me too much because the color it actually is, I like better than the picture.</li>
            <li>My only problem is that I can&#x27;t keep the polish on for more than a week because I want to change it so fast.</li>
            <li>if you want, use SPF lotion or fingertip-less gloves) and issues of fungus under the nails since they are on so long (something I still think is a huge bonus!).  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve have it on for 3 full days and nothing has peeled off.</li>
            <li>Both brands have rather full bristles on the end of the brush, which naturally holds lots of polish.  </li>
            <li>Just as expected, easy system, mirror shine, a MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li>I usually only get 2 days of a chip free  regular manicure when i use quality polish and as much as i would love to</li>
            <li>: My nails last for about two weeks, not totally chip free but good enough</li>
            <li>Which is normal for all gel polish when you&#x27;re right</li>
            <li>It was a good gift and works great,I only wish that the cord was a little longer other than that it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>sally hansen does not have a large range of colors</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m impressed because it took less time than regular polish since it was perfectly dry after I removed it from the LED light.</li>
            <li>So far it odd good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being a teacher she has little time to do her own nails and when she does puts them through a lot of abuse.</li>
            <li>With this system I will get at least a week chip free on most nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple process to do, just paint your nails and then use the UV light.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a video on the Sally Hansen website that&#x27;s really helpful.</li>
            <li>here&#x27;s to hoping that it&#x27;s not secret UV</li>
            <li>So I decided to try Sally Hansen as the price is very affordable.</li>
            <li>very thin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very convient.</li>
            <li>I should, also I didn&#x27;t do much filing of my nail</li>
            <li>My salon also offered bio gel which is much thinner and healthier for your nails.</li>
            <li>You can buy this in bottles at a chemist or hardware store and it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li>but i was ready for a color change.</li>
            <li>a manicure it too much to get them as often as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>So, I came to look at the reviews after the fact and got really nervous.</li>
            <li>But then, I read a very helpful review from a gal who has a friend who is a manicurist.</li>
            <li>The color I did not like so much</li>
            <li>I have to say it doesn&#x27;t really lasts 2 weeks</li>
            <li>You have to spend twenty minutes taking it off just to go through the whole process to redo.  </li>
            <li>However, it takes about an hour to get them done which in my opinion is very time</li>
            <li>and she said she only has to do the light once</li>
            <li>I saw this in the store and it was priced so reasonably that I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>they protect the nail from breakage so they grow nice and long, they are healthy and the best part, I rarely need a manicure until they grow out long enough to look bad where they meet the skin.</li>
            <li>So Much Fawn\\&quot; separately</li>
            <li>go straight to that and skip the Sally Hansen</li>
            <li>Wonderful!to be no worse for the wear.  </li>
            <li>Really looks like a salon manicure .</li>
            <li>so for around fifty bucks I got the whole kit.</li>
            <li>I see a couple teeny bubbles on two nails, nothing real noticeable.  </li>
            <li>A fair amount of people have negative things about this product, but at basically the cost of two pedicures, I thought what could hurt?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so i just buy other brands and use it with their system and it works just fine!</li>
            <li>I found the instructions to be very clear and the different layers of polish went on easily.  </li>
            <li>I intend to always use this kit with my other polishes because I get better results than without</li>
            <li>My nails looked like they normally would after gel polish after two weeks from a salon!</li>
            <li>I love it and have purchased/used other polish colors too.</li>
            <li>I am so excited because this actually works!</li>
            <li>The other notable benefit is the minimized damage to my nail beds.</li>
            <li>Have bought numerous colors since my original purchase.  </li>
            <li>I was originally going to purchase the RED CARPET Brand,</li>
            <li>But, even if it lasts only a week until it chips, it&#x27;s still worth it in my book!</li>
            <li>Sometimes I just do the clear top and bottom coats and then paint on top with regular nail polish and it makes my regular nail polish last for about a week.</li>
            <li>I like the shiny clean look it gives me compared to the traditional nail polish.</li>
            <li>The polish really does last me a full 2 weeks without chipping or scratching.  </li>
            <li>Whenever I get the time to do my nails, they get done by the kit, even with other gel polishes from other brands, the outcome is great.</li>
            <li>My natural nails are badly ridged and this is the first product that I have ever used that makes them smooth and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this kit to anyone who wants the gel nail experience without having to go to the salon.  </li>
            <li>I got a couple of gel manicures in salons for special events and was astonished to discover that they last on me, surviving even my weekly horseback riding.  </li>
            <li>Dries fast with the light, says to dry once</li>
            <li>I was so surprised that it came off so easily with regular nail polish remover</li>
            <li>So far the lamp is doing ok, but the polish, even when cured for several sets of 30 seconds is soft and pliable.</li>
            <li>I really DID get 2 weeks of wear from just the normal application of this product.</li>
            <li>By far much longer than many other polishes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Tries this and found it easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>You absolutely must use an alcohol pad to clean off the nail after you&#x27;re done, otherwise it won&#x27;t feel dry.</li>
            <li>I got my kit in red for the holidays and followed the process curing 2x for each coat to be double sure.</li>
            <li>I like Sally Hansen products, and this Starter Kit had decent reviews.  </li>
            <li>The lamp is great, and so are the base and top coats.</li>
            <li>Also, I leave my nails under the light for 2 30second  times (the light goes off after 30 seconds and the instructions say another round is not necessary), just because they still seem tacky after only 1 time under the light</li>
            <li>And most of those days I was doing heavy garden work so they really got a test.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am very please with this product and found it to be well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Fast, and not messy at all!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and one</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised!!</li>
            <li>followed the instructions to the letter, except for adding some little nail art flowers before adding the top coat.</li>
            <li>Instead of buying the Nail Cleanser Pad refills (cost around $5.00 for 20pads) buy a bottle of the highest concentrate Isopropyl alcohol at your local pharmacy or retailers for about $1.70 a bottle and use it with a clean soft cotton cloth.</li>
            <li>My guess is that the lamp isn&#x27;t strong enough and the product does not dry.</li>
            <li>LED light looks a little like UV light, but it&#x27;s not declared as such, so</li>
            <li>As a side, I love the wine Not colour - super bold and dark red, not too pink or trashy looking.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, to say the least.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical, but it works great.  </li>
            <li>I also do two round of lights between each color and the top coat.  </li>
            <li>but just be aware, apparently chlorine and gel nails do not mix.</li>
            <li>I have 3 kids, lots of dishes, and a pool and my nails with normal polish</li>
            <li>Overall is worth the money if I have to compare it to going to the salon.</li>
            <li>Normal polishes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m from the generation of \\&quot;regular\\&quot; polish where, no matter how careful you were, the polish chipped and shrunk back from the free edge almost immediately, not to mention took forever to dry if you applied more than one coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 14 days, I finally took it off (easy peasy) because the grown out portion was starting to look tacky.  </li>
            <li>and it amounts to concerns that were quickly rebuffed about the UV rays from the curing process (far too brief to cause any harm, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even more convenient than regular polish due to the fast setting time.</li>
            <li>Low and behold the right hand began chipping after 2 days.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and order the Graham HandsDown Nail Wraps for super simple, mess free removal.  </li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and order the Graham HandsDown Nail Wraps for super simple, mess free removal.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to grow nice long nails until I started getting gel manicures and became addicted!</li>
            <li>As I said, I enjoy using it with other nail polishes</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tonight I tried a new color I bought from sally Hansen called \\&quot;Shell We Dance\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>Looking forward to trying new colors.  </li>
            <li>going to buy new ones of those and see what  happens.</li>
            <li>so I ordered two new colors of gel</li>
            <li>I have definitely gotten my money worth from it so far.</li>
            <li>The shop where I purchased it had three kits available and this kit, although the most expensive worked out the cheapest.  </li>
            <li>I love gorgeous gel nails, but hate going to the nail salon to get them done.</li>
            <li>For the price of just the UV light, I got the light, top and base coat, color, orange stick, nail file, cleaning pads and acetone.  </li>
            <li>Polish lasted nearly 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>My husband gave me the kit as a present when it first came out.</li>
            <li>This polish can, in fact last two weeks-but you have to follow the instructions EXACTLY.</li>
            <li>I did my first application and like another reviewer, a few of the nails peeled off in the first 24hrs, so you just have to get used to how much to apply.</li>
            <li>an additional 30 secs after applying the first and second color coat.</li>
            <li>Super convenient for a mom of two young kids who doesn&#x27;t have the luxury of just sitting around waiting for her nails to dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend highly to anyone who is capable of reading instructions and following them to the letter.  </li>
            <li>the product was exactly what I wanted and within deadline  was expected i like so much  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so simple to use and the polish lasts so much longer than normal nail polish.</li>
            <li>A very pretty pink, I must say,</li>
            <li>The color, Wine Not, was as expected and very pretty.</li>
            <li>I actually put each hand under the UV light to dry for five minutes</li>
            <li>8 days chip/peel free, which is UNHEARD of for my nails because I&#x27;m super rough on them (usually regular nail polish + top coat lasts less than a few hours before chipping).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t let it plugged in since it&#x27;s a week or two until it&#x27;s needed again and a little light glows inside.  </li>
            <li>I hardly ever paint my nails, because it lasts about 12 hours before it starts chipping, no mater how many coats I use.</li>
            <li>You need to use the top coat for it to get hard.</li>
            <li>I put on the last coat a little, tiny bit thicker than the rest and kind of scrape the end of each nail with the brush to seal the edges.</li>
            <li>I completed this in approx 35 minutes max because I had to prep my nails, cut them, remove old color and fix my cuticles.</li>
            <li>I bought this product at Christmas and gave it to my daughter who is a professional nail salon artist and she used it on me.  </li>
            <li>They were glued directly to the nail with nail glue, and cured with 2 coats of #3.</li>
            <li>They remained sticky and soft for over an hour.</li>
            <li>The polish on one of the nails that I hadn&#x27;t fixed began to lift.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t cure it under the lamp, so you just need to wait until it dries completely before applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Also, in the nail salon I see them putting the alcohol in a spray bottle and spray them on the customers&#x27; finger and wipe them with soft cotton cloth.</li>
            <li>Even after I&#x27;m completely done it feels gooey</li>
            <li>Then unfortunately developed a allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li>I have gone as far as 5 cycles on each &amp;#34;barely there&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>A metallic, pinky red that is very flattering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also a frequent hand washer.  </li>
            <li>Just remember, if you&#x27;re using regular nail polish between the gel layers, do NOT put on the gel top coat until the nail polish has fully dried.</li>
            <li>They tend to put the gel polish on too thick and when it cures with the LED light, it feels like it&#x27;s burning my fingers!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap, and not really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I had small chips on 2 nail (more peeling than chipping actually).</li>
            <li>I only recommend it if you have realistic expectations and don&#x27;t mind spending the money to give it a try</li>
            <li>/&gt;Granted I only used last night for the first time</li>
            <li>Is the 10th day that I use this product on my finger and there is a big chip on my right thumb and a small chip on my right index finger.</li>
            <li>I am a black female and need medium toned colors (not too light and not too</li>
            <li>I like that everything is included in the kit, even the cord for the light which I was not able to tell from looking at the box online.  </li>
            <li>I picked them off, sanded the nails lightly with the little emery board, added another coat of red polish, and the topcoat again and voila...</li>
            <li>my kit claimed to have been NEW, but when i opened it the step 1 and 3 had red on the brush.</li>
            <li>and it makes the mani dry much faster&lt;</li>
            <li>It looks less shiny after I finished my last step which is to clean it with the nail cleanser pad.  </li>
            <li>Nails were dry and ready to go in five minutes</li>
            <li>My nails looked better than when I took it to the salon which is sad to say since I didn&#x27;t devote much time to them</li>
            <li>I got two top coats instead one one base coat and a top coat.</li>
            <li>Kit came with very clear and specific directions.  </li>
            <li>Its a plug in light (compared to the battery powered in the Red Carpet kit) and it cures in half the time!  </li>
            <li>I am active and I use my hands a lot, but I still wanted pretty nails without having to go to the salon.</li>
            <li>I generally do two times in the LED per coat.  </li>
            <li>This will replace the Nail Cleanser Pad and save you at least $20.00 or more in the long run.</li>
            <li>I usually keep each coat under the light an extra time or two.</li>
            <li>But when I occasionally screw it up and a nail peels early, I just redo that one nail.  </li>
            <li>The color &amp;#34;Wine Not&amp;#34; is much redder than I had expected, but I like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because professional salon gel does peel too and if you go back and ask them to fix it for you.....</li>
            <li>My order came much faster than I expected, too.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you have short nails, do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>Apparently I have oily nail plates</li>
            <li>This is normal and the same thing happened occasionally when I used to go the salon.</li>
            <li>I took it off today and am going with a pretty pink for next week.  </li>
            <li>I usually cure each hand for 2 minutes (4 x 30 seconds) and find that my polish lasts the full two weeks tho way.</li>
            <li>But the kit nail polish is not dry even after 20 cycles!</li>
            <li>The LED lamp is small so only 4 fingers fit, but doing the thumbs at the same time is no problem.</li>
            <li>If they last 1 week without chipping badly, I will be happy.</li>
            <li>and it still did not dry.  </li>
            <li>You have to push the button twice to make sure each layer of polish is &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; enough and the polish is poor quality.</li>
            <li>This was my first time doing a gel manicure, so I was a little nervous</li>
            <li>kit only comes with 10 alcohol wipes, I ended up using half for my first application because I had to fix a number of nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of this system and gel nails in general.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve left polish on for 3 weeks at a time with barely any chips.</li>
            <li>first color, the Wine Not included in this kit, didn&#x27;t last as long as I had expected it to.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions closely the first time because it can get messy.</li>
            <li>after a few days or soaking in the hot tub you guessed it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still using the original base and top coats.</li>
            <li>I have tried the first time, and half of the nail polish did not cure!</li>
            <li>I think most of the effect is due to the base and top coats and not the colour.  </li>
            <li>but if you follow the directions not too difficult and a small irritation for the quality and quantity of time you have great looking nails.</li>
            <li>My fingernail beds started turning black and my cuticles became very itcy and inflamed.</li>
            <li>It is decent priced, and comes with everything you need!!&lt;br /&gt;wouldn&#x27;t want to use a single nail led, takes way to long.</li>
            <li>I have had a (small) chip after 5-6 days (which is much better than regular polish) and could be partially my fault due to not covering the whole nail (missing the edge/tip).  </li>
            <li>Very pricey, but when you look down at you nails, it&#x27;s all smiles!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve done 2 manicures and both have held up fairly well.  </li>
            <li> good starter kit.  </li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s part of the process of looking good..</li>
            <li> Also, SH products are generally good, so I preferred to go with the brand</li>
            <li> She loved it too.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look as good as to the nail salon I been going to.  </li>
            <li> Nails come out looking gorgeous</li>
            <li> Hoping that the lights stay good for a while</li>
            <li> Merchant made good on my purchase thank you</li>
            <li> It looks as good as a salon no-chip manicure.</li>
            <li> Price was good, I might try another brand.</li>
            <li> Good starter kit</li>
            <li> otherwise it&#x27;s still a good starter kit that comes with what you need.</li>
            <li> but I gave it to my mother and she loved it.</li>
            <li> I used three times with good results.  </li>
            <li> But, I love the convenience and how beautiful the nails are when they are done...</li>
            <li> SUPER!!!</li>
            <li> Still, 5 days with colour that looks perfect is rare for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still happy. :)</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own nails for some tome using good quality polishes.</li>
            <li> My nails turned out beautifully, have lasted for 10 days, and still going strong.  </li>
            <li> It works - notning more to say!</li>
            <li> Im in love with this product!</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Amazing colors will occur.  </li>
            <li> It works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> This kit is amazing ...</li>
            <li> The light work great for two applications after that</li>
            <li> It looked amazing, I couldn&#x27;t believe the shine, almost looks like plastic nails.</li>
            <li> My nails did not come out nice at all.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product and thought it was a great value....</li>
            <li> this setup is WELL worth it!!!  </li>
            <li> I found OPI and Mode (a super cheap polish) to be the best wearing.</li>
            <li> If you have a steady hand and are good at painting your nails yourself, it goes on beautifully.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Rite Aid, and am happy to see it available on Amazon too :).</li>
            <li> This stuff looks as good as the salon stuff and works as easily as it claims.</li>
            <li> Very easy.  </li>
            <li> it was very easy to do.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> If they do bubble and peel like mine did, it is very easy to redo.</li>
            <li> But so far everything is great!</li>
            <li> I love doing my own nails.  </li>
            <li> I say, just make sure you have nice hygiene</li>
            <li> The polish peels off the nails really easy!  </li>
            <li> But I followed the easy directions, and had no problem!</li>
            <li> But if you can apply nail polish cleanly and evenly, this is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> if you aren&#x27;t good at applying nail polish in a clean fashion, this won&#x27;t help you, try the strips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both the gel polish that comes with the kit and my own regular nail polish, and both work great!</li>
            <li> exactly what was advertised of shown on the website, packaging was good, very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> in all for a first timer it was a great result.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was great, however, I don&#x27;t even use it anymore</li>
            <li> It works just fine for that!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and looks nice, no peeling, and is shiny.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve found that curing the product for longer than the directions say helps to get a better cure.  </li>
            <li> I went to the salon once and got the shellac and fell in love.  </li>
            <li> It worked and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise it may have taken me more like 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll try this again when I have more time</li>
            <li> and I am not as skilled as the manicurist at the salon.</li>
            <li> and I love the color.  </li>
            <li> I love having this product to do at home when it works around my schedule.  </li>
            <li> I totally LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I teach ofr a lving and one of my students nails were looking so cute</li>
            <li> When applying the top gel, the color of the nail polish comes off a bit.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> The top gel is sticky even after curing.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I wish there was more variety in colors.</li>
            <li> i have been buying more colors since i got this.</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of it, I came to love this gel mani kit.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a more purple tone, but</li>
            <li> Also I did do nail stamping after doing the top coat</li>
            <li> I then put the top coat over and cured.</li>
            <li> One stone popped off because the top coat peeled off the end and the stone came with it.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> purchases, using OPI top coat I could get a week, sometimes</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d decided to invest in a gel kit as they prices have dropped dramatically with more and more kits entering the market.</li>
            <li> , you get a better finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Lovely color.</li>
            <li> I love these Sally Hansen products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Sally Hansen kit for about three months and love it.  </li>
            <li> And the more I use it, the better I&#x27;m getting at it.  </li>
            <li> You will be wasting your money and will not be satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love getting Shellac/Gel manicures but paying $20-$40</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more time consuming to remove them</li>
            <li> Is worth the investment if you want your nails to look good for two weeks without the worry of chipping.</li>
            <li> is a tip to safe some money from this product.</li>
            <li> I love gel nails but who has time to go to the salon?</li>
            <li> So I like the fact that I was able to redo that one nail by my self, took me about 5min.</li>
            <li> I so love it</li>
            <li> even my husband said, that I am doing a better job than a salon...</li>
            <li> I love Shellac manicures.</li>
            <li> Will be trying another brand of the gel polish in hopes for better results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mixed, MAINLY GREAT, experience; my toe nails lasted 3 weeks!!!  </li>
            <li> As of 03-2013, Target has this product for $65; a much better deal, in-store or online.</li>
            <li> This was simple to use, long-lasting, beautiful shine and color!  </li>
            <li> and they have more colors options.</li>
            <li> I love the look of no-chip</li>
            <li> I love when my nails are done.  </li>
            <li> This product does an okay job.  </li>
            <li> I love the gel/shellac look.  </li>
            <li> I love the idea of being able to do it at home at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the gel nails and saves me from going to the manicurist.  </li>
            <li> I wish it came with separate primer, because that keeps the polish more intact for a longer time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better with time</li>
            <li> ( rubbing) your nails will last great!</li>
            <li> I have never ever been able to keep polish on and unchipped for even 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I typically cute my polish for double the time the instructions say, and i have had perfect results every time</li>
            <li> My favorite is the wine color.  </li>
            <li> I read so many reviews on this starter kit and decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> Hopefully more colors will be available soon!</li>
            <li> For the price, I am okay with that.</li>
            <li> Use two coats of the polish and then one coat of the top sealer.  </li>
            <li> I love this n</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li> , I did it twice to make sure.</li>
            <li> I know and love Sally Hansen products</li>
            <li> I have shared my love of this product with everyone.</li>
            <li> Would buy again :]</li>
            <li> bought two more colors yesterday and tried one of them out tonight.</li>
            <li> top coat followed by light;&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Perfect red color for my skin tone, had a nice sheen and looked clean (no bubbles).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t glob it on, the color is very rich and you apply two layers.</li>
            <li> So when I saw this kit, I was very excited.</li>
            <li> So far so good!&#x27;</li>
            <li> It works great and has helped me to keep my nails at a decent length.  </li>
            <li> I already owned one exactly like this one, loved it and bought this one as a Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li> I absolutey loved this product for the first couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Looks so wonderful and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> and I think it came out pretty good</li>
            <li> Tip for removing, if you use finger condom instead of foil paper, it is much, much easy and better.</li>
            <li> , I like the polish color included better and the LED Light was much better.  </li>
            <li> The polish and the strips are long wearing and look very nice on my nails!  </li>
            <li> Love love love how super shiny my nails are.</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s my own polish, it&#x27;s super easy to fix a nail when I get home.</li>
            <li> This product has the potential to be very good.  </li>
            <li> I have given myself 4 manicures so far and they have all turned out great.</li>
            <li> best thing about this kit is that it works with my other nail polishes.  </li>
            <li> Finally, an at-home product that is just as good as the salon!  </li>
            <li> easy steps 123</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and dries in 30 seconds as described.</li>
            <li> but I found it easy, once I started peeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Obviously this is great, because the gel colours don&#x27;t come in a lot of options and they cost more than my favourite brands (Essie and OPI).  </li>
            <li> And once it&#x27;s chipped you can&#x27;t easily touch it up.  </li>
            <li> It peels off easily and does not protect my nails.</li>
            <li> so the polish can hold longer, if not peels off too easily</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to figure out</li>
            <li> Keeps nails shiny and strong for weeks.</li>
            <li> All in all, I have to say I&#x27;m amazed and very pleased with the whole</li>
            <li> Follow the directions exactly, and you will get a nice, shiny, long-lasting manicure.</li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time and am thrilled.</li>
            <li> My nails turned out to be shiny, but not as shiny as I hoped they&#x27;d be, but nevertheless, the shine was present and beautiful.</li>
            <li> And you do it yourself and it looks just like a professional job (if you are decent at painting your own nails), and it lasts !!!</li>
            <li> so with this product my nails look flawless for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly fine, and all 10 nails have held up well since.</li>
            <li> The box was a bit damaged, but everything inside seemed to be perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> so 7 days wear is fine by me.  </li>
            <li> I wish they could invent a new product that doesn&#x27;t cause this issue!!!!!</li>
            <li> It makes my nails strong and it looks great while it&#x27;s on, but it does NOT last.</li>
            <li> The polishes are awesome and it even comes with nail polish remover and little strips to take the topping of.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s accurate.  </li>
            <li> The light works great, no need to spend 100 dollars on something that works the same.</li>
            <li> The instructions say put your fingers under the LED light twice for 30 seconds...</li>
            <li> My left hand looked great until today (6 days</li>
            <li> Just tried this out after hearing fantastic things from my friend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Comes with a LED light instead of a UV light.</li>
            <li> UV light causes you skin to tan, age and might result in skin cancer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Polish dries within 3 minutes under the light.</li>
            <li> it seems quite light weight</li>
            <li> Another reviewer recommended putting this into a spray bottle and then wiping your nails with a cloth.this is a great tip which I will do in future.</li>
            <li> Overall the nail polish is shiny and looks great..</li>
            <li> I have shiny, fantastic looking nails for weeks without worry about chips or dullness.  </li>
            <li> but I have to place them under the light about 6 times per layer.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this it was not yet available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It is important that none of the polish gets on ur skin.</li>
            <li> Soaked the gel off (takes the 15 minutes, as advised), and after a nice scrubbing and some lotion, my nails seem to be no worse for the wear.  </li>
            <li> Light stopped working after 4th use.  </li>
            <li> Since this item is not returnable I went to Wal-Mart to see if I could just buy a replacement light.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions on the kit and my manicures turn out fabulous.  </li>
            <li> if I do light work with my hands.</li>
            <li> : the plug on the cord to the light has come apart, exposing the wiring inside, after two uses.  </li>
            <li> I hope they come out with many more colors and make the replacement pads/alcohol reasonable.</li>
            <li> Once I figured out how to work with the product it became super easy.</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself and it is quick and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Fun product, and it saves money from having to go to the spa!</li>
            <li> Works great for an at home kit and such a good price compared to the same product in store.</li>
            <li> and I downgraded to 4 stars from my original 5 star ranking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited</li>
            <li> For the cost of 1.5 salon gel manicures, it is way worth it!</li>
            <li> It comes exactly as advertised and is super easy for a beginner to use!</li>
            <li> as far as the uv light, your better off using the sun!</li>
            <li> First just let me say that I love this product.</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the color (Wine Not).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this product is worth the money!</li>
            <li> Use the buffer on your nails, clean them, then finish with the alcohol- you can use what you have at home</li>
            <li> This product generates a nice look but does not last more than 1 week on my nails.  </li>
            <li> My first try was with the beautiful blue to go with my uniform.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabulous for a quick nail treatment.</li>
            <li> Love this kit, do my own nails all the time and this lasts as long or longer then the $30 salon job, easy and quick to do so don&#x27;t be intimidated.</li>
            <li> If your gel polish is falling off, you&#x27;re probably not applying it right!</li>
            <li> She was SO right!</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use and like normal nail polish.</li>
            <li> Some of that could be my own error since I&#x27;m not a pro, but the cost savings pretty much out weighs the fact that the manicure doesn&#x27;t hold up as long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time that I used the gel nails they looked great but started peeling off the second day.  </li>
            <li> But so far looks amazing .</li>
            <li> Then approach the application full of knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so there definitely wasnt any good reason why this was happening..</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t plan to because I&#x27;m not concerned with getting a full two weeks of wear and i would just rather not.</li>
            <li> This is a true nude, even after 3 coats I could still see my nail underneath.</li>
            <li> I am ready to buy more colors.</li>
            <li> I love to have my nails done but don&#x27;t go very often because of the expense.  </li>
            <li> and I decided to try again, thinking that I only needed my nails to look good for one night.  </li>
            <li> After nearly 2 weeks my nails are still nice.</li>
            <li> Otherwise the polish lasts almost 2 full weeks or longer</li>
            <li> No wonder it was such a good price.</li>
            <li> But for the price not bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad color but not as pictured.</li>
            <li> It takes me 30 minutes to do a complete manicure but the best part is my nails are completely dry as soon as I am done!  </li>
            <li> The alcohol pads were used up quickly on the first application, but they are easily replaced.</li>
            <li> super easy this was my first try</li>
            <li> other that that great product</li>
            <li> I wish they&#x27;d come up with an easier way to get it off, but other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
            <li> But I use it with other nail colours and the results are always great.</li>
            <li> Was lucky if the nails lasted three days.  </li>
            <li> Follow directions and you will have salon worthy gel manicure.</li>
            <li> I love the results, especially since these kits sell for more than this at drugstores.</li>
            <li> It actually stays perfect for ten days with no chipping, etc.  </li>
            <li> Push your cuticles back, lightly file the surfaces(I use one of those fine grit blocks from Salles and just run it over the top once or twice.</li>
            <li> My bare nails break very easily, but with the gel on, I&#x27;ve been able to grow them much longer.  </li>
            <li> Very worth paying a few $$ more!!</li>
            <li> you follow the instructions carefully and do exactly as it specifies, your nails will come out great.</li>
            <li> It comes with everything that you need, and even had coupons (not sure if they were expired or not since it was a gift, lol) and the polish at Wal-Mart is available for about 10 dollars or so.</li>
            <li> Peels off easily when you are ready to take it off.</li>
            <li> If they look this good my first time using it, I can only assume I&#x27;ll get better/faster at it.</li>
            <li> Very classy and elegant.</li>
            <li> said, be aware that doing a gel manicure yourself is time consuming!  </li>
            <li> so I quickly did the right</li>
            <li> Now I just need to get a few more colors! :)</li>
            <li> I will recommend to spend a little more for a better light</li>
            <li> The Sally Hansen Salon Pro Gel Kit is amazing and so simple.  </li>
            <li> Very shiny and smooth; I get lots of compliments on them.</li>
            <li> You will absolutely enjoy this product so much.</li>
            <li> What I really like is the polish doesnt set without the light,</li>
            <li> It is so nice to finally have nails again.  </li>
            <li> I am honestly going to say it was me for the following reasons: I had no idea</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice because I can find a variety of colors to purchase at my local Meijer!</li>
            <li> I now use clear nail polish that has an hardening and it is much better on my nails</li>
            <li> We are women and we&#x27;re worth it!&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> so I could have the convenience of fresh looking polish without doing them twice a week.</li>
            <li> I have saved a bundle doing my own nails and it does last!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely keep experimenting with it, but I have to be honest.  </li>
            <li> The removal process is kind of a pain (only because it takes about 15 minutes of soaking the nail in the acetone remover)</li>
            <li> , so this is definitely worth it to me.</li>
            <li> ONLY downfall is that the colors on their own are too pricey.  </li>
            <li> When I saw this, I thought it was worth a try, even if it saved me two trips to the salon it would have paid for itself.</li>
            <li> The removal process can be a bit of a pain but still worth it.</li>
            <li> BUT the damage I did to my nails trying to scrape it off wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> You will be pleased with the professional looking job when you&#x27;re done.  </li>
            <li> In order for the manicure to last, you have to make sure you paint the free edge of the nail but not the skin underneath.  </li>
            <li> For $30.00 this is a very nice little kit.</li>
            <li> This system (I&#x27;m sure it has more to do with the paint not being salon quality or the prep prior to paint) doesn&#x27;t peel my nail bed layers to the same extent, which to me seems like a more sustainable way to have pretty nails.</li>
            <li> I also followed a trick my manicurist uses to do a quick pass over the tips to seal them - this really helps to avoid any chips!</li>
            <li> , though, she seems quite satisfied with it and gets numerous compliments on it daily on how beautiful and professionally done it looks.</li>
            <li> I wish there were more color choices in the starter kits; you get either really dark or really light (too light) colors to chose from.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have to push it off, it just came right off when I applied a bit of pressure while pulling the foil off.</li>
            <li> Just my right thumb polish chipped on the edges.</li>
            <li> The UV light is not as strong as a professional one, naturally, but it was easy to compensate by setting the color with two or three times under the light - and the result is the same as from the salon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands, and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I rarely make it more than 24 hours with regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> Cheap price, but the only functional item in the set is the light.</li>
            <li> I had put too much polish on them, and it did not stick well (obviously) plus the polish kind of looked \\&quot;bubbled\\&quot; under the polish.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this home kit until one of my friends did my nails with it and the polish was beautiful was almost 3 full weeks!</li>
            <li> So I removed the gel on these nails following the instructions (super easy) and reapplied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as hard to the touch as the UV cured gel but still a great product.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m extremely pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I love the constant shine!</li>
            <li> a word of caution: Follow the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li> This was my first try with the gel nail polishes.</li>
            <li> I never seen my nails look so pretty.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying more upfront as the kit only includes 10.</li>
            <li> Will def purchase it again, and will purchase more colors from this same brand name</li>
            <li> Nail polish never last on my nails for more than a couple of hours</li>
            <li> This was my first ever experience with a soak off gel manicure</li>
            <li> Now there are a couple of caveats because this was my first time ever doing a gel a manicure</li>
            <li> Also the color looks nothing like the box, much more like the color on the actual cap.</li>
            <li> I actually feel that the results from this polish are better than some of my salon gel manicures - the coat looks like glass and no chips 4 days in.</li>
            <li> product is shiny, but not a shiny as OPI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use regular nail polish between the top and bottom coats.</li>
            <li> recommend watching the SH instructional you tube video before your first application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel that for the price, consideration should have been given to better design of the box so that it could have been used for regular storage of the kit.</li>
            <li> But in the future when I get more colors I have to be aware it may not always match.</li>
            <li> Scuffing up your polish with a nail file first helps, but it still takes 15 minutes or so to dissolve.  </li>
            <li> The gels definitely looked better for longer, though I started to peel off the colour after about 5 days.  </li>
            <li> I definitely like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li> (i had to put on a different top coat to stop this).</li>
            <li> This color lasted exactly 2 weeks then when it began chipping</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> first time I did my nails I used the color that came with the box and</li>
            <li> and I removed the first application...</li>
            <li> I also found more colors to try locally</li>
            <li> but overall I really love my nail gel polish...</li>
            <li> so I get a chance to try out some of the different colors I bought :)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> My first gel mani set.</li>
            <li> It looks and feels exactly like a salon gel manicure.  </li>
            <li> I am an avid shellac/gel polish user.</li>
            <li> The gel/shellac mani&#x27;s are far better than a normal mani b/c in 1 day</li>
            <li> For all my frugal fashionistas I highly recommend this product but YOU MUST FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!!</li>
            <li> The first one lasted through 4 bathroom cleanings, 8 bags of pulled ivy, mowed and trimmed the yard, 5 tax returns,</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first.  </li>
            <li> This is the same kit sold in stores at a much better price.  </li>
            <li> Way better than regular polish and cheaper than a salon.  </li>
            <li> Can use the same top sealer with all the colors so only need to purchase one bottle of sealer and then a couple of your favorite colors.  </li>
            <li> 5 minutes after finishing my manicure I was in the basement rearranging furniture- not so much as a smudge!  </li>
            <li> your time evening it out, even on the second coat and top coat.</li>
            <li> First time, start to finish in under one hour.  </li>
            <li> I plug this up to use for the first time and the lamp did not work.</li>
            <li> Just used my kit for the first time.  </li>
            <li> first</li>
            <li> The Wine Not color is more of a fire engine red than a wine.  </li>
            <li> I ran out of the cleanser pads and removal a long time ago but found suitable</li>
            <li> only lasts a week when I&#x27;m told I should be able to get 2 weeks wear our of it.  </li>
            <li> I am new to doing my own gel manicures and was reluctant to try, but based on several reviews chose this kit to get started.</li>
            <li> The process of putting it on is easy, and the removal (which is what I was really worried about) has so far been a breeze.</li>
            <li> At that point the polish becomes very easy to pull off because it&#x27;s a little more rubbery than the professional stuff.</li>
            <li> Such a great starter for my entrance to the gel manicure, as a warning I found I needed two of the alcohol swabs to make it through a single application.</li>
            <li> The light cures beautifully however the quality of the base and top coat does not give you the salon finish that gelish provides.</li>
            <li> The instructions tell you flat out that it will lift or cause problems if it cures while touching your nail or cuticle.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t bother me too much because the color it actually is, I like better than the picture.</li>
            <li> My only problem is that I can&#x27;t keep the polish on for more than a week because I want to change it so fast.</li>
            <li> if you want, use SPF lotion or fingertip-less gloves) and issues of fungus under the nails since they are on so long (something I still think is a huge bonus!).  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve have it on for 3 full days and nothing has peeled off.</li>
            <li> Both brands have rather full bristles on the end of the brush, which naturally holds lots of polish.  </li>
            <li> Just as expected, easy system, mirror shine, a MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li> I usually only get 2 days of a chip free  regular manicure when i use quality polish and as much as i would love to</li>
            <li> : My nails last for about two weeks, not totally chip free but good enough</li>
            <li> Which is normal for all gel polish when you&#x27;re right</li>
            <li> It was a good gift and works great,I only wish that the cord was a little longer other than that it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> sally hansen does not have a large range of colors</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m impressed because it took less time than regular polish since it was perfectly dry after I removed it from the LED light.</li>
            <li> So far it odd good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being a teacher she has little time to do her own nails and when she does puts them through a lot of abuse.</li>
            <li> With this system I will get at least a week chip free on most nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple process to do, just paint your nails and then use the UV light.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a video on the Sally Hansen website that&#x27;s really helpful.</li>
            <li> here&#x27;s to hoping that it&#x27;s not secret UV</li>
            <li> So I decided to try Sally Hansen as the price is very affordable.</li>
            <li> very thin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very convient.</li>
            <li> I should, also I didn&#x27;t do much filing of my nail</li>
            <li> My salon also offered bio gel which is much thinner and healthier for your nails.</li>
            <li> You can buy this in bottles at a chemist or hardware store and it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li> but i was ready for a color change.</li>
            <li> a manicure it too much to get them as often as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> So, I came to look at the reviews after the fact and got really nervous.</li>
            <li> But then, I read a very helpful review from a gal who has a friend who is a manicurist.</li>
            <li> The color I did not like so much</li>
            <li> I have to say it doesn&#x27;t really lasts 2 weeks</li>
            <li> You have to spend twenty minutes taking it off just to go through the whole process to redo.  </li>
            <li> However, it takes about an hour to get them done which in my opinion is very time</li>
            <li> and she said she only has to do the light once</li>
            <li> I saw this in the store and it was priced so reasonably that I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> they protect the nail from breakage so they grow nice and long, they are healthy and the best part, I rarely need a manicure until they grow out long enough to look bad where they meet the skin.</li>
            <li> So Much Fawn\\&quot; separately</li>
            <li> go straight to that and skip the Sally Hansen</li>
            <li> Wonderful!to be no worse for the wear.  </li>
            <li> Really looks like a salon manicure .</li>
            <li> so for around fifty bucks I got the whole kit.</li>
            <li> I see a couple teeny bubbles on two nails, nothing real noticeable.  </li>
            <li> A fair amount of people have negative things about this product, but at basically the cost of two pedicures, I thought what could hurt?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so i just buy other brands and use it with their system and it works just fine!</li>
            <li> I found the instructions to be very clear and the different layers of polish went on easily.  </li>
            <li> I intend to always use this kit with my other polishes because I get better results than without</li>
            <li> My nails looked like they normally would after gel polish after two weeks from a salon!</li>
            <li> I love it and have purchased/used other polish colors too.</li>
            <li> I am so excited because this actually works!</li>
            <li> The other notable benefit is the minimized damage to my nail beds.</li>
            <li> Have bought numerous colors since my original purchase.  </li>
            <li> I was originally going to purchase the RED CARPET Brand,</li>
            <li> But, even if it lasts only a week until it chips, it&#x27;s still worth it in my book!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I just do the clear top and bottom coats and then paint on top with regular nail polish and it makes my regular nail polish last for about a week.</li>
            <li> I like the shiny clean look it gives me compared to the traditional nail polish.</li>
            <li> The polish really does last me a full 2 weeks without chipping or scratching.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I get the time to do my nails, they get done by the kit, even with other gel polishes from other brands, the outcome is great.</li>
            <li> My natural nails are badly ridged and this is the first product that I have ever used that makes them smooth and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this kit to anyone who wants the gel nail experience without having to go to the salon.  </li>
            <li> I got a couple of gel manicures in salons for special events and was astonished to discover that they last on me, surviving even my weekly horseback riding.  </li>
            <li> Dries fast with the light, says to dry once</li>
            <li> I was so surprised that it came off so easily with regular nail polish remover</li>
            <li> So far the lamp is doing ok, but the polish, even when cured for several sets of 30 seconds is soft and pliable.</li>
            <li> I really DID get 2 weeks of wear from just the normal application of this product.</li>
            <li> By far much longer than many other polishes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Tries this and found it easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> You absolutely must use an alcohol pad to clean off the nail after you&#x27;re done, otherwise it won&#x27;t feel dry.</li>
            <li> I got my kit in red for the holidays and followed the process curing 2x for each coat to be double sure.</li>
            <li> I like Sally Hansen products, and this Starter Kit had decent reviews.  </li>
            <li> The lamp is great, and so are the base and top coats.</li>
            <li> Also, I leave my nails under the light for 2 30second  times (the light goes off after 30 seconds and the instructions say another round is not necessary), just because they still seem tacky after only 1 time under the light</li>
            <li> And most of those days I was doing heavy garden work so they really got a test.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am very please with this product and found it to be well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Fast, and not messy at all!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and one</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised!!</li>
            <li> followed the instructions to the letter, except for adding some little nail art flowers before adding the top coat.</li>
            <li> Instead of buying the Nail Cleanser Pad refills (cost around $5.00 for 20pads) buy a bottle of the highest concentrate Isopropyl alcohol at your local pharmacy or retailers for about $1.70 a bottle and use it with a clean soft cotton cloth.</li>
            <li> My guess is that the lamp isn&#x27;t strong enough and the product does not dry.</li>
            <li> LED light looks a little like UV light, but it&#x27;s not declared as such, so</li>
            <li> As a side, I love the wine Not colour - super bold and dark red, not too pink or trashy looking.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, to say the least.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but it works great.  </li>
            <li> I also do two round of lights between each color and the top coat.  </li>
            <li> but just be aware, apparently chlorine and gel nails do not mix.</li>
            <li> I have 3 kids, lots of dishes, and a pool and my nails with normal polish</li>
            <li> Overall is worth the money if I have to compare it to going to the salon.</li>
            <li> Normal polishes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from the generation of \\&quot;regular\\&quot; polish where, no matter how careful you were, the polish chipped and shrunk back from the free edge almost immediately, not to mention took forever to dry if you applied more than one coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 14 days, I finally took it off (easy peasy) because the grown out portion was starting to look tacky.  </li>
            <li> and it amounts to concerns that were quickly rebuffed about the UV rays from the curing process (far too brief to cause any harm, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even more convenient than regular polish due to the fast setting time.</li>
            <li> Low and behold the right hand began chipping after 2 days.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and order the Graham HandsDown Nail Wraps for super simple, mess free removal.  </li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and order the Graham HandsDown Nail Wraps for super simple, mess free removal.  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to grow nice long nails until I started getting gel manicures and became addicted!</li>
            <li> As I said, I enjoy using it with other nail polishes</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tonight I tried a new color I bought from sally Hansen called \\&quot;Shell We Dance\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying new colors.  </li>
            <li> going to buy new ones of those and see what  happens.</li>
            <li> so I ordered two new colors of gel</li>
            <li> I have definitely gotten my money worth from it so far.</li>
            <li> The shop where I purchased it had three kits available and this kit, although the most expensive worked out the cheapest.  </li>
            <li> I love gorgeous gel nails, but hate going to the nail salon to get them done.</li>
            <li> For the price of just the UV light, I got the light, top and base coat, color, orange stick, nail file, cleaning pads and acetone.  </li>
            <li> Polish lasted nearly 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> My husband gave me the kit as a present when it first came out.</li>
            <li> This polish can, in fact last two weeks-but you have to follow the instructions EXACTLY.</li>
            <li> I did my first application and like another reviewer, a few of the nails peeled off in the first 24hrs, so you just have to get used to how much to apply.</li>
            <li> an additional 30 secs after applying the first and second color coat.</li>
            <li> Super convenient for a mom of two young kids who doesn&#x27;t have the luxury of just sitting around waiting for her nails to dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend highly to anyone who is capable of reading instructions and following them to the letter.  </li>
            <li> the product was exactly what I wanted and within deadline  was expected i like so much  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so simple to use and the polish lasts so much longer than normal nail polish.</li>
            <li> A very pretty pink, I must say,</li>
            <li> The color, Wine Not, was as expected and very pretty.</li>
            <li> I actually put each hand under the UV light to dry for five minutes</li>
            <li> 8 days chip/peel free, which is UNHEARD of for my nails because I&#x27;m super rough on them (usually regular nail polish + top coat lasts less than a few hours before chipping).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t let it plugged in since it&#x27;s a week or two until it&#x27;s needed again and a little light glows inside.  </li>
            <li> I hardly ever paint my nails, because it lasts about 12 hours before it starts chipping, no mater how many coats I use.</li>
            <li> You need to use the top coat for it to get hard.</li>
            <li> I put on the last coat a little, tiny bit thicker than the rest and kind of scrape the end of each nail with the brush to seal the edges.</li>
            <li> I completed this in approx 35 minutes max because I had to prep my nails, cut them, remove old color and fix my cuticles.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Christmas and gave it to my daughter who is a professional nail salon artist and she used it on me.  </li>
            <li> They were glued directly to the nail with nail glue, and cured with 2 coats of #3.</li>
            <li> They remained sticky and soft for over an hour.</li>
            <li> The polish on one of the nails that I hadn&#x27;t fixed began to lift.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t cure it under the lamp, so you just need to wait until it dries completely before applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Also, in the nail salon I see them putting the alcohol in a spray bottle and spray them on the customers&#x27; finger and wipe them with soft cotton cloth.</li>
            <li> Even after I&#x27;m completely done it feels gooey</li>
            <li> Then unfortunately developed a allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I have gone as far as 5 cycles on each &amp;#34;barely there&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> A metallic, pinky red that is very flattering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a frequent hand washer.  </li>
            <li> Just remember, if you&#x27;re using regular nail polish between the gel layers, do NOT put on the gel top coat until the nail polish has fully dried.</li>
            <li> They tend to put the gel polish on too thick and when it cures with the LED light, it feels like it&#x27;s burning my fingers!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap, and not really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I had small chips on 2 nail (more peeling than chipping actually).</li>
            <li> I only recommend it if you have realistic expectations and don&#x27;t mind spending the money to give it a try</li>
            <li> /&gt;Granted I only used last night for the first time</li>
            <li> Is the 10th day that I use this product on my finger and there is a big chip on my right thumb and a small chip on my right index finger.</li>
            <li> I am a black female and need medium toned colors (not too light and not too</li>
            <li> I like that everything is included in the kit, even the cord for the light which I was not able to tell from looking at the box online.  </li>
            <li> I picked them off, sanded the nails lightly with the little emery board, added another coat of red polish, and the topcoat again and voila...</li>
            <li> my kit claimed to have been NEW, but when i opened it the step 1 and 3 had red on the brush.</li>
            <li> and it makes the mani dry much faster&lt;</li>
            <li> It looks less shiny after I finished my last step which is to clean it with the nail cleanser pad.  </li>
            <li> Nails were dry and ready to go in five minutes</li>
            <li> My nails looked better than when I took it to the salon which is sad to say since I didn&#x27;t devote much time to them</li>
            <li> I got two top coats instead one one base coat and a top coat.</li>
            <li> Kit came with very clear and specific directions.  </li>
            <li> Its a plug in light (compared to the battery powered in the Red Carpet kit) and it cures in half the time!  </li>
            <li> I am active and I use my hands a lot, but I still wanted pretty nails without having to go to the salon.</li>
            <li> I generally do two times in the LED per coat.  </li>
            <li> This will replace the Nail Cleanser Pad and save you at least $20.00 or more in the long run.</li>
            <li> I usually keep each coat under the light an extra time or two.</li>
            <li> But when I occasionally screw it up and a nail peels early, I just redo that one nail.  </li>
            <li> The color &amp;#34;Wine Not&amp;#34; is much redder than I had expected, but I like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because professional salon gel does peel too and if you go back and ask them to fix it for you.....</li>
            <li> My order came much faster than I expected, too.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you have short nails, do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Apparently I have oily nail plates</li>
            <li> This is normal and the same thing happened occasionally when I used to go the salon.</li>
            <li> I took it off today and am going with a pretty pink for next week.  </li>
            <li> I usually cure each hand for 2 minutes (4 x 30 seconds) and find that my polish lasts the full two weeks tho way.</li>
            <li> But the kit nail polish is not dry even after 20 cycles!</li>
            <li> The LED lamp is small so only 4 fingers fit, but doing the thumbs at the same time is no problem.</li>
            <li> If they last 1 week without chipping badly, I will be happy.</li>
            <li> and it still did not dry.  </li>
            <li> You have to push the button twice to make sure each layer of polish is &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; enough and the polish is poor quality.</li>
            <li> This was my first time doing a gel manicure, so I was a little nervous</li>
            <li> kit only comes with 10 alcohol wipes, I ended up using half for my first application because I had to fix a number of nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this system and gel nails in general.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve left polish on for 3 weeks at a time with barely any chips.</li>
            <li> first color, the Wine Not included in this kit, didn&#x27;t last as long as I had expected it to.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions closely the first time because it can get messy.</li>
            <li> after a few days or soaking in the hot tub you guessed it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still using the original base and top coats.</li>
            <li> I have tried the first time, and half of the nail polish did not cure!</li>
            <li> I think most of the effect is due to the base and top coats and not the colour.  </li>
            <li> but if you follow the directions not too difficult and a small irritation for the quality and quantity of time you have great looking nails.</li>
            <li> My fingernail beds started turning black and my cuticles became very itcy and inflamed.</li>
            <li> It is decent priced, and comes with everything you need!!&lt;br /&gt;wouldn&#x27;t want to use a single nail led, takes way to long.</li>
            <li> I have had a (small) chip after 5-6 days (which is much better than regular polish) and could be partially my fault due to not covering the whole nail (missing the edge/tip).  </li>
            <li> Very pricey, but when you look down at you nails, it&#x27;s all smiles!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the results bases on the other reviews I had read.  </li>
            <li> The instructions tell you flat out that the nails will feel sticky and tacky throughout the process until you do the final cleansing.</li>
            <li> give the product four stars for the above cons, but they are not major cons.</li>
            <li> Dont last as long as advertized only one week</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had trouble maintaining your manicures I can highly recommend investing some money in this product.</li>
            <li> They warn you about NOT touching the sking or the whole polish will lift off after it dries.</li>
            <li> The bottles are small and harden fast.  </li>
            <li> The polish does not last long.</li>
            <li> Nail polish doesn&#x27;t last as long as it&#x27;s supposed to though.</li>
            <li> So compare to the gel manicure that I get in the salon, the Sally Hansen Gel kits does not last as long as the ones I get in the Salon.  </li>
            <li> but my nails didn&#x27;t last as long as when I go to the nail salon.</li>
            <li> and I think they peeled off the first time because each layer was too thick and didnt harden</li>
            <li> I just filed the cuticle area down, and with it being clear it is not noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have to rush thru second coat so as to not ruin the first coat, which often ends up too thick &amp; takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> The only concern I have is how long the UV light will last (since I know it will be expensive to replace).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, she says that it takes her more than two coats sometimes to get enough color on there so that it&#x27;s not transparent (she said this about a color other than the one that came with the kit that was also sally hansen gel polish, so</li>
            <li> And after 2 days, the tips are still nice (typically impossible for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, when u r done, it&#x27;s dry not only to the touch, but I tried to dent it in an unnoticeable spot and it didn&#x27;t dent.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;wine&amp;#34; color actually ends up being a deep reddish pink, though.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of these at-home kits, but after getting my first professional gel manicure I decided that since I do my nails once a week, if they lasted even a little longer than that it would be worth it.</li>
            <li> I was actually expecting this product to be a little less like salon nails because of some of the reviews, but was possitively please to learn that this product will give tou real salon gel nails.</li>
            <li> Personally, I like that it&#x27;s a little less intense on my nails because they seem to be healthier</li>
            <li> Just last night I have tried it for the second time and half of my nails now have a &amp;#34;bubbly&amp;#34; layer, and it feel like it would peel off any second.</li>
            <li> Some salons use cheap gel products that are very thick, which is why they have to grind your nails down.</li>
            <li> Sadly the led light has already stopped working.  </li>
            <li> then realised that I had mucked up a few nails while they were soft, and some had bubbled as a result.</li>
            <li> I just used it on my toes a few weeks ago and so far my toes are chip</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it will save me money in the long run compared to going to the salon every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> PLUS its about an hour long process.</li>
            <li> how long I wait.</li>
            <li> But, I did go camping/hiking/vacationing during that time, so it&#x27;s not really a surprise that it didn&#x27;t last two weeks.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised when TWO days later they started chipping slowly.</li>
            <li> my lips came with my kitandI have purchased several other colors.  </li>
            <li> followed the directions to a T and then cured everything a little extra, so that could be key, but I would recommend this to system to anyone!</li>
            <li> Originally I thought this kit was expensive, but I got a $10 voucher online, and then bought it on Senior&#x27;s Day at Shoppers Drug Mart which gave me another 20% off...</li>
            <li> So the manicure ends up lasting a little longer than regular polish.</li>
            <li> AND THE POLISH TAKE FOR EVER TO DRY AND PEELS OFF</li>
            <li> followed the instructions, or so I thought, and my nails just wouldn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> The nails don&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> Tried this and cured up to 5 minutes, but still the nails don&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always in a rush to dry my nail polish.  </li>
            <li> The trick to take the sticky feeling n to dry nails is after you use the lamp wipe with a cotton pad with alcohol.</li>
            <li> Also didnt get the sheet marks on them for going to sleep when I thought they were dry, but werent dry all the way through.</li>
            <li> I have not had a single chip and the shine is still glossy.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how long it will last since I only applied it 2 days ago.</li>
            <li> I followed the instruction carefully and even put my nails under the LED lamp twice as long as it</li>
            <li> I was a little iffy at first based on some negative comments, but I wanted to see for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They will last for a solid two weeks with very little wear.  </li>
            <li> The nail polish didn&#x27;t dry in 30 seconds!  </li>
            <li> Also, the product takes hours to dry!</li>
            <li> When I went to wipe my nails with the nail pads, I could see a slight faint color from my nails come off on the nail pads, which worried me a bit, even though I followed instructions carefully and even cured my nails under the uv light twice as long as instructed.</li>
            <li> After 4 days the tips of 4 nails have peeled off all the way across and half of one nail (in a different sally hansen gel color) has peeled off.</li>
            <li> big toes have a small flower design in gemstones, with 2 stones on my smaller toes.</li>
            <li> Also, I went swimming at the local sports club and half of the gel polish peeled off.</li>
            <li> And normally, Amazon takes everything back on products that you&#x27;re not happy with.  </li>
            <li> It took less time for this to chip then regular polish.  </li>
            <li> I definitely have NOT gotten salon quality results (I can typically get 3 weeks out of a shellac manicure from the salon)</li>
            <li> Normally, regular nail polish lasts maybe a day on my nails (normally less than a day).</li>
            <li> I even placed it under the led lamp a little longer so that it could set properly.</li>
            <li> I followed all of the directions, curing a couple extra rounds just because I&#x27;m a little OCD about it, but I doubt it was needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping this color will last a little longer.</li>
            <li> I typically have issues with even salon manicures or the regular polish strips cracking on my nails - they don&#x27;t chip or flake, just get little spider-web cracks (my nails are pretty weak and bendy).</li>
            <li> So far, that hasn&#x27;t happened with the gel polish, it seems to cure to a flexible, vinyl-like finish rather than a hard shell.</li>
            <li> I have had no issues with the light cutting in and out or anything of that nature.  </li>
            <li> Just not sure how long the UV lights will last.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t last quite as long (usually about 1.5 weeks).</li>
            <li> Just be careful.</li>
            <li> Product was eveything I expected.</li>
            <li> Gave it three tries - assuming that I misapplied.  </li>
            <li> My nails were sticky and wet.  </li>
            <li> After I received my kit and applied all steps, I got nervous because the polish was still wet.</li>
            <li> Not just sticky, but wet....</li>
            <li> well, they are not very thrill to help you with it.  </li>
            <li> I just received mine a few days ago and have already used it several times on myself and others.</li>
            <li> application and still had wet sticky nails...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pink.  </li>
            <li> All I got were empty bottles and could not return it.</li>
            <li> Or you can do just the base coat, top coat, and then paint whatever basic nail polish color you want over it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it takes a lot of practice and skill to get it right.  </li>
            <li> I also found that if you do the base coat, then whatever nail polish you want, then wait for it to dry, and apply the gel  top coat, it works just as well as using the gel polish.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to get the kit out of the box and even more difficult to get it back in.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I did wrong that first time</li>
            <li> Usually when I have traditional nail polish on, my nails will look like hell after 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> One was &amp;#34;blue my mind&amp;#34; and the other was &amp;#34;glisten up!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The dryer is cheap.u have to put ur nails under it a few times to dry</li>
            <li> I can tell some of the gels are slightly peeling off at the corner of my other fingers.  </li>
            <li> This is hard to do with short nails!  </li>
            <li> This kit is not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the $65 price tag at all.</li>
            <li> After using it multiple times, every manicure has lasted at least a week</li>
            <li> I am on day 9, and am just now starting to see a few small chips in the polish.</li>
            <li> I hate the cracks, so I love that this doesn&#x27;t do that!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Try to keep the base coat, color and top coat off your skin so there is no chance of peeling.</li>
            <li> If your coats are too thick, it won&#x27;t cure properly.  </li>
            <li> but i think the base and top coat suck because mine always chip after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Not major filing), clean your nails with alcohol or acetone, don&#x27;t get any of the base, polish or topcoat on the skin around your nails or the cuticle.</li>
            <li> Remember thin layers when applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No chipping, instant dry.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going to find something besides cotton swabs to use to wipe down before and after manicure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> prep my nails by:&lt;br /&gt;wiping them down with drug store acetone;&lt;br /&gt;apply</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pink but not too pink and just dark enough without being overly dramatic.</li>
            <li> This is not a good replacement for Salon gel nails though, I have weak nails and two nails broke the first week I used this product.</li>
            <li> I followed all the directions and in less than 24 hours the nail polish peeled off  </li>
            <li> I got gel manicures at the salon previously</li>
            <li> and half my nails were chippd.</li>
            <li> The Sensationails kit does not come with gel remover, which - if you add the cost of this - made the SH it slightly cheaper.</li>
            <li> The only downside I find is that the polish is difficult to properly remove.  </li>
            <li> Nail polish typically lasts on me for about a day or so before I get chipping, peeling and whatnot.  </li>
            <li> Nail polish dries in less than a minute.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easier and takes less time to soak off with polish remover which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that the color changes slightly as the days go by.  </li>
            <li> but since then I have had no further trouble and they have lasted at least twelve days each time.  </li>
            <li> Just purchaaed today at CVS for $70, but had 25% off coupon, so was less than $60 with the tax.</li>
            <li> Both their nails were completed in less than 30 mins.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> typically get 7 days wear before my nails peel.  </li>
            <li> I would mess it up.</li>
            <li> Granted, it&#x27;s gel and therefore not good to keep on your nails constantly.  </li>
            <li> I made the mistake of filing down my thumb nail after it dried and it began to peel off, so that&#x27;s MY fault.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had given up on polishing my nails years ago because I&#x27;d go to the time and trouble and less than 3 hrs</li>
            <li> (I had a hard time at first getting the polish to go on very thinly), but you must get one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a little longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does take a little practice to get it on evenly.</li>
            <li> Also, it takes so much less time than at the salon, i can do both hands in less than 10 minutes!  </li>
            <li> Remember to file your nail a little bit</li>
            <li> :/ other than that</li>
            <li> Not fun!</li>
            <li> Works really well, and much less expensive than a salon!</li>
            <li> so I went really thin on the left hand and then wanted to sleep</li>
            <li> The key is to do thin coats which I&#x27;ve adjusted to.  </li>
            <li> WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY</li>
            <li> Mine came off after a few minutes soaking in an acetone-soaked cotton swab wrapped in foil.</li>
            <li> I got this in shell we dance just to try it out because I was impatient waiting for my sensationail Kit to arrive from a site rhyming with crouton.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> I destroy manicures.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a definite learning curve, but if you follow the directions and use thin coats, it works quite well.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve used this a few times now</li>
            <li> I noticed too not all those harsh chemical smells</li>
            <li> I opt for gel or shelac over acrylic because it doesn&#x27;t destroy my nails.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea how these ladies are getting it on thin enough.</li>
            <li> No matter how thin I applied it, I got the same results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to run to the salon if the color chips, i just fix it myself in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I did need to &amp;#34;tip out&amp;#34; a few nails after 4 or 5 days</li>
            <li> Waste of my time and money.</li>
            <li> Plus, if you have a few friends that have them too- share the nail polish colors</li>
            <li> My sister loves it either way and says that the manicure lasts her a few days to a week.</li>
            <li> Had a friend who works at a beauty supply store pick one up for 60 bucks and in less then 5 minutes, these products are amazine!</li>
            <li> From the name and the picture on the internet, box and cap, I figured it was going to be a pale brownish tone.  </li>
            <li> and I am very lazy and rough on my hands.  </li>
            <li> No more difficult than regular nail polish to apply and no more waiting for them to be REALLY dry to go about your business.</li>
            <li> I have a 1 year old and I have very little time to devote to myself so doing my nails and spending a long time on it is impossible.</li>
            <li> it extended past the side of my nail.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one!  </li>
            <li> My biggest thing is when my nails grow out I tend to pick at the small ridge it leaves at the cuticle area.</li>
            <li> I was left with a strip across the tip that was pretty nasty</li>
            <li> I am not sure</li>
            <li> it starts to come up, dirt gets trapped inside, then i can put a nail under the polish and pull all the nail polish off in one swoop!</li>
            <li> It has the lites  three polishes, wipes a small nail file.</li>
            <li> the only thing I did wrong was the manicure itself.</li>
            <li> For not much more money than just doing a polish she had GEL, and both hands and feet too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or your money, this DOES NOT WORK!  </li>
            <li> Not sure why this happened.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for the longevity of the manicure.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if mine is defective or its just my nails</li>
            <li> it are really so small</li>
            <li> Just put each coat on carefully and use thin coats.</li>
            <li> I cleaned the nail with some polish remover (given with the kit), and redid them, being careful to put thin even coats on.</li>
            <li> it works perfectly no more going to the nail salon jijijiji</li>
            <li> so I thought I had the \\&quot;thin coat\\&quot; thing down but still having trouble with it.  </li>
            <li> The little included light that &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; the polish does a terrible job --</li>
            <li> I have weak, thin nails and need a strong base for them to grow.</li>
            <li> Does not make set as hard as it does in the salon.</li>
            <li> Voila, I had hard shiny nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The plus side is that I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s hard to remove the gel colour</li>
            <li> After paying $30 for the gel polish in the salon every 2-3 weeks, it wasn&#x27;t hard to justify the $70 price (at Rite Aid).</li>
            <li> how hard I used them (cleaning dishes, washing hair, ect).  </li>
            <li> (I got the wine color), it looks a little outdated.</li>
            <li> Wanted a product that lasted for at least a week.</li>
            <li> instruction is buried under the step 3 and as the majority of negative reviews complain about the nails not setting correctly, they should make this a separate step in the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> reviewers have complained that when they wiped their nails with the alcohol wipes at the end that the color is coming off.</li>
            <li> The dryes seems to be operational - at least all LED are lit.</li>
            <li> at least the polish works.</li>
            <li> my manicure lasts for at least two weeks</li>
            <li> She uses it every 2 weeks and hasn&#x27;t complained yet.</li>
            <li> and my nails were not stained in the least.  </li>
            <li> If you put each layer on too thick, it will peel away.  </li>
            <li> I did have a problem with 2 of my nails because the the polish went on a) too thickly in one spot and b)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m (like the rest of you) tired of adding nail polish to see the polish com off in just a few days.</li>
            <li> SH gel is not as thick as the salon gels.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to wipe with the alcohol pad provided before the base coat and when the directions say apply a thin layer, they mean thin!</li>
            <li> Defintely dont waste your money!!</li>
            <li> Total rip-off!!</li>
            <li> Seriously, read the instructions.</li>
            <li> Seriously ladies.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m hard on my nails!  </li>
            <li> /false advertising and the product sucks!  </li>
            <li> This was a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> Opted to get this because I figured in worse case scenario&lt;</li>
            <li> but the next day they were already chipped - so annoying.</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions (apply thin layers and use the alcohol wipe at the end)</li>
            <li> Poor</li>
            <li> I was nervous because I&#x27;m not great at doing my nails and get my gel manicure done every two weeks at the salon.</li>
            <li> (I layer it on thin).</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions very carefully, thin coats, 30 seconds each hand (and thumb)</li>
            <li> Recommendations from my experience: shake the heck out of the polish bottles, do 4 finger nails and then the thumb nail separately, use thin (but sufficient) coats, follow all steps.</li>
            <li> So it works against you when you need to do thin coats.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy</li>
            <li> /&gt;You simply can&#x27;t do a sloppy application and expect this product to fix that for you.</li>
            <li> The brushes in the bottles are terrible for applying the base, polish and top coats.  </li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed with the sturdyness</li>
            <li> When I finally received it, I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take a while to remove, but again, follow the instructions, and it&#x27;s not that difficult.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Figuring I must have done something wrong, I read through the instructions again.</li>
            <li> if im doing something wrong or its just the quality of the product...</li>
            <li> , I was skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY about this purchase!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but decided to give this product a try.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin brittle nails.</li>
            <li> In fact, I usually have to redo my nails because they&#x27;ve grown out, not because the polish looks bad!  </li>
            <li> I use the tin foil and cotton ball method, which somewhat speeds the process, but it&#x27;s awkward to put them on.  </li>
            <li> As in cutting my cuticles etc.</li>
            <li> Wanted, desperately, for this to work.</li>
            <li> when I told someone that I used the Gel polish, they looked aghast and asked if I&#x27;d heard all the health warnings</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to cure your nails</li>
            <li> Followed directions and used thin layers have used twice now and each time lasted 2 weeks with no chipping!!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> If you glob it on you&#x27;ll end up giving it a bad review because it wont set under the LED.</li>
            <li> My guess is user error on some of the really bad reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bad news is that it&#x27;s not quite the professional-grade stuff you&#x27;d get at a nail salon</li>
            <li> It buckled and made this ugly wrinkle effect in my nails.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am deeply disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff stays on like crazy!  </li>
            <li> I am sorry I did!!</li>
            <li> But I hate getting my nails done.</li>
            <li> I hate the price I have to pay in a salon.  </li>
            <li> base coat followed by light;&lt;br /&gt;apply</li>
            <li> I am brutal on my stuff - wash dishes, dig plants, use my nails to scratch up stuff, etc, and the polish has stayed on for a week now.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> Horrible!!!!!</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen products are getting worst and worst.</li>
            <li> Had to take it off, it looked terrible and I could move the gel coats around with my finger.</li>
            <li> I will never pay for an outrageous charge in a salon..</li>
            <li> Crap! Came off in like 4 days</li>
            <li> but I hate spending $60 bucks a pop!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was actually expecting this product to be a little less like salon nails because of some of the reviews, but was possitively please to learn that this product will give tou real salon gel nails. Remember thin layers when applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No chipping, instant dry. It works - notning more to say!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the results bases on the other reviews I had read.  I don&#x27;t think this product even falls in the gel manicure category!  It peeled off e day after I did the manicure!  I am returning it.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed and excited about this gel kit! It works so well! Follow the directions exactly, and you will get a nice, shiny, long-lasting manicure.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  It works great and has helped me to keep my nails at a decent length.  Worth every penny! It is so nice to finally have nails again.  I work in the medical field and can&#x27;t have acrylic nails, but this gives me added thickness that helps prevent breakage.</li>
            <li> I painted my nails 2 nights ago, I&#x27;ve had to re-do 5 nails already. The nail polish literally peels off like a sticker.</li>
            <li> Very nice device. I have definitely gotten my money worth from it so far. Just not sure how long the UV lights will last. So far so good!&#x27;</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but it works great.  Super convenient for a mom of two young kids who doesn&#x27;t have the luxury of just sitting around waiting for her nails to dry.</li>
            <li> Only lasted two days, not two weeks. This was a waste of money!!! I do not recommend anyone buy this item.</li>
            <li> Horrible!!!!! Ruined my nails, couldn&#x27;t get the Polish off after scrubbing and soaking for an hour!!! Not to mention the product doesn&#x27;t do as it states on the box...waste of money!</li>
            <li> For the price of just the UV light, I got the light, top and base coat, color, orange stick, nail file, cleaning pads and acetone.  The UV light is not as strong as a professional one, naturally, but it was easy to compensate by setting the color with two or three times under the light - and the result is the same as from the salon! I was impressed with the unit and it&#x27;s already paid for itself!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done 2 manicures and both have held up fairly well.  However, I&#x27;ve found that they aren&#x27;t holding up as well as a salon manicure does.  Some of that could be my own error since I&#x27;m not a pro, but the cost savings pretty much out weighs the fact that the manicure doesn&#x27;t hold up as long.&lt;br /&gt;That said, be aware that doing a gel manicure yourself is time consuming!  Plan on setting aside about an hour to do a proper job.  Also, I&#x27;ve found that curing the product for longer than the directions say helps to get a better cure.  I recommend looking up an online &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; from a pro and following those directions.  Between the pro&#x27;s directions and you figuring out what works best for you, you&#x27;ll get the hang of it in no time.</li>
            <li> I am not one to write reviews.  I don&#x27;t like to do my nails and I am very lazy and rough on my hands.  Regular polish will last me about 4 hours tops before I would get a chip, peel, knick...you name it.  I went to the salon once and got the shellac and fell in love.  Opted to get this because I figured in worse case scenario&lt;br /&gt;It would cost the amount of a regular shellac mani.  It worked and I love it.  Polish lasted nearly 2 weeks! Very easy.  The instructions say put your fingers under the LED light twice for 30 seconds...I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s accurate.  I did it about 5 or 6 times per hand.  Would definitely recommend if it worked for a tomboy like me!</li>
            <li> A quality product but you should use this type of polish only occasionally as it severely weakens your nails. When you want to this is a great one to use</li>
            <li> The dryer is cheap.u have to put ur nails under it a few times to dry</li>
            <li> The light cures beautifully however the quality of the base and top coat does not give you the salon finish that gelish provides.</li>
            <li> I got this on the 20th.. and tried it out that evening.&lt;br /&gt;1. It was way easier than I imagined and faster to do. I have a 1 year old and I have very little time to devote to myself so doing my nails and spending a long time on it is impossible. I completed this in approx 35 minutes max because I had to prep my nails, cut them, remove old color and fix my cuticles. Otherwise it may have taken me more like 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;2. Its now the 26th and all of my nails are chipped. However, I will update to see if this was the kit itself or me. I am honestly going to say it was me for the following reasons: I had no idea what &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; meant so I went really thin on the left hand and then wanted to sleep so I quickly did the right and it was thicker. Low and behold the right hand began chipping after 2 days. My left hand looked great until today (6 days later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try this again when I have more time and I&#x27;ll update my review accordingly. So far I&#x27;m impressed because it took less time than regular polish since it was perfectly dry after I removed it from the LED light. My nails looked better than when I took it to the salon which is sad to say since I didn&#x27;t devote much time to them and I am not as skilled as the manicurist at the salon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this several weeks ago after trying my relatives a couple of times (and never feeling like having the time or wanting the added expense of going to a salon).  Overall, I&#x27;m extremely pleased with it.  I ordered the wine not color and I love the color.  The key is to do thin coats which I&#x27;ve adjusted to.  If you put each layer on too thick, it will peel away.  I also do two round of lights between each color and the top coat.  I love having this product to do at home when it works around my schedule.  The longest I&#x27;ve had the polish on is 11-12 days.  I have had a (small) chip after 5-6 days (which is much better than regular polish) and could be partially my fault due to not covering the whole nail (missing the edge/tip).  I highly recommend and one if my friends just ordered one for herself!  I love the constant shine!</li>
            <li> HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT TWICE AND THE POLISH TAKE FOR EVER TO DRY AND PEELS OFF WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY</li>
            <li> I Love it!!!! Perfect to Save time, money...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple process to do, just paint your nails and then use the UV light. The polish lasted about a week for me. I was impressed! It&#x27;s also nice because I can find a variety of colors to purchase at my local Meijer! Fun product, and it saves money from having to go to the spa!</li>
            <li> Just tried this out after hearing fantastic things from my friend. Love love love how super shiny my nails are. And after 2 days, the tips are still nice (typically impossible for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a word of caution: Follow the instructions exactly. I did have a problem with 2 of my nails because the the polish went on a) too thickly in one spot and b) it extended past the side of my nail. If it touches your skin or cuticles, and you cure it like that, it will lift. Just be careful. There&#x27;s a video on the Sally Hansen website that&#x27;s really helpful. You absolutely must use an alcohol pad to clean off the nail after you&#x27;re done, otherwise it won&#x27;t feel dry. The instructions tell you flat out that the nails will feel sticky and tacky throughout the process until you do the final cleansing. The instructions tell you flat out that it will lift or cause problems if it cures while touching your nail or cuticle. The instructions also tell you not to file your nails after application because the polish will lift. Seriously, read the instructions. Twice. Watch the videos online. Then approach the application full of knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You simply can&#x27;t do a sloppy application and expect this product to fix that for you. if you aren&#x27;t good at applying nail polish in a clean fashion, this won&#x27;t help you, try the strips. But if you can apply nail polish cleanly and evenly, this is pretty awesome. I typically have issues with even salon manicures or the regular polish strips cracking on my nails - they don&#x27;t chip or flake, just get little spider-web cracks (my nails are pretty weak and bendy). So far, that hasn&#x27;t happened with the gel polish, it seems to cure to a flexible, vinyl-like finish rather than a hard shell. I hate the cracks, so I love that this doesn&#x27;t do that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take a while to remove, but again, follow the instructions, and it&#x27;s not that difficult. Mine came off after a few minutes soaking in an acetone-soaked cotton swab wrapped in foil. I didn&#x27;t even have to push it off, it just came right off when I applied a bit of pressure while pulling the foil off. (of course, I&#x27;ve only removed stuff that was already lifting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LED light looks a little like UV light, but it&#x27;s not declared as such, so here&#x27;s to hoping that it&#x27;s not secret UV light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a fantastic product. I&#x27;d recommend highly to anyone who is capable of reading instructions and following them to the letter.  As a side, I love the wine Not colour - super bold and dark red, not too pink or trashy looking. Very classy and elegant.</li>
            <li> good starter kit.  I generally do two times in the LED per coat.  value for money.</li>
            <li> Good price. Haven&#x27;t used yet. For granddaughter at a later date</li>
            <li> I followed all the directions and in less than 24 hours the nail polish peeled off  I now use clear nail polish that has an hardening and it is much better on my nails</li>
            <li> I totally LOVE it. This was my first try with the gel nail polishes. So I decided to try Sally Hansen as the price is very affordable. I tried to do my pedicure 1st and it turn out to be just great!!! There is very nice instruction inside and if you follow it you will have your manicure or pedicure done in just 40-45 minutes!!!</li>
            <li> I have very thin brittle nails. I don&#x27;t like looking at my hands. I&#x27;m (like the rest of you) tired of adding nail polish to see the polish com off in just a few days. What&#x27;s the point?!! I teach ofr a lving and one of my students nails were looking so cute so I asked her what color she was wearing and she told me about the \\&quot;gel nail polish\\&quot;, so I had to buy it and see if it works for me. I just finished reading all the amazon reviews on this product. Some of them I disagree with and some I agree with. Here&#x27;s my take on this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. you&#x27;re nails will look FAB!! (Provided you follow ALL of the instructions diligently!)&lt;br /&gt;2. So far, I&#x27;ve have it on for 3 full days and nothing has peeled off. They warn you about NOT touching the sking or the whole polish will lift off after it dries. I made the mistake of filing down my thumb nail after it dried and it began to peel off, so that&#x27;s MY fault.&lt;br /&gt;3. I never seen my nails look so pretty. Total confidence booster!&lt;br /&gt;4. Comes with a LED light instead of a UV light. UV light causes you skin to tan, age and might result in skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;5. I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands, and so far so good. Nail polish is still intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. When applying the top gel, the color of the nail polish comes off a bit.&lt;br /&gt;2. The top gel is sticky even after curing.&lt;br /&gt;3. I wish there was more variety in colors. I am a black female and need medium toned colors (not too light and not too dark).&lt;br /&gt;4. Very pricey, but when you look down at you nails, it&#x27;s all smiles! We are women and we&#x27;re worth it!&lt;br /&gt;5. It&#x27;s a lengthly process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the product four stars for the above cons, but they are not major cons. It&#x27;s part of the process of looking good..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NAIL POLISH REMOVAL: I do NOT soak my nails in acetone. I read the reviews about this process. I peel the polis off from the edges. Acetone makes you nails very thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone!</li>
            <li> It chipped after three days!  I was not impressed.  I have had regular polish last longer.</li>
            <li> I bought this so I could have the convenience of fresh looking polish without doing them twice a week. I got gel manicures at the salon previously so I knew what to expect and how to use it. I even placed it under the led lamp a little longer so that it could set properly. I was very excited after i did it because it cam out great! Perfect red color for my skin tone, had a nice sheen and looked clean (no bubbles). I was very surprised when TWO days later they started chipping slowly. I wear gloves while washi my dishes and it was over the weekend so there definitely wasnt any good reason why this was happening.. Another day later and half my nails were chippd. This lasted shorter than a regular manicure..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am deeply disappointed in this product. Defintely dont waste your money!! Sally Hansen products are getting worst and worst. What a shame!</li>
            <li> Such a great starter for my entrance to the gel manicure, as a warning I found I needed two of the alcohol swabs to make it through a single application. I would recommend buying more upfront as the kit only includes 10.</li>
            <li> Product was eveything I expected. Will def purchase it again, and will purchase more colors from this same brand name</li>
            <li> instead of going to the salon to get my nails done i got this. it was very easy to do. the only thing i recommend ot when you do the color you should do 2 beeps per coat. only using one beep the color was not set all the way. other that that great product</li>
            <li> Im in love with this product! i have been buying more colors since i got this. Nail polish never last on my nails for more than a couple of hours so with this product my nails look flawless for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> This will save alot of money at salon!  easy steps 123 very convient. Would recommend to friends and family. great</li>
            <li> I am currently on day 11 of my no-chip manicure and this set it living up to it&#x27;s name. The only concern I have is how long the UV light will last (since I know it will be expensive to replace). But so far everything is great!</li>
            <li> If your gel polish is falling off, you&#x27;re probably not applying it right! Once I got the hang of it, I came to love this gel mani kit. The &amp;#34;wine&amp;#34; color actually ends up being a deep reddish pink, though. I was hoping for a more purple tone, but oh well.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. The nail polish lasts for up 2-3 weeks without chipping and is way cheaper than getting a manicure. Polish dries within 3 minutes under the light.</li>
            <li> Does not make set as hard as it does in the salon. But for the price not bad. Does not really chip but does peel often sometimes early as a day I would have them start to peel off. Possibly try a primer with it or don&#x27;t do dishes.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Christmas and gave it to my daughter who is a professional nail salon artist and she used it on me.  The polish looked wonderful but within 4 hours of application it began chipping away rather drastically.  I had to remove the polish the next morning because it just does not work.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one!  I am sorry I did!!</li>
            <li> This was my first ever experience with a soak off gel manicure and I had been eyeing the kits for a while. I usually only get 2 days of a chip free  regular manicure when i use quality polish and as much as i would love to, i dont have the time to do my nails every 3 days. I got this in shell we dance just to try it out because I was impatient waiting for my sensationail Kit to arrive from a site rhyming with crouton. I will update this review when I try that one out. Now there are a couple of caveats because this was my first time ever doing a gel a manicure: I didn&#x27;t seal the tip of my nail as recommended because I didn&#x27;t know I should, also I didn&#x27;t do much filing of my nail and I don&#x27;t plan to because I&#x27;m not concerned with getting a full two weeks of wear and i would just rather not. Also I did do nail stamping after doing the top coat and so I used acetone when I messed up which may have weakened the gel portion. However after 3 days of wear I had small chips on 2 nail (more peeling than chipping actually). After 4 days the tips of 4 nails have peeled off all the way across and half of one nail (in a different sally hansen gel color) has peeled off. I could chalk this up to human error for now, hence the 3 stars but 3 days out of the projected 14 is dubious. Also the color looks nothing like the box, much more like the color on the actual cap. This is a true nude, even after 3 coats I could still see my nail underneath. It&#x27;s not a bad color but not as pictured.</li>
            <li> If I could give it zero stars I would.  Gave it three tries - assuming that I misapplied.  Wanted a product that lasted for at least a week. No go.  Was lucky if the nails lasted three days.  My guess is that the lamp isn&#x27;t strong enough and the product does not dry. Waste of money and I cannot return it.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to grow nice long nails until I started getting gel manicures and became addicted! The problem is that you need to maintain and the time and $$ going to the salon so often became a problem. I tried to keep my nails going with regular polish at home but the next day they were already chipped - so annoying. I found this product and thought I would give it a shot. I am so thrilled with the results! I got my kit in red for the holidays and followed the process curing 2x for each coat to be double sure. I also followed a trick my manicurist uses to do a quick pass over the tips to seal them - this really helps to avoid any chips! I actually feel that the results from this polish are better than some of my salon gel manicures - the coat looks like glass and no chips 4 days in. I expect they will easily last 2 weeks. I am so happy with this kit, great buy :)</li>
            <li> I have done my nails a couple times already. It will last for a couple weeks. Follow the directions closely the first time because it can get messy. Once I figured out how to work with the product it became super easy. The alcohol pads were used up quickly on the first application, but they are easily replaced. My biggest thing is when my nails grow out I tend to pick at the small ridge it leaves at the cuticle area. I was left with a strip across the tip that was pretty nasty looking.&lt;br /&gt;The second application I added a couple stones to the color layer. (Just glued them to the red color.) I then put the top coat over and cured. They lasted until I went to an amusement/water park. One stone popped off because the top coat peeled off the end and the stone came with it. Once the stone came off I started to again pick at them.&lt;br /&gt;My big toes have a small flower design in gemstones, with 2 stones on my smaller toes. They were glued directly to the nail with nail glue, and cured with 2 coats of #3. This has lasted for about 3 weeks now. I just filed the cuticle area down, and with it being clear it is not noticeable. This has lasted through 2 water parks, and an amusement park as well.&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for a starter kit go with this one!! It is decent priced, and comes with everything you need!!&lt;br /&gt;wouldn&#x27;t want to use a single nail led, takes way to long. Very worth paying a few $$ more!! LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Works great for an at home kit and such a good price compared to the same product in store. If you follow the directions (apply thin layers and use the alcohol wipe at the end) I don&#x27;t see why anyone would complain. Keeps nails shiny and strong for weeks. It&#x27;s not as hard to the touch as the UV cured gel but still a great product.</li>
            <li> Product seems to do the job advertised.  Was a little disappointed with the sturdyness it seems quite light weight and I&#x27;m concerned about its durability.  So far it odd good.</li>
            <li> I am having lots of fun with this kit!!!! Red my lips came with my kitandI have purchased several other colors.  If you can&#x27;t find the color&lt;br /&gt;you are seeking, use two colors on one nail.  Amazing colors will occur.  Enjoy!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product. I used to go to the salon and get my nails done with bio gel, but could no longer justify the cost.  I have been doing my own nails for some tome using good quality polishes. I found OPI and Mode (a super cheap polish) to be the best wearing. purchases, using OPI top coat I could get a week, sometimes a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d decided to invest in a gel kit as they prices have dropped dramatically with more and more kits entering the market. The shop where I purchased it had three kits available and this kit, although the most expensive worked out the cheapest.  The others required additional purchases to ensure you had the all the tools (eg. The Sensationails kit does not come with gel remover, which - if you add the cost of this - made the SH it slightly cheaper. Also, SH products are generally good, so I preferred to go with the brand I knew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions, or so I thought, and my nails just wouldn&#x27;t dry. They remained sticky and soft for over an hour. I put my nails back under the lamp repeatedly with no luck. Figuring I must have done something wrong, I read through the instructions again. Yep, I&#x27;d missed a critical step. You have to wipe you nails with one of the supplied alcohol wipes. Voila, I had hard shiny nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This instruction is buried under the step 3 and as the majority of negative reviews complain about the nails not setting correctly, they should make this a separate step in the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then realised that I had mucked up a few nails while they were soft, and some had bubbled as a result. So I removed the gel on these nails following the instructions (super easy) and reapplied. No bubbles this time. The polish on one of the nails that I hadn&#x27;t fixed began to lift. I&#x27;d gotten some of the polish on my skin. I also missed the bit about sealing the ends of my nails too. So this will affect the longevity of the polish and it&#x27;s chip resistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I foundthat one coat of color was sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of key points to note, you can use the lamp with any brand gel that requires a uv lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SH gel is not as thick as the salon gels. Some salons use cheap gel products that are very thick, which is why they have to grind your nails down. My salon also offered bio gel which is much thinner and healthier for your nails. SH gel is thinner again. I&#x27;ve never used vynal or shellac, so I can&#x27;t compare the thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is shiny, but not a shiny as OPI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use regular nail polish between the top and bottom coats. You can&#x27;t cure it under the lamp, so you just need to wait until it dries completely before applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have complained that when they wiped their nails with the alcohol wipes at the end that the color is coming off. This is normal and the same thing happened occasionally when I used to go the salon. It&#x27;s bits of color that you missed getting off your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit only comes with 10 alcohol wipes, I ended up using half for my first application because I had to fix a number of nails. It&#x27;s just isopropyl. You can buy this in bottles at a chemist or hardware store and it&#x27;s much cheaper. Another reviewer recommended putting this into a spray bottle and then wiping your nails with a cloth.this is a great tip which I will do in future. My salon did this too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply the thinnest coat you can, you get a better finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend watching the SH instructional you tube video before your first application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest gripe is the box the kit comes in. It&#x27;s not designed to be used as regular storage. It was difficult to get the kit out of the box and even more difficult to get it back in. I feel that for the price, consideration should have been given to better design of the box so that it could have been used for regular storage of the kit.</li>
            <li> Lovely color. Easy to apply and dries in 30 seconds as described. Not sure how long it will last since I only applied it 2 days ago.</li>
            <li> I love these Sally Hansen products.  Salon quality manicures as a fraction of the cost of a salon.  I love doing my own nails.  The polish and the strips are long wearing and look very nice on my nails!  I have had no issues with the light cutting in and out or anything of that nature.  The three step procedure goes on just as it should.  Try to keep the base coat, color and top coat off your skin so there is no chance of peeling.</li>
            <li> This kit is not worth the money.  The bottles are small and harden fast.  My nails did not come out nice at all.</li>
            <li> My husband gave me the kit as a present when it first came out. I have tried the first time, and half of the nail polish did not cure! it came off with the alcohol wipe! Just last night I have tried it for the second time and half of my nails now have a &amp;#34;bubbly&amp;#34; layer, and it feel like it would peel off any second. I am not sure if im doing something wrong or its just the quality of the product... Overall the nail polish is shiny and looks great..</li>
            <li> This is a great concept, but you just can&#x27;t replicate the salon.  I tried multiple times and they just kept peeling off.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it.</li>
            <li> It was a good gift and works great,I only wish that the cord was a little longer other than that it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> I already owned one exactly like this one, loved it and bought this one as a Christmas gift.  She loved it too.</li>
            <li> I have saved a bundle doing my own nails and it does last! I get 8 to 10 days out of a manicure. It does take a little practice to get it on evenly. My only complaint is there is not much selection of nail colors available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my gel kit for a couple of months now and it is fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: My nails last for about two weeks, not totally chip free but good enough that they don&#x27;t bother me. The process of putting it on is easy, and the removal (which is what I was really worried about) has so far been a breeze. I&#x27;ve only had to soak my nails in the tin foil for 5 minutes instead of the recommended 15, so I haven&#x27;t noticed any wear or thinning on my nails at all. Sometimes I just do the clear top and bottom coats and then paint on top with regular nail polish and it makes my regular nail polish last for about a week. I just used it on my toes a few weeks ago and so far my toes are chip free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: The color in the bottle was not the color on the package. This didn&#x27;t bother me too much because the color it actually is, I like better than the picture. But in the future when I get more colors I have to be aware it may not always match. Also, I went swimming at the local sports club and half of the gel polish peeled off. I&#x27;d already had my nails done for a week or so, so I don&#x27;t know if that had anything to do with it but just be aware, apparently chlorine and gel nails do not mix.</li>
            <li> I love this! I also found that if you do the base coat, then whatever nail polish you want, then wait for it to dry, and apply the gel  top coat, it works just as well as using the gel polish. Frankly, I am convinced the $12 gel polishes are the same as regular nail polish. Or you can do just the base coat, top coat, and then paint whatever basic nail polish color you want over it.</li>
            <li> the product was exactly what I wanted and within deadline  was expected i like so much  the product... lll ll</li>
            <li> I destroy manicures. I rarely make it more than 24 hours with regular nail polish. I got a couple of gel manicures in salons for special events and was astonished to discover that they last on me, surviving even my weekly horseback riding.  But I hate getting my nails done. So I started poking around looking for a DIY version. I&#x27;ve had the Sally Hansen kit for about three months and love it.  There&#x27;s a definite learning curve, but if you follow the directions and use thin coats, it works quite well.  If your coats are too thick, it won&#x27;t cure properly.  But when I occasionally screw it up and a nail peels early, I just redo that one nail.  And the more I use it, the better I&#x27;m getting at it.  The limiting factor for me is nail growth, not chipping.  After two weeks, it&#x27;s grown out a lot and needs redoing.  The gel seems to protect, not damage, my nails.  My bare nails break very easily, but with the gel on, I&#x27;ve been able to grow them much longer.  The only downside I find is that the polish is difficult to properly remove.  You need to let it soak in acetone for several minutes.  I use the tin foil and cotton ball method, which somewhat speeds the process, but it&#x27;s awkward to put them on.  Scuffing up your polish with a nail file first helps, but it still takes 15 minutes or so to dissolve.  I wish they&#x27;d come up with an easier way to get it off, but other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.  The color &amp;#34;Wine Not&amp;#34; is much redder than I had expected, but I like it.</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this product for me and couldn&#x27;t wait to get it. When I finally received it, I was very disappointed. I followed the instructions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;. The nail polish didn&#x27;t dry in 30 seconds!  I actually put each hand under the UV light to dry for five minutes and it still did not dry.  My nails were sticky and wet.  Poor/false advertising and the product sucks!  I will never buy this again.  It has nothing to do with my nails, it is solely the product.  DO NOT BUY!!!  You will be wasting your money and will not be satisfied.</li>
            <li> Nail polish typically lasts on me for about a day or so before I get chipping, peeling and whatnot.  Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m hard on my nails!  The gels definitely looked better for longer, though I started to peel off the colour after about 5 days.  Still, 5 days with colour that looks perfect is rare for me so I&#x27;m impressed.  It only started coming off because I peeled it off.  The plus side is that I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s hard to remove the gel colour but I found it easy, once I started peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this kit is that it works with my other nail polishes.  Today I tried it with an OPI colour and got great results.  I think most of the effect is due to the base and top coats and not the colour.  Obviously this is great, because the gel colours don&#x27;t come in a lot of options and they cost more than my favourite brands (Essie and OPI).  I intend to always use this kit with my other polishes because I get better results than without and it makes the mani dry much faster&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: 08-08-13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;ve used this a few times now and I downgraded to 4 stars from my original 5 star ranking.  I definitely like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.  For me, it doesn&#x27;t deliver the staying power that it promises.  As I said, I enjoy using it with other nail polishes and I find the results vary.  My OPI colour worked, but another Sally Hansen colour didn&#x27;t work well.  I&#x27;ll definitely keep experimenting with it, but I have to be honest.  This is 4 stars for me.  I only recommend it if you have realistic expectations and don&#x27;t mind spending the money to give it a try</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product and thought it was a great value....but yes here comes the but....after a few days or soaking in the hot tub you guessed it.  They peel off like they were never attached.  Do like how they feel but I can get the same with about 3 layers of essie.</li>
            <li> The polish does not last long.</li>
            <li> The nails don&#x27;t dry. Tried this and cured up to 5 minutes, but still the nails don&#x27;t dry. Had to take it off, it looked terrible and I could move the gel coats around with my finger. Forget it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the $65 price tag at all. My nails have lasted a max of 4 days. It doesn&#x27;t chip, but what happends is at the tip of the nail it starts to come up, dirt gets trapped inside, then i can put a nail under the polish and pull all the nail polish off in one swoop! I have tried the product 3 times, and I have not once used the acentone to get it off. I don&#x27;t know why it keeps happening. Also, the product takes hours to dry! and the polish is so sticky that lint sticks to them (i had to put on a different top coat to stop this). It makes my nails strong and it looks great while it&#x27;s on, but it does NOT last. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Works GREAT!! Followed directions and used thin layers have used twice now and each time lasted 2 weeks with no chipping!! Probably would have lasted longer but i was ready for a color change.</li>
            <li> I love this! I followed all of the directions, curing a couple extra rounds just because I&#x27;m a little OCD about it, but I doubt it was needed. This color lasted exactly 2 weeks then when it began chipping I just peeled it off of my nails. I&#x27;ll continue using!</li>
            <li> I love getting Shellac/Gel manicures but paying $20-$40 a manicure it too much to get them as often as I&#x27;d like.  The Sally Hansen Salon Pro Gel Kit is amazing and so simple.  After using it multiple times, every manicure has lasted at least a week and then the only fingers that chip are my pointer fingers.  They didn&#x27;t even chip while tearing roofing off a garage!!  Amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great investment!!</li>
            <li> I hardly ever paint my nails, because it lasts about 12 hours before it starts chipping, no mater how many coats I use. I&#x27;ve been looking for something that would help the polish last longer, and I have to admit, I was skeptical about this product. I am pleasantly surprised!! The directions were easy to follow, and the results were great! I am on day 9, and am just now starting to see a few small chips in the polish. This was exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> For $30.00 this is a very nice little kit. It has the lites  three polishes, wipes a small nail file.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. Just be sure to wipe with the alcohol pad provided before the base coat and when the directions say apply a thin layer, they mean thin! Don&#x27;t glob it on, the color is very rich and you apply two layers. If you glob it on you&#x27;ll end up giving it a bad review because it wont set under the LED. Don&#x27;t forget to wipe with alcohol after the final coat.</li>
            <li> I read multiple reviews before buying this product. I was nervous because I&#x27;m not great at doing my nails and get my gel manicure done every two weeks at the salon. I bought this kit two weeks ago and amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I did my nails I used the color that came with the box and the only thing I did wrong was the manicure itself. As in cutting my cuticles etc. My gel polish did not chip until after 5 days. Just my right thumb polish chipped on the edges. Which is normal for all gel polish when you&#x27;re right handed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it has been two weeks and I removed the first application... My nails looked like they normally would after gel polish after two weeks from a salon! Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight I tried a new color I bought from sally Hansen called \\&quot;Shell We Dance\\&quot;... I&#x27;m so excited and this was the best investment</li>
            <li> OMG my daughter flipped out. For not much more money than just doing a polish she had GEL, and both hands and feet too. I noticed too not all those harsh chemical smells either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a teacher she has little time to do her own nails and when she does puts them through a lot of abuse. This just fits the bill for her wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I like Sally Hansen products, and this Starter Kit had decent reviews.  I read them all before I purchased it, but I followed the directions perfectly, but the polish was peeling off within 2 days!  The little included light that &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; the polish does a terrible job -- it&#x27;s cheap, and not really easy to use.  The brushes in the bottles are terrible for applying the base, polish and top coats.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or your money, this DOES NOT WORK!  And normally, Amazon takes everything back on products that you&#x27;re not happy with.  But in this case, SURPRISE, they say because the Kit has flammable items in, that it can&#x27;t be returned for credit.  They suggest throwing it away instead.  NOT HAPPY about this purchase!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this home kit until one of my friends did my nails with it and the polish was beautiful was almost 3 full weeks! I bought one for myself and it is quick and so easy to use.  I have shiny, fantastic looking nails for weeks without worry about chips or dullness.  It&#x27;s more time consuming to remove them but if you follow the directions not too difficult and a small irritation for the quality and quantity of time you have great looking nails.</li>
            <li> My nails chipped after 2 days...I&#x27;m going to buy the Gelish starter kit instead</li>
            <li> After I received my kit and applied all steps, I got nervous because the polish was still wet. Not just sticky, but wet.... So, I came to look at the reviews after the fact and got really nervous. But then, I read a very helpful review from a gal who has a friend who is a manicurist. She said you MUST use the alcohol once &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; to seal the deal. She was SO right! That did the trick. I&#x27;m on day 4 with no chips or peeling. The instructions are quite specific about having polish on your skin as it will cause the entire surface to peel or chip. I have 3 kids, lots of dishes, and a pool and my nails with normal polish rarely last 2 days... So, being on day 4 already, I&#x27;m quite optimistic. My advice, follow the instructions. Use the buffer on your nails, clean them, then finish with the alcohol- you can use what you have at home if you run out of wipes. My guess is user error on some of the really bad reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 12 (hand pic in front of white wall). You be the judge. I&#x27;m still happy. :)</li>
            <li> great kit. Nail polish doesn&#x27;t last as long as it&#x27;s supposed to though.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and looks nice, no peeling, and is shiny. This is not a good replacement for Salon gel nails though, I have weak nails and two nails broke the first week I used this product. I will buy and use again but only for toe nails. I will be going back to nail salon for my finger nails.</li>
            <li> The lamp is great, and so are the base and top coats. The color I did not like so much (I got the wine color), it looks a little outdated. But I use it with other nail colours and the results are always great. I have to say it doesn&#x27;t really lasts 2 weeks, I get about 7 to 8 days, but that&#x27;s plenty for me. Overall, I really like this product.</li>
            <li> The dryes seems to be operational - at least all LED are lit. But the kit nail polish is not dry even after 20 cycles!</li>
            <li> This started to chip and peel within four days.  It took less time for this to chip then regular polish.  And once it&#x27;s chipped you can&#x27;t easily touch it up.  You have to spend twenty minutes taking it off just to go through the whole process to redo.  Total rip-off!!</li>
            <li> Just finished my nail with this starter kit about an hour ago, and this is my experience so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I bought the \\&quot;wine not\\&quot; color kit and the color on my nail is about 95% close to the color on the box. I like the shiny clean look it gives me compared to the traditional nail polish. I also like the fact that it will save me money in the long run compared to going to the salon every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  But here are the reasons why I hesitate to give 5 stars. Since the kit itself says \\&quot;Salon Gel Polish,\\&quot; I expect to have salon quality finish. But I don&#x27;t. It doesn&#x27;t look as good as to the nail salon I been going to.  It looks less shiny after I finished my last step which is to clean it with the nail cleanser pad.  Also, as I wiped my nails with the cleanser pad I saw some red color on the pad which tells me that the color was not locked properly. Not sure why this happened. I followed the instruction carefully and even put my nails under the LED lamp twice as long as it recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Overall is worth the money if I have to compare it to going to the salon. Is worth the investment if you want your nails to look good for two weeks without the worry of chipping. However, it takes about an hour to get them done which in my opinion is very time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Anyway, this is my experience with this product shortly after I applied it. I will update my reviews within 2 weeks if I see any changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my recent update about the product. Is the 10th day that I use this product on my finger and there is a big chip on my right thumb and a small chip on my right index finger. I can tell some of the gels are slightly peeling off at the corner of my other fingers.  So compare to the gel manicure that I get in the salon, the Sally Hansen Gel kits does not last as long as the ones I get in the Salon.  Still, I do get lots of compliment from my friends and hair stylist, therefore I am keeping my 4 stars for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a tip to safe some money from this product. Instead of buying the Nail Cleanser Pad refills (cost around $5.00 for 20pads) buy a bottle of the highest concentrate Isopropyl alcohol at your local pharmacy or retailers for about $1.70 a bottle and use it with a clean soft cotton cloth. This will replace the Nail Cleanser Pad and save you at least $20.00 or more in the long run. Also, in the nail salon I see them putting the alcohol in a spray bottle and spray them on the customers&#x27; finger and wipe them with soft cotton cloth.</li>
            <li> I love gel nails but who has time to go to the salon? not to mention $30-40 a visit. So when I saw this kit, I was very excited. The shine lasts and lasts but around the 5th day, some of my polish are starting to peel off. No worries, I just fix it my self.&lt;br /&gt;Because professional salon gel does peel too and if you go back and ask them to fix it for you.....well, they are not very thrill to help you with it.  So I like the fact that I was able to redo that one nail by my self, took me about 5min. and done!&lt;br /&gt;All in all for a first timer it was a great result. Tip for removing, if you use finger condom instead of foil paper, it is much, much easy and better. I am ready to buy more colors. I just wish it is cheaper.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this kit to anyone who wants the gel nail experience without having to go to the salon.  I found the instructions to be very clear and the different layers of polish went on easily.  It takes me 30 minutes to do a complete manicure but the best part is my nails are completely dry as soon as I am done!  The polish really does last me a full 2 weeks without chipping or scratching.  In fact, I usually have to redo my nails because they&#x27;ve grown out, not because the polish looks bad!  The removal process is kind of a pain (only because it takes about 15 minutes of soaking the nail in the acetone remover) but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for the longevity of the manicure.  I have given myself 4 manicures so far and they have all turned out great. I also found more colors to try locally and I&#x27;ve been happy with those as well!</li>
            <li> Nails come out looking gorgeous but I have to place them under the light about 6 times per layer. Even after I&#x27;m completely done it feels gooey so I  just go to bed and in the morning they are all set. Lasts longer than any store bought nail polish I have tried. Peels off easily when you are ready to take it off. Very shiny and smooth; I get lots of compliments on them. My sister in law got the same one and she said she only has to do the light once so I&#x27;m not sure if mine is defective or its just my nails (I layer it on thin).</li>
            <li> I so love it but I only give it a 4 star since the bottles for gel polish and others that comes with it are really so small but overall I really love my nail gel polish... I will never pay for an outrageous charge in a salon.. I feel like a pro even my husband said, that I am doing a better job than a salon...</li>
            <li> 8 days chip/peel free, which is UNHEARD of for my nails because I&#x27;m super rough on them (usually regular nail polish + top coat lasts less than a few hours before chipping). Probably could&#x27;ve gone longer if I hadn&#x27;t been fidgety and messing with the one corner of the one nail that was starting to show signs of peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions to a T and then cured everything a little extra, so that could be key, but I would recommend this to system to anyone! For the cost of 1.5 salon gel manicures, it is way worth it! Hoping that the lights stay good for a while so I get a chance to try out some of the different colors I bought :)</li>
            <li> this kit at the store is over 50 dollars! The polishes are awesome and it even comes with nail polish remover and little strips to take the topping of. The light works great, no need to spend 100 dollars on something that works the same.</li>
            <li> Item as described! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Merchant made good on my purchase thank you</li>
            <li> I absolutey loved this product for the first couple weeks. Then unfortunately developed a allergic reaction to it. My fingernail beds started turning black and my cuticles became very itcy and inflamed. I wish they could invent a new product that doesn&#x27;t cause this issue!!!!! I would definitely try it again if they did!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am new to doing my own gel manicures and was reluctant to try, but based on several reviews chose this kit to get started. I just received mine a few days ago and have already used it several times on myself and others. It comes exactly as advertised and is super easy for a beginner to use! I&#x27;ve used both the gel polish that comes with the kit and my own regular nail polish, and both work great! Just remember, if you&#x27;re using regular nail polish between the gel layers, do NOT put on the gel top coat until the nail polish has fully dried.</li>
            <li> Love being able to do my nails at home!!! I will never pay to have them done again!!!!</li>
            <li> I love to have my nails done but don&#x27;t go very often because of the expense.  I opt for gel or shelac over acrylic because it doesn&#x27;t destroy my nails.  I had been comparing the options to do it myself and pricing the lights and polish.  I saw this in the store and it was priced so reasonably that I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  It took me no longer than 15 minutes to do my nails and they look great! When I purchased this it was not yet available on Amazon.  I&#x27;m glad to see it here now!</li>
            <li> I used this on a Sunday morning and it lasted about seven days. By far much longer than many other polishes I&#x27;ve tried. But doesn&#x27;t last two weeks</li>
            <li> Wanted, desperately, for this to work. I love Shellac manicures. I can&#x27;t justify the expense every two weeks. But this..... it didn&#x27;t cut it. So far the lamp is doing ok, but the polish, even when cured for several sets of 30 seconds is soft and pliable. It peels off easily and does not protect my nails. I have weak, thin nails and need a strong base for them to grow. They still tear with this on and that is unacceptable. Will be trying another brand of the gel polish in hopes for better results.</li>
            <li> at least the polish works. as far as the uv light, your better off using the sun! I have no idea how these ladies are getting it on thin enough. I have gone as far as 5 cycles on each &amp;#34;barely there&amp;#34; application and still had wet sticky nails... No matter how thin I applied it, I got the same results. Had a friend who works at a beauty supply store pick one up for 60 bucks and in less then 5 minutes, these products are amazine! they protect the nail from breakage so they grow nice and long, they are healthy and the best part, I rarely need a manicure until they grow out long enough to look bad where they meet the skin.</li>
            <li> After paying $30 for the gel polish in the salon every 2-3 weeks, it wasn&#x27;t hard to justify the $70 price (at Rite Aid). Just used it for the first time and am thrilled. No more difficult than regular nail polish to apply and no more waiting for them to be REALLY dry to go about your business. If they look this good my first time using it, I can only assume I&#x27;ll get better/faster at it. My advice? If you&#x27;re on the fence about trying it? Go for it!</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target and I love it! It looks as good as a salon no-chip manicure. I&#x27;ve been waiting for a nail product like this!</li>
            <li> Crap! Came off in like 4 days</li>
            <li> Love this! I save money by doing my nails myself and they look like I went to a salon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mixed, MAINLY GREAT, experience; my toe nails lasted 3 weeks!!!  My fingers have lasted 4-11 days, depending on how well I followed the instructions and how hard I used them (cleaning dishes, washing hair, ect).  As of 03-2013, Target has this product for $65; a much better deal, in-store or online.</li>
            <li> My first gel mani set. They work great, I cure my nails under the lamp in 3 increments on 30 secs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I feel that it comes off earlier than the 2 weeks mark. Price was good, I might try another brand.</li>
            <li> This polish can, in fact last two weeks-but you have to follow the instructions EXACTLY. Push your cuticles back, lightly file the surfaces(I use one of those fine grit blocks from Salles and just run it over the top once or twice. Not major filing), clean your nails with alcohol or acetone, don&#x27;t get any of the base, polish or topcoat on the skin around your nails or the cuticle. Just put each coat on carefully and use thin coats. I usually keep each coat under the light an extra time or two. I put on the last coat a little, tiny bit thicker than the rest and kind of scrape the end of each nail with the brush to seal the edges. Looks so wonderful and lasts a long time. I was paying $25 plus tip at the salon twice per month, so this is definitely worth it to me. I just purchased the color &#x27;So Much Fawn\\&quot; separately and I think it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s pink but not too pink and just dark enough without being overly dramatic.</li>
            <li> This was simple to use, long-lasting, beautiful shine and color!  I love it and have purchased/used other polish colors too.</li>
            <li> After having this product for while I have determined that it&#x27;s not that great.  The polish peels off the nails really easy!  At first I thought it was great, however, I don&#x27;t even use it anymore and it has become a $50 mistake.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading all of the reviews here.  Finally, an at-home product that is just as good as the salon!  I followed the instructions very carefully, thin coats, 30 seconds each hand (and thumb) and I was done in 20 minutes.  It looks and feels exactly like a salon gel manicure.  I used the shell color, and it did not streak or bubble.  Looking forward to trying new colors.  I highly recommend this product. You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Good starter kit but i think the base and top coat suck because mine always chip after 2 weeks. going to buy new ones of those and see what  happens. otherwise it&#x27;s still a good starter kit that comes with what you need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always in a rush to dry my nail polish.  In the process, there is always a smudge or a scratch on one of my nails. Problem solved with this LED lamp! Nail polish dries in less than a minute. -Thanx</li>
            <li> First just let me say that I love this product. If you have a steady hand and are good at painting your nails yourself, it goes on beautifully. The bad news is that it&#x27;s not quite the professional-grade stuff you&#x27;d get at a nail salon so it doesn&#x27;t last quite as long (usually about 1.5 weeks). At that point the polish becomes very easy to pull off because it&#x27;s a little more rubbery than the professional stuff. Personally, I like that it&#x27;s a little less intense on my nails because they seem to be healthier and I don&#x27;t feel the need to give them a week or two off after I remove the polish. It&#x27;s also easier and takes less time to soak off with polish remover which I appreciate. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I am an avid shellac/gel polish user. I usually go to my local nail salon and have it done for about $25-30... But within 5 days it chips or peels.  I work in the health care field so i am constantly washing my hands and I feel that 5-6 days is acceptable with all the use of chemicals for massages and cleaning. The gel/shellac mani&#x27;s are far better than a normal mani b/c in 1 day it would chip b/c of handwashing constantly. THe Sally Hansen gel polish system is AWESOME.  It pays for itself in 2 visits... and you can touch up whenever convenient.  FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS TO A T! You can&#x27;t go wrong...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE ONLY downfall is that the colors on their own are too pricey.  I hope they come out with many more colors and make the replacement pads/alcohol reasonable. I may just buy a $1 bottle of alcohol, since you use 1-3 pads a mani.</li>
            <li> I go to the salon every 2-3 weeks to get my gel nails redone and it costs $35 every time PLUS its about an hour long process. But, I love the convenience and how beautiful the nails are when they are done...so I keep going back. When I saw this, I thought it was worth a try, even if it saved me two trips to the salon it would have paid for itself. I am so excited because this actually works! And you do it yourself and it looks just like a professional job (if you are decent at painting your own nails), and it lasts !!! Also, it takes so much less time than at the salon, i can do both hands in less than 10 minutes!  I did my first application and like another reviewer, a few of the nails peeled off in the first 24hrs, so you just have to get used to how much to apply. Also, I leave my nails under the light for 2 30second  times (the light goes off after 30 seconds and the instructions say another round is not necessary), just because they still seem tacky after only 1 time under the light and I think they peeled off the first time because each layer was too thick and didnt harden properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this set! If you&#x27;re not bog on sally henson products, I know Orly makes a Gel nail kit too very similar to this and they have more colors options.</li>
            <li> Dont last as long as advertized only one week</li>
            <li> I love the look of no-chip but I hate spending $60 bucks a pop! This stuff looks as good as the salon stuff and works as easily as it claims. For all my frugal fashionistas I highly recommend this product but YOU MUST FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!! Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> my manicure lasts for at least two weeks and now i don&#x27;t have to go to the salon and pay 30-40 dollars each time i want it done!  sally hansen does not have a large range of colors so i just buy other brands and use it with their system and it works just fine!</li>
            <li> You have to push the button twice to make sure each layer of polish is &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; enough and the polish is poor quality. It buckled and made this ugly wrinkle effect in my nails. Cheap price, but the only functional item in the set is the light. Gelish is a great gel polish brand...go straight to that and skip the Sally Hansen</li>
            <li> Love everything about it! Remember to file your nail a little bit so the polish can hold longer, if not peels off too easily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this system and gel nails in general. I definitely have NOT gotten salon quality results (I can typically get 3 weeks out of a shellac manicure from the salon) but this system definitely lasts longer than regular nail polish... and with instant drying, I will never go back to regular polish. With this system I will get at least a week chip free on most nails. One or two may have issues but because it&#x27;s my own polish, it&#x27;s super easy to fix a nail when I get home. The other notable benefit is the minimized damage to my nail beds. A shellac manicure at the salon destroys my nails by the time I try to properly remove the polish; there&#x27;s no way around the nail bed damage. This system (I&#x27;m sure it has more to do with the paint not being salon quality or the prep prior to paint) doesn&#x27;t peel my nail bed layers to the same extent, which to me seems like a more sustainable way to have pretty nails.</li>
            <li> I have been paying $35 every 2 weeks for this same manicure but never again. If you have gotten gel manicure before then this kit is simple and probaby what you r looking for. I bought a kit of manicure tools to go with it to help trim and push back cuticles. It is important that none of the polish gets on ur skin. Follow directions and you will have salon worthy gel manicure.Manicure lasts 1.5-2 weeks if done correctly.</li>
            <li> I love when my nails are done.  My current lifestyle does not lend itself to sitting around for hours, drying.  This stuff is amazing, to say the least.  I&#x27;m on my second manicure.  The first one lasted through 4 bathroom cleanings, 8 bags of pulled ivy, mowed and trimmed the yard, 5 tax returns, 90 hours of computer work, I changed the faucet on my kitchen sink, 36 loads of laundry and washed 2 cars.  After 14 days, I finally took it off (easy peasy) because the grown out portion was starting to look tacky.  Not one chip and the shine was almost as brilliant as when it was applied.  I didn&#x27;t use the color that came with it (wine not) but purchased It&#x27;s So Fawn.  From the name and the picture on the internet, box and cap, I figured it was going to be a pale brownish tone.  Not so.  It&#x27;s pink.  A very pretty pink, I must say, and I&#x27;ve gotten tons of complements.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that the color changes slightly as the days go by.  All in all, I have to say I&#x27;m amazed and very pleased with the whole system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one point, when I told someone that I used the Gel polish, they looked aghast and asked if I&#x27;d heard all the health warnings and I admitted that I hadn&#x27;t.  Being a Google nut, I looked it up and it amounts to concerns that were quickly rebuffed about the UV rays from the curing process (far too brief to cause any harm, but if you want, use SPF lotion or fingertip-less gloves) and issues of fungus under the nails since they are on so long (something I still think is a huge bonus!).  I say, just make sure you have nice hygiene and you&#x27;re inspecting them between manicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE.....I left the last manicure on for just short of 4weeks.  This stuff stays on like crazy!  Tiniest chip on the tips of my pointer and &#x27;bird&#x27; fingers, but that&#x27;s only because I put them a liiiiittle too close to the Sawzall, but that&#x27;s a story in itself.  Soaked the gel off (takes the 15 minutes, as advised), and after a nice scrubbing and some lotion, my nails seem to be no worse for the wear.  No abnormal brittleness or drying.  Bought a set for my daughter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE of the Update......daughter LOVES this, too.  Do yourself a favor and order the Graham HandsDown Nail Wraps for super simple, mess free removal.  Wonderful!to be no worse for the wear.  No abnormal brittleness or drying.  Bought a set for my daughter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE of the Update......daughter LOVES this, too.  Do yourself a favor and order the Graham HandsDown Nail Wraps for super simple, mess free removal.  Wonderful!</li>
            <li> This kit has already paid for itself.  I love it!  Easy to use. I don&#x27;t have to run to the salon if the color chips, i just fix it myself in a few minutes.  You can use any brand of gel polish.</li>
            <li> The first time that I used the gel nails they looked great but started peeling off the second day.  I had a big event coming and I decided to try again, thinking that I only needed my nails to look good for one night.  Well - they looked great for fifteen days! And most of those days I was doing heavy garden work so they really got a test.  I don&#x27;t know what I did wrong that first time but since then I have had no further trouble and they have lasted at least twelve days each time.  My natural nails are badly ridged and this is the first product that I have ever used that makes them smooth and beautiful.</li>
            <li> This product does an okay job.  My nails started chipping on day 8; which is still longer than regular polish.  Light stopped working after 4th use.  Since this item is not returnable I went to Wal-Mart to see if I could just buy a replacement light.  I couldn&#x27;t so I attempted to repurchase another starter kit.  Went to the register and the product came up as a recalled product, they immediately pulled all of them from the shelf.  Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first.  I love the gel/shellac look.  I hate the price I have to pay in a salon.  I love the idea of being able to do it at home at a fraction of the cost.  A fair amount of people have negative things about this product, but at basically the cost of two pedicures, I thought what could hurt?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the greatest thing.  Ever.  Seriously ladies.  It may take a try or two (I had a hard time at first getting the polish to go on very thinly), but you must get one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a manicure that looks identical to one I got two months ago, and this set was cheaper than it cost me to get that manicure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my feet as well.  It works just fine for that!</li>
            <li> I love gorgeous gel nails, but hate going to the nail salon to get them done. If you know how to paint your own nails, this is a god send! Works great not to mention you will save $$. Don&#x27;t be afraid to cure your nails an additional 30 secs after applying the first and second color coat. After nearly 2 weeks my nails are still nice. Usually when I have traditional nail polish on, my nails will look like hell after 4-5 days. Not anymore. I love this product. Thank you Sally Hansen!</li>
            <li> I love the gel nails and saves me from going to the manicurist.  I wish it came with separate primer, because that keeps the polish more intact for a longer time.  I purchased it separately and it works great.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of these at-home kits, but after getting my first professional gel manicure I decided that since I do my nails once a week, if they lasted even a little longer than that it would be worth it. I&#x27;ve had this kit since August and I will NEVER go back to regular polish! It works amazingly well. I&#x27;ve bought about a dozen different colored polishes since then and I&#x27;m still using the original base and top coats. I actually haven&#x27;t used the red color that it came with - red just isn&#x27;t my color - but I gave it to my mother and she loved it. The removal process can be a bit of a pain but still worth it. I&#x27;ve left polish on for 3 weeks at a time with barely any chips.</li>
            <li> This kit is amazing ... super easy this was my first try and I think it came out pretty good I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better with time</li>
            <li> All I got were empty bottles and could not return it. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> This is the same kit sold in stores at a much better price.  I love it!!!!  I followed the directions on the kit and my manicures turn out fabulous.  They will last for a solid two weeks with very little wear.  Way better than regular polish and cheaper than a salon.  Have bought numerous colors since my original purchase.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The trick to take the sticky feeling n to dry nails is after you use the lamp wipe with a cotton pad with alcohol. ( rubbing) your nails will last great!</li>
            <li> This restaurant owner/chef/bartender is a BELIEVER! I have never ever been able to keep polish on and unchipped for even 24 hours. I really DID get 2 weeks of wear from just the normal application of this product. I did need to &amp;#34;tip out&amp;#34; a few nails after 4 or 5 days but that&#x27;s not such a big deal. I have a light-activated gel kit that a paid $70 for. It worked just as well as this product BUT the damage I did to my nails trying to scrape it off wasn&#x27;t worth it. If you&#x27;ve had trouble maintaining your manicures I can highly recommend investing some money in this product.</li>
            <li> SUPER!!! Just as expected, easy system, mirror shine, a MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li> Love this, works great! I typically cute my polish for double the time the instructions say, and i have had perfect results every time</li>
            <li> This product generates a nice look but does not last more than 1 week on my nails.  I do like it and will use it again.</li>
            <li> Tries this and found it easy to manage.  Nails looks beautiful in know time. You will be pleased with the professional looking job when you&#x27;re done.  Kit came with very clear and specific directions.  There are several color choices to choose from.  My favorite is the wine color.  I would suggest you give your nails some time in between removal and the next application as you should with a salon application.</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the color (Wine Not). A metallic, pinky red that is very flattering. This was my first time doing a gel manicure, so I was a little nervous I would mess it up. But I followed the easy directions, and had no problem! Now I just need to get a few more colors! :)</li>
            <li> Love this kit, do my own nails all the time and this lasts as long or longer then the $30 salon job, easy and quick to do so don&#x27;t be intimidated.</li>
            <li> I read so many reviews on this starter kit and decided to buy it. I LOVE IT! Whenever I get the time to do my nails, they get done by the kit, even with other gel polishes from other brands, the outcome is great. My only problem is that I can&#x27;t keep the polish on for more than a week because I want to change it so fast. This is when I just peel the gel polish off, which is not recommended. Otherwise the polish lasts almost 2 full weeks or longer if I do light work with my hands. The LED lamp is small so only 4 fingers fit, but doing the thumbs at the same time is no problem.</li>
            <li> 12/15/12: I did my nails with this one week ago, and my nails are still in perfect condition. I used it on Sunday, but Monday morning the polish peeled off of 3 nails when I took a shower. I had put too much polish on them, and it did not stick well (obviously) plus the polish kind of looked \\&quot;bubbled\\&quot; under the polish. Part of the polish came off, and I peeled off the rest. I cleaned the nail with some polish remover (given with the kit), and redid them, being careful to put thin even coats on. It worked perfectly fine, and all 10 nails have held up well since. I am brutal on my stuff - wash dishes, dig plants, use my nails to scratch up stuff, etc, and the polish has stayed on for a week now.  I bought this at Rite Aid, and am happy to see it available on Amazon too :). Hopefully more colors will be available soon! This is very easy to use and like normal nail polish. Recommendations from my experience: shake the heck out of the polish bottles, do 4 finger nails and then the thumb nail separately, use thin (but sufficient) coats, follow all steps. You need to use the top coat for it to get hard. If they do bubble and peel like mine did, it is very easy to redo.</li>
            <li> This product is truly as advertised.  My nails turned out beautifully, have lasted for 10 days, and still going strong.  I have not had a single chip and the shine is still glossy.  If you are on the fence about investing in this product, go for it.  You will not regret it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE MY KIT! There was a downfall...my kit claimed to have been NEW, but when i opened it the step 1 and 3 had red on the brush. It had obviously been used. For the price, I am okay with that. If it has been used once, JUST SAY SO! I love the results, especially since these kits sell for more than this at drugstores.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother for a Mother&#x27;s Day gift. She uses it every 2 weeks and hasn&#x27;t complained yet.</li>
            <li> shinny, no smuges. Really looks like a salon manicure . Might take a manicure or two to get the hang of it . But so far looks amazing .</li>
            <li> This nail polish is absolutely amazing!  It actually stays perfect for ten days with no chipping, etc.  Use two coats of the polish and then one coat of the top sealer.  The sealer makes the color &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; and gives nails a beautiful finish.  I was so surprised that it came off so easily with regular nail polish remover and my nails were not stained in the least.  My first try was with the beautiful blue to go with my uniform.  I took it off today and am going with a pretty pink for next week.  Can use the same top sealer with all the colors so only need to purchase one bottle of sealer and then a couple of your favorite colors.  You will absolutely enjoy this product so much.</li>
            <li> I love this n it works perfectly no more going to the nail salon jijijiji I can do it myself lol..</li>
            <li> The light work great for two applications after that it will not cure my nails no matter how long I wait. Waste of my time and money. I will recommend to spend a little more for a better light</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but decided to give this product a try.  I am not one for painting my nails because they are messed up 5 minutes after I&#x27;ve finished them.  This kit is AWESOME.  5 minutes after finishing my manicure I was in the basement rearranging furniture- not so much as a smudge!  I&#x27;m in love.  Granted, it&#x27;s gel and therefore not good to keep on your nails constantly.  But to have a salon quality manicure without having to pay $40 EACH time... this setup is WELL worth it!!!  Plus, if you have a few friends that have them too- share the nail polish colors and you&#x27;re all set!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this kit in May. I used three times with good results.  Sadly the led light has already stopped working.  Just plugged in and pushed the button,  no lights turned on! Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> Just purchaaed today at CVS for $70, but had 25% off coupon, so was less than $60 with the tax. Dries fast with the light, says to dry once, I did it twice to make sure. What I really like is the polish doesnt set without the light, so you can take your time evening it out, even on the second coat and top coat. Normal polishes I have to rush thru second coat so as to not ruin the first coat, which often ends up too thick &amp; takes forever to dry. Also, when u r done, it&#x27;s dry not only to the touch, but I tried to dent it in an unnoticeable spot and it didn&#x27;t dent. Also didnt get the sheet marks on them for going to sleep when I thought they were dry, but werent dry all the way through. If they last 1 week without chipping badly, I will be happy. First time, start to finish in under one hour.  Gave 4 stars only bc cant review longevity bc just did them last nite.</li>
            <li> This is amazing!  I was originally going to purchase the RED CARPET Brand, but when I saw this I ended up changing my mind.  I know and love Sally Hansen products, I like the polish color included better and the LED Light was much better.  Its a plug in light (compared to the battery powered in the Red Carpet kit) and it cures in half the time!  I did mine last night and did both my girls today.  Both their nails were completed in less than 30 mins.&lt;br /&gt;I did purchase the Red Carpet Brand polish because it was on close out and 50% off.  My daughter chose to do that and it worked just as great as the Sally Hansen that was included.  The only problem I&#x27;ve found is purchasing items in the kit as they get used.  The cleaning pads included are just alcohol so I&#x27;m going to find something besides cotton swabs to use to wipe down before and after manicure.&lt;br /&gt;Granted I only used last night for the first time but I don&#x27;t have one chip, scratch or line anywhere!  I had given up on polishing my nails years ago because I&#x27;d go to the time and trouble and less than 3 hrs later they&#x27;d be all chipped and cracked, no matter what I used or prepped with.  I can already tell this will last quite a while.  I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase.  I bought mine from Fred Meyer (a kroger) store because of my employee discount so I only paid $54 and with 4 extra polishes it was $76 total!</li>
            <li> This kit works great. I was a little iffy at first based on some negative comments, but I wanted to see for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you follow the instructions carefully and do exactly as it specifies, your nails will come out great. My nails turned out to be shiny, but not as shiny as I hoped they&#x27;d be, but nevertheless, the shine was present and beautiful. The color, Wine Not, was as expected and very pretty. When I went to wipe my nails with the nail pads, I could see a slight faint color from my nails come off on the nail pads, which worried me a bit, even though I followed instructions carefully and even cured my nails under the uv light twice as long as instructed. But the color was still there, and looked glossy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product is worth the money! Definitely a beautiful at home gel manicure and I recommend this kit to any woman. 5 stars all the way.</li>
            <li> Love this home gel nail polish system!  Easy to use. I recommend longer curing time that suggested. I usually cure each hand for 2 minutes (4 x 30 seconds) and find that my polish lasts the full two weeks tho way. Also I recommend completing one hand before starting the second. I have shared my love of this product with everyone.</li>
            <li> Works really well, and much less expensive than a salon!</li>
            <li> Got it as a gift. The box was a bit damaged, but everything inside seemed to be perfectly fine. My sister loves it either way and says that the manicure lasts her a few days to a week. Unfortunately, she says that it takes her more than two coats sometimes to get enough color on there so that it&#x27;s not transparent (she said this about a color other than the one that came with the kit that was also sally hansen gel polish, so I cannot vouch for the one that came with it) :/ other than that, though, she seems quite satisfied with it and gets numerous compliments on it daily on how beautiful and professionally done it looks. It comes with everything that you need, and even had coupons (not sure if they were expired or not since it was a gift, lol) and the polish at Wal-Mart is available for about 10 dollars or so.Would buy again :]</li>
            <li> I plug this up to use for the first time and the lamp did not work. The on button came on immediately but none of the lamps came on. No wonder it was such a good price.</li>
            <li> Today I used my Sally Hansen Salon Pro Gel Starter Kit for the second time since getting it. I love it! It&#x27;s so simple to use and the polish lasts so much longer than normal nail polish. Normally, regular nail polish lasts maybe a day on my nails (normally less than a day). I am active and I use my hands a lot, but I still wanted pretty nails without having to go to the salon. They tend to put the gel polish on too thick and when it cures with the LED light, it feels like it&#x27;s burning my fingers! Not fun! And they charge me $30 every time I go in to get my nails done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two more colors yesterday and tried one of them out tonight. LOVE IT! One was &amp;#34;blue my mind&amp;#34; and the other was &amp;#34;glisten up!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first color, the Wine Not included in this kit, didn&#x27;t last as long as I had expected it to. It lasted about 6 days. But, I did go camping/hiking/vacationing during that time, so it&#x27;s not really a surprise that it didn&#x27;t last two weeks. I&#x27;m hoping this color will last a little longer. But, even if it lasts only a week until it chips, it&#x27;s still worth it in my book!</li>
            <li> Originally I thought this kit was expensive, but I got a $10 voucher online, and then bought it on Senior&#x27;s Day at Shoppers Drug Mart which gave me another 20% off... so for around fifty bucks I got the whole kit. The only colour they had left was the \\&quot;red my lips\\&quot; and I&#x27;m not big on red nail polish but figured for the price I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually for me, nail polish only lasts around three days before it starts peeling off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions to the letter, except for adding some little nail art flowers before adding the top coat. It looked amazing, I couldn&#x27;t believe the shine, almost looks like plastic nails. It took around an hour to do both hands, but I figured it would be faster the next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bye the next day, the flowers were falling off. I picked them off, sanded the nails lightly with the little emery board, added another coat of red polish, and the topcoat again and voila... they were perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They lasted two weeks and three days, and that included swimming every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am HIGHLY impressed!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a gel nail kit for home because I don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune getting to the salon to do it. I purchased this kit and boy it works so good! Nails were dry and ready to go in five minutes ( after I got all the coats on and cured). Fast, and not messy at all! Easy to figure out and it&#x27;s solid! A great product. I just used it today, so the two weeks we will see how it goes.</li>
            <li> Just used my kit for the first time.  I had tried Nutri Nail Gel Perfect first so I thought I had the \\&quot;thin coat\\&quot; thing down but still having trouble with it.  The problem, for me, seems to be the brush.  Both brands have rather full bristles on the end of the brush, which naturally holds lots of polish.  So it works against you when you need to do thin coats. I see a couple teeny bubbles on two nails, nothing real noticeable.  The Wine Not color is more of a fire engine red than a wine.  I wish there were more color choices in the starter kits; you get either really dark or really light (too light) colors to chose from.  I like that everything is included in the kit, even the cord for the light which I was not able to tell from looking at the box online.  My order came much faster than I expected, too.  Made me happy because my nails look good for the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  it&#x27;s been five days and no chips, nails still shiny and look like I just did them.  I haven&#x27;t been babying them:  been washing dishes, cleaning, pulling weeds without gloves and they look great so I ordered two new colors of gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m middle-aged so this amazes me.  I&#x27;m from the generation of \\&quot;regular\\&quot; polish where, no matter how careful you were, the polish chipped and shrunk back from the free edge almost immediately, not to mention took forever to dry if you applied more than one coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/10/13: the plug on the cord to the light has come apart, exposing the wiring inside, after two uses.  I don&#x27;t let it plugged in since it&#x27;s a week or two until it&#x27;s needed again and a little light glows inside.  So I thought it should be unplugged between uses and the plug fell apart.  I&#x27;m not happy but I used elec tape and put it together again.</li>
            <li> exactly what was advertised of shown on the website, packaging was good, very pleased with the product. Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it but my nails didn&#x27;t last as long as when I go to the nail salon.</li>
            <li> This product has the potential to be very good.  Unfortunately it takes a lot of practice and skill to get it right.  Also, if you have short nails, do not waste your money.  In order for the manicure to last, you have to make sure you paint the free edge of the nail but not the skin underneath.  This is hard to do with short nails!  So the manicure ends up lasting a little longer than regular polish.</li>
            <li> I like it. I&#x27;m still getting used to it and trying to do &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; layers as instructed. It&#x27;s fabulous for a quick nail treatment. No setting a salon time and having to wait forever. It&#x27;s even more convenient than regular polish due to the fast setting time. And it does help the nails as it&#x27;s no chip. I have been using a different color that did not come with the kit. No problems.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for almost 2 years now and I&#x27;m still loving it!  I ran out of the cleanser pads and removal a long time ago but found suitable substitutes.&lt;br /&gt;I prep my nails by:&lt;br /&gt;wiping them down with drug store acetone;&lt;br /&gt;apply base coat followed by light;&lt;br /&gt;apply color coat #1 followed by light;&lt;br /&gt;apply color coat #2 followed by light;&lt;br /&gt;apply top coat followed by light;&lt;br /&gt;and then wipe with cotton ball soaked with baby oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically get 7 days wear before my nails peel.  However any gel polish or acrylic I&#x27;ve had applied at a salon only lasts a week when I&#x27;m told I should be able to get 2 weeks wear our of it.  Apparently I have oily nail plates so 7 days wear is fine by me.  I&#x27;m also a frequent hand washer.  Overall I am very please with this product and found it to be well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The Product works the only thing I don&#x27;t like is I got two top coats instead one one base coat and a top coat.</li>
