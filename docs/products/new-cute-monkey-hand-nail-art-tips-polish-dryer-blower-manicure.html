            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work exceptionally well, but is okay as a novelty.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong blow when it blows on your nails.</li>
            <li>it cause it was cute more than its functions.</li>
            <li>I just got it because it was cute</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something cute or a collectable</li>
            <li>She got a good kick out of it, so it was worth it for that alone.</li>
            <li>cheaply made but cute took a while to get her</li>
            <li>I knew the air wasn&#x27;t going to be really strong</li>
            <li>I asked the company that i would think that i should get another one for free and</li>
            <li>This is a cute gift, but isn&#x27;t really useful.</li>
            <li>The grandchildren were excited to receive their Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>The overall idea is great, and for $0.50 this was well worth it.</li>

            <li>I like because it dries your nails quick</li>

            <li>If you like monkey items then you&#x27;ll enjoy this:-)</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t blow enough air, but it is super cute</li>
            <li>Great as funny or cute gift for someone who collects monkey things, but not worthwhile as a nail dryer.</li>
            <li>It just simply looks cute.</li>
            <li>It shipped a little quicker than I thought it would and made a great stocking stuffer for our 12 year old girl.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to try out the monkey yet because it takes two AAA batteries which I do not posses at the moment.</li>
            <li>Battery powered without much power even though it works as described.</li>
            <li>I really hope it works.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have high expectations.</li>
            <li>But it is cost-effective and cute for little girls.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work and when it does it barely blows air.</li>
            <li>This item is small, but cute.  </li>
            <li>This little monkey is so adorable, but does not work well at all.</li>
            <li>:) the price wasn&#x27;t bad t all so overall  am pleased</li>
            <li>I order this monkey for my girl friend who saw it on pinterest and really wanted one.</li>
            <li>The product is as expected and works very well</li>
            <li>I was able to glue the broken item back on but the dryer would not operate.</li>

            <li> I order this monkey for my girl friend who saw it on pinterest and really wanted one.</li>
            <li> The product is as expected and works very well</li>
            <li> I was able to glue the broken item back on but the dryer would not operate.</li>
            <li> it should be express shipping (especially since i waited so long and its after Christmas).</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t blow enough to dry anything ...</li>
            <li> My nails air dry faster than this monkey can blow</li>
            <li> The monkey does not actually blow out of the mouth, but instead out of a little slit where his hands are.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, which is what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The gift came after Christmas (it took 38 days to get to my house) , when i opened the bag it looked like someone had crushed the box.</li>
            <li> so the blowing power is minimal.</li>
            <li> It only dries one finger at a time and you have to push down on the little platform for it to work.</li>
            <li> and the mouth hole is where the air comes from so it doesn&#x27;t cover a very wide area for drying nails.</li>
            <li> The thing hardly works to actually dry her painted nails though.</li>
            <li> do not waste your money on this item, very very poorly made.</li>
            <li> You also have to press fairly hard down on the button in order for it to work, so I recommend drying two fingers at once.</li>
            <li> You have to hold the button down hard for it to blow your nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well he works, as it was a Christmas gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> Not really effective for adults</li>
            <li> I messed up at least five manicures using this.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little difficult for small kids</li>
            <li> but if you have the patience this will work on a thin layer of polish.</li>
            <li> The edges were bent and dented, and the over all appearance mad it look like maybe someone tried to play hacky-sack with my product, or the box at least.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, especially since it was going to be a (late) Christmas present...  :&#x27;( :&#x27;(</li>
            <li> Disappointing!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so stupid</li>

            <li> cheaply made but cute took a while to get her</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, which is what I expected.  It shipped a little quicker than I thought it would and made a great stocking stuffer for our 12 year old girl. Doesn&#x27;t work exceptionally well, but is okay as a novelty.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t blow enough air, but it is super cute so I am going to keep it. My nails air dry faster than this monkey can blow</li>
            <li> The product is great. The grandchildren were excited to receive their Christmas gifts. The product is as expected and works very well</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 and neither of them worked at all. I put the batteries but couldn&#x27;t get them to work. No directions,</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work and when it does it barely blows air. I gave it 3 stars cause I bought it cause it was cute more than its functions.</li>
            <li> The gift came after Christmas (it took 38 days to get to my house) , when i opened the bag it looked like someone had crushed the box. I put two AAA batteries in to see if it worked, it did not. I asked the company that i would think that i should get another one for free and it should be express shipping (especially since i waited so long and its after Christmas). Very disappointing, especially since it was going to be a (late) Christmas present...  :&#x27;( :&#x27;(</li>
            <li> is just a toy...It don&#x27;t blow enough to dry anything ... I don&#x27;t recomend. it was a mistake !!! .</li>
            <li> and the mouth hole is where the air comes from so it doesn&#x27;t cover a very wide area for drying nails. But it is cost-effective and cute for little girls. Not really effective for adults</li>

            <li> This is a cute gift, but isn&#x27;t really useful. It is battery operated so the blowing power is minimal. It was inexpensive so I didn&#x27;t have high expectations. Great as funny or cute gift for someone who collects monkey things, but not worthwhile as a nail dryer.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my niece for her b-day.  She said it won&#x27;t stop blowing once you put batteries in.  You have to take the batteries out to get it to stop.  Disappointing!  Very cute, but doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> Battery powered without much power even though it works as described. If you like monkey items then you&#x27;ll enjoy this:-)</li>

I just got it because it was cute and I wasn&#x27;t really expecting too much :) but my baby girl loves it and im happy with it :) the price wasn&#x27;t bad t all so overall  am pleased</li>
            <li> This little monkey is so adorable, but does not work well at all. It did arrive on time and was well packaged. I would order from seller again, just wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item. If you are looking for something cute or a collectable this is your piece.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my girlfriend as a gag gift. She got a good kick out of it, so it was worth it for that alone. The thing hardly works to actually dry her painted nails though. It just simply looks cute.</li>
            <li> This little guy is very cute! I&#x27;m not sure how well he works, as it was a Christmas gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> This item is small, but cute.  You have to hold the button down hard for it to blow your nails and it&#x27;s a little difficult for small kids</li>
            <li> Item arrived damaged and not from the Amazon shipping. Product was boxed damaged by manufactuer as it was sealed in a plastic bag and boxed, then boxed by Amazon. I was able to glue the broken item back on but the dryer would not operate. Returned for full refund. do not waste your money on this item, very very poorly made.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong blow when it blows on your nails. I like because it dries your nails quick</li>
            <li> This product does everything it says it will do however I do not support buying outside of the United States. Had I realized it was not a U.S. product I would not have bought this especially since I have currently as of 12/12/12 seen it in our local Walmart.</li>
