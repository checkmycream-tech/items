            <li>Sweet!</li>
            <li>Easy to find at amazon.com.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s light, clean and sensual.</li>
            <li>I always get it for my wife for special occasions like anniversaries.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly as all products do when I order.</li>
            <li>I found this sent many years ago when I was in my early twenties</li>
            <li>This is an old favorite of mine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We could have filled the older bottle with water and not known the difference.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal, genuine &amp;#34;Samsara, Eau De Toilette&amp;#34; in a large 3.4 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li>It is deep and complex scent with a beautiful mystical feeling which always makes me feel sexy and feminine.  </li>
            <li>I found that no other scent lasted as long or got me such wonderful compliments.</li>
            <li>Was so surprised that Amazon carried this product since it has not been available.</li>
            <li>I have tried many others but I always go back to samsara, no matter what.</li>
            <li>Samsara has been my favorite scent since I first found it at age 19 back in 1990.  </li>
            <li>This is the only scent my wife has used for many years.  </li>
            <li>First time I smelled it, I ran out and bought it.</li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance and this is the ONLY place I can find it.</li>
            <li>I received the product on time and exactly how was specify on their advertise.</li>
            <li>Did not realize so many others devoted to my favorite scent which I have worn for at least 20 years.</li>
            <li>Not very happy with the quality, I&#x27;m not even sure this Authentic Samsara.</li>
            <li>I recommend the Eau De Parfum simply because it easily lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Hard to purchase this size and get it for a relatively good price.</li>
            <li>and I have always been very fond of it</li>
            <li>Truly gentle.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never tired of it.</li>
            <li>thanks a lot</li>
            <li>are you wearing&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;you really smell good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>A real head turner.</li>
            <li>really ike</li>
            <li>I admit, I checked the websites of my local department stores and was amazed at how much more they wanted, so I came back and ordered it.  </li>
            <li>Is this new policy???</li>
            <li>It came brand new in box just as described.</li>
            <li>I occasionally wear other scents, but this remains my undying favorite.  </li>
            <li>Shalimar is more subtle, but when I desire a fragrance that lasts, this is the one.</li>
            <li>soon as she tried it she could tell it was not the same EDT as the older one she</li>
            <li>We were very surprised at the size of the bottle because it was twice as large as we expected for the price.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy, flowery or sweet</li>
            <li>Twice as much product for only 2/3 of the costs buying locally.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sexy, subtle and beguiling!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only gift that I will allow any one to give me.  </li>

            <li> This is the only scent my wife has used for many years.  We have reordered several times from A and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very quick shipment and safely packaged. We were very surprised at the size of the bottle because it was twice as large as we expected for the price. Sweet!</li>
            <li> Worn it for over 20 years</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance for years. Hard to purchase this size and get it for a relatively good price. The fragance lasts all day even though I cannot smell but others are constantly asking what I have on? I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I always get asked&amp;#34;what are you wearing&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;you really smell good&amp;#34;. Really nice fragrance.  I wear it in the fall and winter</li>
            <li> They stopped selling this perfume where I work. So I buy it here now. I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for 20 years now... :)</li>
            <li> Did not realize so many others devoted to my favorite scent which I have worn for at least 20 years. First time I smelled it, I ran out and bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for YEARS. I&#x27;ve ALWAYS gotten compliments on it even though no ones ever heard of it. I got it for an amazing price from the seller. So happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance and this is the ONLY place I can find it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this for myself, but as a gift for my mother for her birthday.  This is her her favorite perfume.  This was the best deal I saw.  No issues at all with delivery or receipt.</li>
            <li> This has been my signature scent since the year it came out. I get so many compliments when ever I wear it. FAST shipping &amp; excellent product</li>
            <li> Purchashed for my wife. She has gotten alot of compliments on the smell. A very good buy, also because it&#x60;s 4 times cheaper than the best price that I could find here in Brazil.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. I have been wearing it for years</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Samsara for 15 years. It has such a seductive scent that people stop me to ask what perfume I&#x27;m wearing! I found that no other scent lasted as long or got me such wonderful compliments. I&#x27;m a Samsara user for life!</li>
            <li> Been wearing this fragrance for years...Love it</li>
            <li> My wife likes this product and she isuse it for more 20 years ago and I like it too for many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve uses samsara for years. Great scent that lasts for hours.  Lots of compliments. Not too heavy, flowery or sweet</li>
            <li> This is my moms favorite perfume and I got it at a great price. It came brand new in box just as described. I&#x27;m glad I found and will use again.</li>
            <li> you have to spray 2 or 3 times a day  in order for you to be able to smell it.. Not very happy with the quality, I&#x27;m not even sure this Authentic Samsara.</li>
            <li> This perfume just makes me feel sexy.  I love the smell of it.  It arrived quickly as all products do when I order.</li>
            <li> One of the sexiest perfumes that I&#x27;ve ever smelt. A real head turner. My wife has been wearing it for yrs and still gets compliments. I can&#x27;t get enough of that scent.</li>
            <li> My om loves this too.</li>
            <li> Samsara is the only fragrance I wear!  It&#x27;s sexy, subtle and beguiling!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only gift that I will allow any one to give me.  I keep at least 5 bottles on hand at any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lola! Love</li>
            <li> Received quickly and in perfect condition.  Better deal than I could find at any of the department stores.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> OMG smells so good. Nice winter scent.</li>
            <li> Love the scent....always get compliments on it....only use Guerlain scents....Shalimar and Samsara....any which way that I can het them.....really ike</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife because she was almost close to finishing the earlier one that I had bought for her.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as she tried it she could tell it was not the same EDT as the older one she had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We could have filled the older bottle with water and not known the difference.</li>
            <li> This company makes some delicious scents. Shalimar is more subtle, but when I desire a fragrance that lasts, this is the one.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal, genuine &amp;#34;Samsara, Eau De Toilette&amp;#34; in a large 3.4 ounce bottle. Excellent price, protectively well packaged, and it arrived quite quickly. Great vendor, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Everything was great even arrived early!</li>
            <li> I received the product on time and exactly how was specify on their advertise. Good quality and price. I recomend it</li>
            <li> I reaqlly enjoyed the perfume when it came on time and my it is at a great price. I hae looked everywhere for this perfume and i got a lot of perfume at a great price.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten about this perfume!  I used to wear it about 10 years ago and had completely forgotten how much I loved it and when I saw it on Amazon, I knew I had to order it.  I admit, I checked the websites of my local department stores and was amazed at how much more they wanted, so I came back and ordered it.  Now when I wear it, I&#x27;m reminded of things I did in my &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; years!</li>
            <li> This product was correct and I worked perfectly</li>
            <li> I might be boring using the same perfume for years, but why ruined a good thing.  Love this scent.  I get compliments on it almost every time I wear it.  A little spicy, not overwhelming....</li>
