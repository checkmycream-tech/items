    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best product for curls i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have 2 years using it and is the best.</li>
            <li>Use this in addition to the Curls Rock cream and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>not the best serum i&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Works great as an additive I needed to make your hair softer.</li>
            <li>and this does a great job of locking my curls.</li>
            <li>So glad to find this discontinued product !!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this product here but the prices are good</li>
            <li>I had used Curls Rock from Tigi for years and loved it, but my curls would always seem crispy afterward.  </li>
            <li>The good side to this</li>
            <li>Love this and smells great</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love shopping online!</li>
            <li>Keeps a nice shine in your hair without making it sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair look kind of greasy.</li>
            <li>Great product really helps define my curls!</li>
            <li>So work with it, get the right combination, and I promise these will make your curly hair look amazing and frizz-free!</li>
            <li>Luckily I have some friends with better suited hair types and they&#x27;ll be happy to get a free &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>A dime size is almost too much, but it brings great shine to the hair.  </li>
            <li>It defines my curls better than any product I have found.</li>
            <li>so I may order from Amozon instead of paying more at a salon.</li>
            <li>Love it makes my hair shiny and manageable....</li>
            <li>and I think that together with the serum will be even better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>It does make parts of my hair feel like straw which I don&#x27;t love, it holds my curls</li>
            <li>I love tigi products my hair dresser turned me on to them.my favorite hair store</li>
            <li>This product is super for that kind of hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair which is easy to get weighted down, and I have found the perfect amount.  </li>
            <li>However, my curls with the Curlesque are more free flowing.  </li>
            <li>Curlesque - Defining Serum, Curls Rock Amplifier and Strong Mousse.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, curly (caucasian) hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I like this product because it goes on smooth and evenly</li>
            <li>It smells so good and it leaves my hair really soft and shiney.  </li>
            <li>It is the best formula for a long curly hair in a very high humidity weather.</li>
            <li>Much better for a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>It gives me soft curls that last all day and don&#x27;t get frizzy, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>and I had to make a special trip.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as I was using Redken curvaceous Full Swirl which didn&#x27;t work well in my hair.</li>
            <li>It will give you good short term results.</li>
            <li>I probably would not buy this again, I&#x27;m sure there are other products that would work much better.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good combined with the other tigi products of the curlesque line.</li>
            <li>(My hair sits right at/above my shoulders)  </li>
            <li>This serum works great, but you only need a tiny but, about a pea size amount.</li>
            <li>Love this product and would highly recommend this to people with naturally curly hair!  </li>
            <li>An unlikely combination that works great on my hair!</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t leave my hair flaky which pretty much all the curling products do.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really feel like this does anything for my hair.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know what the heck it really does.</li>
            <li>Thanks to all the reviewers on the site, gr8 for my curls</li>
            <li>I did not like at all this product, Is very thick/deep</li>
            <li>This line works really well for curly hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I read other reviews on this product because that&#x27;s why I decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t particularly like how they look.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the serum for helping with frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I thought it would make my curls look a little more volumized but no.</li>
            <li>This is the only one that consistently works!</li>
            <li>This serum is not sticky and not very thin either.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this locally anymore, so I&#x27;m going to guess the company replaced it with something less effective.  </li>
            <li>it leaves my hair very soft</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>More then anything it weighed my curls down and left them looking lifeless.</li>
            <li>My curls look natural.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I tired of frequenting a popular chain store looking for this product.  </li>
            <li>Used with other shampoos and no conditioner and a light application of Argan oil, it does the same trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave build up on hair but by the end of the day the ends of her hair are pretty dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>I can wake up in the morning and my hair has held the curl/wave and requires a lot less touching up than other products I have used.</li>
            <li>For straight hair, apply on dry hair before styling.</li>
            <li>Used with the matching shampoo and conditioner and no other products, it gives my curls shine and bounce and does away with that wispy, spider-webby look.  </li>
            <li>The Aveda products make my coarse, curly hair soft, and the Curlesque Defining Serum adds hold and structure to my curls.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair looking shiny and the waves and curls look very natural and not stiff like some other products will do.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product, but be very very careful how much you use or your hair will be gummy feeling.  </li>
            <li>Those that say it&#x27;s weighted their hair down have used too much.  </li>
            <li>The amplifier too can also weigh hair down if used too much.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The amplifier too can also weigh hair down if used too much.</li>
            <li> If you have fine loose curls with average moisture (like I do) then it will leave them limp, stringy and greasy.  </li>
            <li> Tried this on my naturally wavy/curly hair and it just weighed it down and took out the curl entirely.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m native american and black with naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly dry hair and uses this product occasionally.</li>
            <li> Key is to use a very small amount, use too much and your hair will feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I apply to damp hair then blow dry and straighten.</li>
            <li> When wearing curly I use in conjunction Tigi Catwalk Curls Rock Booster and let air dry.</li>
            <li> It Is feel sticky and dry</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair, and I find this product makes my hair feel thicker and heavier than it normally is with other products I use.</li>
            <li> For curly hair apply to wet hair after other products.</li>
            <li> This product was made for someone with tight dry curls.  </li>
            <li> always mix it with the other treatments</li>
            <li> The serum left my hair feeling heavy and a little oily.</li>
            <li> and I have thick coarse hair</li>
            <li> and I have not had any luck with this doing anything but weighing my hair down</li>
            <li> and I usually use it after a shower using the coordinating catwalk shampoo/conditioner and let it air dry,</li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy find hair and have had issues trying to find a product that makes it curly without making it crunchy.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness so heavy and greasy</li>
            <li> Even worse, the next day (AFTER washing and shampooing!)</li>
            <li> heavy for my hair</li>
            <li> A little dab will do you!</li>
            <li> The serum - use just a SMALL squirt.  </li>
            <li> The scent is so strong it gives me a horrible headache.</li>
            <li> Not for me at least.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to use it again because it makes my hair look worse that no product at all.</li>
            <li> and it just feels awful strait out of the bottle.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not what I was expecting...I was hoping my hair would be shiny and curls defined and it just stays kinda frizzy.</li>
            <li> This serum works great, but you only need a tiny but, about a pea size amount. I even use it when straightening my hair. I apply to damp hair then blow dry and straighten. When wearing curly I use in conjunction Tigi Catwalk Curls Rock Booster and let air dry. Key is to use a very small amount, use too much and your hair will feel greasy.</li>
            <li> keeps the frizz out of my curl!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really feel like this does anything for my hair. It&#x27;s just silky liquid and I don&#x27;t know what the heck it really does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m native american and black with naturally curly hair. This product was not for me. The serum left my hair feeling heavy and a little oily. More then anything it weighed my curls down and left them looking lifeless. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair, and I find this product makes my hair feel thicker and heavier than it normally is with other products I use. Love the smell and I usually use it after a shower using the coordinating catwalk shampoo/conditioner and let it air dry,</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly (caucasian) hair.  Was told by a stylist to COMBINE a squirt of each: Curlesque - Defining Serum, Curls Rock Amplifier and Strong Mousse.  I thought she was just trying to upsell me, but all three have worked wonders.  If I take ONE of them out of the equation it doesn&#x27;t work as well.  The serum - use just a SMALL squirt.  Those that say it&#x27;s weighted their hair down have used too much.  I promise!  I have very fine hair which is easy to get weighted down, and I have found the perfect amount.  A dime size is almost too much, but it brings great shine to the hair.  The amplifier too can also weigh hair down if used too much. I use a dime size for that, and one puff (?) of the mousse. (My hair sits right at/above my shoulders)  So work with it, get the right combination, and I promise these will make your curly hair look amazing and frizz-free!</li>
            <li> Works great as an additive I needed to make your hair softer.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It defines my curls better than any product I have found. I can wake up in the morning and my hair has held the curl/wave and requires a lot less touching up than other products I have used. I didn&#x27;t buy this product here but the prices are good so I may order from Amozon instead of paying more at a salon.</li>
            <li> This product was made for someone with tight dry curls.  If you have fine loose curls with average moisture (like I do) then it will leave them limp, stringy and greasy.  And yes, I followed the directions and only used a tiny amount.  Oh my goodness so heavy and greasy and it just feels awful strait out of the bottle.  Sometimes I put coconut oil in my hair and even that is not as heavy/sticky as this stuff is.  Even worse, the next day (AFTER washing and shampooing!) I could still feel it&#x27;s residue in my hair.  Luckily I have some friends with better suited hair types and they&#x27;ll be happy to get a free &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m not going to use it again because it makes my hair look worse that no product at all.</li>
            <li> I had used Curls Rock from Tigi for years and loved it, but my curls would always seem crispy afterward.  I like this product because it goes on smooth and evenly and it still has the curling power just like the prior product I&#x27;d used.  However, my curls with the Curlesque are more free flowing.  Much better for a more natural look.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> the TIGI catwalk is excelent for curly hair. My daughter have the hair so curly and bloond . This product is super for that kind of hair.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and it leaves my hair really soft and shiney.  I recommend this to all woman with curly hair.</li>
            <li> Great product really helps define my curls!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, but be very very careful how much you use or your hair will be gummy feeling.  A little dab will do you!</li>
            <li> this did nothing for me I have some wave and curl in my hair and it frizzes and is sometimes unmanageable and I have not had any luck with this doing anything but weighing my hair down and I have thick coarse hair</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this locally anymore, so I&#x27;m going to guess the company replaced it with something less effective.  For my fragile, old-lady curly hair, this stuff rocks!  Used with the matching shampoo and conditioner and no other products, it gives my curls shine and bounce and does away with that wispy, spider-webby look.  Used with other shampoos and no conditioner and a light application of Argan oil, it does the same trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I mix this serum with Aveda&#x27;s Be Curly Style Prep and Curl Enhancer. The Aveda products make my coarse, curly hair soft, and the Curlesque Defining Serum adds hold and structure to my curls. An unlikely combination that works great on my hair!</li>
            <li> Keeps a nice shine in your hair without making it sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this product and would highly recommend this to people with naturally curly hair!  It is a must to my daily routine!</li>
            <li> Thanks to all the reviewers on the site, gr8 for my curls</li>
            <li> Love it makes my hair shiny and manageable....gives it some body with my curls defined.</li>
            <li> I did not like at all this product, Is very thick/deep and after I put in my hair. It Is feel sticky and dry</li>
            <li> I tired of frequenting a popular chain store looking for this product.  It was never in stock and I had to make a special trip.  Love shopping online!</li>
            <li> This serum is not sticky and not very thin either. It is the best formula for a long curly hair in a very high humidity weather.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I was using Redken curvaceous Full Swirl which didn&#x27;t work well in my hair. I bought the serum hoping it would help and it did. Once I finish the Redken I&#x27;m going back to using Tigi Curls Rock Amplifier and I think that together with the serum will be even better. I highly recommend the serum for helping with frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair wavy and my hair is curly! I thought it would make my curls look a little more volumized but no. The good side to this it leaves my hair very soft</li>
            <li> Wow! For straight hair, apply on dry hair before styling. Will help keep you in place all day. For curly hair apply to wet hair after other products.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My curls look natural. This is the best product for curls i&#x27;ve tried. I have 2 years using it and is the best.</li>
            <li> Love this product.Just introduced my daughter to it she ordered it ASAP!</li>
            <li> heavy for my hair I have fine hair</li>
            <li> Love this and smells great</li>
            <li> Use this in addition to the Curls Rock cream and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy find hair and have had issues trying to find a product that makes it curly without making it crunchy. I think I&#x27;ve tried about 20 different products. This is the only one that consistently works! It gives me soft curls that last all day and don&#x27;t get frizzy, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly dry hair and uses this product occasionally. It doesn&#x27;t leave build up on hair but by the end of the day the ends of her hair are pretty dry and frizzy. If you&#x27;re looking for something to improve the moister level in your hair, this isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;re looking for. It will give you good short term results.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to flowers. The scent is so strong it gives me a horrible headache.</li>
            <li> This line works really well for curly hair.</li>
            <li> So glad to find this discontinued product !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. It does make parts of my hair feel like straw which I don&#x27;t love, it holds my curls well but I don&#x27;t particularly like how they look. Makes my hair look kind of greasy. I probably would not buy this again, I&#x27;m sure there are other products that would work much better.</li>
            <li> Came as described! Delivered on time!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t leave my hair flaky which pretty much all the curling products do.  It leaves my hair looking shiny and the waves and curls look very natural and not stiff like some other products will do.  I&#x27;m glad I read other reviews on this product because that&#x27;s why I decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I love tigi products my hair dresser turned me on to them.my favorite hair store discontinued this so I will stock up.  I have oily hair and this doesn&#x27;t even effect it. Gets rid of frize</li>
            <li> not the best serum i&#x27;ve tried but it&#x27;s good combined with the other tigi products of the curlesque line. always mix it with the other treatments</li>
            <li> Tried this on my naturally wavy/curly hair and it just weighed it down and took out the curl entirely.  Not for me at least.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this does a great job of locking my curls. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky or crunchy and no frizz! 😁</li>
