            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I liked this relaxer.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many relaxers</li>
            <li>I started having to relax my hair more often</li>
            <li>I have been relaxing my hair for most of my life...</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve tried to relax it every 2 or more months but would always have to do it sooner because my hair would become too unmanageable and begin to break.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>Love the Coconut</li>
            <li>It seems that my hair holds the curls better.</li>
            <li>My hair is very smooth and has a beautiful natural shine.</li>
            <li>With this relaxer I can actually go 2 months without breakage and still manage to keep my hair looking beautiful and healthy.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This product is excellent, it kept my hair straight longer than traditional relaxers.</li>
            <li>I left it on for the full length of time suggested for my hair type and my hair processed beautifully.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I was able to leave a relaxer on for the recommended period of time.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle but straightens my hair and provides a lovely shine.  </li>
            <li>this is works so good in resistant coarse hair!!</li>
            <li>This relaxer and the other items included in the kit smell very nice.</li>
            <li>Tip: If you don&#x27;t mind chemicals &amp; want a afro-texture softener, then Type A (mild) would be right for your.  </li>
            <li>Type A  is best for child/anyone looking for TEXTURE Softener for anyone who wants to maintain a &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; look Type B is best for those who don&#x27;t want harsh chemical relaxer, The result is loose 4B-like curls, wet and wavy look.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>

            <li>This was my first time using creme of nature straight from eden.</li>
            <li>I think basing your scalp really well will alleviate this issue.</li>
            <li>With the Creme of Nature Straight From Eden Relaxer, I did not have any of those issues.  </li>
            <li>but my hair wasn&#x27;t bone straight.</li>
            <li>This relaxer has my hair shining, feeling soft and overall much better than i was expecting.</li>
            <li>After 3 yrs natural I tried Phytospecific first because I did not know CON Straight Eden yet!</li>

            <li>No chemical smell and leaves hair soft!</li>
            <li>Normally I have to wash out my relaxer within about eight minutes of applying it because my scalp is so sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I have also notices that I do not have to touch up as quickly as before with other products.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to the those ladies in an area with high humidity</li>
            <li>After 12 weeks i did my first touch up with creme of nature eden type A - thinking I would get wet and wavy look but ended up with afro.</li>
            <li>I have been  using an olive oil relaxer for the last several months but notice it was not doing much for my hair any longer.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve always suffered from dry hair and split ends having coarse 4c hair.  </li>
            <li> and then it started to look dry, brittle and wouldn&#x27;t hold a curl.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this relaxer after being 12 months post relaxer this made my hair extremely dry and brittle will never purchase again</li>
            <li> The only negative thing is that it turned my hair yellow.</li>
            <li> I AM NEVER GOING BACK TO ANY OTHER BRAND OF RELAXER!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is fine-medium but extremely curly</li>
            <li> So depending on your hair texture, Type B will take you 1 to 2 steps down from a 4C (extremely tight kinky curl ) to 4B-4A loose kinky curl</li>
            <li> I was initially skeptical when I saw the advertisement for Straight from Eden.  </li>
            <li> For years I have searched for an alternative to the harsh chemicals in relaxers.  </li>
            <li> You would have to at least wash your hair two times with the shampoo for gray hair.</li>
            <li> I am going to use it again but will have my hair washed with shampoo for gray hair  at least two times.</li>
            <li> The no-lye option never did anything for my thick hair.  </li>

            <li> I work out weekly and find that this product works well on my hair.  It is gentle but straightens my hair and provides a lovely shine.  I have also notices that I do not have to touch up as quickly as before with other products.  I would definitely recommend to the those ladies in an area with high humidity and/or are sports minded.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many relaxers this is works so good in resistant coarse hair!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I just bought this relaxer for the first time. I&#x27;ve seen it in my local beauty supply stores but, like many others was skeptical to try it until today. I have been  using an olive oil relaxer for the last several months but notice it was not doing much for my hair any longer.  I started having to relax my hair more often and then it started to look dry, brittle and wouldn&#x27;t hold a curl.  This relaxer has my hair shining, feeling soft and overall much better than i was expecting. It looks healthy and definitely will be using this again. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent, it kept my hair straight longer than traditional relaxers. I would definitely try it again.  Worth the money</li>
            <li> I have been relaxing my hair for most of my life...I know the toll this takes on my hair so I&#x27;ve tried to relax it every 2 or more months but would always have to do it sooner because my hair would become too unmanageable and begin to break. With this relaxer I can actually go 2 months without breakage and still manage to keep my hair looking beautiful and healthy. I love that there is no harsh smell and finally there seems to be a relaxer that I can continue to use and not be in fear that I&#x27;m damaging my hair beyond repair.</li>
            <li> Works great and is long lasting.  Glad to see a product of this nature without a lot of those harmful and hair destroying chemicals as most of the other competitors have.</li>
            <li> My wife looks good but she said this was overpriced</li>
            <li> Using this product for the very first time was not sure how we feel but I was impressed</li>
            <li> I was initially skeptical when I saw the advertisement for Straight from Eden.  For years I have searched for an alternative to the harsh chemicals in relaxers.  The no-lye option never did anything for my thick hair.  This product truly surpassed my expectations. I think I actually like it better than a traditional relaxer.  It didn&#x27;t burn and had a very pleasant smell. It left my hair silky, shiny and totally manageable.  I am so glad I decided to try it.  I will never go back to traditional relaxers as long as this  is on the market.</li>
            <li> I use this perm to &amp;#34;texlax&amp;#34; my hair.  It does not burn and I have no additional breakage from this product.  The only issue is that I experienced bad itching in the back of my head. I think basing your scalp really well will alleviate this issue.</li>
            <li> No chemical smell and leaves hair soft! In LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo Smells GREAT! Love the Coconut Can&#x27;t wait to tell everyone!</li>
            <li> I purchased this relaxer after being 12 months post relaxer this made my hair extremely dry and brittle will never purchase again</li>
            <li> This was my first time using creme of nature straight from eden. I liked this relaxer. It straightened my hair but not 100% which should minimize breakage and add body.  I definitely would like to try it again. The major problem is I cannot locate this product in local stores.</li>
            <li> Love this! Smells great, feels great!</li>
            <li> A licensed cosmetologist applied Type B to my coarse gray hair . It did not burn and my hair was very soft afterwards.. The only negative thing is that it turned my hair yellow. My suggestion is to use shampoo for gray hair. You would have to at least wash your hair two times with the shampoo for gray hair. I would definitely recommend it for persons without gray hair. I am going to use it again but will have my hair washed with shampoo for gray hair  at least two times.</li>
            <li> Best relaxer out there on the market. All Cr√®me of Nature products are high quality but I love this relaxer for minimizing as much as possible the harmful chemical ingredients (as much as you can with a chemical relaxer). I have used this product the past 4 times to relax my hair and it looks super healthy (even more so than my natural hair). The key is to do deep conditioning treatments and minimize or altogether do not put any heat on the hair after relaxing.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It did not burn my scalp and my hair feels great. It seems that my hair holds the curls better. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I was able to leave a relaxer on for the recommended period of time.  Normally I have to wash out my relaxer within about eight minutes of applying it because my scalp is so sensitive.  With the Creme of Nature Straight From Eden Relaxer, I did not have any of those issues.  I left it on for the full length of time suggested for my hair type and my hair processed beautifully.  I have found my relaxer.  I AM NEVER GOING BACK TO ANY OTHER BRAND OF RELAXER!!!</li>
            <li> This relaxer and the other items included in the kit smell very nice. I like the consistency of the relaxer and it was easy to apply. For my hair type the recommended processing time was 20 min in total. My hair is fine-medium but extremely curly and I have a lot of it so it takes forever to get around my head even though it is cut short. I followed the directions but my hair wasn&#x27;t bone straight. There was no damage and the Repairing Oil that was included helped add an incredible shine that was remained even after drying. I&#x27;ll have to practice getting the timing right but I will definitely use it again.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best relaxers I have ever tried. There&#x27;s no chemical smells, no burning, no shedding. My hair is very smooth and has a beautiful natural shine.</li>
            <li> About me: 4c fine - medium thick - course hair. After 3 yrs natural I tried Phytospecific first because I did not know CON Straight Eden yet! (Phyto is also plant based highly renowned, but expensive), The Phyto results were dry, but hair felt strong. I&#x27;ve always suffered from dry hair and split ends having coarse 4c hair.  After 12 weeks i did my first touch up with creme of nature eden type A - thinking I would get wet and wavy look but ended up with afro. Tip: If you don&#x27;t mind chemicals &amp; want a afro-texture softener, then Type A (mild) would be right for your.  Type A  is best for child/anyone looking for TEXTURE Softener for anyone who wants to maintain a &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; look Type B is best for those who don&#x27;t want harsh chemical relaxer, The result is loose 4B-like curls, wet and wavy look.  So depending on your hair texture, Type B will take you 1 to 2 steps down from a 4C (extremely tight kinky curl ) to 4B-4A loose kinky curl</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy again!</li>
