            <li>I am so in love and people always ask me what I am wearing.</li>
            <li>I love that it came on time.</li>
            <li>Its one of my favorite perfumes</li>
            <li>Still a number one favorite</li>
            <li>Love the smell its one of my all time favorite from Jennifer Lopez.</li>
            <li>my Still is better.</li>
            <li>with any perfume, it&#x27;s all about how it mixes with your own chemistry, so just be sure to try this one out first to make sure it&#x27;s a good fit for you.</li>
            <li>After mixing with my own chemistry, it&#x27;s just ok, nothing special.</li>
            <li>happy with my new find!</li>
            <li>It has a nice, sweet &amp; sexy scent..</li>
            <li>and she loved it very much.</li>
            <li>Very clean scent.</li>
            <li>Still is so feminine &amp; so unique!</li>
            <li>I am so excited about this purchase!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is amazing and it brings back great memories</li>
            <li>I find most perfumes to be too strong and overpowering.</li>
            <li>This perfume arrived SUPER quickly and in perfect condition: in a brand new, unopened box.</li>
            <li>It is sexy, light, long-lasting and Not over powering or flowery.</li>
            <li>A girlfriend of mine gifted this scent to me--claiming it to be too light for her.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soo nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s perfumes are usually light smelling and beautiful, but this one is too strong and smells like an old folk&#x27;s home blew up.</li>
            <li>this is the best scent out of all J-lo perfume it last all day long and for a great price</li>
            <li>I sprayed it this morning at 7am and now at 9:30pm, I still smell it just as strongly as I did 10+ hours ago.</li>
            <li>This is the first J-Lo perfume that I have actually liked.</li>
            <li>I got a genuinely-factory sealed perfume box, and a beautiful 3.4oz bottle of the actual perfume!</li>
            <li>After all the reviews I was tempted to buy without trying, lucky I didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>The shipping was super quick--I received it within 2 days of ordering!</li>
            <li>Smells great, has a strong smell that will last hours!</li>
            <li>It has a very light, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed with the large size bottle and the low price.  </li>
            <li>I am super excited to have this scent in my hands again!</li>
            <li>and the bottle is huge compared to others.</li>
            <li>I had many people comment on how fresh and light it smells.</li>
            <li>so it has to be light.</li>
            <li>I enjoy wearing these brands of perfume</li>
            <li>Not too heavy, and smells delicious.  </li>
            <li>I couldn´t buy it in free shops</li>
            <li>great present to give to someone.</li>
            <li>this is my 2nd favorite perfumes j lo did a good job with this one.</li>
            <li>Ive been buying this perfume from others for double the price, so I totally love the price!!</li>
            <li>Very nice and bigger then thought.  </li>
            <li>This is a really good perfume, was a gift for my mom, it is a sweet scent but also fresh  and light, it sticks to my mom really well.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a light clean scent...</li>
            <li>Got my favorite perfume really cheap and really fast!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife, she wore this when we dated in high school, and she was thrilled to get it again.</li>
            <li>Ended up buying Live Luxe instead which is lovely when it goes on and mellows to a lovely citrusy-sweet fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I live this perfume,I get so many compliments, from men and women, they love the smell,and so do I.</li>
            <li>and I am never disappointed with her fragrances.  </li>
            <li>, it is original and smell veryyyyy well.</li>
            <li>Amazingly sweet, light floral scent.</li>
            <li>n opened it up fresh!  </li>
            <li>shipping was super quick!</li>
            <li>Smells pretty authentic.</li>
            <li>Smells great and lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li>but, I wish I had paid better attention to the not so positive reviews of this perfume before adding it to my wish</li>
            <li>Just slightly sweet, clean, fresh, and light.</li>
            <li>It smells great and the bottle is pretty big.</li>
            <li>This was such a good deal.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something that has a sweet smell this is for you.</li>
            <li>This is a nice balance of floral and classy.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I brought it as a gift for one of my friends.</li>
            <li>Use this on a daily basis smells so good.</li>
            <li>Such a good deal...</li>
            <li>thanks for the samples. :)</li>
            <li>yes thanks I just love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with buying products from this store, recommend and hope to make future purchases of the same, because they are very acceptable and excellent what they sell.</li>
            <li>Smells amazingly fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Love it, scent is romantic and sexy</li>
            <li>Many stores didn&#x27;t carry it, but i&#x27;m glad i found the bigger size here at the price that&#x27;s listed here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many perfumes (I used to work at a high end dept store), but nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li>When I first sprayed it, it just smelled cheap.</li>
            <li>and you get the light and pretty fragrance.</li>
            <li>MY NEW FAVORITE 👌</li>
            <li>sprays on strong and then gets light...very soft and pleasant smell; but remember every perfume smells different on every person!</li>
            <li>the best and long lasting sent</li>
            <li>1 of these usually lasts me more than a year, so I think it is a good value.</li>
            <li>It has a very soft smell to it and have gotten many comments about it.  </li>
            <li>This has been the only JLO scent i have ever owned, and im in love with it!</li>
            <li>but here it is exactly what she wanted!</li>
            <li>and the preice is fantastic, soooo reasonable.</li>
            <li>Nowadays, every celebrity has their own scents and they all start smelling the same.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few others but this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>It took a while to get it, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>because I love Glow by J.Lo and since this got so many great reviews, I stupidly assumed I would love this one too.</li>
            <li>I wear it almost daily, &amp; the stone accent on the bottle is also a nice touch.</li>
            <li>It was nice to get it back!</li>
            <li>However well worth the wait</li>
            <li>So Fresh, this is my go-to perfume.</li>
            <li>I must say that this purchase was well worth every penny</li>
            <li>I use to own a perfume that smelled very similar to this one ..</li>
            <li>Definleny well worth wearing, not to ment mention trying.</li>
            <li>I love this soft scent.</li>
            <li>ive always loved this scent and im happy to now have the big big bottle since I preserved my 1 oz size for so long.</li>
            <li>Friend was delighted with it, along with her other 2 gifts.</li>
            <li>The price was just right.</li>
            <li>It arrived right on time.</li>
            <li>ever J. Lo did this right</li>
            <li>The smell is unbelievably sexy and like no other.</li>
            <li>I used my previous spray solely for special occassions but now with this 3.4 oz bottle, I can smell sexy all day, e&#x27;ry day!  </li>
            <li>This is one of my all time favorite perfumes which I must say is kind of hard to find now and days at the stores.  </li>
            <li>Almost daily someone near me says I smell so good.  </li>
            <li>I really appreciate that it is very pretty inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been so curious about this perfume for so many years!</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable also.</li>
            <li>Like most perfume sprays it doesn&#x27;t smell good right when you spray it but a few minutes later</li>
            <li>Smells great but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Glad to see I can still get it only b/c</li>
            <li>I will for sure return to Amazon to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li>Not the real fragrance!</li>
            <li>I have learned my lesson to first try a perfume before buying or putting on a wish</li>
            <li>That was more than 4 years ago, and he still says the same thing.</li>
            <li>I love it and have bought a total of 6.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for any woman!!</li>
            <li>and I really cannot stand them!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I would rather contact the seller first, however there is no where that I have found to do so.</li>
            <li>None of our local retailers carry it any longer, but I don&#x27;t know why, I love this fragrance</li>
            <li>I was used to paying much more at the store, when I could actually find it.  </li>
            <li>I included my personal photo as proof of how excited I am about this perfume!</li>
            <li>As far as the actual scent, it is a nice floral scent.</li>
            <li>So delicate and sexy, it sets lovely into your skin.</li>
            <li>Very feminine and pretty.</li>
            <li>it shipped pretty fast too</li>
            <li>It smells very old and really offensive!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews on Amazon anymore since it seems many who read them view them as a chance to start an online bash fast if the review given doesn&#x27;t agree with their own personal opinion of the product...</li>
            <li>I received so many compliments with this perfume, I suggest this perfume to the ladies, it has light scent that last all day long!!!</li>
            <li>And this is light enough for me and the person I buy it for.</li>
            <li>She said I really &#x27;outdid myself&#x27; this year.  </li>
            <li>I received an undamaged product and it is THE REAL THING.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I read the reviews, so I was expecting to really like this fragrance.</li>
            <li>and I really sprayed it on myself and my clothes....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smell this on myself much longer after I spray it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, not what I expected.</li>
            <li>delivery was surprisingly fast.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and just what I wanted...</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks .</li>
            <li>Warm and cozy, smells like tea.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>I am very picky when it comes to perfume</li>
            <li>thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;Jodi</li>
            <li>Bought for wife, she and I really like it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this scent.</li>
            <li>Item arrived as described and is much cheaper than in stores like Macy&#x27;s, Kohl&#x27;s, Perfumania, etc.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Very saddened by this experience...........</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon, I have found it again.</li>
            <li>, it kind of smells the same but the smell does not last 30 minutes on...</li>
            <li>Not old smelling, not too strong.  </li>
            <li>Look up Jennifer&#x27;s other scents, you will LOVE.</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers have stated, it does smell a bit &amp;#34;grandma-ish,&amp;#34; for lack of a better description.</li>
            <li>Next to the original Glow, this is my fave of Jlo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this based on other reviews</li>
            <li>Very personal and intimate aroma which makes it part of you (not some loudly screaming sent which takes over the whole room and gives everyone a huge headache).&lt;br</li>
            <li>After spraying it had a strong bathroom cleanser overtone, after warming up a bit it ended up settling into a smell that I can only describe as \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; or \\&quot;nanna\\</li>
            <li>I just received it and it smells so soft and pretty...</li>
            <li>My wife loves this particular scent and it was cheaper to buy on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The bottle itself is a decent size (especially for the price) and looks very pretty on the vanity.</li>
            <li>Soft, nice long lasting fragance.</li>
            <li>When I can find it, it&#x27;s twice as high to buy in a department store than it is here.</li>
            <li>I will never pay the high price in a retail store again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Love the time of delivery but the product itself was a little dissapointed</li>
            <li>I have used this perfume for many years and now its pretty hard to find.</li>
            <li>Smell is soft and I cant smell it very often</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong enough scent for others to catch a whiff of it, but soft enough so that I don&#x27;t smell it unless I really sniff for it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for your &amp;#34;romantic and cuddling moments&amp;#34; with your significant other; just don&#x27;t bath yourself in it.</li>
            <li>Once it settles it is quite nice and subtle.</li>
            <li>My body temp usually \\&quot;burns\\&quot; most cologne/perfume.  </li>
            <li>I still smile when I lay my head on my pillow after a long day at work and home, and get that hint of freshness still in my hair.</li>
            <li>It was delivered early!</li>
            <li>I looked for this scent in many department store and I was not able to locate it.</li>
            <li>I bought this with some hesitancy, not expecting it to be exactly the same as I&#x27;ve purchased in the stores.  </li>
            <li>and it came a day early!</li>
            <li>I am a loyal user of J LO Still for over a year,the smell usually lasts long on my skin up to 3-4 hours, but this one wears off very quickly.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical because sometimes celebrity fragrances can be too sweet which I love</li>
            <li>I had a major allergic reaction after using this particular bottle.</li>
            <li>Guess it depends on the natural chemicals on your skin</li>
            <li>I should just spray the air and walk into it instead of direct spraying it.</li>
            <li>I have paid as much as $60 for the same size at perfume island in the mall</li>
            <li>This scent will never get old in my book...</li>
            <li>I am frequently complimented on it.</li>
            <li>As far as amazon goes delivery was on time</li>
            <li>Well worth any money spent.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, but not loud enough&#x27; or should I say, doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I get compliments from random strangers about how good it smells.</li>
            <li>I may slowly purchase more to ensure I&#x27;m stocked up for life.</li>
            <li>The original perfume usually smells very strong only with one spray, but I have to pray a few times to get the smell.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I was able to get such a deal on the 3.4oz, because I am obsessed!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s first perfumes and I will buy it as long as they sell it!</li>
            <li>It is very fresh, a touch of citrus, slightly flowery, and has a floating scent of tea!</li>
            <li>&quot; (sorry nanna, I love you really!)</li>
            <li>YOU spray it on and at first it remotely smells like &amp;#34;Still&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Could barely smell anything!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good everyday parfum, you only need a few sprays and it last all day.</li>
            <li>cuz I thought maybe it was a scam but arrived on time and its not fake or imitation.</li>
            <li>On my skin,its a soft but lasting scent/and it smells like evening time.</li>
            <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised and the size of the bottle was actually larger than I planned on!  </li>
            <li>The inner package came completely damaged (actually torn and the liquid was leaking).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle now since I wear it on a near daily basis.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that the pretty smell doesn&#x27;t last all day like my previous bottle.  </li>
            <li>I will keep ordering this until I&#x27;m old and grey.</li>
            <li>Wish it lasted a little longer, fades fast.  </li>

            <li> I am so excited about this purchase!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is amazing and it brings back great memories</li>
            <li> I find most perfumes to be too strong and overpowering.</li>
            <li> This perfume arrived SUPER quickly and in perfect condition: in a brand new, unopened box.</li>
            <li> It is sexy, light, long-lasting and Not over powering or flowery.</li>
            <li> A girlfriend of mine gifted this scent to me--claiming it to be too light for her.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soo nice and fresh.</li>
            <li> Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s perfumes are usually light smelling and beautiful, but this one is too strong and smells like an old folk&#x27;s home blew up.</li>
            <li> this is the best scent out of all J-lo perfume it last all day long and for a great price</li>
            <li> I sprayed it this morning at 7am and now at 9:30pm, I still smell it just as strongly as I did 10+ hours ago.</li>
            <li> This is the first J-Lo perfume that I have actually liked.</li>
            <li> I got a genuinely-factory sealed perfume box, and a beautiful 3.4oz bottle of the actual perfume!</li>
            <li> After all the reviews I was tempted to buy without trying, lucky I didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> The shipping was super quick--I received it within 2 days of ordering!</li>
            <li> Smells great, has a strong smell that will last hours!</li>
            <li> It has a very light, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> I was impressed with the large size bottle and the low price.  </li>
            <li> I am super excited to have this scent in my hands again!</li>
            <li> and the bottle is huge compared to others.</li>
            <li> I had many people comment on how fresh and light it smells.</li>
            <li> so it has to be light.</li>
            <li> I enjoy wearing these brands of perfume</li>
            <li> Not too heavy, and smells delicious.  </li>
            <li> I couldn´t buy it in free shops</li>
            <li> great present to give to someone.</li>
            <li> this is my 2nd favorite perfumes j lo did a good job with this one.</li>
            <li> Ive been buying this perfume from others for double the price, so I totally love the price!!</li>
            <li> Very nice and bigger then thought.  </li>
            <li> This is a really good perfume, was a gift for my mom, it is a sweet scent but also fresh  and light, it sticks to my mom really well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a light clean scent...</li>
            <li> Got my favorite perfume really cheap and really fast!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, she wore this when we dated in high school, and she was thrilled to get it again.</li>
            <li> Ended up buying Live Luxe instead which is lovely when it goes on and mellows to a lovely citrusy-sweet fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I live this perfume,I get so many compliments, from men and women, they love the smell,and so do I.</li>
            <li> and I am never disappointed with her fragrances.  </li>
            <li> , it is original and smell veryyyyy well.</li>
            <li> Amazingly sweet, light floral scent.</li>
            <li> n opened it up fresh!  </li>
            <li> shipping was super quick!</li>
            <li> Smells pretty authentic.</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> but, I wish I had paid better attention to the not so positive reviews of this perfume before adding it to my wish</li>
            <li> Just slightly sweet, clean, fresh, and light.</li>
            <li> It smells great and the bottle is pretty big.</li>
            <li> This was such a good deal.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something that has a sweet smell this is for you.</li>
            <li> This is a nice balance of floral and classy.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I brought it as a gift for one of my friends.</li>
            <li> Use this on a daily basis smells so good.</li>
            <li> Such a good deal...</li>
            <li> thanks for the samples. :)</li>
            <li> yes thanks I just love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with buying products from this store, recommend and hope to make future purchases of the same, because they are very acceptable and excellent what they sell.</li>
            <li> Smells amazingly fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Love it, scent is romantic and sexy</li>
            <li> Many stores didn&#x27;t carry it, but i&#x27;m glad i found the bigger size here at the price that&#x27;s listed here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many perfumes (I used to work at a high end dept store), but nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li> When I first sprayed it, it just smelled cheap.</li>
            <li> and you get the light and pretty fragrance.</li>
            <li> MY NEW FAVORITE 👌</li>
            <li> sprays on strong and then gets light...very soft and pleasant smell; but remember every perfume smells different on every person!</li>
            <li> the best and long lasting sent</li>
            <li> 1 of these usually lasts me more than a year, so I think it is a good value.</li>
            <li> It has a very soft smell to it and have gotten many comments about it.  </li>
            <li> This has been the only JLO scent i have ever owned, and im in love with it!</li>
            <li> but here it is exactly what she wanted!</li>
            <li> and the preice is fantastic, soooo reasonable.</li>
            <li> Nowadays, every celebrity has their own scents and they all start smelling the same.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few others but this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> It took a while to get it, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> because I love Glow by J.Lo and since this got so many great reviews, I stupidly assumed I would love this one too.</li>
            <li> I wear it almost daily, &amp; the stone accent on the bottle is also a nice touch.</li>
            <li> It was nice to get it back!</li>
            <li> However well worth the wait</li>
            <li> So Fresh, this is my go-to perfume.</li>
            <li> I must say that this purchase was well worth every penny</li>
            <li> I use to own a perfume that smelled very similar to this one ..</li>
            <li> Definleny well worth wearing, not to ment mention trying.</li>
            <li> I love this soft scent.</li>
            <li> ive always loved this scent and im happy to now have the big big bottle since I preserved my 1 oz size for so long.</li>
            <li> Friend was delighted with it, along with her other 2 gifts.</li>
            <li> The price was just right.</li>
            <li> It arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> ever J. Lo did this right</li>
            <li> The smell is unbelievably sexy and like no other.</li>
            <li> I used my previous spray solely for special occassions but now with this 3.4 oz bottle, I can smell sexy all day, e&#x27;ry day!  </li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite perfumes which I must say is kind of hard to find now and days at the stores.  </li>
            <li> Almost daily someone near me says I smell so good.  </li>
            <li> I really appreciate that it is very pretty inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so curious about this perfume for so many years!</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable also.</li>
            <li> Like most perfume sprays it doesn&#x27;t smell good right when you spray it but a few minutes later</li>
            <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Glad to see I can still get it only b/c</li>
            <li> I will for sure return to Amazon to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> Not the real fragrance!</li>
            <li> I have learned my lesson to first try a perfume before buying or putting on a wish</li>
            <li> That was more than 4 years ago, and he still says the same thing.</li>
            <li> I love it and have bought a total of 6.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for any woman!!</li>
            <li> and I really cannot stand them!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I would rather contact the seller first, however there is no where that I have found to do so.</li>
            <li> None of our local retailers carry it any longer, but I don&#x27;t know why, I love this fragrance</li>
            <li> I was used to paying much more at the store, when I could actually find it.  </li>
            <li> I included my personal photo as proof of how excited I am about this perfume!</li>
            <li> As far as the actual scent, it is a nice floral scent.</li>
            <li> So delicate and sexy, it sets lovely into your skin.</li>
            <li> Very feminine and pretty.</li>
            <li> it shipped pretty fast too</li>
            <li> It smells very old and really offensive!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews on Amazon anymore since it seems many who read them view them as a chance to start an online bash fast if the review given doesn&#x27;t agree with their own personal opinion of the product...</li>
            <li> I received so many compliments with this perfume, I suggest this perfume to the ladies, it has light scent that last all day long!!!</li>
            <li> And this is light enough for me and the person I buy it for.</li>
            <li> She said I really &#x27;outdid myself&#x27; this year.  </li>
            <li> I received an undamaged product and it is THE REAL THING.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, so I was expecting to really like this fragrance.</li>
            <li> and I really sprayed it on myself and my clothes....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell this on myself much longer after I spray it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not what I expected.</li>
            <li> delivery was surprisingly fast.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery and just what I wanted...</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks .</li>
            <li> Warm and cozy, smells like tea.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to perfume</li>
            <li> thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;Jodi</li>
            <li> Bought for wife, she and I really like it</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this scent.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as described and is much cheaper than in stores like Macy&#x27;s, Kohl&#x27;s, Perfumania, etc.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> Very saddened by this experience...........</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon, I have found it again.</li>
            <li> , it kind of smells the same but the smell does not last 30 minutes on...</li>
            <li> Not old smelling, not too strong.  </li>
            <li> Look up Jennifer&#x27;s other scents, you will LOVE.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have stated, it does smell a bit &amp;#34;grandma-ish,&amp;#34; for lack of a better description.</li>
            <li> Next to the original Glow, this is my fave of Jlo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this based on other reviews</li>
            <li> Very personal and intimate aroma which makes it part of you (not some loudly screaming sent which takes over the whole room and gives everyone a huge headache).&lt;br</li>
            <li> After spraying it had a strong bathroom cleanser overtone, after warming up a bit it ended up settling into a smell that I can only describe as \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; or \\&quot;nanna\\</li>
            <li> I just received it and it smells so soft and pretty...</li>
            <li> My wife loves this particular scent and it was cheaper to buy on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The bottle itself is a decent size (especially for the price) and looks very pretty on the vanity.</li>
            <li> Soft, nice long lasting fragance.</li>
            <li> When I can find it, it&#x27;s twice as high to buy in a department store than it is here.</li>
            <li> I will never pay the high price in a retail store again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the time of delivery but the product itself was a little dissapointed</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for many years and now its pretty hard to find.</li>
            <li> Smell is soft and I cant smell it very often</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strong enough scent for others to catch a whiff of it, but soft enough so that I don&#x27;t smell it unless I really sniff for it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for your &amp;#34;romantic and cuddling moments&amp;#34; with your significant other; just don&#x27;t bath yourself in it.</li>
            <li> Once it settles it is quite nice and subtle.</li>
            <li> My body temp usually \\&quot;burns\\&quot; most cologne/perfume.  </li>
            <li> I still smile when I lay my head on my pillow after a long day at work and home, and get that hint of freshness still in my hair.</li>
            <li> It was delivered early!</li>
            <li> I looked for this scent in many department store and I was not able to locate it.</li>
            <li> I bought this with some hesitancy, not expecting it to be exactly the same as I&#x27;ve purchased in the stores.  </li>
            <li> and it came a day early!</li>
            <li> I am a loyal user of J LO Still for over a year,the smell usually lasts long on my skin up to 3-4 hours, but this one wears off very quickly.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because sometimes celebrity fragrances can be too sweet which I love</li>
            <li> I had a major allergic reaction after using this particular bottle.</li>
            <li> Guess it depends on the natural chemicals on your skin</li>
            <li> I should just spray the air and walk into it instead of direct spraying it.</li>
            <li> I have paid as much as $60 for the same size at perfume island in the mall</li>
            <li> This scent will never get old in my book...</li>
            <li> I am frequently complimented on it.</li>
            <li> As far as amazon goes delivery was on time</li>
            <li> Well worth any money spent.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, but not loud enough&#x27; or should I say, doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I get compliments from random strangers about how good it smells.</li>
            <li> I may slowly purchase more to ensure I&#x27;m stocked up for life.</li>
            <li> The original perfume usually smells very strong only with one spray, but I have to pray a few times to get the smell.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I was able to get such a deal on the 3.4oz, because I am obsessed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s first perfumes and I will buy it as long as they sell it!</li>
            <li> It is very fresh, a touch of citrus, slightly flowery, and has a floating scent of tea!</li>
            <li> &quot; (sorry nanna, I love you really!)</li>
            <li> YOU spray it on and at first it remotely smells like &amp;#34;Still&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Could barely smell anything!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good everyday parfum, you only need a few sprays and it last all day.</li>
            <li> cuz I thought maybe it was a scam but arrived on time and its not fake or imitation.</li>
            <li> On my skin,its a soft but lasting scent/and it smells like evening time.</li>
            <li> However, I was pleasantly surprised and the size of the bottle was actually larger than I planned on!  </li>
            <li> The inner package came completely damaged (actually torn and the liquid was leaking).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle now since I wear it on a near daily basis.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the pretty smell doesn&#x27;t last all day like my previous bottle.  </li>
            <li> I will keep ordering this until I&#x27;m old and grey.</li>
            <li> Wish it lasted a little longer, fades fast.  </li>
            <li> Usually, someone will say, \\&quot;whoever smells citrusy--you smell really</li>
            <li> It is also very long lasting.</li>
            <li> Thank God Amazon has it and by far less than everyone else..</li>
            <li> Still is my go to purfume everyday and it never gets old!</li>
            <li> It was discontinued long ago</li>
            <li> I like other perfumes but always go back to Still.</li>
            <li> I just want to know whether the one that I got is original or fake.</li>
            <li> At least it fades enough so that I am not one of those women strangling others near me with overpowering perfume.</li>
            <li> I had to get it as soon as it came out a few years back</li>
            <li> , not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> and feel like i&#x27;m slipping into something glamorous whenever i wear it.</li>
            <li> Its getting harder to find.</li>
            <li> it was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Fresh and subtle but not too subtle.</li>
            <li> It always smelled bad and really strong to me.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s hard to track down a bottle, and then it&#x27;s hard to find one reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It took a little longer then expected to arrive, being that I am a Prime member.</li>
            <li> Its scent is very delicate, soft aroma that will let anyone in the room know that you just arrived by awakening their senses.</li>
            <li> thanks it so expensive else where</li>
            <li> It lasts less than 20 minutes</li>
            <li> I searched for this for so long because for some reason they don&#x27;t sell it in my state.........or at least not in any close by areas.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, for the first time I must rate negatively a product purchased from Amazon LLC.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptic when ordering it</li>
            <li> I got it again from this site and it&#x27;s not original</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned J.Lo perfumes in the past (Glow, Miami Glow, Glow After Dark) that I received as gifts</li>
            <li> I wanted a less flowery smelling perfume and that&#x27;s what I got!</li>
            <li> i started using it almost 10 years ago then got sad when i could barely find it in stores.</li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect because I had never smelled this fragrance before.  </li>
            <li> perfume used to cost me $60 for a small bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to think you can&#x27;t go wrong with JLo&#x27;s fragrances.</li>
            <li> /&gt;People usually ask me the name of it ...&lt;</li>
            <li> I do not normally leave bad feed back in this type of forum</li>
            <li> Normally I would be sick of a perfume by now</li>
            <li> its kinda hard to describe, but it does not smell old-ladyish.</li>
            <li> It is a hard to find item.</li>
            <li> Hard to find</li>
            <li> This one is the least overpowering of the cleb scents.</li>
            <li> Thought it a little expensive until I got the bottle</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this.</li>
            <li> This is the worse one I bought.</li>
            <li> Can see me using it everyday as a casual scent for work!</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed and would like to return this for my money back!!</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3I will never get tired of this scent!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;m sorry,</li>
            <li> Sad it&#x27;s no longer being made.</li>
            <li> I think the one that I bought is fake.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry for purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with it, I lost my money!</li>
            <li> SORRY!  </li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad bottle....</li>
            <li> Not to bad for never smelling it before.</li>
            <li> Too bad they took it off the market.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Would hate to lose this scent.</li>
            <li> Either this is a bad bottle or this seller ripped me off!</li>

            <li> Fifth time ordering it. The price is even better! Loving it everytime!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom! She bought this perfume when it came out and it&#x27;s her trademark scent&lt;br /&gt;The smell is amazing and it brings back great memories 💖</li>
            <li> This is my top favorite perfume!! I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years and I&#x27;m glad I can still buy it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Always been my favorite fragrance I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> this goes great with my body chemistry. love it love it love it.</li>
            <li> this is my 2nd favorite perfumes j lo did a good job with this one. I loved the way it smells</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for many years and now its pretty hard to find. So happy to find it on here so I can continue to use my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> This perfume is flower smell a got a lot of complements every time I use it....I love it it smell sooooooo!!!!!! Good :)</li>
            <li> I only buy this fragrance and any thing with vanilla scent. MOST smells give me a headache so it has to be light. And this is light enough for me and the person I buy it for. Glad to see I can still get it only b/c its no longer in the stores.</li>
            <li> One of my wife&#x27;s favorite perfumes @ an affordable price from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents of all time.  I had to get it as soon as it came out a few years back and I have loved it ever since.  Nowadays, every celebrity has their own scents and they all start smelling the same.  Jlo is one of the originals and I am never disappointed with her fragrances.  I&#x27;ve tried a few others but this is by far the best.  It has a very light, fresh scent.  It doen&#x27;t smell grandmaish like others have stated but that is just my opinion.</li>
            <li> I cannot even remember how many times I&#x27;ve been approached by women of all ages asking for the name of my fragrance.  It is sexy, light, long-lasting and Not over powering or flowery.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The pricing was fair, and also the product arrived in a timely manner. I will for sure return to Amazon to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for my future daughter-in-law.  It was the PERFECT GIFT!  She absolutely loved it!  AND she thought I was the best ever.  She said I really &#x27;outdid myself&#x27; this year.  She also said it was one of her best birthdays ever - and I had made it happen!  Thank YOU so much for the awesome product at a great price and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Timeless perfume. Always have loved it, always will. Great smell, grown. I wish it was never discontinued!</li>
            <li> After all the reviews I was tempted to buy without trying, lucky I didn&#x27;t! After spraying it had a strong bathroom cleanser overtone, after warming up a bit it ended up settling into a smell that I can only describe as \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; or \\&quot;nanna\\&quot; (sorry nanna, I love you really!), not what I expected.  Ended up buying Live Luxe instead which is lovely when it goes on and mellows to a lovely citrusy-sweet fragrance.  Guess it depends on the natural chemicals on your skin, mine just didn&#x27;t mix well with Still.</li>
            <li> This is my moms favorite perfume. I buy her a bottle every year and she falls more in love with it each year. Any concerns about it not smelling the same or being &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; can be put aside. I have now ordered two bottles from Amazon and I don&#x27;t have any complaints. Also the price can&#x27;t be beat when compared to those perfume stores. As far as the actual scent, it is a nice floral scent. I would recommend to those who like floral perfumes.</li>
            <li> I received this today and spritzed it on but.... it does smell kinda grandma-ish.  I can&#x27;t describe the scent.... I want to like it because I just ordered and received Glow and Live which are great!  This is not my kinda scent.  I keep smelling my wrist hoping that somehow the scent will change but ugh.  SORRY!  I should just spray the air and walk into it instead of direct spraying it.</li>
            <li> I so love this scent to me this is the best scent out of all J-lo perfume it last all day long and for a great price</li>
            <li> Great price,not easy to find in store&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This was such a good deal. It took a while to get it, but it was worth the wait. The price was unbeatable.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for Christmas not knowing how it smelled. Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s perfumes are usually light smelling and beautiful, but this one is too strong and smells like an old folk&#x27;s home blew up. Everywhere.</li>
            <li> Great!  The scent is  one you fall for and keep on buying . Nothing else needs to be said. Just great.</li>
            <li> This has been the only JLO scent i have ever owned, and im in love with it! its kinda hard to describe, but it does not smell old-ladyish. it smells wonderful, the best in her collection by FAR!!!</li>
            <li> Love this scent. I couldn&#x27;t find this perfume anywhere .</li>
            <li> This was a great price for this perfume. It is a hard to find item. I have paid as much as $60 for the same size at perfume island in the mall</li>
            <li> Not the real fragrance! Does not last.</li>
            <li> smells so good stays in forever I love the smell I always buy it pricey but its so good .</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, smells like roses.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> My most favorite scent by Jennifer. You won&#x27;t be dissapointed with this. I received an undamaged product and it is THE REAL THING. The smell is unbelievably sexy and like no other. Fast shipping by a great seller. I highly recommend this for your &amp;#34;romantic and cuddling moments&amp;#34; with your significant other; just don&#x27;t bath yourself in it. It&#x27;s a magnificent and powerful scent. Look up Jennifer&#x27;s other scents, you will LOVE.</li>
            <li> I got this gift for my sister for Christmas..she luvvvvved it!!! sprays on strong and then gets light...very soft and pleasant smell; but remember every perfume smells different on every person!</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance for day or evening wear.  I will purchase again.  It was perfect for her, evn during her pregnancy where she has been easily triggered to...well you know.</li>
            <li> It was very good thank you...</li>
            <li> Love it thank you😉☺️😊</li>
            <li> I think it was a good gift</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptic when ordering it cuz I thought maybe it was a scam but arrived on time and its not fake or imitation. Ive been buying this perfume from others for double the price, so I totally love the price!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews on Amazon anymore since it seems many who read them view them as a chance to start an online bash fast if the review given doesn&#x27;t agree with their own personal opinion of the product...but, I wish I had paid better attention to the not so positive reviews of this perfume before adding it to my wish list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I put this on my Amazon wish list because I love Glow by J.Lo and since this got so many great reviews, I stupidly assumed I would love this one too. Like other reviewers have stated, it does smell a bit &amp;#34;grandma-ish,&amp;#34; for lack of a better description. When I first sprayed it, it just smelled cheap.After mixing with my own chemistry, it&#x27;s just ok, nothing special. At least it fades enough so that I am not one of those women strangling others near me with overpowering perfume. I have learned my lesson to first try a perfume before buying or putting on a wish list!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any perfume, it&#x27;s all about how it mixes with your own chemistry, so just be sure to try this one out first to make sure it&#x27;s a good fit for you.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, for the first time I must rate negatively a product purchased from Amazon LLC. The inner package came completely damaged (actually torn and the liquid was leaking). It is unacceptable.</li>
            <li> My body temp usually \\&quot;burns\\&quot; most cologne/perfume.  At some point I can both smell the perfume and sometimes can taste it (have no idea why...).  So I tend to stick to body sprays from the likes of Bath &amp; Bodyworks.  A girlfriend of mine gifted this scent to me--claiming it to be too light for her.  It&#x27;s perfect for me.  I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.  Usually, someone will say, \\&quot;whoever smells citrusy--you smell really good!\\&quot;  It&#x27;s a strong enough scent for others to catch a whiff of it, but soft enough so that I don&#x27;t smell it unless I really sniff for it.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle now since I wear it on a near daily basis.  It&#x27;s definitely my go-to scent from now on.  I really appreciate that it is very pretty inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite and is usually difficult for me to find it. The price to me is perfect for this and the bottle is huge compared to others. I love this fragrance. If you are looking for something that has a sweet smell this is for you.</li>
            <li> It smells good.  I was not sure what to expect because I had never smelled this fragrance before.  I bought it because of the reviews.</li>
            <li> Very nice and bigger then thought.  Very very light smell.  It came on time and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Perfectly as described, good product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is the first J-Lo perfume that I have actually liked. It smells nice and flowery. The writing on the bottle is backwards though. I don&#x27;t get that....</li>
            <li> Smells amazingly fresh and clean. Great price, great product.</li>
            <li> One of my fav jams off her 3rd LP/ and the.fragance of STILL is soo romantic.On my skin,its a soft but lasting scent/and it smells like evening time.The bottle is sassy like Ms.Lopez.I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my class reunion. I had many people comment on how fresh and light it smells. My husband loves it! It has become my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; fragrance.</li>
            <li> Was a gift, my nieces loves it</li>
            <li> I ordered this without even knowing what it smelled like. I wanted a less flowery smelling perfume and that&#x27;s what I got! It&#x27;s a great price for a large bottle of very nice smelling perfume.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this particular scent and it was cheaper to buy on Amazon. That s a win- win!</li>
            <li> This is a great perfume. I&#x27;ve always loved Jenifer Lopez&#x27;s perfumes because they are really good quality perfumes. This one is no exception.</li>
            <li> the best and long lasting sent</li>
            <li> I absolutely liked the scent! I was skeptical because sometimes celebrity fragrances can be too sweet which I love but are too overpowering. This is a nice balance of floral and classy. Once it settles it is quite nice and subtle. Can see me using it everyday as a casual scent for work! Excellent service, product, and packaging. Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Covers up the smell of pot perfect. Thank you jlo!!</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent and I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years. But it&#x27;s hard to track down a bottle, and then it&#x27;s hard to find one reasonably priced. Amazon has both! I get to smell great for half the price; it&#x27;s an awesome deal.</li>
            <li> Got my favorite perfume really cheap and really fast! No complains at all! It is a good deal! Love it!</li>
            <li> Luv the bold smell so good....been wearin this for so many years .....u cant beat this smell it last all day ...n ppl ask me wat am i wearin...i tell dem&amp;#34; sill &amp;#34; by jlo.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this perfume. Receive lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, smells great! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister as a gift for her birthday since she is in love with this scent and she was very happy, price was perfect and was shipped fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume but I can find it here online for a better price than I can at stores.  When I can find it, it&#x27;s twice as high to buy in a department store than it is here.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my mom and she loved it. She said it smelled like a store perfume.And that it was a great deal and that she would buy more.</li>
            <li> Still by Jennifer Lopez is great. I love it so much I brought it as a gift for one of my friends. The delivery was great as well</li>
            <li> I loved the size and price of this, as this was a gift.  Friend was delighted with it, along with her other 2 gifts.</li>
            <li> Well worth any money spent. Love this perfume it makes me smell sexy</li>
            <li> This perfume is one of my favorites. I get compliments from random strangers about how good it smells. The price was just right.</li>
            <li> Oh Lord I bouht this perfume and I&#x27;m so happy, it is original and smell veryyyyy well. I love it.</li>
            <li> The smell is unique and so pleasant. I get compliments everywhere I go, and get numerous people asking what I&#x27;m wearing. I have and always will love this fragrance. JLO Glow is nice also, but Still is my fav.</li>
            <li> This is just the best scent ever made. I&#x27;ve tried many perfumes (I used to work at a high end dept store), but nothing compares to this. I&#x27;ve had more compliments than I can count, but the best, and most telling, of all would be my 1st date with my boyfriend. That night he said over and over \\&quot; you just smell so good\\&quot;. That was more than 4 years ago, and he still says the same thing. Not old smelling, not too strong.  Just slightly sweet, clean, fresh, and light. Lasts all day. I still smile when I lay my head on my pillow after a long day at work and home, and get that hint of freshness still in my hair. It&#x27;s amazing. No words can describe. If Jenny from the block is reading this, PLEASE never stop making this. It&#x27;s my signature and I&#x27;ve found nothing that even compares!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so curious about this perfume for so many years! The shipping was super quick--I received it within 2 days of ordering! I got a genuinely-factory sealed perfume box, and a beautiful 3.4oz bottle of the actual perfume! The smell is amazing! It is very fresh, a touch of citrus, slightly flowery, and has a floating scent of tea! Still is so feminine &amp; so unique! I love it! I am so excited about this purchase! I am so glad I was able to get such a deal on the 3.4oz, because I am obsessed! JLo&#x27;s perfumes have always been one of my most favorites! The scent lasts! I highly recommend this product! I included my personal photo as proof of how excited I am about this perfume!</li>
            <li> JLo Still should not be underestimated. This perfume was my signature scent when I lived in London and I can&#x27;t wear it without feeling absolutely happy and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This perfume used to cost me $60 for a small bottle. I used my previous spray solely for special occassions but now with this 3.4 oz bottle, I can smell sexy all day, e&#x27;ry day!  I may slowly purchase more to ensure I&#x27;m stocked up for life. Would hate to lose this scent.</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3I will never get tired of this scent! This is the scent i can use outside and in the office. It is nice that they still continue to sell/make it &amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Arrived. Item is as specified. Very good.</li>
            <li> very nice will buy again</li>
            <li> I live this perfume,I get so many compliments, from men and women, they love the smell,and so do I.</li>
            <li> my personal perfume...plus the price was...awesome...love it !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;m sorry, but...I don&#x27;t know what else to say...I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for...10+ more years...so...addicted ! )</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, great deal on price. I will be purchasing another as soon as I run out of it. thank you</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. So happy I can still get it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! I had this a couple if years ago and all this time I had no idea its on Amazon.I&#x27;m so happy I can find it easily now! I just received it and it smells so soft and pretty...I really love this scent!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. Sad it&#x27;s no longer being made.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, so I was expecting to really like this fragrance. Took it out of the box and sprayed it on my wrist.....nothing. Could barely smell anything!  Tried it again a day later and I really sprayed it on myself and my clothes....at last....a very nice pleasant scent. Doesn&#x27;t last however, although every now and then I would catch a whiff. I don&#x27;t want to over power anyone with my perfume....but I do expect to smell SOMETHING without having to bathe in this stuff. Maybe I got a bad bottle....but I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Smells soooo good and the bottle is very beautiful. Next to the original Glow, this is my fave of Jlo&#x27;s. I just read a review on a diff website about a diff perfume that if you put Vaseline on your skin before applying your scent it will last all day and beyond. I want to try this trick bc I don&#x27;t smell this on myself much longer after I spray it.</li>
            <li> Smells like bug spray. I was looking for a light clean scent...this is not it! I tried it for a couple weeks thinking I just had to get used to it but i never did. It always smelled bad and really strong to me.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume before from macy&#x27;s and the smell would last all day. I got it again from this site and it&#x27;s not original, it kind of smells the same but the smell does not last 30 minutes on...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Use this on a daily basis smells so good. I bought it after smelling it on a coworker. Its the perfect combo not too strong and not annoying after a while. I will keep ordering this until I&#x27;m old and grey. My husband loves it and got lots of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> delivery was surprisingly fast.  Although I believe they are authentic, it has an off smell about it...like..old? I don&#x27;t know if that makes sense.  But the smell is definitely off.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance. Hope they never run out. Don&#x27;t know what I would do if they did. Happy</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this and I love her smelling like this.</li>
            <li> Amazingly sweet, light floral scent. I wear it almost daily, &amp; the stone accent on the bottle is also a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! I get so many compliments when I wear it. It makes me feel so sexy yum &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This is just the best scent ever made!!!!! OMG i love it.... I&#x27;ve tried many perfumes but nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li> This perfume will stay with u all day when I where it people stop me to ask what  I have on love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for many years! My husband had bought it for me because he like the fragrance so I have stayed with it.&lt;br /&gt;I have had many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sister (it&#x27;s her favorite perfume) and she always gets so many compliments about the scent of the perfume and they always ask her what it is.</li>
            <li> This perfume was one of my faves,  and then it disappeared. It was nice to get it back!</li>
            <li> always loved this.. great price</li>
            <li> perfect,came just in time i love it thank you :)</li>
            <li> Great value and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This is a really good perfume, was a gift for my mom, it is a sweet scent but also fresh  and light, it sticks to my mom really well.</li>
            <li> Soft, nice long lasting fragance. Gets lot&#x27;s of nice remarks &amp;#34;You smell so good &amp;#34; what are you wearing?  Etc.</li>
            <li> ive always loved this scent and im happy to now have the big big bottle since I preserved my 1 oz size for so long.</li>
            <li> Sent in 2 days, love it !!!</li>
            <li> the best smelling perfume ever</li>
            <li> THE BEST PERFUME EVER. I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and it was a great price for the size. Ffor some reason there were a bunch of delays with the carrier. Finally got it today!😄</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, she wore this when we dated in high school, and she was thrilled to get it again. She couldn&#x27;t believe I was able to find it. Great product, outstanding value.  Delivery only took 3 days (it made it before Christmas) with standard shipping. Would definitely recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter.  She loves it and the price is a good value.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! So many compliments!!! I received so many compliments with this perfume, I suggest this perfume to the ladies, it has light scent that last all day long!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite perfumes which I must say is kind of hard to find now and days at the stores.  It has a very soft smell to it and have gotten many comments about it.  I noticed that the pretty smell doesn&#x27;t last all day like my previous bottle.  But I&#x27;m ok with that.  I still love it and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Still for 7 years and can go longer buy in a store. I like other perfumes but always go back to Still.</li>
            <li> Hard to find but here it is exactly what she wanted!</li>
            <li> I love it and have bought a total of 6.  It stays on you and have a lot people ask me what I am wearing</li>
            <li> I think the one that I bought is fake. I am a loyal user of J LO Still for over a year,the smell usually lasts long on my skin up to 3-4 hours, but this one wears off very quickly. It lasts less than 20 minutes and I have to spray again!! The original perfume usually smells very strong only with one spray, but I have to pray a few times to get the smell. Another thing I noticed is that it is spelled backwards on the bottle.. I am not happy with this. I just want to know whether the one that I got is original or fake.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and just what I wanted...thanks</li>
            <li> Could not find this anywhere in stores! Loved that you offer large bottles!!! Such a good deal... I bought two!!</li>
            <li> Yes, I love it. Thanks . IS awesome.</li>
            <li> This scent will never get old in my book...I love it.</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent. It was delivered early!</li>
            <li> It is a great Perfume. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the sent this is surely a good buy</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume at a wonderful price!! I will never pay the high price in a retail store again.</li>
            <li> A fragrance that leaves traces.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is beautiful. Very feminine and pretty. I&#x27;ve had many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!!  Smells warm and sexy.  Wish it lasted a little longer, fades fast.  I wear it all the time and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Grrrreat!!!!! Love this perfume....it&#x27;s seductive n sexxxxy! Came today n opened it up fresh!  I Love Amazon !!!</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful. Warm and cozy, smells like tea. I really like this. I&#x27;m starting to think you can&#x27;t go wrong with JLo&#x27;s fragrances.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and I could not find it in stores! I thought it was a lost cause but found it here. Thought it a little expensive until I got the bottle it is HUGE!</li>
            <li> My all time favorite perfume.  Jennifer Lopez has not made a scent better than this!  All others seem somewhat cheap, but this scent is awesome!</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume and I ordered it for her Birthday. It came on time as promised and was a great price. She loved it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell great..</li>
            <li> Excellent ! You will not be sorry for purchasing this product. Very pleasant smell! The price is very reasonable also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for many years. I had a major allergic reaction after using this particular bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume I was told they stopped making it happy I found it here</li>
            <li> This was the perfect size for the price I paid! What a great value! I will definetlly order again and tell my friends.</li>
            <li> todo tal como lo esperaba, la entrega fue rapida y el producto llego en excelentes condiciones, la compra fue un exito</li>

            <li> I love this parfum, it has become one of my favorites.  Its scent is very delicate, soft aroma that will let anyone in the room know that you just arrived by awakening their senses. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> It took a little longer then expected to arrive, being that I am a Prime member. However well worth the wait I am super excited to have this scent in my hands again!</li>
            <li> I enjoy wearing these brands of perfume</li>
            <li> My fiance bought this perfume for me from Amazon once before. I Loved the smell.</li>

            <li> Bought this product for my wife and she loves it.  Smells great on her and my daughter loves it as well.</li>
            <li> I got this perfume for Christmas. I am very picky when it comes to perfume but I had no problem with this one. Next to Marc Jacobs Daisy Eu So Fresh, this is my go-to perfume. So delicate and sexy, it sets lovely into your skin. I&#x27;m so happy I received this. Try it; you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>

            <li> I must say that this purchase was well worth every penny ❤️❤️❤️❤️ I use to own a perfume that smelled very similar to this one .. It was discontinued long ago so you can imagine how much I love this perfume MY NEW FAVORITE 👌</li>
            <li> Fresh and subtle but not too subtle.</li>
            <li> Love it, scent is romantic and sexy</li>
            <li> This is the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever purchased and I just can&#x27;t get enough of it. Every time I wear it I received just amazing compliments and everyone says it&#x27;s smells so good. I hope they never stop making this perfume because it&#x27;s become my signature fragrances.</li>
            <li> Never had it before and g/f loved it. Not to bad for never smelling it before. Highly recommended for any woman!!</li>
            <li> Got it for my mom and she LOVES it! She gets compliments everywhere about how nice she smells. Got myself one too.</li>
            <li> i smell absolutely fabulous! and feel like i&#x27;m slipping into something glamorous whenever i wear it. thank you jennifer lopez:)</li>
            <li> Happy I can still purchase this perfume on-line!!</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s all time favorite</li>
            <li> Always great perfume every time I&#x27;ve ordered JLo&#x27;s still</li>
            <li> Too bad they took it off the market.  J Lo&#x27;s Still is not too strong and has a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> thanks it so expensive else where&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;walgreens stopped carring it.  they cost way more anyway.  so pleased.  thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;Jodi</li>
            <li> Great price for the size and packaging was excellent.  It turned to be a good place to go for hard-to-find items.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt; Wearing it for years an still love the smell!</li>
            <li> Smells GREAT! I love it!</li>
            <li> I have had so many people tell me how good I smell and ask what I am wearing!! It&#x27;s a good everyday parfum, you only need a few sprays and it last all day. I looked for this scent in many department store and I was not able to locate it. Thank goodness for amazon! I would recommend &amp;#34;Still&amp;#34; this to anyone that like a stronger parfum,</li>
            <li> more then met my expectations.</li>
            <li> Love the time of delivery but the product itself was a little dissapointed</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes of all time! Great price!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and so does everyone else when I were it! I always get compliments on how good I smell. The best part is,is that it lasts all day,compared to others. Nice size bottle at a great price!</li>
            <li> Smells delicious. Very clean scent. Wanted to jump all over the girl I smelled this on. And I&#x27;m a girl...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly suggest</li>
            <li> my fave forever! thanks for the samples. :)</li>
            <li> Love it. Nice perfume at a great price.</li>
            <li> Favorite perfume. Its getting harder to find. I always get compliments and no one can guess what it is. Ive been wearing since I was 16. Im 28 now. Great all year fragance too.</li>
            <li> Real perfume on time happy with order</li>
            <li> Bought for wife, she and I really like it</li>
            <li> This is my go to scent. I am frequently complimented on it. 1 of these usually lasts me more than a year, so I think it is a good value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for 2 years now and I ALWAYS get compliments on it!  Normally I would be sick of a perfume by now but I still love it.  It&#x27;s not overbearing...very nice scent.  Almost daily someone near me says I smell so good.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this scent for 10 years now.  Not too heavy, and smells delicious.  I always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I always loved this perfume by J.Lo. It smells great and the bottle is pretty big. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This perfume arrived SUPER quickly and in perfect condition: in a brand new, unopened box. I was nervous because I had read some reviews from people saying that they had gotten a knock-off or a perfume that didn&#x27;t smell like anything. This perfume smells nice; warm and sweet and lasts all day. I sprayed it this morning at 7am and now at 9:30pm, I still smell it just as strongly as I did 10+ hours ago. The bottle itself is a decent size (especially for the price) and looks very pretty on the vanity.</li>
            <li> This is my favourite parfum, great size, great price, excellent quality ! I couldn´t buy it in free shops so Im happy to buy it here!</li>
            <li> Like most perfume sprays it doesn&#x27;t smell good right when you spray it but a few minutes later and you get the light and pretty fragrance. I am not a perfume wearer except for this one. I find most perfumes to be too strong and overpowering. I really like this scent.</li>
            <li> Great price shipped fast</li>
            <li> I gave this perfume to daughter as a christmas gift and she loved it very much. Happy with the order.</li>
            <li> I will never buy a Jennifer Lopez-perfume, thru Amazon. This is the worse one I bought. I am not happy with it, I lost my money! I would like to return it and you can smell it. It smells very old and really offensive!! Please pass the note to the seller.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite perfume of all time. I love it. Many stores didn&#x27;t carry it, but i&#x27;m glad i found the bigger size here at the price that&#x27;s listed here. i am extremely happy with the purchase. it shipped pretty fast too</li>
            <li> Item arrived as described and is much cheaper than in stores like Macy&#x27;s, Kohl&#x27;s, Perfumania, etc.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this purfume! It has a very light and sensual scent to it. And I have gotten many compliments on this scent. Still is my go to purfume everyday and it never gets old! Do buy it. The delivery was prompt. And packaging was excellent. I will be purchasing from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this perfume! I&#x27;ve owned J.Lo perfumes in the past (Glow, Miami Glow, Glow After Dark) that I received as gifts and I really cannot stand them! I had all but given up on \\&quot;J.Lo scents\\&quot; until, once again, my Grandmother gave me yet another J.Lo perfume for Christmas.It was Still. That was about 5 years ago. And I STILL love it! I actually ask for it now when I&#x27;m asked for gifts ideas. Lol But, this is NOT your \\&quot;grandmother&#x27;s\\&quot; perfume. It has a nice, sweet &amp; sexy scent..and I&#x27;ve never gotten more comments on a perfume than I have on this one! Both men, and women have commented on it... especially the men! And it&#x27;s like a magnet for them! Beware &amp; enjoy!!  haha ;)</li>
            <li> I have had try 3 others jlo perfumes but this one is the best I recived a lots of compliments</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!! One of my favorites!! Smells great! My go to perfume!! It&#x27;s one of Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s first perfumes and I will buy it as long as they sell it!</li>
            <li> I bought this with some hesitancy, not expecting it to be exactly the same as I&#x27;ve purchased in the stores.  However, I was pleasantly surprised and the size of the bottle was actually larger than I planned on!  Smells the same as what I&#x27;ve bought before, so I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE perfume!</li>
            <li> I got a lot of compliments from men when I wore this but not my favorite fragrance. As far as amazon goes delivery was on time</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction, really fast delivery - thank you - Love it</li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE perfume! I always get compliments when i wear it! And you can&#x27;t beat this price! Get one every year! A++</li>
            <li> i love this perfume. i started using it almost 10 years ago then got sad when i could barely find it in stores. so stoked i decided to give in to the internet purchasing. so glad i got it. and it came a day early! woot woot</li>
            <li> I do not normally leave bad feed back in this type of forum I would rather contact the seller first, however there is no where that I have found to do so. THIS is my favorite perfume and this does not have a scent! YOU spray it on and at first it remotely smells like &amp;#34;Still&amp;#34; Which is the only perfume I wear so I know what it is supposed to smell like.. Either this is a bad bottle or this seller ripped me off! I am a bit upset and would love to be able to find out what happened here! I need someone to contact me regarding this purchase I AM NOT ONE BIT HAPPY HERE!!!  VERY disappointed and would like to return this for my money back!! THIS WAS the only thing I had ever gotten on Amazon that was NOT as it was advertised.  Very saddened by this experience........... I want my perfume............ NOT a  bottle of water...............</li>
            <li> Sorry, not my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is a mine and my daughters all time favorite.  Smells great and lasts a very long time.  Beautiful scent.</li>
            <li> I really liked, good price, and smells sooo good!&lt;br /&gt;People usually ask me the name of it ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ui ui</li>
            <li> Very satisfied and happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it !!</li>
            <li> Greaaaaaaat parfume. I love the smell. It&#x27;s soo nice and fresh.</li>
            <li> This one is the least overpowering of the cleb scents. Definleny well worth wearing, not to ment mention trying. Great!</li>
            <li> Smells like Jlo&#x27;s stinky vajayjay</li>
            <li> Smells good. Great price, good amount of perfume.</li>
            <li> I love this soft scent. It is also very long lasting.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty authentic.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, but not loud enough&#x27; or should I say, doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I wish they didn&#x27;t stop carrying this stuff in store because it&#x27;s my favorite! Much better than the others (I think).</li>
            <li> We love the smell of this perfume and the price was the best on the internet. It was a great buy.</li>
            <li> i love the smell to this and the order came in on time. great present to give to someone. very nice</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this based on other reviews but I don&#x27;t love it.  I like it but I like  &amp;#34;Glow&amp;#34; much  better.</li>
            <li> I have a habit of falling in love with items that are discontinued. I am very happy i found this perfume. It is my go to scent for daily wear.</li>
            <li> Smell is soft and I cant smell it very often but others do. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> it was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Totally love this smell! I always get compliments when I wear this perfume!</li>
            <li> This has always been my fave perfume.  It smells delightful.  I was impressed with the large size bottle and the low price.  Definitely ordering this again...</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase it because of its low price and because it was one of those &amp;#34;celebrity perfumes&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Now STILL for Women by JLo is among my favorite everyday wears - delicate sent of flowers with a touch of honey. Very personal and intimate aroma which makes it part of you (not some loudly screaming sent which takes over the whole room and gives everyone a huge headache).&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my new find! Defiantly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with buying products from this store, recommend and hope to make future purchases of the same, because they are very acceptable and excellent what they sell.</li>
            <li> yes thanks I just love it.</li>
            <li> I truly love this.Thank God Amazon has it and by far less than everyone else..</li>
            <li> Smells great, has a strong smell that will last hours! Im happy</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume....great price</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find this product on Amazon. None of our local retailers carry it any longer, but I don&#x27;t know why, I love this fragrance and so does anyone who smell it.  I was really suprised at what a great deal I got!  I was used to paying much more at the store, when I could actually find it.  This is J Lo&#x27;s best in my opinion. Once time a parent in my class asked what smelled so nice, and all my students burst out, it&#x27;s our teacher, she always smells like that!  How is that for a confirmation?</li>
            <li> his was a gift and my sister liked it...was ecstatic because she ran out and needed another</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling perfume ever J. Lo did this right and the preice is fantastic, soooo reasonable. This is much more money in the store.</li>
            <li> I searched for this for so long because for some reason they don&#x27;t sell it in my state.........or at least not in any close by areas. I had purchased it once before years ago when I was living in another state. When I moved, I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere! Thanks to Amazon, I have found it again. I am so in love and people always ask me what I am wearing. I just tell them &amp;#34;they don&#x27;t sell it in the state&amp;#34; because I don&#x27;t like to smell like everybody else. lol</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, very clean and sofisticated scent!</li>
            <li> I love that it came on time. Its one of my favorite perfumes but i wish I knew at the time that I could have ordered the lotion as well.</li>
            <li> Still a number one favorite</li>
            <li> Love the smell its one of my all time favorite from Jennifer Lopez. It&#x27;s a must have! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Ive been wearing this for about 8 yrs. Shortly after it came out. Ive always gotten lots of compliments. Now i cant find it in stores. I tried some Coach. Its nice but my Still is better. Grateful &amp; relived i can get it on-line. Thank you</li>
            <li> I always receive a compliment when wearing this fragrance.</li>
