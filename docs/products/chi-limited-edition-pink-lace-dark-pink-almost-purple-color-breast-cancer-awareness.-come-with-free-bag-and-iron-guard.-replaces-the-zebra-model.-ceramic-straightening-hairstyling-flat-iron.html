            <li>Getting ready to order one for my best friend for Christmas.</li>

            <li>Love Chi products.</li>
            <li>I LOVE chi products.</li>
            <li>Leaves me a bit concerned over if this product is a knock-off or authentic.</li>
            <li>I normally love the CHI brand.</li>
            <li>So satisfied with my new chi flat irons, they are cute and the Quality is AWESOME!</li>
            <li>Feel as if this product is a cheap imatation.</li>
            <li>however it was supposed to come with a free nail polish and the nail polish</li>
            <li>Looks like cheap toy.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, heats and cools quickly.</li>
            <li>It heats up just as well as the normal 1\\&quot; chi, but is cute &amp; colorful!</li>
            <li>but hopefully its not fake!</li>
            <li>I used it as soon as it arrived, (my hair was a mess) and I was happy with the transformation it made on my head.</li>
            <li>CHI is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This straightner doesn&#x27;t even get hot, doesn&#x27;t even get close to straightening my hair, if I didn&#x27;t already throw away the box I would return it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it doesn&#x27;t get as hot or what....</li>
            <li>it did not even get hot</li>
            <li>In addition, the outer part gets too hot to handle.  </li>
            <li>have been an issue due to slight paint ware but after some careful examining and a first time use this is definitely a Chi and a very good straightener for a very good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my second CHI iron &amp; I love it just as much as the first (before it died.</li>
            <li>Yet cute enough that she wants to use it.</li>
            <li>I certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Very unsatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I really wonder if it is a real Chi by Farouk iron.  </li>
            <li>I should have spent more $ and got what I knew worked.  </li>
            <li>I got this as a gift for christmas and on the outside it came with something free</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe it is a real chi product.</li>
            <li>THANKS AMAZON FOR THE GREAT DEAL ON A BRAND NEW PAIR OF PINK ZEBRA PRINT CHI FLAT IRONS!!!</li>
            <li>It is strong enough to survive my teenage daughter.  </li>
            <li>Its the only brand that i use for my straighteners because they are the only ones that get hot enough for my hair, and don&#x27;t pull it out or fry it to a crisp.</li>
            <li>Buy from the company directly or from a salon.</li>
            <li>&amp; this iron REALLY helps manage my coarse hair.</li>
            <li>1st plug in barely any heat.</li>

            <li> This Chi doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the other one I owned</li>
            <li> My other daughters iron doesn&#x27;t have that problem.  </li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use ANY other iron.</li>
            <li> THIS ALSO ADDS TO THE PINK AND BLACK ANIMAL PRINT ACCESSORIES</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and less than two months if would not heat up.</li>
            <li> I had this straightener for less than a month</li>
            <li> At first I received this Iron and was afraid there&lt;br /&gt;may</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT A REAL CHI!!!</li>
            <li> My other Chi iron lasted me 5 years, I&#x27;ll never stop using their irons!!</li>
            <li> but it was missing</li>
            <li> was missing.</li>
            <li> Usually I buy them from a salon,</li>
            <li> i could use it when i got home by the time i used it 3 times and it broke the return date was past</li>
            <li> and it hardly heats up.</li>
            <li> I have not heard one complaint out of her about it..</li>
            <li> Save your money because this is a waste!!</li>
            <li> Not a good idea to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I work very hard for my money and and do not like to be taken advantage of.  </li>
            <li> Not happy at all, I order a lot from amazon and im really not happy with this at all.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed, but realize AGAIN you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> so I am wondering either the seller took it or its a fake???</li>
            <li> I contacted the manufacturer (farouk) and found out that this is a fake and not covered by them.</li>
            <li> IF the label says &amp;#34;Made in USA&amp;#34; for this product, they are a fake.</li>

            <li> My daugehter loves this Chi iron. The colors match her vanity and the iron works great! She wanted a chi iron and this is a great one.</li>
            <li> This Chi doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the other one I owned I don&#x27;t know if it doesn&#x27;t get as hot or what.... Really disappointed!</li>
            <li> it did not even get hot it would cut off on its own. Very unsatisfied with this product. Feel as if this product is a cheap imatation.</li>
            <li> The ceramic plate is already sliding.  I really wonder if it is a real Chi by Farouk iron.  The quality isn&#x27;t there.  It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my past ones.  The temperature is not on the packaging, inserts, or the iron itself.  In addition, the outer part gets too hot to handle.  I am not impressed, but realize AGAIN you get what you pay for.  I should have spent more $ and got what I knew worked.  I would like to hear back from the sellers concerning this piece.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for christmas and on the outside it came with something free but it was missing so I am wondering either the seller took it or its a fake??? I have not used it yet but hopefully its not fake!</li>
            <li> This Chi does NOT work. I&#x27;ve had it for 3 months and the paint is rubbing off and it hardly heats up. Save your money because this is a waste!!</li>
            <li> Great product!  I love it! I used it as soon as it arrived, (my hair was a mess) and I was happy with the transformation it made on my head.</li>
            <li> If you are considering buying a flat iron than this is it. Love Chi products. They last last forever. Would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girl friend.  I have not heard one complaint out of her about it..and that&#x27;s saying something</li>
            <li> I LOVE chi products. This straightener is not only pleasing to the eye but also straightens my hair well. Definitely a great product and worth a buy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this straightener! It heats up just as well as the normal 1\\&quot; chi, but is cute &amp; colorful!</li>
            <li> Bought this iron for my youngest daughter in July and bought my oldest daughter the white and black CHI Zebra in back in February.  They are both still working great and they are very happy.  My oldest daughters has worn a bit on one side, but I think it is because she uses a ton of spray and product on her hair and I don&#x27;t think she rinses her hands and it gets sticky, like everything else she touches in the bathroom!  My other daughters iron doesn&#x27;t have that problem.  Getting ready to order one for my best friend for Christmas. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> At first I received this Iron and was afraid there&lt;br /&gt;may have been an issue due to slight paint ware but after some careful examining and a first time use this is definitely a Chi and a very good straightener for a very good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it.(:</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT A REAL CHI!!! IT QUIT WORKING AND THE PLATES BROKE OFF IN JUST A FEW SHORT MONTHS!!!</li>
            <li> THIS ALSO ADDS TO THE PINK AND BLACK ANIMAL PRINT ACCESSORIES THAT MY DAUGHTER IS IN TO THIS YEAR ..</li>
            <li> The product works as expected however it was supposed to come with a free nail polish and the nail polish was missing. The box appeared to have been opened and beat up before it was shipped to me. Leaves me a bit concerned over if this product is a knock-off or authentic.</li>
            <li> I had mine for about 2 months and it died while i was straightening my hair.  P.S. I dont straighten my hair that often, so it was maybe the 5th time I used it and it died</li>
            <li> It is trendy and a great tool for my tween daughter!  It is easy to use, heats and cools quickly.</li>
            <li> after about a month this product started smoking when it was plugged in. I don&#x27;t believe it is a real chi product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and less than two months if would not heat up. Message the merchant and Amazon to resolve the issue and the only people I heard from was amazon. I contacted the manufacturer (farouk) and found out that this is a fake and not covered by them. WARNING: IF the label says &amp;#34;Made in USA&amp;#34; for this product, they are a fake. BEWARE! Waiting to see what Amazon is going to do for us.</li>
            <li> 1st plug in barely any heat. 2nd plug in no heat. Looks like cheap toy. Not a good idea to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I normally love the CHI brand. Its the only brand that i use for my straighteners because they are the only ones that get hot enough for my hair, and don&#x27;t pull it out or fry it to a crisp. Usually I buy them from a salon, But I didn&#x27;t have the funds for a 200 dollar one this time. This straightener must have been used Before I got it because it was NOT getting as Hot as CHI usually does. It is either a knock off or was used before hand. I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING CHI brand from Amazon. Buy from the company directly or from a salon.</li>
            <li> I used this thing 3 times and it broke! I was in AIT for the army when i ordered it to my house os i could use it when i got home by the time i used it 3 times and it broke the return date was past so I could not return it and it did not give me a number to call and explain my situation</li>
            <li> This is my second CHI iron &amp; I love it just as much as the first (before it died. Had it a while) I stopped chemically relaxing my hair 5yrs ago &amp; this iron REALLY helps manage my coarse hair. Wouldn&#x27;t use ANY other iron. I recommend it to ALL my girlfriends! CHI is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> So satisfied with my new chi flat irons, they are cute and the Quality is AWESOME! THANKS AMAZON FOR THE GREAT DEAL ON A BRAND NEW PAIR OF PINK ZEBRA PRINT CHI FLAT IRONS!!!</li>
            <li> Contacted seller several times about package delivery date.  Finally received today (8/28/12) what I thought was the package. I knew when i took it out of the mailbox there was nothing in it.  IT WAS EMPTY.  Who would send an empty package in the mail then say it weighed 1lbs &amp; 9oz? No way....  I work very hard for my money and and do not like to be taken advantage of.  Treat others as you would like to be treated.  All I was is either my CHI or my money back!  I&#x27;ve also asked the seller to conact me as soon as possible.  I will see if the seller does.</li>
            <li> I had this straightener for less than a month and I take very good care of my stuff used it about 4 times and it already wont turn on.</li>
            <li> I received my Chi today &amp; I love it! I have been a Chi user for over 10 years &amp; I won&#x27;t use anything else! My other Chi iron lasted me 5 years, I&#x27;ll never stop using their irons!!</li>
            <li> It is strong enough to survive my teenage daughter.  Yet cute enough that she wants to use it. I certainly recommend it.</li>
