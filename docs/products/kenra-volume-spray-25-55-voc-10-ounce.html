            <li>This hairspray is great if you don&#x27;t want your hair to be too crunchy and it also has a nice light scent.</li>
            <li>nozzle can sometimes clogg, so rinse it with warm water when done with it</li>
            <li>I love being able to order both items online!  </li>
            <li>This is by far THE best hairspray I have ever used.</li>

            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this hairspray!</li>
            <li>Despite the good reviews, it sure didn&#x27;t hold my fine hair at all and the odor was more than I bargained for.  </li>
            <li>Holds nicely even with my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>Love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>My hair never looked better.</li>
            <li>She seems to LOVE this hairspray</li>
            <li>so I was hoping that it would perform better.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair fuller and with more volume.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found it, will continue to buy this product.  </li>
            <li>My hair does feel more secured after using this.</li>
            <li>I have been using this hairspray for over a year now and love it.</li>
            <li>There is nothing else on the market that can do a better job for any amount of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I love this spray.</li>
            <li>and I was pleased that it performed well there too.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Absolutely love love it.</li>
            <li>Joico Joimist Medium works much better.</li>
            <li>Better pricing with Amazon than retail stores.</li>
            <li>I love Kenra products, but I don&#x27;t love this one.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>this means that most hairsprays flatten and pull out my curls.</li>
            <li>and it held my style in place perfectly with no extra weight.</li>
            <li>Outstanding hairspray.</li>
            <li>I have used many products over the years, but I love this one for styling.  </li>
            <li>Definitely my favorite</li>
            <li>I love their products been using for a couple years now.</li>
            <li>Cost more in the store.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>It works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brands.  </li>
            <li>Kenra volume spray is my all-time favorite hair spray.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>I have been using this hair spray for many years.  </li>
            <li>It is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>I would keep searching for something better, but it probably depends on your hair type.</li>
            <li>like the volume spray  and love all the products</li>
            <li>I have tried so many kinds of volume hair spray since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for all most a month</li>
            <li>It does the job. :)</li>
            <li>Love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love this hair spray.  </li>
            <li>I love this spray.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky like most hairsprays I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I love this spray...</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the hairspray</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use it, but it seems to be more of a hairspray than a volume spray.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>and I love the hold.  </li>
            <li>and I was always so pleased</li>
            <li>Both great for keeping the style without the old lady feel!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light on my hair and holds my style perfectly all day - even thru the high humidity in the south!  </li>
            <li>so the value is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Have used many salon products, and Kenra is still a favorite of mine, particularily for fine hair to give and maintain volume.</li>
            <li>great for fine straight hair...really holds without stiffness...</li>
            <li>Best long hold hairspray out there!</li>
            <li>I love Kenra 25 hairspray, it gives you a fine mist, but it holds your hair.</li>
            <li>Even when my very fine hair, which needs lots of support, is clean, this &amp;#34;dulls</li>
            <li>I can lightly spray it throughout my hair and scrunch once or twice to make my curls more springy and defined with hold</li>
            <li>It provides incredible, all-day lasting hold.</li>
            <li>Great deal, shipped super fast and will purchase again&lt;</li>
            <li>It provided the best hold and humidity block than any other hairspray I&#x27;ve used, period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair type: Kinky curly.</li>
            <li>It is not the best ever spray (as some other reviews state).</li>
            <li>Product washed out easily when shampooing.</li>
            <li>Yes&lt;br /&gt;Sweat easily?:</li>
            <li>Overall, this hairspray is worth every penny - it is the best on the market.</li>
            <li>Works well for volume and as a hairspray, but is easy to overuse.</li>
            <li>Does not have a strong hold on hair.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong smell that would overpower.  </li>
            <li>My mum who uses it frequently finds that it layers perfectly; she has straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li>The product works fine, but if someone is going to pay $18-20 bucks for a bottle of hairspray, the merchant should deliver the bottle in an undamaged form.</li>
            <li>This spray is the best hairspray that I&#x27;ve used and has little to no smell.</li>
            <li>Did a little shopping around and found the perfect seller on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The hair spray itself is fine and does a good job, but I was surprised at the dents.</li>
            <li>This is the best hairspray -hands down!  </li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have the finest, thinnest hair and have tried every spray available.</li>
            <li>I use it for my bangs every day, and to secure up-dos.  </li>
            <li>and I liked it to much that I asked to purchase the product.  </li>
            <li>Great product and the ONLY hairspray on the market today that I know of that you can immediately comb through!  </li>
            <li>This hairspray is great for adding volume and helps with second day hair.</li>
            <li>This spray has a great hold and personally, I like the smell!</li>
            <li>Fantastic hold</li>
            <li>But overall I am happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how cheap it is too</li>
            <li>It is worth the money, it does not take as much to keep looking good.</li>
            <li>Therefore, it&#x27;s fair to say that this product works well with nearly all hair types.</li>
            <li>I buy a lot from good old Amazon</li>
            <li>it has excellent hold without being too stiff.  </li>
            <li>I primarily use this along with a liquid mousse to maintain a unique style.</li>
            <li>Super strong so a touch &#x27;ll do ya.</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin hair, this is the best product I have ever used!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Excellent product and worth every penny !</li>
            <li>Love the product and the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>Best hairspray around and price is usually competitive with ULTA.</li>
            <li>Hair spray did not have normal nice fragrance</li>
            <li>It clogs with every use and is a pain to clean.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found this to be a great finishing spray after letting my hair air dry or diffusing.</li>
            <li>Great hold on limp hair, I have tried many others.</li>
            <li>Brushes out cleanly.  </li>
            <li>Dominique Sachsa was right!  </li>
            <li>The can stops spraying (nothing seems to \\&quot;unclog\\&quot; it) and they are still almost full.</li>
            <li>Smells like sweet tarts, not obnoxiously.</li>
            <li>SO it does not do well with the humidity as much as I like, but still does better than others.</li>
            <li>It has super hold in any weather and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and holds well.</li>
            <li>Lucky accident.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like aerosol super glue</li>
            <li>I have very fine soft hair that won&#x27;t hold hair spray..</li>
            <li>The can lasts a long time, the sprayer rarely jams up w/ gook and when it does, it is easily removed by running warm water over it.</li>
            <li>My new favorite hair spray... holding up under Seattle weather.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t leave your house without spraying this on your hair first!</li>
            <li>Kenra Super Hold Finishing Spray keeps them right where I put them.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and with age has gotten much thinner..  </li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair that does not hold curls well.</li>
            <li>This is the only aerosol spray that holds my hair and the price was amazing.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>It is SO worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>Not for any kind of daily use, IMO.</li>
            <li>Expensive but worth it for special occasions and perfect hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>You can spray and continue to work your hair until it is right</li>
            <li>It keep volume without becoming sticky, allowing hair to move naturally.</li>
            <li>This large size lasts me for months!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend, it&#x27;s worth the switch!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hold is perfect -long lasting, not flaky, not heavy, mists evenly and</li>
            <li>it worked very, very well.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has walked into the bathroom right after I have used it and commented on how good it smells -- drastically different from my old spray where she asked to leave the room if I was getting ready to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it on the recommendation of a Youtuber that i follow who is a prominent public figure in the news business.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Volume Spray purchase</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t corroborate since this is my first time using a hairspray.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>Of COURSE the nozzle gets &amp;#34;gunked&amp;#34; up, as do all hair sprays, but running it under hot water takes care of the problem.</li>
            <li>It will definitely hold better than water-based or any product that lists water as the first ingredient.</li>
            <li>However, the real reason I obsess over this spray compared to others is the smell!</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend it!!</li>
            <li>This stuff really holds the hair and gives it body, but also takes away the shine!  </li>
            <li>My first time using it myself</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, but it is soft, fine, and straight.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much improvement in volume with this and like most products, made my hair oily the next day.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing it, as it is entirely worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I am pretty cheap when I comes to buying beauty products (definitely a Walmart shopper in that arena)</li>
            <li>This certainly adds body while it hold.  </li>
            <li>Great for hair with a little more texture, not so much for straight slick hair.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida where the humidity is high and hair gets frizzy quick.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to spend this much at first, but the product came so highly recommended that I tried it.</li>
            <li>It holds good and doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard.</li>
            <li>Holds but very sticky.  </li>
            <li>My bride says it works really well.  </li>
            <li>It gets all clogged up and no matter how much i wash the hole where the spray comes out, it still continues to stay clogged and sticky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve rinsed it and gently rubbed the sprayer</li>
            <li>Thanks Kenra.</li>
            <li>I really like this spray -</li>
            <li>And it holds up to heat and humidity really well.  </li>
            <li>and I found it here much cheaper than elsewhere.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much for it to hold my hair all day</li>
            <li>Now my hairs have been mostly straight for a while, I found using conditioner will even ruin my hairs&#x27; volume.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>Works very well on the hair, but it does leave a sticky residue on the floor, hair brush, etc.</li>
            <li>And, thanks to Amazon, it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li>so you only need light sprays.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t care for this product.  </li>
            <li>I prefer some hold but not this much.</li>
            <li>This is a product that really delivers.</li>
            <li>it really holds the hair in place.</li>
            <li>I wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much</li>
            <li>I have fine and flat straight hair.</li>
            <li>It holds great, but doesn&#x27;t look stiff and gross like some hairsprays.</li>
            <li>I live in sunny, hot, HUMID SW Florida....</li>
            <li>My other favorite is Prive #89.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that the sprayer doesn&#x27;t get clogged like so many other aerosol hairsprays do.</li>
            <li>Also seems less drying than other top salon brands I&#x27;ve used and adds more shine.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray--keeps hair in place all day without being too sticky or glued down.  </li>
            <li>Many volume and control hairsprays weighed my hair down and destroyed the shine.  </li>
            <li>but I can tolerate it because I love the soft and natural looking hold, especially in times of high humidity.  </li>
            <li>My hair has gotten drier as I have grown older</li>
            <li>Even with being around the ocean and high heat/humidity</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly suggest trying this is you have been considering it.</li>
            <li>Makes hair a little crunchy, so there may be a bit more of a learning curve with this product than with others.</li>
            <li>It creates amazing hold and volume without making your hair feel hard.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thin, very fine, and resistant to styling so most products designed for hold either weigh it down or aren&#x27;t strong enough to provide hold.</li>
            <li>but I definitely think this is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has terrific hold and is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I live in a hot, very humid climate, and this is the only spray that works.  </li>
            <li>My friend told me the other day that she uses it to add volume to her fine hair</li>
            <li>Not to mention that I had more breakage because it was so stiff.  </li>
            <li>I have a very fine hair and it just relaxed into a very limp curl  that eventually disappeared after using this hairspray.</li>
            <li>Cant live without it.</li>
            <li>This has become my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; spray.</li>
            <li>Plus it actually smells good (at least I think so).</li>
            <li>My hair looks very natural and still moves when I move.  </li>
            <li>Very natural</li>
            <li>I live in constant humidity in Florida and this stuff works better than the 30 other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I can use this hairspray the first day and a lighter one the next day.  </li>
            <li>and when I straighten it or curl it with a hot iron, this spray keeps it from frizzing back up.  </li>
            <li>This is the second can of Kenra I have purchased and the first one I had, the cap always gummed up.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong.  </li>
            <li>I also like to use this to control flyaways; you can spray a bit on your palms and smooth them over your hair to flatten them down and lock them in place.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and items were packed carefully and protected.</li>
            <li>It is actually a little sticky feeling on my fine hair and it has a bit of perfume-like smell which I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li>And overall it was just too heavy for my very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find in my city, so I was happy to see I could purchase it (&amp; for less money than in stores/salons) on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is a great hairspray that does NOT leave your hair bogged down the next day, either.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and I like a firm hold.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but lots of it, and in humid weather it just goes limp and floppy.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft not stiff feeling, but holds all day.</li>
            <li>This spray was actually purchased for our Old English Sheepdog in preperation for her first show!</li>
            <li>Its a huge hassle cleaning it EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li>I took it with me on vacation last week to a very humid climate</li>
            <li>the fragrance is not heavy.</li>
            <li>Since my natural texture is curly/wavy</li>
            <li>Nowadays I am embracing my natural texture</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, but holds without being sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li>I read other reviews and this one is supposedly better smelling than other hairsprays out there?</li>
            <li>so much!&lt;br /&gt;I have very long and straight hair</li>
            <li>Applying it after blow dry, my hairs hold for the whole day.</li>
            <li>I would pair this up with a good oil moisturizer to prevent your hair from feeling hard or stiff.</li>
            <li>It keeps it from frizzing like no other.  </li>
            <li>I just finished my first can of Kenra and have decided to try other options.  </li>
            <li>so I compared bottle to one from local store &amp;amp; found it was old with a date stamp of 2009!</li>
            <li>Little pricey but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I also love their blow dry spray which cuts down on the blow dry time.</li>
            <li>Maybe this is a problem common to most hairsprays, but it has been so long since I used another brand that I have forgotten.  </li>
            <li>If you have thin hair, or hair that needs more body and volume...</li>
            <li>Arrived super fast, for which I am grateful, but unfortunately, really poor packaging that caused the bottle to dent.  </li>
            <li>This is the first hairspray that held volume in my hair all day with only a few bursts and it looks so natural.</li>
            <li>Not what was expected per description but still a decent product.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely stiff, very quickly, and not very workable afterward at all, and a can lasts a surpringly short amount of time, to boot.</li>
            <li>Seemed drying and just not a good fit for my highlighted hair.</li>
            <li>The scent is sort of heavy at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different hairsprays &amp; this one is exactly as its described.  </li>
            <li>I have, and always have had extremely fine and thin hair.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this hairspray!</li>
            <li> Despite the good reviews, it sure didn&#x27;t hold my fine hair at all and the odor was more than I bargained for.  </li>

            <li> My hair never looked better.</li>
            <li> She seems to LOVE this hairspray</li>
            <li> so I was hoping that it would perform better.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair fuller and with more volume.  </li>
            <li> Glad I found it, will continue to buy this product.  </li>
            <li> My hair does feel more secured after using this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hairspray for over a year now and love it.</li>
            <li> There is nothing else on the market that can do a better job for any amount of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this spray.</li>
            <li> and I was pleased that it performed well there too.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Absolutely love love it.</li>
            <li> Joico Joimist Medium works much better.</li>
            <li> Better pricing with Amazon than retail stores.</li>
            <li> I love Kenra products, but I don&#x27;t love this one.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> this means that most hairsprays flatten and pull out my curls.</li>
            <li> and it held my style in place perfectly with no extra weight.</li>
            <li> Outstanding hairspray.</li>
            <li> I have used many products over the years, but I love this one for styling.  </li>
            <li> Definitely my favorite</li>
            <li> I love their products been using for a couple years now.</li>
            <li> Cost more in the store.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li> It works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brands.  </li>
            <li> Kenra volume spray is my all-time favorite hair spray.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair spray for many years.  </li>
            <li> It is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> I would keep searching for something better, but it probably depends on your hair type.</li>
            <li> like the volume spray  and love all the products</li>
            <li> I have tried so many kinds of volume hair spray since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for all most a month</li>
            <li> It does the job. :)</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray.  </li>
            <li> I love this spray.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky like most hairsprays I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li> I love this spray...</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the hairspray</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it, but it seems to be more of a hairspray than a volume spray.</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> and I love the hold.  </li>
            <li> and I was always so pleased</li>
            <li> Both great for keeping the style without the old lady feel!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super light on my hair and holds my style perfectly all day - even thru the high humidity in the south!  </li>
            <li> so the value is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Have used many salon products, and Kenra is still a favorite of mine, particularily for fine hair to give and maintain volume.</li>
            <li> great for fine straight hair...really holds without stiffness...</li>
            <li> Best long hold hairspray out there!</li>
            <li> I love Kenra 25 hairspray, it gives you a fine mist, but it holds your hair.</li>
            <li> Even when my very fine hair, which needs lots of support, is clean, this &amp;#34;dulls</li>
            <li> I can lightly spray it throughout my hair and scrunch once or twice to make my curls more springy and defined with hold</li>
            <li> It provides incredible, all-day lasting hold.</li>
            <li> Great deal, shipped super fast and will purchase again&lt;</li>
            <li> It provided the best hold and humidity block than any other hairspray I&#x27;ve used, period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair type: Kinky curly.</li>
            <li> It is not the best ever spray (as some other reviews state).</li>
            <li> Product washed out easily when shampooing.</li>
            <li> Yes&lt;br /&gt;Sweat easily?:</li>
            <li> Overall, this hairspray is worth every penny - it is the best on the market.</li>
            <li> Works well for volume and as a hairspray, but is easy to overuse.</li>
            <li> Does not have a strong hold on hair.  </li>
            <li> It has a strong smell that would overpower.  </li>
            <li> My mum who uses it frequently finds that it layers perfectly; she has straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li> The product works fine, but if someone is going to pay $18-20 bucks for a bottle of hairspray, the merchant should deliver the bottle in an undamaged form.</li>
            <li> This spray is the best hairspray that I&#x27;ve used and has little to no smell.</li>
            <li> Did a little shopping around and found the perfect seller on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The hair spray itself is fine and does a good job, but I was surprised at the dents.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray -hands down!  </li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have the finest, thinnest hair and have tried every spray available.</li>
            <li> I use it for my bangs every day, and to secure up-dos.  </li>
            <li> and I liked it to much that I asked to purchase the product.  </li>
            <li> Great product and the ONLY hairspray on the market today that I know of that you can immediately comb through!  </li>
            <li> This hairspray is great for adding volume and helps with second day hair.</li>
            <li> This spray has a great hold and personally, I like the smell!</li>
            <li> Fantastic hold</li>
            <li> But overall I am happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how cheap it is too</li>
            <li> It is worth the money, it does not take as much to keep looking good.</li>
            <li> Therefore, it&#x27;s fair to say that this product works well with nearly all hair types.</li>
            <li> I buy a lot from good old Amazon</li>
            <li> it has excellent hold without being too stiff.  </li>
            <li> I primarily use this along with a liquid mousse to maintain a unique style.</li>
            <li> Super strong so a touch &#x27;ll do ya.</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair, this is the best product I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Excellent product and worth every penny !</li>
            <li> Love the product and the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Best hairspray around and price is usually competitive with ULTA.</li>
            <li> Hair spray did not have normal nice fragrance</li>
            <li> It clogs with every use and is a pain to clean.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found this to be a great finishing spray after letting my hair air dry or diffusing.</li>
            <li> Great hold on limp hair, I have tried many others.</li>
            <li> Brushes out cleanly.  </li>
            <li> Dominique Sachsa was right!  </li>
            <li> The can stops spraying (nothing seems to \\&quot;unclog\\&quot; it) and they are still almost full.</li>
            <li> Smells like sweet tarts, not obnoxiously.</li>
            <li> SO it does not do well with the humidity as much as I like, but still does better than others.</li>
            <li> It has super hold in any weather and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and holds well.</li>
            <li> Lucky accident.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like aerosol super glue</li>
            <li> I have very fine soft hair that won&#x27;t hold hair spray..</li>
            <li> The can lasts a long time, the sprayer rarely jams up w/ gook and when it does, it is easily removed by running warm water over it.</li>
            <li> My new favorite hair spray... holding up under Seattle weather.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave your house without spraying this on your hair first!</li>
            <li> Kenra Super Hold Finishing Spray keeps them right where I put them.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and with age has gotten much thinner..  </li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair that does not hold curls well.</li>
            <li> This is the only aerosol spray that holds my hair and the price was amazing.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li> It is SO worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not for any kind of daily use, IMO.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it for special occasions and perfect hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> You can spray and continue to work your hair until it is right</li>
            <li> It keep volume without becoming sticky, allowing hair to move naturally.</li>
            <li> This large size lasts me for months!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend, it&#x27;s worth the switch!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hold is perfect -long lasting, not flaky, not heavy, mists evenly and</li>
            <li> it worked very, very well.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has walked into the bathroom right after I have used it and commented on how good it smells -- drastically different from my old spray where she asked to leave the room if I was getting ready to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it on the recommendation of a Youtuber that i follow who is a prominent public figure in the news business.  </li>
            <li> This is my first Volume Spray purchase</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t corroborate since this is my first time using a hairspray.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> Of COURSE the nozzle gets &amp;#34;gunked&amp;#34; up, as do all hair sprays, but running it under hot water takes care of the problem.</li>
            <li> It will definitely hold better than water-based or any product that lists water as the first ingredient.</li>
            <li> However, the real reason I obsess over this spray compared to others is the smell!</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend it!!</li>
            <li> This stuff really holds the hair and gives it body, but also takes away the shine!  </li>
            <li> My first time using it myself</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, but it is soft, fine, and straight.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much improvement in volume with this and like most products, made my hair oily the next day.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend purchasing it, as it is entirely worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I am pretty cheap when I comes to buying beauty products (definitely a Walmart shopper in that arena)</li>
            <li> This certainly adds body while it hold.  </li>
            <li> Great for hair with a little more texture, not so much for straight slick hair.  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida where the humidity is high and hair gets frizzy quick.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend this much at first, but the product came so highly recommended that I tried it.</li>
            <li> It holds good and doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard.</li>
            <li> Holds but very sticky.  </li>
            <li> My bride says it works really well.  </li>
            <li> It gets all clogged up and no matter how much i wash the hole where the spray comes out, it still continues to stay clogged and sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rinsed it and gently rubbed the sprayer</li>
            <li> Thanks Kenra.</li>
            <li> I really like this spray -</li>
            <li> And it holds up to heat and humidity really well.  </li>
            <li> and I found it here much cheaper than elsewhere.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much for it to hold my hair all day</li>
            <li> Now my hairs have been mostly straight for a while, I found using conditioner will even ruin my hairs&#x27; volume.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> Works very well on the hair, but it does leave a sticky residue on the floor, hair brush, etc.</li>
            <li> And, thanks to Amazon, it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> so you only need light sprays.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t care for this product.  </li>
            <li> I prefer some hold but not this much.</li>
            <li> This is a product that really delivers.</li>
            <li> it really holds the hair in place.</li>
            <li> I wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much</li>
            <li> I have fine and flat straight hair.</li>
            <li> It holds great, but doesn&#x27;t look stiff and gross like some hairsprays.</li>
            <li> I live in sunny, hot, HUMID SW Florida....</li>
            <li> My other favorite is Prive #89.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that the sprayer doesn&#x27;t get clogged like so many other aerosol hairsprays do.</li>
            <li> Also seems less drying than other top salon brands I&#x27;ve used and adds more shine.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray--keeps hair in place all day without being too sticky or glued down.  </li>
            <li> Many volume and control hairsprays weighed my hair down and destroyed the shine.  </li>
            <li> but I can tolerate it because I love the soft and natural looking hold, especially in times of high humidity.  </li>
            <li> My hair has gotten drier as I have grown older</li>
            <li> Even with being around the ocean and high heat/humidity</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I highly suggest trying this is you have been considering it.</li>
            <li> Makes hair a little crunchy, so there may be a bit more of a learning curve with this product than with others.</li>
            <li> It creates amazing hold and volume without making your hair feel hard.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thin, very fine, and resistant to styling so most products designed for hold either weigh it down or aren&#x27;t strong enough to provide hold.</li>
            <li> but I definitely think this is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has terrific hold and is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I live in a hot, very humid climate, and this is the only spray that works.  </li>
            <li> My friend told me the other day that she uses it to add volume to her fine hair</li>
            <li> Not to mention that I had more breakage because it was so stiff.  </li>
            <li> I have a very fine hair and it just relaxed into a very limp curl  that eventually disappeared after using this hairspray.</li>
            <li> Cant live without it.</li>
            <li> This has become my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; spray.</li>
            <li> Plus it actually smells good (at least I think so).</li>
            <li> My hair looks very natural and still moves when I move.  </li>
            <li> Very natural</li>
            <li> I live in constant humidity in Florida and this stuff works better than the 30 other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I can use this hairspray the first day and a lighter one the next day.  </li>
            <li> and when I straighten it or curl it with a hot iron, this spray keeps it from frizzing back up.  </li>
            <li> This is the second can of Kenra I have purchased and the first one I had, the cap always gummed up.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong.  </li>
            <li> I also like to use this to control flyaways; you can spray a bit on your palms and smooth them over your hair to flatten them down and lock them in place.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and items were packed carefully and protected.</li>
            <li> It is actually a little sticky feeling on my fine hair and it has a bit of perfume-like smell which I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> And overall it was just too heavy for my very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in my city, so I was happy to see I could purchase it (&amp; for less money than in stores/salons) on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a great hairspray that does NOT leave your hair bogged down the next day, either.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and I like a firm hold.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but lots of it, and in humid weather it just goes limp and floppy.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft not stiff feeling, but holds all day.</li>
            <li> This spray was actually purchased for our Old English Sheepdog in preperation for her first show!</li>
            <li> Its a huge hassle cleaning it EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li> I took it with me on vacation last week to a very humid climate</li>
            <li> the fragrance is not heavy.</li>
            <li> Since my natural texture is curly/wavy</li>
            <li> Nowadays I am embracing my natural texture</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, but holds without being sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and this one is supposedly better smelling than other hairsprays out there?</li>
            <li> so much!&lt;br /&gt;I have very long and straight hair</li>
            <li> Applying it after blow dry, my hairs hold for the whole day.</li>
            <li> I would pair this up with a good oil moisturizer to prevent your hair from feeling hard or stiff.</li>
            <li> It keeps it from frizzing like no other.  </li>
            <li> I just finished my first can of Kenra and have decided to try other options.  </li>
            <li> so I compared bottle to one from local store &amp;amp; found it was old with a date stamp of 2009!</li>
            <li> Little pricey but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I also love their blow dry spray which cuts down on the blow dry time.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is a problem common to most hairsprays, but it has been so long since I used another brand that I have forgotten.  </li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, or hair that needs more body and volume...</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast, for which I am grateful, but unfortunately, really poor packaging that caused the bottle to dent.  </li>
            <li> This is the first hairspray that held volume in my hair all day with only a few bursts and it looks so natural.</li>
            <li> Not what was expected per description but still a decent product.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely stiff, very quickly, and not very workable afterward at all, and a can lasts a surpringly short amount of time, to boot.</li>
            <li> Seemed drying and just not a good fit for my highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> The scent is sort of heavy at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different hairsprays &amp; this one is exactly as its described.  </li>
            <li> I have, and always have had extremely fine and thin hair.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite hair sprays, leaves your hair in place without having that hard stiff hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> It falls down within 20 min normally.</li>
            <li> This got such consistently high ratings I thought I would risk it, though its a little pricier.</li>
            <li> It is affordable, it lasts longer than other products, it keeps my style intact all day while my hair looks and feels natural.</li>
            <li> I used to perm hairs to get more volume, but I&#x27;m tired of it as it dries my hairs and ruins its shininess.</li>
            <li> especially when the grey comes in.</li>
            <li> It was the only hairspray I would use for a long time.....</li>
            <li> It tames my frizzies after I flat iron.</li>
            <li> I simply spray the root of each dry curl before using curling iron and my set stays all day.  </li>
            <li> I have oily hair that is also long, so it tends to go flat</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely fine, which makes it difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> This hairspray keeps the curls in all day long and into the evening.</li>
            <li> Not soft &amp; tousled</li>
            <li> A can lasts me for a really long time, and I use it almost every day.</li>
            <li> Usually with a little hot water or astringent and picking with my fingernails</li>
            <li> On the other hand, when I need body and for the curl to last a couple of days, this is the stuff!</li>
            <li> Either way it is not enough of an irritation to bring it down a star.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This holds well even when my hair is a little longer and makes the style last another day.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for when I curl my hair and needed a little extra hold.</li>
            <li> It does feel a little grody halfway through day two if I don&#x27;t wash it out, but all sprays with hold are similar.</li>
            <li> it help my hair hold allll dayyyyyy long !!!</li>
            <li> Too bad because I know this product and love using it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, but the last few times I have purchased it, I wind up throwing 90% of it away.</li>
            <li> With damp climate my hairdo is nonexistent after a few minutes outside.</li>
            <li> Before Kenra I had trouble finding hairspray that would last all day, through any weather.  </li>
            <li> The scent is not what I expected and the product clumps in your hair.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time, as expected.</li>
            <li> expensive but worth it .</li>
            <li> The rating listed here is actually for the poor and sarcastic service I received from a spokesperson, &amp;#34;Vivian&amp;#34;, at Beauty Shine out of San Jose, CA.</li>
            <li> I have short, sassy hair and this lets me place it where I want without making my hair stiff.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin and straight hair, looking oily and flat all the time.</li>
            <li> this stuff is serious and leaves residue that nearly destroyed my invisibles cover on my iPhone screen.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is lightweight, long-lasting, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It does not take much so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was leary at first because aerosal in the past never worked for my hair but this hairspray works!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in the purchase because the sprayer spits more than it sprays.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare it to any other products, but this is no exception.</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of hairsprays over the past several years.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really mind the stiff hair, but the smell is really not great..</li>
            <li> I use it to tame my wild thick hair, so I guess it could work for everyone.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day and have not problem re-styling on day 2 without it being weighed down from the previous day.</li>
            <li> only complaint I have is that the nozzle sometimes gets clogged with hairspray.  </li>
            <li> so I tend to write reviews for stuff I love, and that I hate.  </li>
            <li> and it smells of the typical hairspray smell.</li>
            <li> Of course going from $3 a bottle to $17 a bottle is a little bit of a shock</li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t stand to get anywhere near her hair because of the powerful, horrible smell.  </li>
            <li> And the seller got it to me in just a few days.</li>
            <li> It holds all day and doesn&#x27;t not feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I can achieve all day weightless hold without the heavy look or feel that cheaper sprays provide.</li>
            <li> Firm hold without sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> I use everyday and run through a bottle in about 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> It touts as Volume Spray but is really a heavy finishing spray.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy or stiff looking like the suave hairspray did.  </li>
            <li> If I use the spray two or three days in a row though my hair is too stiff to style.</li>
            <li> This spray keeps my hair in place, but not too stiff.  </li>
            <li> Stays in place without that stiff feeling.</li>
            <li> Smell is not strong or offensive</li>
            <li> The hairspray is not overwhelmingly strong or sticky.</li>
            <li> No more limp, lifeless hair.  </li>
            <li> Almost impossible to get too much.</li>
            <li> it holds my hair in place without feeling sticky on weighed down, it&#x27;s like not having any hair spray on ay all!!</li>
            <li> , this is an expensive product but a can lasts me 6+ months of daily use</li>
            <li> Im not sure if the formula has changed or if my hair has changed</li>
            <li> Holds firm!</li>
            <li> I was in NY for the past two months and my hair was AWSOME in that enviroment using this product.</li>
            <li> It did not make my hair sticky or hard.</li>
            <li> Then what little spray does come out spews in all directions and not where i want it!!  </li>
            <li> never complained but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had to keep using hair spray to keep my hair look &amp;#34;volumed&amp;#34; at least twice a day until a friend of mine who is a hairstylist recommended me Kenra volume Spray.</li>
            <li> it left my hair filmy and I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell either.  </li>
            <li> She kept signing her e-mails &amp;#34;Best Regards&amp;#34;, even though the content was rude and  ridiculous.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally thin straight hair which I hate</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is the hairspray every woman dreams about.</li>
            <li> It holds my hair in place without looking stuck to my head or dull &amp; it doesn&#x27;t leave residue behind.</li>
            <li> Way too sticky and hard for my hair!</li>
            <li> frustrating--</li>
            <li> I am totally addicted to it.</li>
            <li> Not good!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any extra volume and the holding properties are awful.  </li>
            <li> Vivian absurdly maintained, after reviewing my e-mail asking the whereabouts of my hairspray, that I had the product sent to an address  in Northern VA.</li>
            <li> I hunt eBay and amazon or bargains, it is expensive.</li>
            <li> This texture can be difficult to work with, but this spray does wonders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of scrubbing it each morning, testing to see if it&#x27;s spraying strait, accidently spraying off in some crazy direction, blech.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad, I wonder if I got a knock</li>
            <li> but I was very unhappy this time. :(</li>
            <li> Hated it</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> However, the nozzle is terrible.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great for hair with a little more texture, not so much for straight slick hair.  Also good if you brush through hair after spraying because it does not flake.</li>
            <li> I have been using Suave non-aerosol hairspray for years and after going to the stylist they introduced me to this hairspray.  I was leary at first because aerosal in the past never worked for my hair but this hairspray works!!!  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy or stiff looking like the suave hairspray did.  Of course going from $3 a bottle to $17 a bottle is a little bit of a shock but I think it&#x27;s well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally thin straight hair which I hate so I have to curl it every morning to make it look full and beautiful.  This hairspray keeps the curls in all day long and into the evening. I highly recommend, it&#x27;s worth the switch!</li>
            <li> Holds but very sticky.  Not soft &amp; tousled like I thought.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! Only problem is I have to rinse the sprayer off after each use so it dont clog.</li>
            <li> My new favorite hair spray... holding up under Seattle weather.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair spray I use and I don&#x27;t like hair sprays.</li>
            <li> My bride says it works really well.  However, I can&#x27;t stand to get anywhere near her hair because of the powerful, horrible smell.  Want romance?  Then wash it out so you don&#x27;t gag your partner.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, but the last few times I have purchased it, I wind up throwing 90% of it away. The can stops spraying (nothing seems to \\&quot;unclog\\&quot; it) and they are still almost full.</li>
            <li> Love it. Fantastic. I have the finest, thinnest hair and have tried every spray available. With damp climate my hairdo is nonexistent after a few minutes outside. Wish I could get the spray in Switzerland. I am truly enthousiastic about it.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray.  Always use it!</li>
            <li> The best hairspray I have found.</li>
            <li> it help my hair hold allll dayyyyyy long !!!&lt;br /&gt;omg cant believe it .  i love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only thing it smells not that good</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray. It is my favorite! Little pricey but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with item !</li>
            <li> This is great hairspray but I can&#x27;t use it every day. My hair has gotten drier as I have grown older so I don&#x27;t wash it every day.  I can use this hairspray the first day and a lighter one the next day.  This holds well even when my hair is a little longer and makes the style last another day.  If I use the spray two or three days in a row though my hair is too stiff to style. You can shape your hair as you spray with this product.  When my hair is growing out, this is a life saver to set a style so my hair won&#x27;t be all over the place and frizzy in moist weather.  I like to have one can of this and one can of a lighter hair spray.</li>
            <li> Super strong so a touch &#x27;ll do ya.</li>
            <li> Dominique Sachsa was right!  Watch her YouTube recommendations...this stuff works even in the Houston humidity!  My hair never looked better.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair spray I have ever used.  It is worth the money, it does not take as much to keep looking good.</li>
            <li> The best hairspray on earth.  I love being able to order both items online!  Both came very quickly!</li>
            <li> I agree totally with the writer that said she has to throw 90% of it away because it stops spraying.  It gets all clogged up and no matter how much i wash the hole where the spray comes out, it still continues to stay clogged and sticky. Then what little spray does come out spews in all directions and not where i want it!!  Very disappointed.  I bought it on the recommendation of a Youtuber that i follow who is a prominent public figure in the news business.  She seems to LOVE this hairspray so I was hoping that it would perform better.</li>
            <li> I live in constant humidity in Florida and this stuff works better than the 30 other brands I&#x27;ve tried. It holds your hair without the &#x27;glued-down&#x27; look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in the purchase because the sprayer spits more than it sprays. Sends drops everywhere!  I&#x27;ve rinsed it and gently rubbed the sprayer but it still spits. Too bad because I know this product and love using it.</li>
            <li> Found this product by chance and I love it!  Although the salon I go to sells this brand, it doesn&#x27;t carry this one.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair fuller and with more volume.  Glad I found it, will continue to buy this product.  Thanks Kenra.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray--keeps hair in place all day without being too sticky or glued down.  I use it for my bangs every day, and to secure up-dos.  Before Kenra I had trouble finding hairspray that would last all day, through any weather.  Often my bangs would be either greasy from the products or from being on my face all day .  Kenra Super Hold Finishing Spray keeps them right where I put them.  I will continue to buy this product for the rest of my days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that the nozzle sometimes gets clogged with hairspray.  I don&#x27;t usually find out that it is clogged until after I have tried to spray and found that the stream is off--either too concentrated or angled funny.  Usually with a little hot water or astringent and picking with my fingernails I can get it unclogged.  A couple of times the clog has meant a chunk of bangs saturated with spray, with no spray on the rest--so I have to brush it out and use my hairdryer and try again.  Guess I should start checking the nozzle before I use it.  Maybe this is a problem common to most hairsprays, but it has been so long since I used another brand that I have forgotten.  Either way it is not enough of an irritation to bring it down a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this--you will be in love!</li>
            <li> This is my first Volume Spray purchase so I can&#x27;t compare it to any other products, but this is no exception. This one too stiffens your hair like melted candy is stuck to it and it smells of the typical hairspray smell. I don&#x27;t really mind the stiff hair, but the smell is really not great.. I feel like I&#x27;m walking around telling people &amp;#34;Hey guys, I used hairspray on my hair&amp;#34;. It feels similar to when I had my hair permed and smelled like chemicals for 3 days except this hairspray smell lasts maybe 3-4 hours?? But it does the job. My hair does feel more secured after using this. I read other reviews and this one is supposedly better smelling than other hairsprays out there? I can&#x27;t corroborate since this is my first time using a hairspray. Overall I&#x27;ve come to use hairspray only when it&#x27;s necessary because I can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairspray of all time! I live in Florida where the humidity is high and hair gets frizzy quick.  This spray keeps my hair in place, but not too stiff.  It keeps it from frizzing like no other.  The smell is wonderful too! I have frizzy, partly wavy hair and when I straighten it or curl it with a hot iron, this spray keeps it from frizzing back up.  Love it!</li>
            <li> The hairspray works well, but the sprayer is ALWAYS clogging which is a constant frustration to me, even though I am storing it properly.  The canister overall is not made well.</li>
            <li> I really like this spray - it has excellent hold without being too stiff.  And it holds up to heat and humidity really well.  However, the nozzle is terrible.  It clogs with every use and is a pain to clean.  I&#x27;m tired of scrubbing it each morning, testing to see if it&#x27;s spraying strait, accidently spraying off in some crazy direction, blech.  I just finished my first can of Kenra and have decided to try other options.  It just wasn&#x27;t meant to be,</li>
            <li> This is by far THE best hairspray I have ever used. It has super hold in any weather and lasts all day. Plus it actually smells good (at least I think so). If you have thin hair, or hair that needs more body and volume...this is for  you! Also seems less drying than other top salon brands I&#x27;ve used and adds more shine.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice enough of a difference in my hair to pay the money for this again!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and in good condition. I am very happy with this purchase. I have been using this hairspray for over a year now and love it. There is nothing else on the market that can do a better job for any amount of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this spray. My stylist started using it on me and I found it here much cheaper than elsewhere. The Texas humidity plays havoc with my hair. This spray is the best hairspray that I&#x27;ve used and has little to no smell. My friend told me the other day that she uses it to add volume to her fine hair and she loves it. I use it to tame my wild thick hair, so I guess it could work for everyone.</li>
            <li> My stylist has used this on my hair the last several times and I liked it to much that I asked to purchase the product.  I am pretty cheap when I comes to buying beauty products (definitely a Walmart shopper in that arena) but I definitely think this is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much for it to hold my hair all day and it never feels sticky plus I don&#x27;t have that \\&quot;helmet hair\\&quot; hardness.  My hair looks very natural and still moves when I move.  I took it with me on vacation last week to a very humid climate and I was pleased that it performed well there too.  Even with being around the ocean and high heat/humidity it worked very, very well.  Another bonus is the aroma.  My daughter has walked into the bathroom right after I have used it and commented on how good it smells -- drastically different from my old spray where she asked to leave the room if I was getting ready to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product and worth every penny !</li>
            <li> Great Product! Best hold I&#x27;ve ever experienced. Leaves hair soft not stiff feeling, but holds all day. Pleasant smell as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for over a year and I love it. It holds good and doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard.</li>
            <li> It really works! I have very thin and straight hair, looking oily and flat all the time. I used to perm hairs to get more volume, but I&#x27;m tired of it as it dries my hairs and ruins its shininess. Now my hairs have been mostly straight for a while, I found using conditioner will even ruin my hairs&#x27; volume.  I started trying Kendra spray. It works like a wonder. Applying it after blow dry, my hairs hold for the whole day. It&#x27;s amazing. Even at the next day and third day the hairs wouldn&#x27;t look greasy and would not stick to the scalp or the face. The best things is, I no longer have to wash hairs everyday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love love it.</li>
            <li> Does not have a strong hold on hair.  I have a very fine hair and it just relaxed into a very limp curl  that eventually disappeared after using this hairspray. Joico Joimist Medium works much better.</li>
            <li> A great finishing spray, great volume and another of excellent Kenra products. Better pricing with Amazon than retail stores. Have used many salon products, and Kenra is still a favorite of mine, particularily for fine hair to give and maintain volume.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Smells great And had a nice hold. Did not make my hair look like a helmet. Very natural</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair spray of all time!  Highly recommend!  It doesn&#x27;t get sticky or leave any residue plus it has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Love the product and the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Started using this spray when purchased at beauty shop. It works great combs out easily. Price is great and received in no time.</li>
            <li> I love Kenra products, but I don&#x27;t love this one.  The scent is not what I expected and the product clumps in your hair.  I don&#x27;t notice any extra volume and the holding properties are awful.  It&#x27;s so bad, I wonder if I got a knock off?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great product and the ONLY hairspray on the market today that I know of that you can immediately comb through!  The scent is sort of heavy at first but I can tolerate it because I love the soft and natural looking hold, especially in times of high humidity.  This large size lasts me for months!</li>
            <li> My review is related only to the condition  of the containers  of the hair spray. They each had several dents in the cans. The hair spray itself is fine and does a good job, but I was surprised at the dents.</li>
            <li> Happy happy with this hairspray!  It holds nicely but without any stiffness.  It also smells great!</li>
            <li> we like the product.  The smell is a little strong.  Works very well on the hair, but it does leave a sticky residue on the floor, hair brush, etc.</li>
            <li> not for me but my wife likes it</li>
            <li> This hairspray works very good . Holds the syle in place but it&#x27;s not to sticky! Love it!</li>
            <li> Best hairspray around and price is usually competitive with ULTA.</li>
            <li> Was great for the time I did have it. Until I came back from over-seas and security confiscated it.</li>
            <li> I have unruly curly hair and found this spray to be the perfect product for my hair.  It stays put without feeling like I have a helmut on!</li>
            <li> five stars! the very best hair spray!get great volume ,not sticky,a styling must.Cant live without it.I wish it would go on sale</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray you&#x27;ll ever need.  Comes in a handy travel size, too.  It&#x27;s light, but holds without being sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray -hands down!  It&#x27;s hold is perfect -long lasting, not flaky, not heavy, mists evenly and the fragrance is not heavy.</li>
            <li> This product has excellent hold and creates a natural looking shine. I primarily use this along with a liquid mousse to maintain a unique style. Since I shower at night it is imperative that my hair maintain its form over night. I can say with certainty that this works wonders in preventing bedhead. My mum who uses it frequently finds that it layers perfectly; she has straight, fine hair. My hair, however, is course and curly, bordering on wavy. Therefore, it&#x27;s fair to say that this product works well with nearly all hair types. Others have used it with great success. I highly recommend purchasing it, as it is entirely worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Very good hair spray.  Great hold in light humidity conditions.  I spray some at the roots to give my hair some extra body.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairspray!  It gives you volume, controls against the summer humidity without making my hair feel that I have applied Elmer&#x27;s Glue to it.  Many volume and control hairsprays weighed my hair down and destroyed the shine.  This one does NOT while controlling the frizzies.  No Helmet Head either, my hair still moves and has life to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful Product!</li>
            <li> Holy Grail hairspray!  I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s super light on my hair and holds my style perfectly all day - even thru the high humidity in the south!  It smells wonderful!  I didn&#x27;t realize the difference in hairsprays until I tried this one!  Kenra 25 all the way!</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray I have found for fine hair. My hair is thin, very fine, and resistant to styling so most products designed for hold either weigh it down or aren&#x27;t strong enough to provide hold. Since my natural texture is curly/wavy this means that most hairsprays flatten and pull out my curls. I started using this when I had a haircut that required daily straightening and it held my style in place perfectly with no extra weight. Nowadays I am embracing my natural texture and I&#x27;ve found this to be a great finishing spray after letting my hair air dry or diffusing. I can lightly spray it throughout my hair and scrunch once or twice to make my curls more springy and defined with hold but no weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this is an expensive product but a can lasts me 6+ months of daily use so the value is pretty good. I also like to use this to control flyaways; you can spray a bit on your palms and smooth them over your hair to flatten them down and lock them in place.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hairspray!! The low score was for shipping. The lid to my bottle was damaged and with this hairspray the nozzle gets clogged if you do not keep the cap on.</li>
            <li> great hair spray light weight and great for volume.</li>
            <li> Great hold on limp hair, I have tried many others. Smells like sweet tarts, not obnoxiously. Been using it for 15 years.</li>
            <li> This is the only aerosol spray that holds my hair and the price was amazing. Did a little shopping around and found the perfect seller on Amazon. it holds my hair in place without feeling sticky on weighed down, it&#x27;s like not having any hair spray on ay all!! Great product wont use anything else!!</li>
            <li> Outstanding hairspray. Best I&#x27;ve used. Holds hair and good for either curly or smooth looks. Brushes out cleanly.  Try it!</li>
            <li> I have used many products over the years, but I love this one for styling.  It dries quickly and holds well.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses it so thought I&#x27;d try it.  Holds nicely even with my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Light spray with good hold</li>
            <li> I buy a lot from good old Amazon so I tend to write reviews for stuff I love, and that I hate.  I love this stuff! I sort of bought it by mistake while looking for something else.  Lucky accident.  I like the smell, I like the hold, I LOV tat it doesn&#x27;t stick every hair on my head together!  My hair is fine and with age has gotten much thinner..  This certainly adds body while it hold.  And, thanks to Amazon, it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> This product is a lifesaver in Florida humid weather.  I simply spray the root of each dry curl before using curling iron and my set stays all day.  No more limp, lifeless hair.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Best hair spray ever.  It&#x27;s hard to find in my city, so I was happy to see I could purchase it (&amp; for less money than in stores/salons) on Amazon. Of COURSE the nozzle gets &amp;#34;gunked&amp;#34; up, as do all hair sprays, but running it under hot water takes care of the problem.</li>
            <li> Great control for fine, fly away hair, my curl held up in OH humidity.  Product washed out easily when shampooing.</li>
            <li> This spray was actually purchased for our Old English Sheepdog in preperation for her first show! My daughters and I use it every day now (on our hair!)-it holds beautifully, keeps hair touchable but in place, it smells very nice but is not overpowering. I was hesitant to spend this much at first, but the product came so highly recommended that I tried it. It is SO worth the money.</li>
            <li> It will definitely hold better than water-based or any product that lists water as the first ingredient. How is a hair spray going to fight humidity when there&#x27;s a generous amount of water in it? Give me alcohol, thank you. I would pair this up with a good oil moisturizer to prevent your hair from feeling hard or stiff. It provided the best hold and humidity block than any other hairspray I&#x27;ve used, period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair type: Kinky curly. 4a or 3c (Biracial)&lt;br /&gt;Use straightener?: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Sweat easily?: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Would you recommend this?: Oh yeah.</li>
            <li> order delivered promptly, product is as described--would order again</li>
            <li> works awesome for updoes and keeping your hair in shape. i use it for dance and for vintage looks! Definitely my favorite</li>
            <li> This is the second can of Kenra I have purchased and the first one I had, the cap always gummed up.  The spray seemed to make my hair sticky.  I gave it another chance and purchased a second one and guess what------- cap gums up and it does not spray like it should even after cleaning the cap.  Won&#x27;t buy again.  This stuff is terrible.</li>
            <li> I love their products been using for a couple years now. Price is good. Cost more in the store. Good buy</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  It works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brands.  It&#x27;s totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> Hair spray did not have normal nice fragrance so I compared bottle to one from local store &amp;amp; found it was old with a date stamp of 2009! Should be 2013!</li>
            <li> Kenra volume spray is my all-time favorite hair spray.  My hair is fine and I like a firm hold.  I have used this product for several years.</li>
            <li> My favorite ever hairspray!</li>
            <li> This hairspray is the best, and it doesn&#x27;t stink! Has great hold. And the seller got it to me in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Almost impossible to get too much. Has a great hold but doesnt get sticky. Wont buy another hairspray</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray. It holds great, but doesn&#x27;t look stiff and gross like some hairsprays. However, the real reason I obsess over this spray compared to others is the smell! It smells wonderful!!</li>
            <li> This hairspray is great for adding volume and helps with second day hair. Smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I Love Kenra!  This is the best hairspray I have ever used!  Highly recommend.  It holds all day and doesn&#x27;t not feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair spray for many years.  I live in a hot, very humid climate, and this is the only spray that works.  I can&#x27;t find it in any local stores.</li>
            <li> I love the hairspray!!! I give the hairspray a 5 rating. It holds with softness while not drying out my hair.  The rating listed here is actually for the poor and sarcastic service I received from a spokesperson, &amp;#34;Vivian&amp;#34;, at Beauty Shine out of San Jose, CA., who provides the service to Amazon.com for this Kenra product.  Vivian absurdly maintained, after reviewing my e-mail asking the whereabouts of my hairspray, that I had the product sent to an address  in Northern VA. where we had not lived (and no longer owned) for 11/2 years. The correct address the product should have been sent to was the same as the billing address. We had several exchanges of e-mail, where Vivian kept insisting that I had put the address in northern VA as my home address.  She kept signing her e-mails &amp;#34;Best Regards&amp;#34;, even though the content was rude and  ridiculous. I eventually received the product, because Vivian indicated it had been returned to their warehouse.  I will never purchase another product from said site.</li>
            <li> It is not the best ever spray (as some other reviews state). It is actually a little sticky feeling on my fine hair and it has a bit of perfume-like smell which I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> This is the only spray I use. It is my all time favorite. Will hold up to ind and dampness.  I hunt eBay and amazon or bargains, it is expensive. O I stock pile when I get a great price.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this hairspray! great price and smells great!</li>
            <li> Good price.. Will reorder</li>
            <li> Works well. Smell is not strong or offensive</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, but it is soft, fine, and straight. This texture can be difficult to work with, but this spray does wonders. I can achieve all day weightless hold without the heavy look or feel that cheaper sprays provide. Since discovering it 5 years ago, I refuse to use anything else; sometimes you truly get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love Kenra 25 hairspray, it gives you a fine mist, but it holds your hair. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> This got such consistently high ratings I thought I would risk it, though its a little pricier. I have oily hair that is also long, so it tends to go flat and I need good volume. I didn&#x27;t notice much improvement in volume with this and like most products, made my hair oily the next day. I would keep searching for something better, but it probably depends on your hair type.</li>
            <li> I received the mouse not the hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;I never complained but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used.. holds and allows you to brush through...</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites!  I have short, sassy hair and this lets me place it where I want without making my hair stiff.  My other favorite is Prive #89.  Both great for keeping the style without the old lady feel!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different hairsprays &amp; this one is exactly as its described.  It holds my hair in place without looking stuck to my head or dull &amp; it doesn&#x27;t leave residue behind.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my wife. She told me it didn&#x27;t work, would not hold...Also I ordered two bottles, got charged for that, but only recieved one bottle!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Kenra products.  This spray has a great hold and personally, I like the smell! I also noticed that the sprayer doesn&#x27;t get clogged like so many other aerosol hairsprays do.</li>
            <li> My go to hairspray. Stays in place without that stiff feeling.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray! I have purchased before and will continue to do so. Firm hold without sticky feeling. Also smells great!</li>
            <li> Way too sticky and hard for my hair!</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair, this is the best product I have ever used!! It gives me a thickness and voulme I have never had. I highly reccommend it!!</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely fine, which makes it difficult to work with. I have tried countless hairsprays. This  is the winner. It is affordable, it lasts longer than other products, it keeps my style intact all day while my hair looks and feels natural. Love it!!</li>
            <li> The brand I prefer over all others and the price was quite a bit cheaper than retail</li>
            <li> like the volume spray  and love all the products</li>
            <li> love this hairspray just wish it was cheaper! I use everyday and run through a bottle in about 6 weeks. Smells great and has a great hold.</li>
            <li> I have fine and flat straight hair. I have tried so many kinds of volume hair spray since I was a teenager. Some of them seemed to hold my hair but only for a hour or so. I had to keep using hair spray to keep my hair look &amp;#34;volumed&amp;#34; at least twice a day until a friend of mine who is a hairstylist recommended me Kenra volume Spray. It literally hold your hair all day!  Have been using this for all most a month and I still think this is the best hair spray I have EVER used.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading about it on a beauty blog. It really is the best hairspray I have ever used. The hold is incredible so you only need light sprays. A can lasts me for a really long time, and I use it almost every day. It also smells really good, which is nice because with a lot of hairsprays it&#x27;s either baby powder or aerosol smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff really holds the hair and gives it body, but also takes away the shine!  Even when my very fine hair, which needs lots of support, is clean, this &amp;#34;dulls it up&amp;#34; well.  On the other hand, when I need body and for the curl to last a couple of days, this is the stuff!</li>
            <li> Just a teensy bit does the trick.  Holds like cement.  I use it in the area of my cowlick which always looks like I&#x27;m going bald-- so frustrating-- especially when the grey comes in.</li>
            <li> A bit sticky but smells good. I bought it for when I curl my hair and needed a little extra hold. It does the job. :)</li>
            <li> This works great on my fine hair without making it look crunchy. Subtracting one star only because the nozzle clogs often and requires extra cleaning of my bathroom counter tops.</li>
            <li> Best long hold hairspray out there!</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray. It holds.</li>
            <li> This product did not meet my expectations because it did not spray properly. The actuator appears to be defective. Spray sputters.</li>
            <li> Not what was expected per description but still a decent product.  It touts as Volume Spray but is really a heavy finishing spray.  There is a difference</li>
            <li> Great deal, shipped super fast and will purchase again&lt;br /&gt;Packed great!</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t care for this product.  It has a strong smell that would overpower.  The spray nozzle gums up repeatedly causing it to concentrate in a stream.  Not good!  And overall it was just too heavy for my very fine hair.  Also, forget it if your husband likes to touch your hair.  He will pull back like mine did.  I think it felt something like a brillo pad when I used it.  Not to mention that I had more breakage because it was so stiff.  I prefer some hold but not this much.</li>
            <li> It was the only hairspray I would use for a long time.....Im not sure if the formula has changed or if my hair has changed but I was very unhappy this time. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hairspray for over 10 years and would not change. It is never sticky, even in humid weather, holds without stiffness, and brushes out with no problem. I love this hairspray.</li>
            <li> Have been using this spray for years.  Holds firm!</li>
            <li> I have been using Kenra spray for years and I absolutely love it.I am totally addicted to it. I don&#x60;t know what I  would do without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they never take it of the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sylvia.</li>
            <li> This is a product that really delivers. I have tried dozens of hairsprays over the past several years. Of all of them this is easily the best. I have fine, straight hair that does not hold curls well. This hairspray is lightweight, long-lasting, and a little bit goes a long way. The bottle is well designed - the sprayer is sturdy and does not clog. Overall, this hairspray is worth every penny - it is the best on the market.</li>
            <li> LOVE this hair spray! Fantastic hold and it smells wonderful. It does not take much so a little goes a long way. I highly suggest trying this is you have been considering it.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is great if you don&#x27;t want your hair to be too crunchy and it also has a nice light scent. The price was really good as well.</li>
            <li> I have used this hairspray for years as my finishing spray. Great holding power lasts all day without feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair spray IÂ´ve used so far....I am using it for 10 years... it really holds the hair in place. My husband and I fight for it.</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray.  As a previously short haired guy, I had never used quality hair sprays before.  This has great hold.  It does feel a little grody halfway through day two if I don&#x27;t wash it out, but all sprays with hold are similar.</li>
            <li> I love this spray. I wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much</li>
            <li> I like this spray so much!&lt;br /&gt;I have very long and straight hair..I was trying a lot of staff to make my hair the way I want..but nothing was working for me.&lt;br /&gt;But this thing is just awesome! It holds hair good without being sticky and stiff.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to buy it..no doubt!</li>
            <li> I would give this 5 stars, but it doesn&#x27;t add or hold volume.  But overall I am happy with it.  It&#x27;s not sticky like most hairsprays I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and sealed packaging. Great product. My first time using it myself but I had it used on my hair for a wedding and loved that it kept my hair perfect all night. Expensive but worth it for special occasions and perfect hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also I learned you want to cover your phone/desk/clothing on shoulders: this stuff is serious and leaves residue that nearly destroyed my invisibles cover on my iPhone screen. It made my robe hold its shape for a week too!!</li>
            <li> Great hold without the stickiness!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite hair sprays, leaves your hair in place without having that hard stiff hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic! I have, and always have had extremely fine and thin hair. This is the first hairspray that held volume in my hair all day with only a few bursts and it looks so natural. I am amazed.</li>
            <li> Works well. Love the smell. Holds great.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, as expected.</li>
            <li> Great hold for my fine hair. It did not make my hair sticky or hard.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this spray it left my hair filmy and I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell either.  Seemed drying and just not a good fit for my highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> The hairspray is not overwhelmingly strong or sticky. You can spray and continue to work your hair until it is right</li>
            <li> great for fine straight hair...really holds without stiffness...nozzle can sometimes clogg, so rinse it with warm water when done with it</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  It meets all my expectations and does a great job of holding my very fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love this hair spray!  It has terrific hold and is well worth the price.  Delivery was quick and items were packed carefully and protected.</li>
            <li> Hated it it&#x27;s like aerosol super glue</li>
            <li> I love this spray...no sticky build up....very workable.</li>
            <li> This has become my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; spray. It keep volume without becoming sticky, allowing hair to move naturally. Mind you, I have baby fine hair and this works great! IF...I stay indoors. I live in sunny, hot, HUMID SW Florida....SO it does not do well with the humidity as much as I like, but still does better than others. I was in NY for the past two months and my hair was AWSOME in that enviroment using this product. Held my hair all day with shine!!</li>
            <li> BEST HAIRSPRAY EVER!!!!  It holds all day without it looking like i&#x27;ve plastered my hair!</li>
            <li> I so wanted to give this product 5 stars. I absolutely LOVE the hairspray and I would have said that its the best I&#x27;ve tried in years BUT the nozzle clogs after every use. Its a huge hassle cleaning it EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser sold me on Kenra as she loves all their products.  It&#x27;s now my go-to hair spray.  I used to used Shaper, but this holds much better and smells great.  I also love their blow dry spray which cuts down on the blow dry time.</li>
            <li> In love with this product!!! I have very fine soft hair that won&#x27;t hold hair spray.. It falls down within 20 min normally. I use this and it stays up for hours! I can&#x27;t believe how cheap it is too</li>
            <li> awesome hairspray, holds good, not helmet like. would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Works well for volume and as a hairspray, but is easy to overuse. Makes hair a little crunchy, so there may be a bit more of a learning curve with this product than with others. I&#x27;ll continue to use it, but it seems to be more of a hairspray than a volume spray.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after I read a blogger review.  Love this hairspray!  I love the smell and I love the hold.  It tames my frizzies after I flat iron.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is the bomb! Seriously, this is the hairspray every woman dreams about. It provides incredible, all-day lasting hold. It also has a pleasant smell unlike a lot of hair sprays, so fear not its odor. I always get the biggest can since there is a ton of bang for your buck, and it lasts forever. Don&#x27;t leave your house without spraying this on your hair first!</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast, for which I am grateful, but unfortunately, really poor packaging that caused the bottle to dent.  The product works fine, but if someone is going to pay $18-20 bucks for a bottle of hairspray, the merchant should deliver the bottle in an undamaged form.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray I have ever used!  I have been using this product for several years and would recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is a great spray if you want volume and hold. It is one of the best products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Despite the good reviews, it sure didn&#x27;t hold my fine hair at all and the odor was more than I bargained for.  Gave it to my neighbor.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is amazing! It creates amazing hold and volume without making your hair feel hard.  Kenra Volume Spray is the best.</li>
            <li> I have bought hundreds of products over the years to try and find THE ONE. This is it. I have fine hair, but lots of it, and in humid weather it just goes limp and floppy. I have cut it all of in frustration, thinking I just \\&quot;can&#x27;t\\&quot; wear my hair longer. Now I can! Great hold, not too sticky, holds up in humidity. Hope they never stop making it!!</li>
            <li> I have used this spray for years ,tried others but keep going back to it .nothing compares .little expensive but worth it .</li>
            <li> Kristy, my hairdresser uses this and I was always so pleased w/ my hair&#x27;s staying power when I left her salon, that I asked about it and bought a can from her. The can lasts a long time, the sprayer rarely jams up w/ gook and when it does, it is easily removed by running warm water over it. This is a great hairspray that does NOT leave your hair bogged down the next day, either. I wash my hair every other day and have not problem re-styling on day 2 without it being weighed down from the previous day. You will be very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was not as impressed as all the hype, for the cost. It is extremely stiff, very quickly, and not very workable afterward at all, and a can lasts a surpringly short amount of time, to boot. Not for any kind of daily use, IMO.</li>
