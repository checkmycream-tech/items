            <li>love this!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Nail polish has a tendency to thicken after I own it for awhile.</li>
            <li>my polish nice and silky again</li>
            <li>Would be nice if it came with a funnel or 1ml syringe.</li>
            <li>Its a great addition to anyone who loves nail polishes and want to keep them in excellent condition for as long  as you owned them.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to received my nail polish thinner because a have a lot of lovely nail polish that are imposible to use and without this thinner they were ready to go in the garbage</li>
            <li>Be warned that the smell is very strong, but I am not bothered by it.  </li>
            <li>It cost a bit more than I would have liked.</li>
            <li>It kind of ruined my favorite nail polishes...</li>
            <li>It works, but the odor it has is very strong, make sure to use in a well ventilated room.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipment and great product.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worked on the most stubborn  of my polishes.</li>
            <li>looovee it :)</li>
            <li>ever so if you have nail polishes that can&#x27;t be used i suggest to buy it.  :)</li>
            <li>its okay, didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>This works great just add a couple of drops to a polish that has gotten a bit thick or gloopy and its perfect.</li>
            <li>I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE FOR MYSELF HOW &amp;#34;WORDY&amp;#34; I WANT TO BE IN</li>
            <li>Great product, works very well, make sure to have a drop dispenser to use when mixing with Polish or you will spill more than you want.</li>
            <li>This product revitalizes those bottles so I can get more use out of them.</li>
            <li>I tried fewer drops; I tried more drops.</li>
            <li>It does take more than you think, so don&#x27;t give up.</li>
            <li>Works much, much, much better than nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li>It has saved some of my favorite colors from being thrown out.</li>
            <li>More than I&#x27;ll ever need.  </li>
            <li>I am glad to have found it</li>
            <li>Thinner nail polish goes on more easily, in my experience.</li>
            <li>Must of been in a rush, since others gave it great reviews as far as packaging goes.</li>
            <li>Luckily the top coat I bought came with one, so I was able to use the dropper on this bottle.  </li>
            <li>The smell is really strong but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and</li>
            <li>Product is strong.</li>
            <li>Does the job fine.</li>
            <li>Super Product!</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>I will agree that it would be nice to have a dropper top, but at the end of the day that wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it to clean my nail art brushes.  </li>
            <li>But so far I&#x27;m 100% satisfied all around!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find this to be true.</li>
            <li>I have some old nail polish that was getting chunky, and since I don&#x27;t have a pippette or syringe (would have been nice if it came with an eyedropper in the lid)</li>
            <li>I believe it to be true).</li>
            <li>This is a good-sized bottle of nail polish thinner that will last for a good while.  </li>
            <li>I got it quickly and it made it</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the results, only a couple of drops helps.</li>
            <li>This was great for getting my nail polish back to its regular consistency and cleaning up the top of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I didn&#x27;t throw out all of my old nail polish because this product revived all of them!</li>
            <li>Better than buying new, right?</li>
            <li>This nail thinner is worth its price in gold.</li>
            <li>Very strong smelling, so make sure you&#x27;re near a window or in a big room.</li>
            <li>On the plus side it shipped super fast.</li>
            <li>This saved me so much money!</li>
            <li>Nail polish lasts much longer!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s brought back many a nail polish that for some reason I chose to hang onto, although they were too think to use.  </li>
            <li>:)and only took 3 days</li>
            <li>Especially helpful if your favorite polish has been discontinued as one of mine was.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it mixes well with many different brand of nail polishes(and</li>
            <li>First off let me just say...</li>
            <li>But with a few drops of this thinner, it is as good as new!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is great to use to bring back the nail polish that has gotten a little too thick to apply evenly to a more desired consistency, love it!</li>
            <li>It has a very strong scent to it, but as it&#x27;s a chemical product that was expected.</li>
            <li>It works awesome with only a small amount needed!</li>
            <li>But I needed to reapply thinner pretty much every time I need polish my nails.</li>
            <li>However every 10mins I had to add more because the polish dried out quickly again.</li>
            <li>The picture is a bit misleading, but the product is very high quality.  </li>
            <li>really fast shipping</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>It really extends the life of a bottle.</li>
            <li>I already feel like this product is going to save me so much money.</li>
            <li>The bottle was glass and sturdy, and the seller wrapped it in so much saran wrap there was no way it would leak.</li>
            <li>and I ended up wasting so much in spillage.</li>
            <li>biggest lament is really that this doesn&#x27;t come with one of those sucking syringe things, so that has to be bought separately.</li>
            <li>very well protected and arrived 2 days before the earliest promised date.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Instead of dissolving, it will separate your polish into thick gel(ish) on the bottom and water light liquid on top -and</li>
            <li>This thinner restored all of my clumpy polishes back to their original state.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like getting a whole new polish!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time buying thinner, so far it works well.</li>
            <li>Spend a few dollars more and get real nail polish thinner.</li>
            <li>Now, the actual product, so far it&#x27;s fantastic, it&#x27;s fixed 6 of my opi very chunky glitters that I thought were helpless and was going to throw away</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend,</li>
            <li>Useful for keeping proper consistency of your nail polish.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>and they are like new.</li>
            <li>now they are like new.</li>
            <li>Oh man, how did I ever live without this product before I got it?  </li>
            <li>and this made it like new again.</li>
            <li>so I didnt have to spend $18 on a new polish color..</li>
            <li>I am at that point where some of my nail polish is getting to be kind of thick and old.</li>
            <li>but NOPE, it completely destroys your polish!</li>
            <li>When I poured a few drops into my sticky nail polishes, it gave them their original normal paint consistency.</li>
            <li>Gets my brushes clean and thins out my super thick polishes!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to throw away my old nail polishes</li>
            <li>This did the trick for revitalizing some old nail polish I had, but didn&#x27;t want to let go of.</li>
            <li>Thins out old polish so you can use it again.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it claims, bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Arrived fast and actually works.</li>
            <li>It gives you so much control over your polishes and makes them last forever!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it many times in the last few months</li>
            <li>I can salvage most of the ones that got too thick to use and</li>
            <li>to.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll need a eye dropper of some sort to get it in the bottle (or a tiny funnel), &amp; I started by only adding a few drops, but realized that I could be a lot more liberal in adding the thinner.</li>
            <li>It worked wonders on one of my favorite but old and thick polishes!</li>
            <li>Then I put the lid back on and shook until the little ball bearing inside the nail polish started jostling around really freely again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This thinner brings polish back to new condition immediately.</li>
            <li>the other reviewer said, it seems like it is working at first</li>
            <li>After a year, I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in the bottle of thinner, and my clumpy polishes are generally the ones I never use anyway.</li>
            <li>(I actually put it in the old OPI bottle)</li>
            <li>This makes old nail polish come back to life.</li>
            <li>thought it would thin better..</li>
            <li>I used it to thin many of my nail polish and at a glance, it seemed to work.</li>
            <li>Having no previous experience with nail polish thinner, I can only say that the product accomplishes its purpose.</li>
            <li>Also works great to thin new nail polishes that are a little too think or dark</li>
            <li>It will last for a long time since it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to revive the polish as if it were brand new again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the OPI brand previously and I would say the results are exactly the same.</li>
            <li>This might just be paint thinner (smells like it) but it wasn&#x27;t super expensive &amp; it worked exactly as I wanted it</li>
            <li>The only request I would make is that I wish it came with some sort of a dropper because the mouth of the bottle is much larger than the mouth of a nail polish bottle, so it is very easy to make a mess if you have shaky hands.</li>

            <li> First off let me just say...</li>
            <li> But with a few drops of this thinner, it is as good as new!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is great to use to bring back the nail polish that has gotten a little too thick to apply evenly to a more desired consistency, love it!</li>
            <li> It has a very strong scent to it, but as it&#x27;s a chemical product that was expected.</li>
            <li> It works awesome with only a small amount needed!</li>
            <li> But I needed to reapply thinner pretty much every time I need polish my nails.</li>
            <li> However every 10mins I had to add more because the polish dried out quickly again.</li>
            <li> The picture is a bit misleading, but the product is very high quality.  </li>
            <li> really fast shipping</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> It really extends the life of a bottle.</li>
            <li> I already feel like this product is going to save me so much money.</li>
            <li> The bottle was glass and sturdy, and the seller wrapped it in so much saran wrap there was no way it would leak.</li>
            <li> and I ended up wasting so much in spillage.</li>
            <li> biggest lament is really that this doesn&#x27;t come with one of those sucking syringe things, so that has to be bought separately.</li>
            <li> very well protected and arrived 2 days before the earliest promised date.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Instead of dissolving, it will separate your polish into thick gel(ish) on the bottom and water light liquid on top -and</li>
            <li> This thinner restored all of my clumpy polishes back to their original state.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like getting a whole new polish!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time buying thinner, so far it works well.</li>
            <li> Spend a few dollars more and get real nail polish thinner.</li>
            <li> Now, the actual product, so far it&#x27;s fantastic, it&#x27;s fixed 6 of my opi very chunky glitters that I thought were helpless and was going to throw away</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend,</li>
            <li> Useful for keeping proper consistency of your nail polish.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> and they are like new.</li>
            <li> now they are like new.</li>
            <li> Oh man, how did I ever live without this product before I got it?  </li>
            <li> and this made it like new again.</li>
            <li> so I didnt have to spend $18 on a new polish color..</li>
            <li> I am at that point where some of my nail polish is getting to be kind of thick and old.</li>
            <li> but NOPE, it completely destroys your polish!</li>
            <li> When I poured a few drops into my sticky nail polishes, it gave them their original normal paint consistency.</li>
            <li> Gets my brushes clean and thins out my super thick polishes!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to throw away my old nail polishes</li>
            <li> This did the trick for revitalizing some old nail polish I had, but didn&#x27;t want to let go of.</li>
            <li> Thins out old polish so you can use it again.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims, bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Arrived fast and actually works.</li>
            <li> It gives you so much control over your polishes and makes them last forever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it many times in the last few months</li>
            <li> I can salvage most of the ones that got too thick to use and</li>
            <li> to.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll need a eye dropper of some sort to get it in the bottle (or a tiny funnel), &amp; I started by only adding a few drops, but realized that I could be a lot more liberal in adding the thinner.</li>
            <li> It worked wonders on one of my favorite but old and thick polishes!</li>
            <li> Then I put the lid back on and shook until the little ball bearing inside the nail polish started jostling around really freely again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This thinner brings polish back to new condition immediately.</li>
            <li> the other reviewer said, it seems like it is working at first</li>
            <li> After a year, I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in the bottle of thinner, and my clumpy polishes are generally the ones I never use anyway.</li>
            <li> (I actually put it in the old OPI bottle)</li>
            <li> This makes old nail polish come back to life.</li>
            <li> thought it would thin better..</li>
            <li> I used it to thin many of my nail polish and at a glance, it seemed to work.</li>
            <li> Having no previous experience with nail polish thinner, I can only say that the product accomplishes its purpose.</li>
            <li> Also works great to thin new nail polishes that are a little too think or dark</li>
            <li> It will last for a long time since it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to revive the polish as if it were brand new again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the OPI brand previously and I would say the results are exactly the same.</li>
            <li> This might just be paint thinner (smells like it) but it wasn&#x27;t super expensive &amp; it worked exactly as I wanted it</li>
            <li> The only request I would make is that I wish it came with some sort of a dropper because the mouth of the bottle is much larger than the mouth of a nail polish bottle, so it is very easy to make a mess if you have shaky hands.</li>
            <li> do have one complaint (minor)- the thinner is kind of hard to pour into the nail polish tube itself.</li>
            <li> They make your fingernail polishes last a long time and stops them from getting clumpy and un-useable.</li>
            <li> a lot of it is getting pretty thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete and total waste of time, polish, and money.</li>
            <li> I was able to use it to effectively thin some of my thicker, dried polishes.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is pretty large and a small amount will thin out a regular sized bottle of nail polish.</li>
            <li> It made the nail polish dull, and very watery.  </li>
            <li> This bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t tell you how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> The thinner just doesn&#x27;t seem to penetrate the thick polish no matter how much rolling or shaking I do.</li>
            <li> If your nail paint is dry then it does not work.</li>
            <li> helps the nail polish dry quicker.</li>
            <li> The thinner seems to work ok, but seems like I do need quite a bit of it to thin polish that has become a bit thick for use.</li>
            <li> it sparingly as it only needs a few drops.</li>
            <li> A few drops added to a bottle of slow-moving polish transform the latter into usable form again.</li>
            <li> really only need a drop or two to revive your dried polish</li>
            <li> but I expected that.</li>
            <li> My only suggestion is that the cap be fitted with an eye dropper type cap to ensure the thinner gets in the other little opening on the nail polish bottle.</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I WANTED,  AND FOUND IT WITH OTHER ITEMS I WANTED.  </li>
            <li> , I just held the nail polish bottle over the sink and carefully poured a little into the bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to pour into your polish - might need a funnel or something, but it definitely thins it out</li>
            <li> However -- the next time I go to use the polish, it&#x27;s generally thick again.</li>
            <li> One word of advice, don&#x27;t put the lid down, face down, on a wood table.</li>
            <li> Only use a very small amount.</li>
            <li> When I do that, it spills half of it.</li>
            <li> Shipping was less than a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> even though you get way less..</li>
            <li> If you want to paint with ballpoint pen in this is the goto mess of chemicals .</li>
            <li> I put a few drops at a time and shook it.</li>
            <li> I feel like it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> I felt like I was wasting a ton of money on getting replacement polishes every few weeks.</li>
            <li> A few drops of this to even my oldest must crusty polishes</li>
            <li> I have quite a few brands, that&#x27;s why from my experience</li>
            <li> My thickened polish gets this watery wet look to it as the thinner settles over it, but it stays thick and gooey.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used it on a few bottles already.</li>
            <li> a waste of money</li>
            <li> Saved a few bottles of nail polish that I would have had to toss.</li>
            <li> I rarely use nail polish, so I&#x27;m very sad when my almost-full bottles start to get thick and gooey.</li>
            <li> Also, it is not very effective.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to throw away half a bottle just because it&#x27;s gotten thick and gloppy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some reviews say it doesn&#x27;t work ?</li>
            <li> it came to the top and when I went to do a nail design it was horrible.  </li>
            <li> I put a few drops in a polish that&#x27;s gotten thick and clumpy, and this restores it to a usable state.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to get into a small nail polish bottle.</li>
            <li> helped me alot,i saved all my nail polishes and they were in a really bad condition and now its like i have new ones....</li>
            <li> I know a few period indicated that you had to use a lot of product to get the nail polish to thin.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it was very difficult to pour in my nail polish bottles</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers mention, I haven&#x27;t noticed any unpleasant scent from my bottle of thinner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does thin and the polish works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m grateful it wasn&#x27;t broken since it&#x27;s glass.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the reviews but alas, if I knew I couldn&#x27;t return it</li>
            <li> I use this to thin the my nail art polish which I used continuously for nail art design on my customers nails.</li>
            <li> No need to toss out expensive nail polish when it gets too thick to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would thin out my polish</li>
            <li> I tried this in one of my polishes that was just starting to thicken and managed to get some of it on my nail, but it just caused horrible bubbling.</li>
            <li> However, the act of puring into the bottle proved to be difficult.</li>
            <li> This crap is not a good idea if you care at all about saving your polish.</li>
            <li> Of course it stinks</li>
            <li> The bottle was broken!!</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because it is very difficult to pour.</li>
            <li> so disappointed.</li>
            <li> now it&#x27;s unusable :(</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of this product, it&#x27;s so</li>
            <li> The smell is awful so use in a well ventilated area, I know it a solvent</li>
            <li> this product stinks!!!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The smell is really strong but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and really fast shipping</li>
            <li> I got a much bigger looking bottle than the one shown, as others have stated. The thinner seems to work ok, but seems like I do need quite a bit of it to thin polish that has become a bit thick for use. It does thin and the polish works ok.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipment and great product. I don&#x27;t have to throw away my old nail polishes and I can save money too. So, I definitely recommed this item.</li>
            <li> This fingernail polish thinner is a good way to save money. They make your fingernail polishes last a long time and stops them from getting clumpy and un-useable. Using fingernail polish remover desolves the color and makes the color fade. This bottle goes a long way. I&#x27;ve used it many times in the last few months and I&#x27;ve only used maybe 10% of it. Its very good and very cheap.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of this product, it&#x27;s so strong!&lt;br /&gt;Also, it does not work with any of my nail polishes that are Drying or gooey. I put a few drops at a time and shook it. Nothing. I feel like it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> I recommend this product. I bought it for myself and females in the family.&lt;br /&gt;Use it sparingly as it only needs a few drops.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because it is very difficult to pour. They should have given some thing so I can put it in Nail polish bottle. When I do that, it spills half of it. Also, it is not very effective. If your nail paint is dry then it does not work.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come with directions or a dropper so it&#x27;s hard to get into a small nail polish bottle. It cost a bit more than I would have liked. The smell is awful so use in a well ventilated area, I know it a solvent but man did the smell linger, and gave me a headache. On the plus side it shipped super fast.</li>
            <li> Works great. I know a few period indicated that you had to use a lot of product to get the nail polish to thin. I didn&#x27;t find this to be true. I&#x27;ve used the OPI brand previously and I would say the results are exactly the same. I will agree that it would be nice to have a dropper top, but at the end of the day that wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal for me. (I actually put it in the old OPI bottle)</li>
            <li> This did the trick for revitalizing some old nail polish I had, but didn&#x27;t want to let go of. Better than buying new, right? I can&#x27;t can&#x27;t tell a change in quality of the nail polish after mixing, so I am very happy with this purchase. You get a ton of product, and I think this will last me a lifetime.</li>
            <li> This is great to use to bring back the nail polish that has gotten a little too thick to apply evenly to a more desired consistency, love it!</li>
            <li> Love the product!  I&#x27;ve used it to clean my nail art brushes.  Haven&#x27;t used it for my nail polish yet, but, I have no doubt that&#x27;ll work great!  I only gave it 4 stars because of the packaging.  Box was too big and they didn&#x27;t stuff it with paper or nothing.  No bubble wrap around the bottle or anything.  I&#x27;m grateful it wasn&#x27;t broken since it&#x27;s glass.  Must of been in a rush, since others gave it great reviews as far as packaging goes.</li>
            <li> This saved me so much money! I felt like I was wasting a ton of money on getting replacement polishes every few weeks. A few drops of this to even my oldest must crusty polishes and they are like new. I&#x27;m not sure why some reviews say it doesn&#x27;t work ? It&#x27;s worked on the most stubborn  of my polishes. Very happy !</li>
            <li> It does the job! Nail polish lasts much longer! Instant results!</li>
            <li> thought it would thin better..</li>
            <li> I bought this thinner and left it in my nailart bottle.  it came to the top and when I went to do a nail design it was horrible.  It made the nail polish dull, and very watery.  this product stinks!!!!!</li>
            <li> Got the job done.  Requires an eye dropper.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for thinning out gunky nail polish.  It&#x27;s brought back many a nail polish that for some reason I chose to hang onto, although they were too think to use.  One word of advice, don&#x27;t put the lid down, face down, on a wood table.</li>
            <li> helped me alot,i saved all my nail polishes and they were in a really bad condition and now its like i have new ones....:)and only took 3 days looovee it :) best investment ever so if you have nail polishes that can&#x27;t be used i suggest to buy it.  :)</li>
            <li> I was very happy to received my nail polish thinner because a have a lot of lovely nail polish that are imposible to use and without this thinner they were ready to go in the garbage now they are like new. So I am saving money. This is a great addition to my nail products. Delivery was fast. I recommend this great product and very nice size.</li>
            <li> This nail thinner is worth its price in gold. Its a great addition to anyone who loves nail polishes and want to keep them in excellent condition for as long  as you owned them.</li>
            <li> its okay, didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> It is quite necessary to have a bottle of thinner if you are a nail polish lover like myself. This works great just add a couple of drops to a polish that has gotten a bit thick or gloopy and its perfect.</li>
            <li> Buy this instead of another bottle of polish. It really extends the life of a bottle. Especially helpful if your favorite polish has been discontinued as one of mine was.</li>
            <li> Thins out old polish so you can use it again.  Very pleased with the results, only a couple of drops helps.</li>
            <li> Oh man, how did I ever live without this product before I got it?  I am so glad I don&#x27;t have to throw away nailpolishes now!  I can salvage most of the ones that got too thick to use and it&#x27;s like getting a whole new polish!</li>
            <li> Great product. Works good.</li>
            <li> I already feel like this product is going to save me so much money. I was constantly throwing away half-full bottles of nail polish because they were all goopy but this product saves them from going in the trash.</li>
            <li> The bottle was broken!!</li>
            <li> Works great! I have some old nail polish that was getting chunky, and since I don&#x27;t have a pippette or syringe (would have been nice if it came with an eyedropper in the lid), I just held the nail polish bottle over the sink and carefully poured a little into the bottle. Then I put the lid back on and shook until the little ball bearing inside the nail polish started jostling around really freely again.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients in this mixture are as follows: Mineral oil, MEK (Methyl ethyl ketone (butanone)), isopropyl alcohol, acetone.</li>
            <li> Alot of thinner!!!!! Works beautifully!!!!</li>
            <li> It works awesome with only a small amount needed! Also works great to thin new nail polishes that are a little too think or dark</li>
            <li> This was great for getting my nail polish back to its regular consistency and cleaning up the top of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Would be 5 stars if it included a dropper.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims, bottle lasts a long time.  Useful for keeping proper consistency of your nail polish.</li>
            <li> Having no previous experience with nail polish thinner, I can only say that the product accomplishes its purpose. A few drops added to a bottle of slow-moving polish transform the latter into usable form again. The 4 oz bottle is a generous size that will last me several years.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and actually works. It worked wonders on one of my favorite but old and thick polishes!</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I WANTED,  AND FOUND IT WITH OTHER ITEMS I WANTED.  GREAT PRODUCTS AND SERVICE ! I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE FOR MYSELF HOW &amp;#34;WORDY&amp;#34; I WANT TO BE IN ABLE TO POST FYI !!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time buying thinner, so far it works well. But I needed to reapply thinner pretty much every time I need polish my nails. Don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> This picture that&#x27;s shown is not the one I received(mine has red/black label) but, the same brand.I don&#x27;t think it mixes well with many different brand of nail polishes(and I have quite a few brands, that&#x27;s why from my experience I believe it to be true).</li>
            <li> I could not do nail art without this stuff. It gives you so much control over your polishes and makes them last forever!</li>
            <li> This might just be paint thinner (smells like it) but it wasn&#x27;t super expensive &amp; it worked exactly as I wanted it to.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll need a eye dropper of some sort to get it in the bottle (or a tiny funnel), &amp; I started by only adding a few drops, but realized that I could be a lot more liberal in adding the thinner. That being said, it&#x27;s a big bottle &amp; I can&#x27;t imagine emptying it for a quite a while!</li>
            <li> Great product, works very well, make sure to have a drop dispenser to use when mixing with Polish or you will spill more than you want.</li>
            <li> Nail polish has a tendency to thicken after I own it for awhile. I do my nails weekly and like switching colours. This means I may not use a colour for several months. I don&#x27;t want to throw away half a bottle just because it&#x27;s gotten thick and gloppy. This product revitalizes those bottles so I can get more use out of them.</li>
            <li> This crap is not a good idea if you care at all about saving your polish. This is NOT for thinning nail polish as all it did to my polish was make it break up into particles and not blend back into usable nail polish form. Spend a few dollars more and get real nail polish thinner. This is nail polish remover not thinner.&lt;br /&gt;I can agree to 1 star because guess what it does do? It thins out ball point pen ink. If you want to paint with ballpoint pen in this is the goto mess of chemicals .</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s hard to pour into your polish - might need a funnel or something, but it definitely thins it out</li>
            <li> It works, but the odor it has is very strong, make sure to use in a well ventilated room.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm. The bottle was glass and sturdy, and the seller wrapped it in so much saran wrap there was no way it would leak. My only complaint is that it was very difficult to pour in my nail polish bottles and I ended up wasting so much in spillage.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Thins everything great.  No need to throw anything away anymore.</li>
            <li> First off let me just say...the shipping was amazing! Not just because it was on time and only took 5 days to get here but because of how it was packaged. There was no possible way this glass bottle was breaking!! 5 stars for just that. Now, the actual product, so far it&#x27;s fantastic, it&#x27;s fixed 6 of my opi very chunky glitters that I thought were helpless and was going to throw away and this made it like new again. Now it&#x27;s only been 4 days and they&#x27;re still the same...perfect consistency so I can&#x27;t tell you how long it lasts. But so far I&#x27;m 100% satisfied all around!</li>
            <li> This so called nail polish thinner actually doesn&#x27;t work. I used it to thin many of my nail polish and at a glance, it seemed to work. However, when I actually used them, they were thickened again. It kind of ruined my favorite nail polishes...so disappointed.</li>
            <li> This was the cheapest nail polish thinner, so of course it&#x27;s the one I bought. It works great. I put a few drops in a polish that&#x27;s gotten thick and clumpy, and this restores it to a usable state. However -- the next time I go to use the polish, it&#x27;s generally thick again. Not a big deal. After a year, I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in the bottle of thinner, and my clumpy polishes are generally the ones I never use anyway. Unlike other reviewers mention, I haven&#x27;t noticed any unpleasant scent from my bottle of thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest lament is really that this doesn&#x27;t come with one of those sucking syringe things, so that has to be bought separately. Otherwise, good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nail blogger so I have a ton of polish and a lot of it is getting pretty thick. With the good reviews on this thinner I thought this was the cheaper option to my costly problem. WRONG! This thinner sticks. Both literally and figuratively. It has a very strong scent to it, but as it&#x27;s a chemical product that was expected. What I didn&#x27;t expect was for this thinner not to work -- at all! I tried fewer drops; I tried more drops. Nothing. My thickened polish gets this watery wet look to it as the thinner settles over it, but it stays thick and gooey. The thinner just doesn&#x27;t seem to penetrate the thick polish no matter how much rolling or shaking I do. I tried this in one of my polishes that was just starting to thicken and managed to get some of it on my nail, but it just caused horrible bubbling. It&#x27;s a complete and total waste of time, polish, and money.</li>
            <li> Finally something that works. We&#x27;ve used it on a few bottles already. It does take more than you think, so don&#x27;t give up. No noticeable degradation of polish so we&#x27;re very happy with it. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> this definitely extends the life of pricey nail polish.  But I wish it included something like an eyedropper in order to facilitate adding it to the polish.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the reviews but alas, if I knew I couldn&#x27;t return it I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the other reviewer said, it seems like it is working at first but NOPE, it completely destroys your polish! Instead of dissolving, it will separate your polish into thick gel(ish) on the bottom and water light liquid on top -and now it&#x27;s unusable :( I tried it on several different polishes but none of them came back to their fluid consistency. The directions are unclear and there is no dropper so you&#x27;d have to buy separately or guess the amount you&#x27;re putting it into your polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of money and I&#x27;ve lost my polishes !! Horrible!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-You get a lot of product for the price&lt;br /&gt;-You really only need a drop or two to revive your dried polish&lt;br /&gt;-Makes my polish nice and silky again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;-No eye dropper</li>
            <li> You get a bang for your buck.  I just used the thinner and my polish looks awesome.  I love this product and its a great deal</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff!!  Works much, much, much better than nail polish remover.  Very strong smelling, so make sure you&#x27;re near a window or in a big room.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I didn&#x27;t throw out all of my old nail polish because this product revived all of them! It will last for a long time since it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to revive the polish as if it were brand new again.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find nail polish thinner in the store and found it on line.  Works great and I have applied it to all&lt;br /&gt;of the nail polish that has thickened.  It has saved all of them which would have been thrown out and wasted.&lt;br /&gt;It was packaged very well protected and arrived 2 days before the earliest promised date.</li>
            <li> Great. Does the job fine. Would be nice if it came with a funnel or 1ml syringe.</li>
            <li> The price to quantity ratio is excellent. When I poured a few drops into my sticky nail polishes, it gave them their original normal paint consistency. However, the act of puring into the bottle proved to be difficult. The opening was about the size of a dime, and I found myself spilling the stuff all over the side of my nail polish bottle, so I would recommend buying a designated eye dropper to use. Shipping was less than a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> The picture is a bit misleading, but the product is very high quality.  I was able to use it to effectively thin some of my thicker, dried polishes.  I think it would even revive the driest nail polish.  Be warned that the smell is very strong, but I am not bothered by it.  You might also want to invest in a dropper of some sort in order to get the product out of the bottle and into a nail polish bottle.  Luckily the top coat I bought came with one, so I was able to use the dropper on this bottle.  Fantastic product.  I recommend it to anyone who needs a nail polish thinner.</li>
            <li> This thinner restored all of my clumpy polishes back to their original state. Love this product! I recommend this thinner!</li>
            <li> This is a good thinner for my polish!  My only suggestion is that the cap be fitted with an eye dropper type cap to ensure the thinner gets in the other little opening on the nail polish bottle.</li>
            <li> Saved my fave nail polish that I couldn&#x27;t find anymore!!</li>
            <li> love this!  helps the nail polish dry quicker.</li>
            <li> Gets my brushes clean and thins out my super thick polishes! Amazing price, too!</li>
            <li> Does what it says. About 15 of my nail polishes are now usable again.</li>
            <li> Saved a few bottles of nail polish that I would have had to toss.</li>
            <li> It thins the nail polish within a minute. I use this to thin the my nail art polish which I used continuously for nail art design on my customers nails. However every 10mins I had to add more because the polish dried out quickly again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have central air, so in the summer this saves my nail polish from clotting!  I recommend it.  Thinner nail polish goes on more easily, in my experience.</li>
            <li> Just what i was looking for</li>
            <li> Kinda dissapointed, it works but i had to add a lot of it to get my nail polish the way I wanted. It&#x27;s alright for the price I guess.. wish I would have gotten the name brand one even though you get way less..</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Works as described. Product is strong. Only use a very small amount.</li>
            <li> this was a bigger bottle than I thought. It has saved some of my favorite colors from being thrown out. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Super Product! No need to toss out expensive nail polish when it gets too thick to use.This thinner brings polish back to new condition immediately. Love it!</li>
            <li> More than I&#x27;ll ever need.  Just wish it had an applicator of some sort.</li>
            <li> This makes old nail polish come back to life. I am glad to have found it and I highly recommend,</li>
            <li> I received this yesterday I tried it out last night it seems to do what it&#x27;s suppose to.. Of course it stinks but I expected that. I got it quickly and it made it so I didnt have to spend $18 on a new polish color.. I think I&#x27;ll be using this all the time.</li>
            <li> I rarely use nail polish, so I&#x27;m very sad when my almost-full bottles start to get thick and gooey. I bought this hoping it would thin out my polish and it did. The bottle is pretty large and a small amount will thin out a regular sized bottle of nail polish. The only request I would make is that I wish it came with some sort of a dropper because the mouth of the bottle is much larger than the mouth of a nail polish bottle, so it is very easy to make a mess if you have shaky hands. Otherwise, this was a great buy.</li>
            <li> Total miracle nail polish saver!!!..... i used the same cap to insert the liquid in the nail polish... this stuff WORKS!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is great. I am at that point where some of my nail polish is getting to be kind of thick and old. But with a few drops of this thinner, it is as good as new!!&lt;br /&gt;I do have one complaint (minor)- the thinner is kind of hard to pour into the nail polish tube itself. So one **tip** that I have is to pour some thinner into a plastic baggy and then snip a tiny corner off and use that to put the thinner in the nail polish.</li>
            <li> This is a good-sized bottle of nail polish thinner that will last for a good while.  It is also good for smoothing out polish already on your nails.</li>
