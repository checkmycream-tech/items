            <li>I love the fact that it gives me volume</li>
            <li>I love this mascara</li>
            <li>It is everything I&#x27;ve ever wanted in a mascara and to much more.</li>
            <li>The length brush is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I have alot of mascaras and this is one of my favorite to make them longer.</li>
            <li>Being office or club appropriate is easy as ever with just one product to work with.</li>
            <li>Bought because it was cheap, works okay.</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to get the same great value and in just a couple days.</li>
            <li>Really works!! :)</li>
            <li>They make your lashes look amazing and really play up your eyes.</li>
            <li>I will buy it until it&#x27;s no longer available.</li>
            <li>If you do it right, it makes for a lovely lash-intense look.</li>
            <li>It was very useful to me and my spouse.</li>
            <li>I love this product and haven&#x27;t been able to find it at my local discount store anymore.</li>
            <li>I love Rimmel London and this is definitely one of my new most favorite mascaras.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>As a maybelline loyalist for the last 10 years, I decided to try this because I liked the idea of a two in one.</li>
            <li>The volume brush does exactly what is says, give your lash volume and makes them look full.</li>
            <li>I have curly long lashes and this helps me make the most of them and keep them gunk free.</li>
            <li>This is probably good because I know that I normally use my mascaras too long anyway.</li>
            <li>Used it yesterday for the first time and it made my lashes look longer and curled.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara I was searching and couldn&#x27;t find it locally</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t easy to find locally.</li>
            <li>The lengthening brush doesn&#x27;t really do much, the volume brush works</li>
            <li>Absolute favourite mascara.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>was much</li>
            <li>option night-time may or may not clump depending how much time and effort you put into paying attention to what your are doing.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real but was looking for a cheaper alternative that would work just as well.</li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;long- daytime&amp;#34; tends to work more reliably than the &amp;#34;max-volume night time&amp;#34;... this may be due to the amount of product allowed to stay on the brush.  </li>
            <li>Recommend it highly. </li>
            <li>, you can see each one do as it says, I just wish it lengthened a little bit more.  </li>
            <li>Great for dramatic natural lashes.</li>
            <li>2 in 1 gives you long thick lashes which is great try it out</li>
            <li>Ordered (2) last week came a day before expected :) I recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li>A must have for girls who don&#x27;t like to wear falsies and prefer a full dark look.</li>
            <li>Barely lengthened my lashes or made it thicker.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to trying this based on other reviews.</li>

            <li> many thanks excellent product</li>
            <li> Bought because it was cheap, works okay. The lengthening brush doesn&#x27;t really do much, the volume brush works okay.</li>
            <li> I love this. I can&#x27;t find this anywhere in the stores</li>
            <li> As a maybelline loyalist for the last 10 years, I decided to try this because I liked the idea of a two in one. This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered it and am very happy with the product. I like that you can opt for extension OR thickening OR both. I usually do both and when applied, you can see each one do as it says, I just wish it lengthened a little bit more.  It seems like it may run out faster than other mascaras. This is probably good because I know that I normally use my mascaras too long anyway.</li>
            <li> I love Rimmel London and this is definitely one of my new most favorite mascaras. They make your lashes look amazing and really play up your eyes. Being office or club appropriate is easy as ever with just one product to work with. Beautiful product!</li>
            <li> Absolute favourite mascara. I will buy it until it&#x27;s no longer available.</li>
            <li> I always use Rimmel mascara ... this one is particularly nice as it has the two brushes, for length and volume.  Really works!! :)</li>
            <li> I bought all I could afford. This is the best of the best on the market. It isn&#x27;t easy to find locally. Hope they don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
            <li> Ive been searching everywhere in town for this mascara and I&#x27;ve finally found it! Ordered (2) last week came a day before expected :) I recommend this to everyone. This mascara makes my eyelashes longer than they already are. Again so glad i was able to find it :)</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> I may be using this wrong but it clumps easier than most I&#x27;ve bought in my life. I like it but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to trying this based on other reviews. I was quite disappointed. Barely lengthened my lashes or made it thicker. It came out clumpy and I had to use a lash separator.  I tried day followed by night in hopes of getting more dramatic lashes with little improvement.  I will not be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I love this product and haven&#x27;t been able to find it at my local discount store anymore. Glad I was able to get the same great value and in just a couple days.</li>
            <li> love it. great product perfect eyelashes. 2 in 1 gives you long thick lashes which is great try it out</li>
            <li> I have curly long lashes and this helps me make the most of them and keep them gunk free. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to use it was much but I use it everyday I love the fact that it gives me volume nd it separates my eyelashes</li>
            <li> I love this mascara it makes my eyelashes look long. Recommend it highly. </li>
            <li> Volume brush makes lashes clumpy.  Mascara smears very easily.</li>
            <li> Great mascara! Used it yesterday for the first time and it made my lashes look longer and curled. My eyes popped! I would definitely recommenced it!</li>
            <li> the &amp;#34;long- daytime&amp;#34; tends to work more reliably than the &amp;#34;max-volume night time&amp;#34;... this may be due to the amount of product allowed to stay on the brush.  opion day-time will leave your lashes long and subtle. option night-time may or may not clump depending how much time and effort you put into paying attention to what your are doing.  If you do it right, it makes for a lovely lash-intense look.</li>
            <li> the product is so good, I use always both and my eyelashes look fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with that</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but for this product I just had to. It is everything I&#x27;ve ever wanted in a mascara and to much more. I was using Benefit They&#x27;re Real but was looking for a cheaper alternative that would work just as well. Well I found it and I will never pay $20 for mascara again! The volume brush does exactly what is says, give your lash volume and makes them look full. The length brush is FANTASTIC! it gets rid of any clumps, adds length and additional volume and helps get every little lash.  Do yourself a favor and at least give this mascara a try.</li>
            <li> Best mascara on the market.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara I was searching and couldn&#x27;t find it locally the volume and length brushes work great my favorite use to be Dior show and this works the same if not better and way less expensive</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. It was very useful to me and my spouse. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Great for dramatic natural lashes. A must have for girls who don&#x27;t like to wear falsies and prefer a full dark look.</li>
            <li> Love this. I have alot of mascaras and this is one of my favorite to make them longer. Also makes them look fuller.</li>
