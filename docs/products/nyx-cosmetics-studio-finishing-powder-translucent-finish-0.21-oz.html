            <li>Good product.  </li>

            <li>This one was affordable and had good reviews, so I gave it a shot.  </li>
            <li>Best finishing powder I&#x27;ve used in a while, keeps my makeup looking fresh, and it helps keep my face from looking oily!</li>
            <li>Very good powder, it make the skin so soft and flawless !!</li>
            <li>I am usually very pleased with NYX products and have always used NYX products.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this finishing powder!  </li>
            <li>I apply with my damp beauty blender so amazing gives a airbrushed look</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing your makeup stays put all day and matte</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>good then the Nars one but way more cheaper.</li>
            <li>Nice product</li>
            <li>But if you have any sort of color, this isn&#x27;t the best because by the time you put it on your brush and shake the access off, you are loosing a lot of the product and even then if you have too much product</li>
            <li>The product itself was nice quality.  </li>
            <li>Super light and flawless finish</li>
            <li>and it really smoothes my face, leaving my makeup more flawless than it has ever been.  </li>
            <li>I also think the packaging felt cheap, but that wouldn&#x27;t hinder my purchase since the quality of the powder was good.</li>
            <li>have very fair skin (even the lighest makeup shades are often too pigmented for me), so an added bonus is that it does tone the L&#x27;Oreal True Match down to match my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li>it is very very light and doesnt make my skin oily.-sarah</li>
            <li>Very light and airy.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, it will work better in the summer, or on somebody else.</li>
            <li>This powder absorbs oil throughout the day and makes my completion more even then foundation by itself.</li>
            <li>I will be playing with it more this weekend.</li>
            <li>it was okay</li>
            <li>I used this product with my e.l.f.cosmetics concealer palette amenities LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>The finishing powder is ok</li>
            <li>I am just as satisfied with the NYX Finishing Powder.</li>
            <li>I love this for the price.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I saw this product on a ten best list and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>This makes me look more polished and</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Its awesome use it daily, i also use for my lipstick to make them matte</li>
            <li>love this finishing powder, it has multi purpose ..</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this powder.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t come with an applicator either which wasn&#x27;t the most convenient.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I love nyx products anyway, so this is one more product to add to my nyx list of faves :)</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m already obsessing over it , leaves a beautiful soft touch to my face .</li>
            <li>Way better than the super priced ones at any makeup store!</li>
            <li>Very good product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so fine that I can&#x27;t help</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also so fine that even after holding my breath while brushing it over my face and waiting a minute, I still breathe in a bunch of it.  </li>
            <li>I wish there was more product in the container because I felt like I ran out quickly.  </li>
            <li>Will return to buy more very very soon!</li>
            <li>This powder is the best for diminishing the oily look while allowing a little glow (not shine).  </li>
            <li>Very lightweight, leaves a nice smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest taking pictures with light while using it.</li>
            <li>I use powder and sometimes cream foundations but no matter what I put on this really does give my makeup a nice finish.</li>
            <li>Extremely light.</li>
            <li>I have used other translucent that was very good, but I thought I would try one that was not so pricey.</li>
            <li>Every bit as good as the high end brands with an economical price.</li>
            <li>I use a light concealer, L&#x27;Oreal True Match mineral powder, and then a light dusting of this Nyx powder applied with a kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>my face has stayed fresh with no need to reapply or touch up!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several translucent powders in hopes of achieving a matte finish to set my foundation without a cakey, powdery look and this one does a fair job of achieving that.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it in full force to know if</li>
            <li>I go through them so quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly the same and is an amazing deal!</li>
            <li>Bought a couple to give as gifts and they came quickly in protective packaging.</li>
            <li>This powder leaves my face looking nice and smooth after applying my foundation and keeps me shine-free for a long time.</li>
            <li>Sets my makeup for the entire dayðŸ˜„ love it!</li>
            <li>;) bought 2!</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth $14..</li>
            <li>but I just can&#x27;t afford it right now, .</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s a perfect dupe for the super expensive silica powder from Make Up Forever.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a woman of color and want a loose white powder with no flashback and some gorgeous blurring effects, spring for the Estee Lauder Lucidity!</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product, because it left my face oil free throughout the day (and I have highly oily skin).</li>
            <li>so got used up very fast</li>
            <li>Good staple for anyone who is a little oily.</li>
            <li>I most likely won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, and my nose gets really oily!</li>
            <li>Thanks NYX!</li>
            <li>But this stuff really helps reduce shine!</li>
            <li>So soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is actually sheer, which is important to me because I have fair skin with dark freckles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s similar to a veil or filter and flushes out flaws nicely, covering lightly, and stays on for a long time!</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, so it&#x27;s a nice way to appear less greasy.</li>
            <li>It seems to work adequately,  and I do have ultra sensitive skin, (a guy wouldn&#x27;t notice the difference)</li>
            <li>, It makes my skin look dry and doesn&#x27;t really make my face look any better.</li>
            <li>Its really fine and white.</li>
            <li>That one actually is colorless especially if spritzed with Fix+ to make it look more like skin!</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>softens my over all look, i really like this powder.  </li>
            <li>If you apply too much yes you will get that ash look.</li>
            <li>But I may have applied too much.</li>
            <li>but it really flies all over the place</li>
            <li>gets absolutely everywhere.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to use much on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like to use this Finishing Powder.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like this stuff at all</li>
            <li>Very please.</li>
            <li>and I find that it is very drying on my face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like it and will probably continue buying this brand.  </li>
            <li>However, the whiteness of the powder is really noticeable because i am tan like Beyonce skin tone.</li>
            <li>Whether I am wearing just foundation, or just powder, this finishing powder keeps it in place all day with absolutely ZERO shine.</li>
            <li>When applying this a little goes a long way, I suggest using this product like a mineral powder foundation, build to the coverage you are happy with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried HD powder other than this one, so another brand could be much better</li>
            <li>I only give 4 stars because the amount in this container doesn&#x27;t last very long, but compared to how much I was spending on the fancy sephora version, it&#x27;s fine :)</li>
            <li>The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of a full five is that I have no basis for comparison.</li>
            <li>besides the price is great and a little goes a long way!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Decent..</li>
            <li>I am pretty much shine free from morning til night; I get a little shine on my nose.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this finishing powder</li>
            <li>I would skip the high end brands for this type of product.</li>
            <li>Then after I&#x27;ve completed my makeup I apply a little more to help blend everything in.  </li>
            <li>Probably better for pale skin.  </li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t like the fact that the powder is SO fine that even when kept in a drawer, right side up, and not jumbled with all my other products in a makeup bag, it gets everywhere every time I open the lid.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact same price</li>
            <li>Very nice, lightweight powder, goes on silky and fills in pores without being too heavy, but darn the packaging is so small.  </li>
            <li>I also find that Neutrogena anti shine powder is a less expensive and more effective anti-shine finishing powder, and it&#x27;s a compact</li>
            <li>skin looks quite shiny during summers in Florida due to my strong physical sunscreen and the humidity.  </li>
            <li>This finishing powder was recommended to me and I happy to say that I will NOT be switching back to the expensive powder!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only thing was the lid was very scratched up.</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;d only need to reapply if you have really oily skin.</li>
            <li>I think it is probably translucent if applied directly over foundation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but you really have to blend it in or it does look very white on the skin.</li>
            <li>It makes you skin feel so soft</li>
            <li>It instantly took away the shine from my foundation and is very lightweight.</li>
            <li>I really wish I had found this sooner, as I have been using it daily</li>
            <li>it does not make you look like you have caked on makeup, and it leaves your skin feeling SO soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather pay $14 more and get some real heavy duty MAC studio fix.</li>
            <li>I have dry to normal skin and this setting powder did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>It really mattifies EVERYTHING, so I only use it all over my face when I&#x27;m really oily because it catches onto dry patches.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s somewhat very powdery, and it looks a bit dry on the skin.</li>
            <li>I am usually running out the door so having this product wasn&#x27;t working for me because I would have to be super delicate with it to make sure my face and clothes didn&#x27;t turn white.</li>
            <li>You need to use barely any</li>
            <li>Very light weight, non irritating and long lasting powder</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have spent a lot of money on cosmetic counter makeup over the last twenty-plus years.</li>
            <li>it is messy the containers holes are much to large</li>
            <li>Too white, even using a little, I looked dead, could be its too light for my skin.</li>

            <li> The product itself was nice quality.  </li>
            <li> Super light and flawless finish</li>
            <li> and it really smoothes my face, leaving my makeup more flawless than it has ever been.  </li>
            <li> I also think the packaging felt cheap, but that wouldn&#x27;t hinder my purchase since the quality of the powder was good.</li>
            <li> have very fair skin (even the lighest makeup shades are often too pigmented for me), so an added bonus is that it does tone the L&#x27;Oreal True Match down to match my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li> it is very very light and doesnt make my skin oily.-sarah</li>
            <li> Very light and airy.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, it will work better in the summer, or on somebody else.</li>
            <li> This powder absorbs oil throughout the day and makes my completion more even then foundation by itself.</li>
            <li> I will be playing with it more this weekend.</li>
            <li> it was okay</li>
            <li> I used this product with my e.l.f.cosmetics concealer palette amenities LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> The finishing powder is ok</li>
            <li> I am just as satisfied with the NYX Finishing Powder.</li>
            <li> I love this for the price.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I saw this product on a ten best list and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> This makes me look more polished and</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Its awesome use it daily, i also use for my lipstick to make them matte</li>
            <li> love this finishing powder, it has multi purpose ..</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this powder.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t come with an applicator either which wasn&#x27;t the most convenient.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I love nyx products anyway, so this is one more product to add to my nyx list of faves :)</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m already obsessing over it , leaves a beautiful soft touch to my face .</li>
            <li> Way better than the super priced ones at any makeup store!</li>
            <li> Very good product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so fine that I can&#x27;t help</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also so fine that even after holding my breath while brushing it over my face and waiting a minute, I still breathe in a bunch of it.  </li>
            <li> I wish there was more product in the container because I felt like I ran out quickly.  </li>
            <li> Will return to buy more very very soon!</li>
            <li> This powder is the best for diminishing the oily look while allowing a little glow (not shine).  </li>
            <li> Very lightweight, leaves a nice smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest taking pictures with light while using it.</li>
            <li> I use powder and sometimes cream foundations but no matter what I put on this really does give my makeup a nice finish.</li>
            <li> Extremely light.</li>
            <li> I have used other translucent that was very good, but I thought I would try one that was not so pricey.</li>
            <li> Every bit as good as the high end brands with an economical price.</li>
            <li> I use a light concealer, L&#x27;Oreal True Match mineral powder, and then a light dusting of this Nyx powder applied with a kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> my face has stayed fresh with no need to reapply or touch up!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several translucent powders in hopes of achieving a matte finish to set my foundation without a cakey, powdery look and this one does a fair job of achieving that.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it in full force to know if</li>
            <li> I go through them so quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly the same and is an amazing deal!</li>
            <li> Bought a couple to give as gifts and they came quickly in protective packaging.</li>
            <li> This powder leaves my face looking nice and smooth after applying my foundation and keeps me shine-free for a long time.</li>
            <li> Sets my makeup for the entire dayðŸ˜„ love it!</li>
            <li> ;) bought 2!</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth $14..</li>
            <li> but I just can&#x27;t afford it right now, .</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a perfect dupe for the super expensive silica powder from Make Up Forever.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a woman of color and want a loose white powder with no flashback and some gorgeous blurring effects, spring for the Estee Lauder Lucidity!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product, because it left my face oil free throughout the day (and I have highly oily skin).</li>
            <li> so got used up very fast</li>
            <li> Good staple for anyone who is a little oily.</li>
            <li> I most likely won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and my nose gets really oily!</li>
            <li> Thanks NYX!</li>
            <li> But this stuff really helps reduce shine!</li>
            <li> So soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It is actually sheer, which is important to me because I have fair skin with dark freckles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s similar to a veil or filter and flushes out flaws nicely, covering lightly, and stays on for a long time!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, so it&#x27;s a nice way to appear less greasy.</li>
            <li> It seems to work adequately,  and I do have ultra sensitive skin, (a guy wouldn&#x27;t notice the difference)</li>
            <li> , It makes my skin look dry and doesn&#x27;t really make my face look any better.</li>
            <li> Its really fine and white.</li>
            <li> That one actually is colorless especially if spritzed with Fix+ to make it look more like skin!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> softens my over all look, i really like this powder.  </li>
            <li> If you apply too much yes you will get that ash look.</li>
            <li> But I may have applied too much.</li>
            <li> but it really flies all over the place</li>
            <li> gets absolutely everywhere.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to use much on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like to use this Finishing Powder.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like this stuff at all</li>
            <li> Very please.</li>
            <li> and I find that it is very drying on my face.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like it and will probably continue buying this brand.  </li>
            <li> However, the whiteness of the powder is really noticeable because i am tan like Beyonce skin tone.</li>
            <li> Whether I am wearing just foundation, or just powder, this finishing powder keeps it in place all day with absolutely ZERO shine.</li>
            <li> When applying this a little goes a long way, I suggest using this product like a mineral powder foundation, build to the coverage you are happy with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried HD powder other than this one, so another brand could be much better</li>
            <li> I only give 4 stars because the amount in this container doesn&#x27;t last very long, but compared to how much I was spending on the fancy sephora version, it&#x27;s fine :)</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of a full five is that I have no basis for comparison.</li>
            <li> besides the price is great and a little goes a long way!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Decent..</li>
            <li> I am pretty much shine free from morning til night; I get a little shine on my nose.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this finishing powder</li>
            <li> I would skip the high end brands for this type of product.</li>
            <li> Then after I&#x27;ve completed my makeup I apply a little more to help blend everything in.  </li>
            <li> Probably better for pale skin.  </li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t like the fact that the powder is SO fine that even when kept in a drawer, right side up, and not jumbled with all my other products in a makeup bag, it gets everywhere every time I open the lid.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the exact same price</li>
            <li> Very nice, lightweight powder, goes on silky and fills in pores without being too heavy, but darn the packaging is so small.  </li>
            <li> I also find that Neutrogena anti shine powder is a less expensive and more effective anti-shine finishing powder, and it&#x27;s a compact</li>
            <li> skin looks quite shiny during summers in Florida due to my strong physical sunscreen and the humidity.  </li>
            <li> This finishing powder was recommended to me and I happy to say that I will NOT be switching back to the expensive powder!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only thing was the lid was very scratched up.</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;d only need to reapply if you have really oily skin.</li>
            <li> I think it is probably translucent if applied directly over foundation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you really have to blend it in or it does look very white on the skin.</li>
            <li> It makes you skin feel so soft</li>
            <li> It instantly took away the shine from my foundation and is very lightweight.</li>
            <li> I really wish I had found this sooner, as I have been using it daily</li>
            <li> it does not make you look like you have caked on makeup, and it leaves your skin feeling SO soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather pay $14 more and get some real heavy duty MAC studio fix.</li>
            <li> I have dry to normal skin and this setting powder did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> It really mattifies EVERYTHING, so I only use it all over my face when I&#x27;m really oily because it catches onto dry patches.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat very powdery, and it looks a bit dry on the skin.</li>
            <li> I am usually running out the door so having this product wasn&#x27;t working for me because I would have to be super delicate with it to make sure my face and clothes didn&#x27;t turn white.</li>
            <li> You need to use barely any</li>
            <li> Very light weight, non irritating and long lasting powder</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have spent a lot of money on cosmetic counter makeup over the last twenty-plus years.</li>
            <li> it is messy the containers holes are much to large</li>
            <li> Too white, even using a little, I looked dead, could be its too light for my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain exactly how it works because the powder looks snow white, so you think it will wash out your face, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> But overall it works and long lasting</li>
            <li> Messy and very hard to apply because this powder is SO FINE that brushes can barely pick it up--</li>
            <li> It does make my face smother to the touch where it doesn&#x27;t just look dry and gross though.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell that this is doing anything other than making me look awfully pale.</li>
            <li> I remember once I was running late and just put on some powder before heading out, however, I accidently put on too much</li>
            <li> And jar is bigger than I expected</li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that you have to be careful with the amount that you put on your face.</li>
            <li> (Because as a teenager I didn&#x27;t have the brains to investigate and learn what ingredients caused me grief -- I just marched straight to the bix box mall cosmetic counter because it was easy to do.)</li>
            <li> This setting powder works just as good if not better than the expensive setting powder i was using fro smashbox!</li>
            <li> The only other cheaper option that I have found for silica powder is through coastal scents, which works just as well.</li>
            <li> performs the more expensive brands by a mile!</li>
            <li> How have I lived without this for so long?!</li>
            <li> But the skin in-between my eyebrows became really dry and started to peal, has not stopped yet and it has almost been a month.</li>
            <li> This is decent for the mean time.</li>
            <li> and I only use this product at home, over my bathroom sink, and before I put on dark clothing.  </li>
            <li> Slightly messy if you&#x27;re not careful</li>
            <li> I would have to apply it several times throughout the day, but that is typical for my skin.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m wasting half the product each time I open it</li>
            <li> the only problem is the mess it makes when its been bounced around.</li>
            <li> Dry, white, messy.</li>
            <li> This powder is only translucent if you put a little bit on</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is reasonably priced but difficult to find locally.</li>
            <li> and I really do not like it.  </li>
            <li> put this to save money usually buy bare essentials mineral veil</li>
            <li> It also kicks up a lot of &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; so you have to be careful while applying it.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it&#x27;s messy because of how the holes are in the container.</li>
            <li> I closed it, dropped it onto my table, then took the lid off.</li>
            <li> Great...works and can be applied as expected.</li>
            <li> I just sampled it and it appears to work as expected.</li>
            <li> But after watching some youtube videos I thought I would try harder to do my makeup, and one of the things used was HD powder.  </li>
            <li> This year, I needed to make some budget changes and began exploring other paraben-free and sunscreen-free makeup options that were closer to home.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day, controls shine and does not make my face itch like other powders.</li>
            <li> Loose powder is always messy, no matter how careful I am with my kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> So in short, it&#x27;s very messy</li>
            <li> I have to put a hand towel down under it or powder</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s much less</li>
            <li> If it had a way to close the holes during storage, I might buy again because it sets my foundation well and doesn&#x27;t wash out my face and make me look more pale than I already am, but I really hate the mess and the wasted powder.</li>
            <li> It may be a little drying for those that don&#x27;t have oily skin.</li>
            <li> its a little pricy for the amount of powder that it came with.&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li> causing alot of waste.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday to set my makeup.</li>
            <li> Forever I&#x27;ve been using for a few years by allot</li>
            <li> I use it everyday after putting the rest of my make up on.</li>
            <li> It makes my face pale as a ghost.</li>
            <li> A little goes along way !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now a must have in my make up bag for everyday use!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one con: it is SO messy to apply!</li>
            <li> I looked at several brands, and some were wildly expensive.  </li>
            <li> or else it makes you look like a vampire (it&#x27;s so white), but when you use it so lightly it is difficult to tell whether it is doing anything at all.</li>
            <li> I have an olive skin tone, so my face ends up looking very very pale.  </li>
            <li> At least for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have always purchased the foundation and powder from Victoria Secret</li>
            <li> I think it is an unnecessary product that I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> But Im not sure if it was the cold weather, or this product.</li>
            <li> It was decent at leaving a matte finish, however, the smell of the product was terrible and made me feel uncomfortable while applying it.</li>
            <li> The product was not easy to handle. :(</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed I feel it leaves like a weird finish</li>
            <li> hate the smell.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s horrible for when you are taking pictures with flash it makes your face look all ghost like.</li>
            <li> if I forget to apply this, I always have a nasty shock looking in the bathroom mirror at mid-day.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product! Super light and flawless finish</li>
            <li> Very nice, lightweight powder, goes on silky and fills in pores without being too heavy, but darn the packaging is so small.  I go through them so quickly.  Don&#x27;t let the white color scare you.  It looks invisible, which is good.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF! I have very sensitive skin and have spent a lot of money on cosmetic counter makeup over the last twenty-plus years. (Because as a teenager I didn&#x27;t have the brains to investigate and learn what ingredients caused me grief -- I just marched straight to the bix box mall cosmetic counter because it was easy to do.) This year, I needed to make some budget changes and began exploring other paraben-free and sunscreen-free makeup options that were closer to home. This finishing powder was recommended to me and I happy to say that I will NOT be switching back to the expensive powder!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This NYX finishing powder is AMAZING! It does not irritate my skin or cause breakouts. It simply sets my (drugstore) liquid CC cream and the (drugstore) mineral powder foundation that I bounce between every morning. This finishing powder is translucent and a tiny amount is all that is needed. (In fact, I leave the sticker on the sifter holes and just poke one of them open so I only shake a tiny bit out at a time.) It lasts all day, controls shine and does not make my face itch like other powders. It is just silica.&lt;br /&gt;It is reasonably priced but difficult to find locally.</li>
            <li> This is the only powder I will use now! I have very oily skin but this doesn&#x27;t get shiny throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The powder needs to be silkier a bit too grainy. Does the job though.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and it would drive me nuts when I would have to blot my face several times a day. This leaves my face shine free and it blends perfectly. It&#x27;s now a must have in my make up bag for everyday use! Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful finishing powder for the price!! Make up forever dupe! Only thing was the lid was very scratched up. But that&#x27;s ok, it didn&#x27;t effect the product.</li>
            <li> softens my over all look, i really like this powder.  it is very very light and doesnt make my skin oily.-sarah</li>
            <li> Though I did not buy this on Amazon, I bought this from a store I have to say it is a great product. When applying this a little goes a long way, I suggest using this product like a mineral powder foundation, build to the coverage you are happy with. If you apply too much yes you will get that ash look. I work in a gym sometimes 12 hour shifts my face has stayed fresh with no need to reapply or touch up!  The only draw back to this powder is it is messy the containers holes are much to large causing alot of waste. If they revamp the lid it would make this product 5 stars! I find it comparable to my smash box powder.</li>
            <li> Good product.  I would have to apply it several times throughout the day, but that is typical for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have over an 8 hour work day and I never have to reapply or even use a blotting sheet.  Not once.  Slightly messy if you&#x27;re not careful but I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Use it everyday to set my makeup.</li>
            <li> Messy and very hard to apply because this powder is SO FINE that brushes can barely pick it up-- it&#x27;s so fine that I can&#x27;t help but breathe it in when I open itâ€¦ yuck. I also find that Neutrogena anti shine powder is a less expensive and more effective anti-shine finishing powder, and it&#x27;s a compact so it&#x27;s much less messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also hate the smell.</li>
            <li> Makes your make up and skin flawless!! Alot of product. This will last a while. I am loving this stuff!</li>
            <li> Using as finishing powder is great even without foundation. I also use it on any lipstick and it makes it matte. I will order it again</li>
            <li> Very light and airy. It left face looking ashy. I have used other translucent that was very good, but I thought I would try one that was not so pricey.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s similar to a veil or filter and flushes out flaws nicely, covering lightly, and stays on for a long time!</li>
            <li> Just got my product today &amp; I&#x27;m already obsessing over it , leaves a beautiful soft touch to my face .</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and this works just as we&#x27;ll as the makeup forever finishing powder. Def recommend.</li>
            <li> Every bit as good as the high end brands with an economical price. The only other cheaper option that I have found for silica powder is through coastal scents, which works just as well.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;m a guy and I use it daily after I wash and moisturize my face to take some of the oily shine off. I have oily skin, so it&#x27;s a nice way to appear less greasy.</li>
            <li> For a cheap finishing powder, I think this is one of the best I&#x27;ve found.  I think you&#x27;d only need to reapply if you have really oily skin.</li>
            <li> I got this product in way before the shopping date which I loved and it has a nice finish that makes my skin look perfect</li>
            <li> I have dry to normal skin and this setting powder did absolutely nothing for me. If anything it made me oily and left a white residue on my face. I will definitely not recommend that anyone purchase this product!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product, because it left my face oil free throughout the day (and I have highly oily skin). Did not have to touch-up, or anything. But Im not sure if it was the cold weather, or this product. But the skin in-between my eyebrows became really dry and started to peal, has not stopped yet and it has almost been a month. It did give me a white glow, or something because my mom would ask what was on my face. Hopefully, it will work better in the summer, or on somebody else. But I am still using it!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Decent.. Worth $14.. No. I&#x27;d rather pay $14 more and get some real heavy duty MAC studio fix. This is decent for the mean time. Loose powder is always messy, no matter how careful I am with my kabuki brush. As a makeup guru, I don&#x27;t recommend you spend $14 on this. If It were maybe $5-$7 I would though.</li>
            <li> I apply with my damp beauty blender so amazing gives a airbrushed look i set everything after with a setting spray</li>
            <li> The product says not to be fooled by the white color that once it is applied it won&#x27;t show.  Well it does show and I really do not like it.  I will NOT be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Very good for face but drys lips.</li>
            <li> Good staple for anyone who is a little oily. This powder absorbs oil throughout the day and makes my completion more even then foundation by itself. It may be a little drying for those that don&#x27;t have oily skin.</li>
            <li> Its really fine and white. It makes my face pale as a ghost. Would not reccommend this product unless you have no color pigment -_-</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this finishing powder but I was disappointed I feel it leaves like a weird finish and it&#x27;s horrible for when you are taking pictures with flash it makes your face look all ghost like.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight, leaves a nice smooth finish.</li>
            <li> Was a bit too white for my skin tone. But I may have applied too much. I will be playing with it more this weekend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several translucent powders in hopes of achieving a matte finish to set my foundation without a cakey, powdery look and this one does a fair job of achieving that.  However, I don&#x27;t like the fact that the powder is SO fine that even when kept in a drawer, right side up, and not jumbled with all my other products in a makeup bag, it gets everywhere every time I open the lid.  I feel like I&#x27;m wasting half the product each time I open it and I have to try to get the excess off the rim and my hand with my brush.  It&#x27;s also so fine that even after holding my breath while brushing it over my face and waiting a minute, I still breathe in a bunch of it.  So in short, it&#x27;s very messy and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend keeping it in your purse or traveling with it to reapply during the day.  I&#x27;ve gone back to keeping a compressed power in my purse for touch ups and I only use this product at home, over my bathroom sink, and before I put on dark clothing.  If it had a way to close the holes during storage, I might buy again because it sets my foundation well and doesn&#x27;t wash out my face and make me look more pale than I already am, but I really hate the mess and the wasted powder.</li>
            <li> Its great for setting my under eye concealer. If you have oily skin it doesn&#x27;t keep you matte. I most likely won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> put this to save money usually buy bare essentials mineral veil but I just can&#x27;t afford it right now, . it was okay but it really flies all over the place so got used up very fast</li>
            <li> Works great! It gives you a glowing finish. I feel incomplete without it.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest taking pictures with light while using it. But overall it works and long lasting</li>
            <li> This is the only finishing powder that keeps the shine away all day for me. I have combination skin, and my nose gets really oily! I use a light concealer, L&#x27;Oreal True Match mineral powder, and then a light dusting of this Nyx powder applied with a kabuki brush. Let me tell you...if I forget to apply this, I always have a nasty shock looking in the bathroom mirror at mid-day. Shiniest nose ever. Then if I try to blot the oil, the makeup comes up, and I have Rudolph Syndrome. Nyx prevents this entirely.&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair skin (even the lighest makeup shades are often too pigmented for me), so an added bonus is that it does tone the L&#x27;Oreal True Match down to match my skin perfectly. I think it is probably translucent if applied directly over foundation.&lt;br /&gt;The one con: it is SO messy to apply! I have to put a hand towel down under it or powder gets absolutely everywhere. If it were a more expensive product, I&#x27;d be irritated at the lost powder.</li>
            <li> I used this product with my e.l.f.cosmetics concealer palette amenities LOVE IT. Tjeres actually quite a bit in there so you don&#x27;t have to use much on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin tone is Deep Brown.</li>
            <li> Dry, white, messy. Flashback galore! If you&#x27;re a woman of color and want a loose white powder with no flashback and some gorgeous blurring effects, spring for the Estee Lauder Lucidity! That one actually is colorless especially if spritzed with Fix+ to make it look more like skin!</li>
            <li> The price is right...cheaper than the sephora Makeup Forever I&#x27;ve been using for a few years by allot but..the powder isn&#x27;t as microfine either..it feels coarser. It seems to work adequately,  and I do have ultra sensitive skin, (a guy wouldn&#x27;t notice the difference) but I prefer the finer sized particle of the Make up Forever product but the price of this one. They should list micron size for the particles of silica powder so you know how fine/ silky or coarse the powder is.</li>
            <li> Works grate if u have oily skin</li>
            <li> The finishing powder is ok but you really have to blend it in or it does look very white on the skin. It also kicks up a lot of &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; so you have to be careful while applying it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have always purchased the foundation and powder from Victoria Secret they no longer make these items.  I am just as satisfied with the NYX Finishing Powder.</li>
            <li> Best finishing powder I&#x27;ve used in a while, keeps my makeup looking fresh, and it helps keep my face from looking oily!</li>
            <li> Still feel the same way as I did in my review 2 years ago. This powder is awesome, and I have not purchased translucent powder from MAC since I started to use this one.</li>
            <li> It makes you skin feel so soft</li>
            <li> Very good powder, it make the skin so soft and flawless !!&lt;br /&gt;As good then the Nars one but way more cheaper.</li>
            <li> This powder is great. It is actually sheer, which is important to me because I have fair skin with dark freckles. It instantly took away the shine from my foundation and is very lightweight. The only drawback is that it&#x27;s messy because of how the holes are in the container. I closed it, dropped it onto my table, then took the lid off. There was just enough product in the lid to use by dipping my brush into the lid instead of the jar.</li>
            <li> I really like to use this Finishing Powder. Not only do I use it when I&#x27;m done with my makeup application but I also use it when I am not wearing makeup. It helps keep the shine from my face and absorb any oils that are hanging around. I really wish I had found this sooner, as I have been using it daily</li>
            <li> It was decent at leaving a matte finish, however, the smell of the product was terrible and made me feel uncomfortable while applying it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Don&#x27;t forget primer and powder finish . A little goes along way ! Otherwise it cakes!</li>
            <li> Perfect touch during summer months&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks quite shiny during summers in Florida due to my strong physical sunscreen and the humidity.  This powder is the best for diminishing the oily look while allowing a little glow (not shine).  It is too matte on me during the winter, but it is perfect for summer.  BTW - I am medium tan, and I do not have issues with the color of this product. I apply sparingly.</li>
            <li> this is the best powder ever. it does not make you look like you have caked on makeup, and it leaves your skin feeling SO soft. Also, it&#x27;s a perfect dupe for the super expensive silica powder from Make Up Forever. This is exactly the same and is an amazing deal! I only give 4 stars because the amount in this container doesn&#x27;t last very long, but compared to how much I was spending on the fancy sephora version, it&#x27;s fine :)</li>
            <li> I love this for the price.  The product is not as great as the &amp;#34;Make-up Forever&amp;#34; hd powder but is great for the price and does in a pinch!  I will keep this product on hand.</li>
            <li> perfect powder. the only problem is the mess it makes when its been bounced around. i took mine on vacation, and when i opened it powder flew up in my face. Still, really great product, and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work and makes you skin look white</li>
            <li> Leave your skin so perfect</li>
            <li> Great powder. It really mattifies EVERYTHING, so I only use it all over my face when I&#x27;m really oily because it catches onto dry patches. But I use this under my eyes on the daily to keep my concealer in place.</li>
            <li> Love it. Seems to keep my makeup on all day!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like this stuff at all, It makes my skin look dry and doesn&#x27;t really make my face look any better. It does make my face smother to the touch where it doesn&#x27;t just look dry and gross though. Overall I just think I will stick with not using finishing powder.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Bought a couple to give as gifts and they came quickly in protective packaging. Very please. Will return to buy more very very soon!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the white color fool you this stuff is amazing your makeup stays put all day and matte I love it</li>
            <li> I saw this product on a ten best list and decided to give it a try.  It&#x27;s a great value for the money and out performs the more expensive brands by a mile! Definitely a part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> This finishing powder completes my look. Always a must use item when I go out and even if i am just running to the store. Very light weight, non irritating and long lasting powder</li>
            <li> this works so good! I am so glad I got it!!</li>
            <li> This powder is only translucent if you put a little bit on and I find that it is very drying on my face. Recommend only for people with oily faces.</li>
            <li> I use powder and sometimes cream foundations but no matter what I put on this really does give my makeup a nice finish.</li>
            <li> Great...works and can be applied as expected. Nice product</li>
            <li> This makes me look more polished and any photo taken when I have this on, I feel like my skin looks great!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. Amazing quality for a good price! Great finishing powder. Way better than the super priced ones at any makeup store! Thanks NYX!</li>
            <li> Great powder. Extremely light. Doesn&#x27;t alter your makeup colors. Great for setting finished makeup. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it everyday after putting the rest of my make up on. I am pretty much shine free from morning til night; I get a little shine on my nose. But this stuff really helps reduce shine!</li>
            <li> Sets my makeup for the entire dayðŸ˜„ love it!</li>
            <li> Its awesome use it daily, i also use for my lipstick to make them matte</li>
            <li> If you have fair skin and just looking for a good setting powder this is an amazing product with great price. But if you have any sort of color, this isn&#x27;t the best because by the time you put it on your brush and shake the access off, you are loosing a lot of the product and even then if you have too much product it&#x27;ll show up as a white streak...which is a no no. I am usually running out the door so having this product wasn&#x27;t working for me because I would have to be super delicate with it to make sure my face and clothes didn&#x27;t turn white.</li>
            <li> love this finishing powder, it has multi purpose .. best for that finishing touch after concealer .. lovely for that highlighting area for fresh dewy look but not oily .. perfect powder !</li>
            <li> Too white, even using a little, I looked dead, could be its too light for my skin.</li>
            <li> Great price great product</li>
            <li> Can you put it on your lips to set lipstick that way it don&#x27;t rub off ?</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this powder. Yes, it is white but it just disappears on the skin and give a wonderfully matte look. Not chalky white or washed out. At least for me. It only takes a bit of product to do the job and is unscented. Blends beautifully.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it in full force to know if and how often it has to be applied. I just sampled it and it appears to work as expected. This is something I intend to use outside of the office.</li>
            <li> The product itself was nice quality.  I wish there was more product in the container because I felt like I ran out quickly.  I also think the packaging felt cheap, but that wouldn&#x27;t hinder my purchase since the quality of the powder was good.</li>
            <li> Very good product, especially for the price. This powder leaves my face looking nice and smooth after applying my foundation and keeps me shine-free for a long time. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The product was not easy to handle. :( I am usually very pleased with NYX products and have always used NYX products.</li>
            <li> This setting powder works just as good if not better than the expensive setting powder i was using fro smashbox!</li>
            <li> No I didn&#x27;t buy it off amazon, but yes I bought it. I love this finishing powder!  So soft and smooth. After I put my foundation I applied my nyx finishing powder. I love it. Perfect for someone with oily skin.  If you don&#x27;t want to wait for amazon then go to target. It&#x27;s the exact same price</li>
            <li> Looooooove !!! Best setting powder ever !!! Blends so well ;) bought 2! And jar is bigger than I expected</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I had never used HD powder before in any way.  But after watching some youtube videos I thought I would try harder to do my makeup, and one of the things used was HD powder.  I looked at several brands, and some were wildly expensive.  This one was affordable and had good reviews, so I gave it a shot.  It&#x27;s hard to explain exactly how it works because the powder looks snow white, so you think it will wash out your face, but it doesn&#x27;t. I apply it after foundation, and it helps set it in place.  Then after I&#x27;ve completed my makeup I apply a little more to help blend everything in.  It&#x27;s made of silica and it really smoothes my face, leaving my makeup more flawless than it has ever been.  I really like it and will probably continue buying this brand.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of a full five is that I have no basis for comparison. I&#x27;ve never tried HD powder other than this one, so another brand could be much better and I would have no way of knowing.</li>
            <li> its a little pricy for the amount of powder that it came with.&lt;br /&gt;also didn&#x27;t come with an applicator either which wasn&#x27;t the most convenient.&lt;br /&gt;but it did come on time..</li>
            <li> Probably better for pale skin.  I have an olive skin tone, so my face ends up looking very very pale.  very nice texture, but I think I will try the one with color next time.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy again, but I would recommend it to my lighter friends.</li>
            <li> I use this product alone or after I put on all my makeup. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that you have to be careful with the amount that you put on your face. I remember once I was running late and just put on some powder before heading out, however, I accidently put on too much and it left patches of white on my face. However, the whiteness of the powder is really noticeable because i am tan like Beyonce skin tone.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It gives you a perfect finish after your makeup routine. I deff. Recommend this!! :)  besides the price is great and a little goes a long way!!!</li>
            <li> keeps skin matte and great</li>
            <li> Excellent inexpensive translucent setting power! I would skip the high end brands for this type of product. I love nyx products anyway, so this is one more product to add to my nyx list of faves :)</li>
            <li> Loved, gives a perfect finish to your makeup!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell that this is doing anything other than making me look awfully pale. You need to use barely any or else it makes you look like a vampire (it&#x27;s so white), but when you use it so lightly it is difficult to tell whether it is doing anything at all. I think it is an unnecessary product that I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> How have I lived without this for so long?! Even with a matte primer and my UD setting spray, I would still get greasy or my makeup would move throughout the day. Whether I am wearing just foundation, or just powder, this finishing powder keeps it in place all day with absolutely ZERO shine. YES YES YES!</li>
            <li> did nit like this at all you could tell there was stuff in my face and looked like I needed to wipe it off</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat very powdery, and it looks a bit dry on the skin. Can&#x27;t say I want that for my skin. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
