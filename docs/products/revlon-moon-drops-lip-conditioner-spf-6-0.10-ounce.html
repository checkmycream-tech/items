    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is best lip conditioning I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Still one of the best.  </li>
            <li>Excellent lip conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Best lip gloss and sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The best news, it blends into the skin and truly conditions the lip skin instead of glazing the lip skin and rubbing off in patches.  </li>
            <li>Words cannot EVER suffice just how happy I am today.</li>
            <li>I been craving that came along with this great quality of a lip conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>Hopefully, by the time I run out there will be another product as good as this one on the market.</li>
            <li>When I purchased these two Moon Drops lipsticks from you on Amazon, I honestly thought I was taking a chance and may not get that ORIGINAL DELICIOUS TASTE &amp; SCENT</li>
            <li>Been using this for years and still love it!</li>

            <li>My other favorite is good old Chapstick.  </li>
            <li>and I love it and for me, there is no other like it</li>
            <li>Have used for many years and found it to be the best lip conditioner/moisturizer on the market outside of plain old Vaseline..</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes my day because my lips are always smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>My friend has given me a name  \\&quot;Hot Lips!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>So glad to finally see it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>&quot; I don&#x27;t care much for.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to you..</li>
            <li>It protects your lips and keeps them moist throughout the whole day.  </li>
            <li>Too many other products have ingredients that I am allergic to.</li>
            <li>High quality and well priced.</li>
            <li>I bought several to have on hand because they are that good but apparently discontinued except for a few locaions like Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Orange is not cute on most</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth but doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>It was orange not the clear like before.</li>
            <li>and my lips are still soft.  </li>
            <li>I had hoped this conditioner would remove the dead skin and leave my lip smooth.  </li>
            <li>and so far can&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li>and I think these I received are really OLD before they started putting SPF in them.</li>
            <li>Megs Natural Health Market</li>
            <li>This hard to find anymore item is great for my lips, it is tasteless and has a smooth texture.  </li>
            <li>I hunt outdoors in severe weather; cold, wind, bright sunlight, freezing dry conditions, and have not suffered chapped lips since I began using this product daily.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding it on the East Coast where I live, so I&#x27;ve been stocking up on my trips to Seattle.</li>
            <li> I put this on my very dry lips this morning.  </li>
            <li> My lower lip stays dry and usually has dead skin areas that cause lipstick to look bad.  </li>

            <li> I have always liked this lip conditioner.</li>
            <li> I put this on my very dry lips this morning.  I blotted my lips, ate, etc.  It is now after 4 p.m. and my lips are still soft.  Amazing</li>
            <li> It was orange not the clear like before. Orange is not cute on most so I wont wear.</li>
            <li> My lower lip stays dry and usually has dead skin areas that cause lipstick to look bad.  I had hoped this conditioner would remove the dead skin and leave my lip smooth.  I&#x27;ve been using it several times a day for about a week and so far can&#x27;t see a difference. It goes on smooth but doesn&#x27;t last long.  It does have a \\&quot;taste\\&quot; I don&#x27;t care much for.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it and update later if it does what I need it to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lipstick for years and there is nothing as good as this for moisturizing and giving your lips a lovely shine.  Just keep on makin it, Revlon!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years and still love it!</li>
            <li> This is best lip conditioning I&#x27;ve used.  Keeps from drying out, totally prevents chapping.  I don&#x27;t have any more words to add, so don&#x27;t require me to.</li>
            <li> This has been the only lip conditioner that has worked for me and I love it and for me, there is no other like it and I wish that they would bring it back.  As long as I can get it at a resonable price online, I will always be a satisfied customer, and a happy one at that!  I will be a customer of yours (Amazon) forever as long as I can get Revlon Moon Drops Lip Conditioner!  This conditioner makes my day because my lips are always smooth and soft.  My friend has given me a name  \\&quot;Hot Lips!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Comes as promised every month.</li>
            <li> This hard to find anymore item is great for my lips, it is tasteless and has a smooth texture.  I bought several to have on hand because they are that good but apparently discontinued except for a few locaions like Amazon.  Hopefully, by the time I run out there will be another product as good as this one on the market.</li>
            <li> My absolutely favorite lip conditioner for over twenty years.  It moisturizes without leaving a greasy feeling.  It is always out of stock in the stores, but as always I can find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> what I received was not moon drops lip conditioner, SPF 6 , it was just &amp;#34;lip conditioner&amp;#34;, and in addition to having no spf, it is not as emolient as what I&#x27;ve been using for years</li>
            <li> I chose it because I have been using it for years and I can&#x27;t find it in the stores now.  I really like it and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Have used for years.  Still one of the best.  My other favorite is good old Chapstick.  Too many other products have ingredients that I am allergic to.</li>
            <li> Have used for many years and found it to be the best lip conditioner/moisturizer on the market outside of plain old Vaseline..</li>
            <li> Ordered Moon Drops Lip Conditioner with SPF ! There is NO SPF in these three tubes that I purchased. I have been buying this lip conditioner for years and I think these I received are really OLD before they started putting SPF in them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Revlon Moon Drops lip conditioner (and recommending it to others) for over thirty years. I&#x27;m a makeup artist, and my clients love it. I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding it on the East Coast where I live, so I&#x27;ve been stocking up on my trips to Seattle. So glad to finally see it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Words cannot EVER suffice just how happy I am today. When I purchased these two Moon Drops lipsticks from you on Amazon, I honestly thought I was taking a chance and may not get that ORIGINAL DELICIOUS TASTE &amp; SCENT I been craving that came along with this great quality of a lip conditioner. I was looking for it for decades now, and today I opened my package and THAT SCENT I WAS CRAVING IS BACK!!!! Thanks to you..Megs Natural Health Market..I have found my true lip conditioner love again!! I am purchasing more as soon as I finish this feedback. The delivery time was awesome fast too..thank you so, so very much for this!! I LOVE YOU MEG!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent lip conditioner.  It&#x27;s the only one I use.  It protects your lips and keeps them moist throughout the whole day.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I hope Revlon NEVER stops making this. Best lip gloss and sunscreen. High quality and well priced.</li>
            <li> The lip conditioner applies evenly without build up and actually assists the skin in staying moist and pliable.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like a lip protection wax or grease.  The best news, it blends into the skin and truly conditions the lip skin instead of glazing the lip skin and rubbing off in patches.  I hunt outdoors in severe weather; cold, wind, bright sunlight, freezing dry conditions, and have not suffered chapped lips since I began using this product daily.  You definitely need to reapply it during times when exposed to tough conditions but the product has not failed to perform as advertised.</li>
