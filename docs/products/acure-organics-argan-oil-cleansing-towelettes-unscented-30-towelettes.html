            <li>The argan oil makes my skin feel really good as well.  </li>
            <li>No matter how good something cleans you, it shouldn&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li>Good cleanser, organic which I like.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I am wearing BB cream fairly often and have been experimenting with highlighting and contouring makeup techniques.  </li>
            <li>Argan oil is very good for my skin and those cleansing towelettes dont&#x27; irritate my skin and remove my make up easily.</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love!  </li>
            <li>Love!  </li>
            <li>The towelettes themselves have a nice lather.</li>
            <li>I use wipes every time I remove my make up so good wipes are really important to me.</li>
            <li>ok for body.</li>
            <li>towelettes, which is much more soothing product.</li>
            <li>5/26/15 : took these to Africa on Safari, and they were fantastic!</li>
            <li>I use Acure&#x27;s face wash, which I love.  </li>
            <li>and i love how organic it all is.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Aside from the stinging, it cleans well better than Olay and Neutrogenia</li>
            <li>I love this towelettes.  </li>
            <li>I make sure I have these on hand all the time.  </li>
            <li>I really love these wipes.  </li>
            <li>Love the feel of my face after using it.</li>
            <li>I have used them on lipstick, eyeshadow (that&#x27;s over good primer), and mascara with success (not waterproof mascara, though).  </li>
            <li>I really have been happy with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>This is not my favorite type of closure in terms of effectiveness (the packages can lose stickiness about halfway through, which leads to the towelettes drying out).  </li>
            <li>Love these cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li>And I love that they are fragrance-free.</li>
            <li>The keep it nice and clean without over</li>
            <li>However, I will say that they&#x27;re gentle and good at removing oil-based makeup.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent quick wipe for both facial &amp; body needs.  </li>
            <li>Removes even mascara easily and has no cloying scent.  </li>
            <li>This is basically unscented, so there&#x27;s no lingering smell after using it which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for several months and still happy with them</li>
            <li>I use it to clean my face and neck after my workout and it leaves my face feeling so clean.</li>
            <li>My face is oily and I used these during the day to keep it clean.  </li>
            <li>Argon oil by itself breaks my face out, but this is non greasy and clean.</li>
            <li>And the paperboard part at the bottom helps keep the sticky flap in place (more effective than the package without the cardboard, based on my experience with similar products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have combo skin, and these leave it clean without over drying.  </li>
            <li>These are great for removing makeup and wiping away germs, dirt, oil and grime on nights when I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my face. :)</li>
            <li>Good size, moist enough without being drippy, do a good job removing make-up, and no sting or other discomfort</li>
            <li>Since I have multiple chemical allergies, it&#x27;s always nice to find a product that I can use without issues.  </li>
            <li>I used them in the morning when I wasn&#x27;t able to take a shower because of early classes.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and these are really and truly very gentle, but effective.  </li>
            <li>I still use them at home and keep them in the fridge to freshen up on hot humid days.</li>
            <li>Funny</li>
            <li>They are my favorite facial cleansing wipe.  </li>
            <li>I follow up with a facial cleanser for sensitive skin, either Acure Sensitive Facial Cleanser (a product that apparently contains probiotics) or John Masters Organics Rose Foaming Face Wash (a product I got for free from my housemate, who works in the Health and Beauty Department of a health store and receives free full-size samples all the time, many of which I greedily commandeer if he is in a generous mood).  </li>
            <li>I love these facial wipes, although I recommend you look for them at target, they are much cheaper there.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re quite soft, which is nice, especially since I have been using them to take off eye</li>
            <li>no residue left over, it just feels clean!  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many brands of wipes and still keep trying new ones because I have not found any brand that I like enough.</li>
            <li>Not like sharp stings but more of a mild soft burning.</li>
            <li>I use only cruelty free, vegan products and this one is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>As another reviewer mentions, these are also available at Target in the same aisle with the &amp;#34;Yes</li>
            <li>This stuff takes off all my makeup and gunk off my face at the end of the day but leaves my skin fresh, rejuvenated, and completely hydrated.</li>
            <li>really like these wipes</li>
            <li>, they work really well for thoroughly removing make up.</li>
            <li>Their products work really well</li>
            <li>Soothing, not irritating, removes makeup/grime and leaves skin refreshed and not at all irritated.</li>
            <li>They are gentle, remove makeup well, and are organic.</li>
            <li>One or two towelettes gently removes the makeup and sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Toxin free, great for sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling like a sticky residue has been left behind.  </li>
            <li>And they do a pretty complete job</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I plan to order a few more packs to stash in my gym bag and travel bag.</li>
            <li>If you are tired and just want to go to bed, then this is a great product as you can cleanse your skin very conveniently in next to no time and do not necessarily need to apply moisturizers afterwards.</li>
            <li>Seriously cleans pores and leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands of facial wipes and they are all so strong that they sting my face.  </li>
            <li>It removes my foundation and eye shadow and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>and they do not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>They take off eye makeup and daily dirt/makeup, and they&#x27;re very convenient.</li>
            <li>(in fairness, I am using a water-based natural mascara at the moment, which may be easier to remove than competing</li>
            <li>Soft and unscented, as promised.</li>
            <li>I am admittedly very vain about my facial skin and have battled dermatitis.  </li>
            <li>They have not caused any irritation, even though I generally have sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>Whole Foods carries them too, but they are much more expensive.</li>
            <li>Finally I have found make up remover wipes without phenoxyethanol that agree with my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>It is difficult to find affordable products that meet all those criteria, and even more difficult to find products that meet those criteria and are actually gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li>This facial cleanser has just the right amount of moisture - not too dry but not too wet either.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this product is not completely unscented but the smell is really soft</li>
            <li>B001KYQDEW Blum Naturals Dry and Sensitive Skin Daily Cleansing Towelettes with Chamomile, 30 Towelettes]] and [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and was told by my dermatologist that I can&#x27;t wash my skin everyday, but this I can use on my face everyday without it feeling like it&#x27;s stripping my skin.</li>

            <li> It seems to do a much better job at thoroughly cleaning your makeup off without irritating than any other towelette I&#x27;ve used on my face.  </li>
            <li> They kept me clean when I wasn&#x27;t near a shower, and didn&#x27;t leave any weird alcohol smell, or dry skin!</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry or &amp;#34;overwashed&amp;#34; afterwards, and I will apply moisturizers and/or Argan facial oil afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I frequently don&#x27;t want to bother splashing and making everything a mess when I am trying to get to bed, so I use these almost every night.</li>
            <li> My skin is not sensitive but this stings!</li>
            <li> These are about the same size as other towelettes on the market.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry, either.</li>
            <li> I now have a small idea of what my friend, who has extremely sensitive skin, has gone through.</li>
            <li> These seem to make my face a little red, maybe from increased circulation?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got plenty of moisture, but not sopping wet.  </li>
            <li> ; list until they stop making it - hopefully sometime years distant.</li>
            <li> Knocked off one star because they are a little on the dry side.</li>
            <li> Got to me in like less than 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Burn my eyes a little....</li>
            <li> It dries out your skin a little so before bed</li>
            <li> Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;re also relatively thick for this type of product.  </li>
            <li> They are very small in size and thin as well.</li>
            <li> Works well, removes tough makeup and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve had bad luck with oil-based cleansers in the past).  </li>
            <li> The price is a bit expensive but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in these wipes.</li>
            <li> Very bad.</li>

            <li> Works well, removes tough makeup and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> ok for body. It stings. I will stick with say yes to cucumbers. towelettes, which is much more soothing product.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I started using it when Target started offering it, but they have now ceased to offer it.  Very happy to have found it on Amazon.  It&#x27;s an excellent quick wipe for both facial &amp; body needs.  It&#x27;s got plenty of moisture, but not sopping wet.  It leaves a very nice &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; on my face after using, and it is NOT scented!  Since I have multiple chemical allergies, it&#x27;s always nice to find a product that I can use without issues.  This will stay on my &amp;#34;to be used&amp;#34; list until they stop making it - hopefully sometime years distant.</li>
            <li> I use these to remove my makeup.  It seems to do a much better job at thoroughly cleaning your makeup off without irritating than any other towelette I&#x27;ve used on my face.  The argan oil makes my skin feel really good as well.  They also smell great.</li>
            <li> Very bad. I didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> I use only cruelty free, vegan products and this one is one of my favorites. Argan oil is very good for my skin and those cleansing towelettes dont&#x27; irritate my skin and remove my make up easily.</li>
            <li> They were perfect for my trip to Italy.  I used them in the morning when I wasn&#x27;t able to take a shower because of early classes.  They are perfect for freshening up, you can carry a couple in a ziplock snack bag.  I still use them at home and keep them in the fridge to freshen up on hot humid days.</li>
            <li> Burn my eyes a little....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product. I tried  [[ASIN:B001KYQDEW Blum Naturals Dry and Sensitive Skin Daily Cleansing Towelettes with Chamomile, 30 Towelettes]] and [[ASIN:B005FVSH0O Yes To Cucumber Hypoallergenic Facial Towelettes, 30 Count (Pack of 2)]] and they did not work for me. This facial cleanser has just the right amount of moisture - not too dry but not too wet either. It removes my foundation and eye shadow and leaves my skin soft. I don&#x27;t have to put on a moisturizer after using it since it&#x27;s not drying, but my face doesn&#x27;t feel oily either, so I could add a moisturizer if I wanted to. This is basically unscented, so there&#x27;s no lingering smell after using it which is a huge plus. These seem to make my face a little red, maybe from increased circulation? But there&#x27;s no irritation. I would buy these again.  Update: I&#x27;ve been using these for several months and still happy with them so I&#x27;m upgrading my rating from four to five stars. As another reviewer mentions, these are also available at Target in the same aisle with the &amp;#34;Yes To...&amp;#34; Products. Whole Foods carries them too, but they are much more expensive.</li>
            <li> The price is a bit expensive but you get what you pay for. This stuff takes off all my makeup and gunk off my face at the end of the day but leaves my skin fresh, rejuvenated, and completely hydrated. I have super sensitive skin and was told by my dermatologist that I can&#x27;t wash my skin everyday, but this I can use on my face everyday without it feeling like it&#x27;s stripping my skin. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I always take off my make up with a cloth and I like these a lot.</li>
            <li> There OK,but wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> Finally I have found make up remover wipes without phenoxyethanol that agree with my sensitive skin! I love these facial wipes, although I recommend you look for them at target, they are much cheaper there.</li>
            <li> I just purchased these: Funny I don&#x27;t think they are that great. In fact when I use Neutrogena wipes, only 1 side is needed, with these I have to use both sides, and when I used a washcloth after cleaning with them, makeup came off my face on the cloth.</li>
            <li> no residue left over, it just feels clean!  update 5/26/15 : took these to Africa on Safari, and they were fantastic! They kept me clean when I wasn&#x27;t near a shower, and didn&#x27;t leave any weird alcohol smell, or dry skin! Still love these!!</li>
            <li> I use Acure&#x27;s face wash, which I love.  I was disappointed in these wipes.</li>
            <li> Fastest shipping I have ever received. Got to me in like less than 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I really like these wipes, they work really well for thoroughly removing make up. It dries out your skin a little so before bed I put on a moisturizer also by Acure. Their products work really well and i love how organic it all is. Would definitely recomment.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic!  Toxin free, great for sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling like a sticky residue has been left behind.  Removes even mascara easily and has no cloying scent.  We reuse the wipes in our household cleaning and they hold up well, and are biodegradable.</li>
            <li> I like these wipes a lot.  I keep them in my travel bag and they do not irritate my sensitive skin.  Knocked off one star because they are a little on the dry side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m upset. My skin is not sensitive but this stings! Not like sharp stings but more of a mild soft burning. No matter how good something cleans you, it shouldn&#x27;t sting. I now have a small idea of what my friend, who has extremely sensitive skin, has gone through. She would say things like &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t put just anything on my face, I&#x27;m not like you!&amp;#34; I get it now. I feel like calling her and apologizing lol. Anyway, this product is not completely unscented but the smell is really soft then it&#x27;ll fade. The towelettes themselves have a nice lather. Aside from the stinging, it cleans well better than Olay and Neutrogenia I&#x27;d say. I guess I could keep these in my gym bag for body purposes, but why would I for the price!?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of facial wipes and they are all so strong that they sting my face.  I have sensitive skin, and these are really and truly very gentle, but effective.  They take off eye makeup and daily dirt/makeup, and they&#x27;re very convenient. I plan to order a few more packs to stash in my gym bag and travel bag.</li>
            <li> These are great for removing makeup and wiping away germs, dirt, oil and grime on nights when I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my face. :)</li>
            <li> Soothing, not irritating, removes makeup/grime and leaves skin refreshed and not at all irritated.</li>
            <li> I love this towelettes.  I use it to clean my face and neck after my workout and it leaves my face feeling so clean. I am just wondering if I should be using this as my night time cleanser?</li>
            <li> Work well they are cheapert at a Target .</li>
            <li> I make sure I have these on hand all the time.  They are my favorite facial cleansing wipe.  They are gentle, remove makeup well, and are organic. I frequently don&#x27;t want to bother splashing and making everything a mess when I am trying to get to bed, so I use these almost every night. They don&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry, either.</li>
            <li> They are very small in size and thin as well. Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many brands of wipes and still keep trying new ones because I have not found any brand that I like enough. But after trying this one, I believe I have found the one! I use wipes every time I remove my make up so good wipes are really important to me. Worth the money and you feel great after each use!</li>
            <li> Good cleanser, organic which I like. But the smell is borderline intolerable</li>
            <li> I really love these wipes.  My face is oily and I used these during the day to keep it clean.  The keep it nice and clean without over drying.&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of my face after using it. Argon oil by itself breaks my face out, but this is non greasy and clean.</li>
            <li> These are about the same size as other towelettes on the market.  I think they&#x27;re also relatively thick for this type of product.  They&#x27;re quite soft, which is nice, especially since I have been using them to take off eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because they are oil-based, I am hesitant to use them all over my face (I&#x27;ve had bad luck with oil-based cleansers in the past).  However, I will say that they&#x27;re gentle and good at removing oil-based makeup.  I have used them on lipstick, eyeshadow (that&#x27;s over good primer), and mascara with success (not waterproof mascara, though).  They have not caused any irritation, even though I generally have sensitive eyes.  And they do a pretty complete job (in fairness, I am using a water-based natural mascara at the moment, which may be easier to remove than competing products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Olive Fruit Oil, Argan Oil, Sesame Seed Oil, Grape Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Potassium Sorbate (Food Grade Preservative), Citric Acid (Food Grade), Glyceryl Caprylate (From Glycerin + Coconut), Glyceryl Undecylenate (From Glycerin + Castor Bean Oil)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the ingredients are nice -- no parabens, dyes, artificial fragrance, sulfates, or animal-based ingredients.  It is difficult to find affordable products that meet all those criteria, and even more difficult to find products that meet those criteria and are actually gentle and effective.  I really have been happy with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: the container does have a plastic sticky flap as a closure.  This is not my favorite type of closure in terms of effectiveness (the packages can lose stickiness about halfway through, which leads to the towelettes drying out).  However, I think the oils are helping keep my towelettes moist.  And the paperboard part at the bottom helps keep the sticky flap in place (more effective than the package without the cardboard, based on my experience with similar products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I like these a lot and would definitely consider getting them again once I make a dent in my enormous stash of towelettes.hese a lot and would definitely consider getting them again once I make a dent in my enormous stash of towelettes.</li>
            <li> Love!  Love!  Love these cleansing wipes. Good size, moist enough without being drippy, do a good job removing make-up, and no sting or other discomfort if I get the liquid in my eyes. And I love that they are fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> Best face wipes I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have combo skin, and these leave it clean without over drying.  They also remove my eye make-up.</li>
            <li> Good product. Soft and unscented, as promised.</li>
            <li> I am wearing BB cream fairly often and have been experimenting with highlighting and contouring makeup techniques.  One or two towelettes gently removes the makeup and sunscreen.  I follow up with a facial cleanser for sensitive skin, either Acure Sensitive Facial Cleanser (a product that apparently contains probiotics) or John Masters Organics Rose Foaming Face Wash (a product I got for free from my housemate, who works in the Health and Beauty Department of a health store and receives free full-size samples all the time, many of which I greedily commandeer if he is in a generous mood).  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry or &amp;#34;overwashed&amp;#34; afterwards, and I will apply moisturizers and/or Argan facial oil afterwards.  If I didn&#x27;t wear any makeup, I can just use a towelette and skip the facial cleansers and moisturizers afterwards because the towelette is so hydrating.  I am admittedly very vain about my facial skin and have battled dermatitis.  This product does not irritate my facial skin, and my dermatitis is almost gone.  If you are tired and just want to go to bed, then this is a great product as you can cleanse your skin very conveniently in next to no time and do not necessarily need to apply moisturizers afterwards.</li>
            <li> Great product for oily, acne prone skin.  Seriously cleans pores and leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
