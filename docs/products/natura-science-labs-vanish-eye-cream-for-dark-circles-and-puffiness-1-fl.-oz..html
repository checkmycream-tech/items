            <li>What&#x27;s nice is that this cream is it isn&#x27;t limited to just your eyes, you can use it on your entire face if you like.</li>
            <li>I like this so much more than the previous eye cream I have been using.</li>
            <li>The main reason why is because it doesn&#x27;t have a sticky feel at all.</li>
            <li>just started using it, don&#x27;t see much change, I use it twice a day and it has been two weeks, I will update in a few more weeks if any changes occur.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Received</li>
            <li>Works just as well as the high priced products you buy at the mall.</li>
            <li>I have ordered other products from Natura Science Labs and have been pleased with all their products thus far.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you massage it into your skin for a little bit.</li>
            <li>The slue of my favorite ingredients makes it happen in one little bottle.</li>
            <li>It has a very faint smell of cucumber which I find very pleasant.</li>
            <li>I love the product began to see results in just a few days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for new eye creams, so I decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>She stated the scent of the cream was nice and clean and it was thick in consistency and not runny as other creams and serums tend to be.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and a little bit really goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Works but only fades my dark circles, does not get rid of them, however I have not found a product that has been any better than this one.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and has  a very silky texture unlike my previous one from a different company.</li>
            <li>This has clearly been tried and tested.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive eyes and</li>
            <li>It has no harsh orders, but has a cucumber smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve your looking for a natural eye cream</li>
            <li>My puffiness has not gone completely away</li>
            <li>This product may be used all over the face for a natural glow.</li>
            <li>I know i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Do not try this product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>vanishing eye cream feels so soft and luxurious on my eyes and soothes them on contact.</li>
            <li>I just massage it into the skin around my eyes and after using it day &amp; night for over a week, I am completely blown away with the results.</li>
            <li>I can watch it work in action.</li>
            <li>With a lot of the natural ingredients my sink doesn&#x27;t break out.</li>
            <li>The skin around the eyes are more delicate.</li>
            <li>As a Amazon product tester, I&#x27;ve tried many serums with a few of the ingredients but never in the same bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had fairly aggressive dark circles under my eyes, or at least it seems that way.</li>
            <li>This cream is easy to apply, just massage in for 2 minutes after washing your face each morning and evening, the rosehip, green tea and amica bring an instant glow and remove signs of fatigue.</li>
            <li>If you under eyes get dry, it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The mixture of natural elements help the skin regain moisture and strengthens the delicate eye area and can actually be used on pretty much anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li>I really like that it quickley soaks into my skin and doesnt leave my face wet.</li>
            <li>I feel that the cream will last for many applications as it only takes a small amount to apply twice daily.</li>
            <li>wow how different my eyes look.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have dark circles but puffiness is a problem for me.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this dark circle &amp; puffy eye vanishing cream, I have seen a very noticeable difference in the appearance of my eyes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dark circles but it clearly diminishes my puffy eyes and so far this is the only one that does.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for new eye creams, so I decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> She stated the scent of the cream was nice and clean and it was thick in consistency and not runny as other creams and serums tend to be.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and a little bit really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Works but only fades my dark circles, does not get rid of them, however I have not found a product that has been any better than this one.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth and has  a very silky texture unlike my previous one from a different company.</li>
            <li> This has clearly been tried and tested.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive eyes and</li>
            <li> It has no harsh orders, but has a cucumber smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve your looking for a natural eye cream</li>
            <li> My puffiness has not gone completely away</li>
            <li> This product may be used all over the face for a natural glow.</li>
            <li> I know i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Do not try this product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> vanishing eye cream feels so soft and luxurious on my eyes and soothes them on contact.</li>
            <li> I just massage it into the skin around my eyes and after using it day &amp; night for over a week, I am completely blown away with the results.</li>
            <li> I can watch it work in action.</li>
            <li> With a lot of the natural ingredients my sink doesn&#x27;t break out.</li>
            <li> The skin around the eyes are more delicate.</li>
            <li> As a Amazon product tester, I&#x27;ve tried many serums with a few of the ingredients but never in the same bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had fairly aggressive dark circles under my eyes, or at least it seems that way.</li>
            <li> This cream is easy to apply, just massage in for 2 minutes after washing your face each morning and evening, the rosehip, green tea and amica bring an instant glow and remove signs of fatigue.</li>
            <li> If you under eyes get dry, it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The mixture of natural elements help the skin regain moisture and strengthens the delicate eye area and can actually be used on pretty much anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li> I really like that it quickley soaks into my skin and doesnt leave my face wet.</li>
            <li> I feel that the cream will last for many applications as it only takes a small amount to apply twice daily.</li>
            <li> wow how different my eyes look.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have dark circles but puffiness is a problem for me.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this dark circle &amp; puffy eye vanishing cream, I have seen a very noticeable difference in the appearance of my eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dark circles but it clearly diminishes my puffy eyes and so far this is the only one that does.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t really tell the difference with my dark under eye circles, been using it almost a month and still dark circles</li>
            <li> Besides reducing the puffiness and dark circles this gel leaves my face feeling moisturized and hydrated, all day long and with the results I&#x27;ve seen so far</li>
            <li> I have several products from this company, and all work as expected.</li>
            <li> This product also helps sagging and dry skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li> but it is noticeable different as well as my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have tried several eye creams and while they have helped with the dark circles and puffiness, I have had to be so careful using them as the products have made my eyes water.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is the pump is a little difficult to use and squirts the product out at a weird angle, once I got used to that, it was ok.  </li>
            <li> Do be careful to keep it away from the eyelid.</li>
            <li> I had dark circles that looked like black eyes and with this They are starting to go away.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced major difference with it yet, but I have only been using it for about a week.</li>
            <li> Chemicals are so bad for us, this meets my requirement for a natural product that really works!  </li>
            <li> It has a very faint scent that smells green and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I looked in the mirror the other day and thought,</li>
            <li> it hasn&#x27;t done a thing for the puffiness or dark circles</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter who has dark circles under her eyes.</li>
            <li> I have continued to use this product and while it has not taken away totally my dark circles it has maintained a balance for my eyes.</li>
            <li> Hence it would indeed get rid of dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I had my mother try this cream since I thankfully don&#x27;t suffer from dark eye circles.</li>
            <li> My mother stated she&#x27;s going to continue to use the cream to ensure efficacy of the product, but for now she stated she feels she&#x27;s seen a difference in skin texture around the eyes and her dark circles have somewhat diminished.</li>
            <li> I received the item to review but will purchase again if there&#x27;s continued improvement with the texture, puffiness and dark circles with the skin around my mother&#x27;s eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There does seem to be a bit of a reduction in my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles and puffiness.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be helping the dark circles, but not the puffiness.</li>
            <li> I can see change on my dark circle</li>
            <li> A small amount of this crem goes a long wase.</li>
            <li> I have had dark circles under my eyes since childhood.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue using this product in hopes that the dark circles will continue to be less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I felt a slight stinging sensation.</li>
            <li> I have been using the &#x27;Vanish&#x27; dark circle and puffiness eye cream for a few days.</li>
            <li> I have very dark circles and just started using your eye cream</li>
            <li> It contains Aloe, Cucumber, Rosehip, Coconut Oil, Caffeine, Green Tea, Matrixyl 300&amp; Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li> A few minutes after i put it on</li>
            <li> Green tea and caffeine remove puffiness, aloe and cucumber  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, applying it in the morning and at night after washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of the scent.</li>
            <li> I should have taken a &amp;#34;before picture,&amp;#34; but didn&#x27;t think of it until too late.</li>
            <li> After approximately 2-3 weeks I noticed a difference, the darkness under my eyes had significantly decreased and the puffiness has been very minimal.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product faithfully for the past two weeks, two times a day, and have not seen any difference!</li>
            <li> It works as well as other expensive eye cream</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this eye cream since I have terrible allergies and my eyes are always puffy and look like I haven&#x27;t slept in days.</li>
            <li> but it has it&#x27;s drawbacks, tired puffy eyes and</li>
            <li> When I wake up and after my shower, I got to have something for my eyes because they look and feel so extremely tired.</li>
            <li> This helps with my puffy and tired look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not happy about the microscopic print.</li>
            <li> im always getting comments that i look so tired.</li>
            <li> My eyes are not as puffy and tired looking.</li>
            <li> It took me all of two weeks to see dramatic changes in my eyes so now I use it on my neck as well.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about Vanish, but I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Disappointment.</li>
            <li> but that was crazy .</li>
            <li> It was horrible .</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Clean light feeling when applied</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a natural bunny safe organic product this is for you. It really works! It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and is great to use if you have sensitive skin like I do. I just followed the easy to use directions and was so happy to see it didn&#x27;t leave my skin red or blotchy like some other products I&#x27;ve tried. Highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Received this item for testing and review purposes! &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have dark circle almost daily so to receive this complimentary and be able to try it was great In return leaving my unbiased opinion on this product I have not noticed anything yet because its only been a couple of days but I can say it doesn&#x27;t sting on contact it has a light smell doesn&#x27;t cause irritation and as soon as I see something I will update</li>
            <li> I have very dark circles and just started using your eye cream so I will keep you posted. I do have sensitive eyes and your eye cream feels and smells wonderful so far!</li>
            <li> I use this product in the evening because I tend to wake up with puffy eyes. It really makes a huge difference using it at night, I wake up with more refreshed looking eyes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference yet!!!</li>
            <li> Disappointment. I have used this product faithfully it hasn&#x27;t done a thing for the puffiness or dark circles&lt;br /&gt;under my eyes. Tea bags work better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for new eye creams, so I decided to give this one a try. It contains Aloe, Cucumber, Rosehip, Coconut Oil, Caffeine, Green Tea, Matrixyl 300&amp; Hyaluronic Acid. It comes in a 1 oz bottle, and has a light creamy texture at first, but once you begin to put it under your eye becomes clear. It has no harsh orders, but has a cucumber smell. It&#x27;s very light under the eyes, and is not greasy. If you under eyes get dry, it is very moisturizing. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple days and already notice the puffiness diminish. I&#x27;ve your looking for a natural eye cream I would give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I receive this product for free for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ALSO GOOD STUFF! I have several products from this company, and all work as expected. I have very puffy eyes and large bags as well. I have recently started using this and have already seen a difference. My puffiness has not gone completely away but it is noticeable different as well as my dark circles. I will continue using and purchase more once this is out. I received this for an unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> To soon to see any difference.  I keep it in the fridge to Give it that additional cooling effect!  Nice scent and absorbs quickly.  My Husband and I both are uSing it.  I&#x27;ll keep you updated!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter who has dark circles under her eyes. I think it is heretatary. This product is also good for puffiness under your eyes. I think I will use it also. This product also helps sagging and dry skin around the eyes. This product may be used all over the face for a natural glow. I look forward to seeing our results. I bought this product at a free or discounted price and this is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I tried this product threw karmas reviews. I love trying all these different products to see which one works best. A few minutes after i put it on i had to rinse it off my face because it felt like it was on fire. My face was red . after i washed it two times it was still red with patches . I know i have sensitive skin but that was crazy . It said for all skin types. Do not try this product if you have sensitive skin. It was horrible .</li>
            <li> Recieved my package under 2 weeks, was pretty fast. The product smells nice, isn&#x27;t oily but I can&#x27;t really tell the difference with my dark under eye circles, been using it almost a month and still dark circles, I&#x27;ll give it longer to see if there&#x27;s a difference eventually</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Nothing works except eye bag removal surgery.</li>
            <li> . I received the product to test and review. I don&#x27;t really have dark circles but puffiness is a problem for me. I have been using the &#x27;Vanish&#x27; dark circle and puffiness eye cream for a few days. I have noticed that my eyes look awake. The puffiness is minimal and the cream feels good. Make sure that you massage it into your skin for a little bit. I massage it into my eyes for 2 minutes. It feels good and is relaxing. I am not a huge fan of the scent. It is not awful but it in my opinion is not wonderful. The scent is not something that sticks around either.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream! I saw results within a short time! Cream has a nice texture, blends in smooth (only need a small amount) and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product faithfully for the past two weeks, two times a day, and have not seen any difference! I was really hoping this would help me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of night owl, I love staying up late because I get more work done once the rest of the family is in bed but it has it&#x27;s drawbacks, tired puffy eyes and under eye circles are at the top of the list. I&#x27;ve been using Natura Science Labs Best Dark Circles &amp; Puffiness Eye Cream for going on a week now and the results have been amazing. The mixture of natural elements help the skin regain moisture and strengthens the delicate eye area and can actually be used on pretty much anywhere on your body. This cream is easy to apply, just massage in for 2 minutes after washing your face each morning and evening, the rosehip, green tea and amica bring an instant glow and remove signs of fatigue. Besides reducing the puffiness and dark circles this gel leaves my face feeling moisturized and hydrated, all day long and with the results I&#x27;ve seen so far I can&#x27;t wait to see even more positive changes as I continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price or the item was supplied to me at no cost in order to evaluate and share my experience.  All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.  One may or may not have the same results as myself when using this product.</li>
            <li> I m still using it .there&#x27;s some progress there . This is a good product to use .thanks.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Good product</li>
            <li> Love the product.  It works as well as other expensive eye cream and it feels great when it goes on the skin.  Very happy</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product and a great value for organic ingredients. It works much better than expensive skincare brand offerings. Highly recommended! And it arrived very quickly too.</li>
            <li> I read the review before I tried this product.  I have tried several eye creams and while they have helped with the dark circles and puffiness, I have had to be so careful using them as the products have made my eyes water.  I was skeptical about Vanish, but I thought I would give it a try.  The first thing I noticed is the pump is a little difficult to use and squirts the product out at a weird angle, once I got used to that, it was ok.  After approximately 2-3 weeks I noticed a difference, the darkness under my eyes had significantly decreased and the puffiness has been very minimal.  I have continued to use this product and while it has not taken away totally my dark circles it has maintained a balance for my eyes.</li>
            <li> I received this this at a promotional price in commitment to post an honest product review. I like this so much more than the previous eye cream I have been using. The main reason why is because it doesn&#x27;t have a sticky feel at all. It goes on so smooth and has  a very silky texture unlike my previous one from a different company. When I wake up and after my shower, I got to have something for my eyes because they look and feel so extremely tired. This helps with my puffy and tired look and I just love how it feels.I have ordered other products from Natura Science Labs and have been pleased with all their products thus far. I love that it is natural and ALL their  ingredients are recognizable to me. This is another great  product.</li>
            <li> I am a product tester and was offered a complimentary bottle of TruOrganics VANISH eye cream in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I was so excited to try this eye cream since I have terrible allergies and my eyes are always puffy and look like I haven&#x27;t slept in days. Since I&#x27;ve been using this dark circle &amp; puffy eye vanishing cream, I have seen a very noticeable difference in the appearance of my eyes. I have posted before and after pictures for you to really see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This vanishing eye cream feels so soft and luxurious on my eyes and soothes them on contact. I just massage it into the skin around my eyes and after using it day &amp; night for over a week, I am completely blown away with the results. Plus I have sensitive skin and this cream works great, absolutely no side affects!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a very nice pump dispenser which we all know saves money since there is no waste. There is also no contamination from sticking your finger in a jar of cream. It has a very faint smell of cucumber which I find very pleasant. It does, in fact, contain cucumber, which women have been using for decades to get rid of puffy eyes. It also contains the healing &amp; moisturizing properties of Aloe, Rosehip oil, Coconut oil and Vitamin C. What&#x27;s nice is that this cream is it isn&#x27;t limited to just your eyes, you can use it on your entire face if you like. The Green Tea, Matixyl 3000 &amp; Hyalouric acid make it a wonderful face cream since it restores your skin&#x27;s natural radiance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am completely happy with this wonderful multi-purpose vanishing cream and would strongly recommend it for anyone, but particularly allergy sufferers since it helps with the itchy, puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> I applied this cream around my eyes and basically under my eyes to see how it looked and let me tell you I&#x27;m in love now cause my bags are fading and smaller gotta love that especially when I was approached to try this product for free , free isn&#x27;t always good but this is amazing.</li>
            <li> Love this cream! The ingredients in this cream are excellent, if you take the time to read them, it makes complete sense why it would work.  Arnica is used to remove bruising.  Hence it would indeed get rid of dark circles.  Green tea and caffeine remove puffiness, aloe and cucumber  are soothing, coconut oil is one of your best moisturizers that is not greasy but quickly absorbed.  The cream is very smooth and silky, it glides on nicely.  It has a very faint scent that smells green and refreshing.  When you put it on, you instantly feel the skin under the eyes firming up.  I like that a lot and I think organic products are so important.  Chemicals are so bad for us, this meets my requirement for a natural product that really works!  Even my husband wants to use it!  Will definitely buy in the future.&lt;br /&gt; Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review. I was not required or compelled to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with FTC 16 CFR, Part 255.</li>
            <li> I had my mother try this cream since I thankfully don&#x27;t suffer from dark eye circles. She stated the scent of the cream was nice and clean and it was thick in consistency and not runny as other creams and serums tend to be. My mother stated she&#x27;s going to continue to use the cream to ensure efficacy of the product, but for now she stated she feels she&#x27;s seen a difference in skin texture around the eyes and her dark circles have somewhat diminished. I received the item to review but will purchase again if there&#x27;s continued improvement with the texture, puffiness and dark circles with the skin around my mother&#x27;s eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with this product and noticed a difference right away. I like the way it feels on my skin, not too greasy so it can be worn during the day. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Best product I have found to treat my dark circles. I would recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> just started using it, don&#x27;t see much change, I use it twice a day and it has been two weeks, I will update in a few more weeks if any changes occur.</li>
            <li> I love the product began to see results in just a few days. Very easy to use and a little bit really goes a long way. Works just as well as the high priced products you buy at the mall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had fairly aggressive dark circles under my eyes, or at least it seems that way. The fact that I&#x27;m a college student working peculiar hours probably doesn&#x27;t help them; the same goes for my desk job staring at a computer all day. I decided to try this product after reading some of the reviews. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, applying it in the morning and at night after washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There does seem to be a bit of a reduction in my dark circles. I should have taken a &amp;#34;before picture,&amp;#34; but didn&#x27;t think of it until too late. I&#x27;m going to continue using this product in hopes that the dark circles will continue to be less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I own nearly all TruOrganik products. This is by far my favorite. I&#x27;m still not happy about the microscopic print. After all, most people who will use their products are aging and our eyes don&#x27;t work like 20 year olds. This product does allow me to push that thought to the curb. Whatever it says; I don&#x27;t need to read it. I can watch it work in action. I don&#x27;t have dark circles but it clearly diminishes my puffy eyes and so far this is the only one that does. The slue of my favorite ingredients makes it happen in one little bottle. As a Amazon product tester, I&#x27;ve tried many serums with a few of the ingredients but never in the same bottle. This has clearly been tried and tested. For me, it works the best. I received a sample to try and test as a consumer for review purposes. This one I honestly LOVE above all others. It took me all of two weeks to see dramatic changes in my eyes so now I use it on my neck as well. I highly recommend this product if you want to see real changes. The name is appropriately titled. It is a vanishing cream.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a short time.  I have dark circles and puffiness.  It seems to be helping the dark circles, but not the puffiness.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best smelling eye creams I have ever gotten. It almost has a melon scent to it. I have not experienced major difference with it yet, but I have only been using it for about a week. Once I finish the bottle, I&#x27;ll try to remember to update my review. What I do notice is my skin feeling softer. Another notion is that it does not cause any sensitivity to the area. First, I tried it on a small part of my wrist to see if any allergy was present.</li>
            <li> Works but only fades my dark circles, does not get rid of them, however I have not found a product that has been any better than this one.</li>
            <li> I can see change on my dark circle</li>
            <li> Been using the vanishing cream and I love the tingling feeling I get when I put it on. I  swear I can smell the cucumber. I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients gives me some peace of mind to know I&#x27;m not using anything that will harm my skin. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this cream out im always getting comments that i look so tired. I applied this cream to my eyes before bed for the last 2 nights and ive already started to notice a change. My eyes are not as puffy and tired looking. I even got complements of looking like i finally got some rest. A small amount of this crem goes a long wase. I really like that it quickley soaks into my skin and doesnt leave my face wet. I also use this on my whole face not just my eyes. The cream leaves my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized. I look forward to continuing use of this product and seeing the results. I would recomend this to others wanting to improve there overall skin health and reduse the tiredness look in there eyes. I recived this product in exchange of my honest opinion and review.</li>
            <li> I am just beginning to use this product as I received it yesterday. I like the fact that it is organic. I have had dark circles under my eyes since childhood. There are times that allergies or eyestrain causes puffiness under my eyes also. With the first day of use I noticed that the cream has a consistency of whipped coconut oil (which is in the mixture of ingredients). I feel that the cream will last for many applications as it only takes a small amount to apply twice daily. The cream has a light green tint and is very creamy and easy to spread. Do be careful to keep it away from the eyelid. You do not want to get it in your eye! As the cream started to work I felt a slight stinging sensation. I am prone to irritations to scented products when used on my face. I didn&#x27;t detect a scent with the Natura Science Labs Vanish cream. My skin stayed as normal with no irritations or reaction which is a relief! I am pleased and plan to continue using it to see how it helps the skin under my eyes. Disclaimer: I got this product for free in return for my own unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> This really works. I had dark circles that looked like black eyes and with this They are starting to go away. I looked in the mirror the other day and thought, wow how different my eyes look. It hydrates the eyes and helps the puffiness go away.With a lot of the natural ingredients my sink doesn&#x27;t break out. For best results use before bed and pat around your eyes. not to massage. The skin around the eyes are more delicate.The pump is nice so that so I get just what I need out. I DID RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
