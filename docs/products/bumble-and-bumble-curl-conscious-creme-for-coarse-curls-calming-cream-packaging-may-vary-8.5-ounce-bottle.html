            <li>works the best for me.  </li>
            <li>This is the best creme for curly hair in the winter.  </li>
            <li>It smells great</li>
            <li>this cream has been a happy medium for me.  </li>
            <li>Why ruin a good thing?</li>

            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>She said that she has gotten so many compliments on her hair since using this cream, and she is now a believer and said she wouldn&#x27;t wear her hair without it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s okay!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a bonus that the scent is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>put a bunch of it in your hand, message and curl it into your hair and kind of &amp;#34;scrunch&amp;#34; it in.  </li>
            <li>My friend thinks it&#x27;s great and will want more I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>The product was fine, but nothing super impressive.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve tried every drugstore styling product and most of the popular salon products for curly hair and nothing gave me managable hair.</li>
            <li>I love my hairdresser</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I mentioned this in another review regarding hair products</li>
            <li>hairdresser is awesome cause she specifically finds products that will actually benefit me and not just sell them to me for the sake of selling them.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>This is a must have for curly hair....works better than anything I have ever tried at enhancing curls and controlling frizz.</li>
            <li>It works like most others.</li>
            <li>I do think it has a bit more greasy feel to it than when you use mousse for example.</li>
            <li>I guess that tends to make your hair a bit more crunchy.</li>
            <li>It works well too, but this one seems to work better for me.</li>
            <li>With this product, my curls are more defined and stay that way longer without frizz.</li>
            <li>I use the calming cream if I want my hair wavy, and the defining cream if I want it more curly.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I wish I cld find a better product for that.</li>
            <li>This product works ok...</li>
            <li>I even get complimented on my hair for the first first time in my life now. :D</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried the one for fine hair because I feared this one would have more \\&quot;crunch\\&quot; to it.  </li>
            <li>It is weightless and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It does not leave my hair crunchy or sticky, just very soft with good wave.</li>
            <li>It works best if you have a little time to diffuse your hair with a blow dryer!</li>
            <li>Most days, I don&#x27;t have time for that, so I just put some of this creme in my hair while it&#x27;s towel-dry, let it air dry, and I am good to go.</li>
            <li>For those of you who have super curly hair and don&#x27;t feel like having to always deal with it, this is one solution.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this based on reviews and while it is a good product it doesn&#x27;t work that well on really long hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to control my frizzes without weighing my hair down.  </li>
            <li>This product gives your hair great volume without looking greasy.(Be careful not to use too much!)</li>
            <li>I bought this product hoping it would make my wavy hair more curly, I should have bought the cream for fine curls, not the cream for coarse curls.  </li>
            <li>and I can proudly wear my hair down for a change!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the $.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best hair creme you can use for curly and thick hair.</li>
            <li>Garnier makes a $4 drugstore product that is exactly like this.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it does that well at controlling frizz, but definitely does do an okay job.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s about the same as most others though.</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing Bumble and Bumble</li>
            <li>I apply the product on wet hair and let it dry naturally and the end result is perfect!</li>
            <li>This is the only stuff that makes my thick curly hair into awesome ringlets.</li>
            <li>It kind of weighs your hair down.</li>
            <li>I trusted it so much, after I applied it</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>This I really can&#x27;t speak on as I didn&#x27;t purchase for myself.</li>
            <li>(the curls are less tight), it makes her hair look healthy and non-frizzy, it looks amazing.  </li>
            <li>Not surprisingly, when I use curl conscious many people will compliment the curls and the depth it adds to my hair :)</li>
            <li>As long as you do put in a lot and make sure your hair gets even amounts (even the ends), then your hair will be that cool &amp;#34;wet curl from the shower&amp;#34; but dry just like that.  </li>
            <li>The new formula is gooey and frizzes my curls!</li>
            <li>This product is decent.</li>
            <li>Now that there are decent hair products out there</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I have super coarse, thick hair and this product works amazingly.</li>
            <li>I thought it meant the product would be good for my very thick hair.  </li>
            <li>The texture is more like a gel and as opposed to coming out of the bottle like a creme, oozes into your hand and feels slimy in your hands on and on your hair.</li>
            <li>I wanted to be able to wear my hair down in it&#x27;s natural curl and now I can since I started to use this product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product hoping it would live up to its hype.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this after reading about it in the New York Times; it was recommended over everything else for controlling frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize it at the time but the bottle was not sealed nor did it look to be a new bottle.</li>
            <li>Since it didn&#x27;t work well for making my hair more curly I gave it to my sister who has coarse, tight, frizzy curls.  </li>
            <li>It does leave your hair soft (almost too soft)and takes care of the frizzes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experimented with dozens of products and Curl Conscious</li>
            <li>a consumer near Philadelphia</li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair which needs a strong hold</li>
            <li>It is the only curl product I have found that makes my curls defined, yet touchably soft.  </li>
            <li>I wish it would combat frizz a little more, but my hair is less frizzy when I use it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even want to think about how much I&#x27;ve spent on different products and I have finally found the right one.</li>
            <li>It made my hair extra curly with such a soft feel.</li>
            <li>I have notoriously straw-like hair, and this is the only product I&#x27;ve tried that gives me soft, loose curls with some hold.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly, and in order to wear it straight, it takes at least an hour of drying and straightening.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, and it is pretty expensive, but it is a superior product to any of the drugstore cremes and gels I have used over the years.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and this tames the curls into pretty ringlets.</li>
            <li> so maybe my hair is just more difficult than other women with curly hair.</li>
            <li> And who wants their hair all sticky and hard?</li>
            <li> The moment I got it in the mail I rushed to the shower to rinse all the other numerous products out of my hair.</li>
            <li> My bathroom counter is suddenly quite empty!</li>
            <li> I grew up in the 70&#x27;s when all the other white chicks had Farrah Fawcett hair</li>
            <li> I applied it and waited for my hair to dry-</li>
            <li> I literally cannot believe this product has dried in my hair and left it feeling supple instead of fried and crunchy.    </li>
            <li> I am currently siting in lecture stroking my unbelievably soft-and dry- hair and admiring my springy, structured curls in the reflection from my laptop monitor.</li>
            <li> It does not define the curls, which the other product did.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair that curls at random.</li>
            <li> Be warned that if you have thick curls and/or coarse hair, this is NOT the product for you.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, wavy hair that is color treated.</li>
            <li> Every curl product i&#x27;ve ever used has either failed utterly or transformed my hair into a crunchy, stiff mess that looks wet-and immobile- for the entire day.     </li>
            <li> every curly-haired person knows that the moment of truth comes when your hair has finally dried.</li>
            <li> A bottle lasts me about 5 months--1 tablespoon per application, 2-3 times a week (I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, too drying).</li>
            <li> I have wavy-curly hair that tends to either frizz or go limp depending on the product...</li>
            <li> Makes my limp curls, curlier.</li>
            <li> I have struggled over the years to tame my frizzy, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly, frizy, long hair</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll just repeat myself since I&#x27;m too lazy to check out which one</li>
            <li> I used a diffuser and I.was not satisfied with the creme one bit...</li>
            <li> so not sure if she&#x27;s tried it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking forward to trying the correct type of Bumble &amp; bumble creme to tame my thick, curly hair.    </li>
            <li> I assumed at this price I would at least receive a sealed unopened bottle!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick</li>
            <li> I was confused by the description.  </li>
            <li> should this cucumber-scented cream fail me (like, bobby pins- or a hat).     </li>
            <li> It is not a pleasant experience and I am really disappointed that they ruined it!</li>

            <li> I love my hairdresser and I take her recommendations.  I&#x27;m sure I mentioned this in another review regarding hair products but I&#x27;ll just repeat myself since I&#x27;m too lazy to check out which one I did a review on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser is awesome cause she specifically finds products that will actually benefit me and not just sell them to me for the sake of selling them.  She tried this in my hair to show how it would work and I love it.  For those of you who have super curly hair and don&#x27;t feel like having to always deal with it, this is one solution.  put a bunch of it in your hand, message and curl it into your hair and kind of &amp;#34;scrunch&amp;#34; it in.  As long as you do put in a lot and make sure your hair gets even amounts (even the ends), then your hair will be that cool &amp;#34;wet curl from the shower&amp;#34; but dry just like that.  It smells great, it feels great, I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  A curly girl cannot be without it!</li>
            <li> This is a must have for curly hair....works better than anything I have ever tried at enhancing curls and controlling frizz.</li>
            <li> After using this product for years, B&amp;B recently changed formula along with packaging. Why ruin a good thing? The new formula is gooey and frizzes my curls! It does not define the curls, which the other product did. Garnier makes a $4 drugstore product that is exactly like this. Be warned that if you have thick curls and/or coarse hair, this is NOT the product for you. It does not \\&quot;calm\\&quot; and is definitely no longer a \\&quot;creme\\&quot;, so the packaging is misleading. The texture is more like a gel and as opposed to coming out of the bottle like a creme, oozes into your hand and feels slimy in your hands on and on your hair. It is not a pleasant experience and I am really disappointed that they ruined it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping it would make my wavy hair more curly, I should have bought the cream for fine curls, not the cream for coarse curls.  Since it didn&#x27;t work well for making my hair more curly I gave it to my sister who has coarse, tight, frizzy curls.  She absolutely loves it! It makes her hair look fuller (the curls are less tight), it makes her hair look healthy and non-frizzy, it looks amazing.  She said that she has gotten so many compliments on her hair since using this cream, and she is now a believer and said she wouldn&#x27;t wear her hair without it!</li>
            <li> This product is decent. It works like most others. I don&#x27;t think it does that well at controlling frizz, but definitely does do an okay job. I do think it has a bit more greasy feel to it than when you use mousse for example. I guess that tends to make your hair a bit more crunchy. This is softer, but definitely has a bit of grease to it. The product was fine, but nothing super impressive.</li>
            <li> Every curl product i&#x27;ve ever used has either failed utterly or transformed my hair into a crunchy, stiff mess that looks wet-and immobile- for the entire day.     I bought this product hoping it would live up to its hype. The moment I got it in the mail I rushed to the shower to rinse all the other numerous products out of my hair. I applied it and waited for my hair to dry- every curly-haired person knows that the moment of truth comes when your hair has finally dried. I trusted it so much, after I applied it I went to class immediately without even bringing a backup&#x3D;plan, should this cucumber-scented cream fail me (like, bobby pins- or a hat).     I am currently siting in lecture stroking my unbelievably soft-and dry- hair and admiring my springy, structured curls in the reflection from my laptop monitor. I literally cannot believe this product has dried in my hair and left it feeling supple instead of fried and crunchy.    Bumble and Bumble, I am your fan!</li>
            <li> I have notoriously straw-like hair, and this is the only product I&#x27;ve tried that gives me soft, loose curls with some hold.  I&#x27;ve also tried the one for fine hair because I feared this one would have more \\&quot;crunch\\&quot; to it.  It works well too, but this one seems to work better for me.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this after reading about it in the New York Times; it was recommended over everything else for controlling frizzy hair. It&#x27;s not perfect, and it is pretty expensive, but it is a superior product to any of the drugstore cremes and gels I have used over the years. I have thick, coarse, wavy hair that is color treated. It does not leave my hair crunchy or sticky, just very soft with good wave. It doesn&#x27;t last for days and days, but it does last longer than anything else except the stickiest mousse or gel. And who wants their hair all sticky and hard? Yuck. A bottle lasts me about 5 months--1 tablespoon per application, 2-3 times a week (I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, too drying). It&#x27;s very thick so you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best hair creme you can use for curly and thick hair. i recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> This I really can&#x27;t speak on as I didn&#x27;t purchase for myself. My friend thinks it&#x27;s great and will want more I&#x27;m sure. She loves it so hurray B &amp; B..</li>
            <li> I have struggled over the years to tame my frizzy, curly hair. I don&#x27;t even want to think about how much I&#x27;ve spent on different products and I have finally found the right one. It is weightless and easy to use. I have gotten a handful of comments since I started using this a couple of weeks ago and I can proudly wear my hair down for a change! I definitely recommend this to anyone who wishes their frizzy hair could form bouncy ringlets for a change. Smells good too! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have graying hair..this product helps the shine..helps the curl all without feeling like I have product in my hair!!!! Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair that curls at random. With this product, my curls are more defined and stay that way longer without frizz. I apply the product on wet hair and let it dry naturally and the end result is perfect! i&#x27;ve been searching for years for one product that does this, and I&#x27;ve finally found it. My bathroom counter is suddenly quite empty!</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that makes my thick curly hair into awesome ringlets.</li>
            <li> This product gives your hair great volume without looking greasy.(Be careful not to use too much!) It works best if you have a little time to diffuse your hair with a blow dryer! Not surprisingly, when I use curl conscious many people will compliment the curls and the depth it adds to my hair :)I wish it would combat frizz a little more, but my hair is less frizzy when I use it. I guess the next thing I&#x27;ll try is the Bumble and Bumble Frizz Fighter!</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on reviews and while it is a good product it doesn&#x27;t work that well on really long hair. It does leave your hair soft (almost too soft)and takes care of the frizzes but, there isn&#x27;t enough hold. It kind of weighs your hair down.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to control my frizzes without weighing my hair down.  I have wavy-curly hair that tends to either frizz or go limp depending on the product... this cream has been a happy medium for me.  I combine it with a bit of serum and scrunch, and presto!  Well controlled waves, even in 90% humidity.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair which needs a strong hold but I don&#x27;t want my hair to look plastic.  I&#x27;ve experimented with dozens of products and Curl Conscious works the best for me.  I use it with a bit of Bumble &amp; Bumble DeFrizz applied to the outer curly ends afterwards (applied by coating my palms with it and crunching the curls) and my hair stays curly without frizz even in humid conditions.</li>
            <li> I was confused by the description.  I thought it meant the product would be good for my very thick hair.  When the bottle arrived and I read the back, I realized the product was supposed to make your hair thicker.  I&#x27;m still looking forward to trying the correct type of Bumble &amp; bumble creme to tame my thick, curly hair.    a consumer near Philadelphia</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and was worried that they stopped making it as I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore.  I have thick curly hair and this tames the curls into pretty ringlets.</li>
            <li> I grew up in the 70&#x27;s when all the other white chicks had Farrah Fawcett hair and I had an afro.  Now that there are decent hair products out there I can wear my fro with pride.  Bumble and Bumble Curl Creme and the Hair Tonic are the hair products I would take with me to a deserted island.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, and in order to wear it straight, it takes at least an hour of drying and straightening. Most days, I don&#x27;t have time for that, so I just put some of this creme in my hair while it&#x27;s towel-dry, let it air dry, and I am good to go. It leaves my hair curly but not crunchy and it controls the frizz that otherwise would occur. I love it!</li>
            <li> I will only use this product on my hair.  It is the only curl product I have found that makes my curls defined, yet touchably soft.  It&#x27;s just a bonus that the scent is AMAZING.  I use the calming cream if I want my hair wavy, and the defining cream if I want it more curly.  I HIGHLY recommend this product.  It&#x27;s worth the $.</li>
            <li> The curling creme made my hair frizzy and I didn&#x27;t have any shape of curls.  I used a diffuser and I.was not satisfied with the creme one bit...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Makes my limp curls, curlier. I have super coarse, thick hair and this product works amazingly. One downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t help with the frizzys. I wish I cld find a better product for that.</li>
            <li> This product works ok...it&#x27;s about the same as most others though. I have yet to find any products for curly hair that I have been ecstatic about...so maybe my hair is just more difficult than other women with curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly, frizy, long hair and I was about to give up and chop it off before this product. I think I&#x27;ve tried every drugstore styling product and most of the popular salon products for curly hair and nothing gave me managable hair. I wanted to be able to wear my hair down in it&#x27;s natural curl and now I can since I started to use this product.  I even get complimented on my hair for the first first time in my life now. :D</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing Bumble and Bumble and I love it.  It made my hair extra curly with such a soft feel. I will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a stocking stuffer for me 20something daughter. Didn&#x27;t realize it at the time but the bottle was not sealed nor did it look to be a new bottle. She hasn&#x27;t said anything to me about it yet so not sure if she&#x27;s tried it..I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s okay! I assumed at this price I would at least receive a sealed unopened bottle! Bummer!!! Won&#x27;t buy from this seller again</li>
            <li> This is the best creme for curly hair in the winter.  If you live in a humid climate, it won&#x27;t hold the frizz down.  I don&#x27;t use it in the summer months.</li>
