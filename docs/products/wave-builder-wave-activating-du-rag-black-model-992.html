    <ol>
            <li> I really did&#x27;nt need it pyt helps to have more than one so the cap is need to activate the waves its a good way matain them</li>
            <li> It reeks of cologne and as others have said, it&#x27;s a durag.  Plus, if you really want this mess on your head, get it at Wal-mart it&#x27;s about a 1/4th of the price.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly. No issues</li>
            <li> Its a but bulky but very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.</li>
            <li> Came Fast, and Looks like what I expected!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s keep this honest: It&#x27;s a Du-Rag. Unfortunately, this is a Du-Rag sprayed with copious amounts of cologne. If I wanted my hair to smell like cologne, I&#x27;d have sprayed it with... guess what? Cologne. Again, it&#x27;s a Du-Rag. However, if you want your head to smell like a Scottish Man&#x27;s musk, then order the Wave Builder Wave Activating Du-Rag (stupidly, long ridiculous name).</li>
            <li> I would definately purchase this twice. The quality is still good, and it&#x27;s been a few months since I&#x27;ve bought this item. I use this Du-Rag everyday, and it&#x27;s still going strong. The fact that you can adjust the tightness of it makes it ideal for me.</li>
            <li> Dont be fool its a durag lol it does its job</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the material it was made out of.</li>
            <li> Fits Works Perfect. I wear this item every night before I lay down to go to sleep . Thank you.</li>
            <li> Havent noticed a dramatic difference in my connections using the wave builder wave activating du-rag in black.  Typical with all tie typed du rags this one does cause headaches.  Have switched over to the TsuRag, with its design haven&#x27;t had a single headache.</li>
            <li> Only ones my husband will buy. Good price too!</li>
            <li> Nice, loose wave cap. Not too tight around your head like other wave caps. Keeps and locks in moisture in your hair as well. Also arrived on time. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Nice durag seems like its build very well</li>
            <li> I Used to Wear a Du-rag about a few years ago, and Getting back into wearing one, and Reallying Focusing on my hair, Its like a New year for me. So yes  I do recommend this Du-rag if your a fellow man that wants some Smoove Waves!</li>
            <li> I found these in the states at Walgreens and never used another brand since. By far the best du-rag out there. I would recommend it to anyone that uses du-rags. I have had one of these for over three years believe it or not. I definitely with make another purchase in the near future!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. My waves weren&#x27;t as &amp;#34;popping&amp;#34; as i thought they&#x27;d be, but they were alright.</li>
            <li> Generic durag don&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect. I never bought a du rag before and this is exactly what I wanted. It fits great, and I bought two more.</li>
