            <li> Some packets are better than others.</li>
            <li> I ordered these lotions just because when tanning you always need to switch it up a little bit. I was so happy with the lotions I got! A lot of them are expensive and just thinking I paid only $10! I got 10 of them and each one of these are worth $7+. Well worth the buy and I will do it again!</li>
            <li> A very nice selection. A lot of them had parabens and glycol. I personally try to avoid these ingredients.</li>
            <li> Revived these quickly! I was hoping for more of a variety of brands, 8 out of the 10 were from supre tan. So far I like them though.</li>
            <li> These were really great. Found some that I enjoyed the best of the rest I&#x27;ve tried and I went ahead and purchased the full size bottles. Each one was good and provided a great tan. I like to be e tts dark and brown, not orange. I enjoyed these because they developed intensely dark brown. I found a few that work so well, its less trips to the salon, because they last so long.</li>
            <li> Awesome assortment of tanning lotion. I loved each and every one!</li>
            <li> Good stuff GREAT price Fast Delivery</li>
            <li> Really like the sample pack.</li>
            <li> Received 10 different packets of lotion, all were brand name. Great purchase, I love trying different lotions &amp; this is a great way to do just that.</li>
            <li> good variety came quickly</li>
            <li> I like the samples. I recently started tanning again. As soon as you walk through the door the employees sell you what seems like the most expensive lotion they have lol.... But seriously! I like the samples vs. the bigger bottles bc I find I tan faster and longer and of course can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I ordered two sets of these, and the second set should have been top brands like Australian Gold, Swedish Beauty, etc but they were all Supre, which is fine.  However, I ordered two DIFFERENT sets of these samples and got two identical sets.  I did like the product though.</li>
            <li> I got all 10 samples, in good condition.  I have only used one sample so far, so I am satisfied thus far...</li>
            <li> They all smell like nothing and dried out my skin. I got all brands I&#x27;ve never heard of. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> All expired but maybe they&#x27;ll still work</li>
            <li> Not very good  compared  to ssllys  beauty  packs</li>
            <li> great product, all ten will work well got everything from Australian gold to Ed hardy, definitely a great deal!</li>

            <li> When I received these packets I noticed that they were samples of non brand names. I used 1 of the packets and it burned my skin and made me all red. I have never had this happen before. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying these.</li>
            <li> loved the assortment of lotions.</li>
            <li> Loved this assortment!</li>

            <li> I ordered this package and here is what i received:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro Tan - Summer Lovin&#x27; (tingle)&lt;br /&gt;S.H.O 6000 GOLD Super High Output (tingle)&lt;br /&gt;Swedish Beauty - Dangerously Dark (bronzer)&lt;br /&gt;Australian Gold - Gold &amp; Bronze Dual Bronzer with Hemp (bronzer)&lt;br /&gt;California Tan - Shiver (cooling bronzer)&lt;br /&gt;ZEDA - Psychic (bronzer)&lt;br /&gt;Supre - Coco Beach (bronzer)&lt;br /&gt;Fiesta Sun - Bikini Tini&lt;br /&gt;Rio Tanning - Rum Jungle&lt;br /&gt;Emerald Bay - Coconut Colada (accelerator)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of tingles, but luckily only 2 were tingle. I looked them up and some seem to be pretty old (like from 2008) but I&#x27;m sure they work fine as I&#x27;ve used other packets that were older and still saw results. Overall I am happy with the mix I received.</li>
