            <li>But it flows very nicely onto the nail and stays on while curing</li>

            <li>I love this color!  </li>
            <li>This is a nice neutral color.</li>
            <li>This is sort of a pinky-beige, kind of a &amp;#34;non&amp;#34; color.</li>
            <li>Color is nice</li>
            <li>Was expecting an opaque kind of color, I guess.</li>
            <li>I was told no because its considered a hazardous material.</li>
            <li>I had to apply 4 coats before to achieve kind of milk color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have ordered from this vendor before and have had nothing but great responses and quick receipt on orders.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a color that would look good with a french manicure and this color is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for the busy mom who doesn&#x27;t have time to polish her nails 4 times a week!</li>
            <li>As always the Gelish  is by far the best nail polish  could buy.</li>
            <li>Best use would be for a clear coat.</li>
            <li>This is perfect if you want your nails to look natural.</li>
            <li>I honestly think this color would look beautiful on someone with much darker skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great with just the right amount of color.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for a French manicure and love that I can do this myself at home!  </li>
            <li>Great price for a large quantity, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Perfect for shorter nails or just to put on top of natural nails.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t so great with the application.</li>
            <li>I find one coat is perfect, but two gives a more solid look that is still nice.</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and was good quality.</li>
            <li>It arrived super fast, this products are so great!</li>
            <li>I have ordered more colors and the Structure too.  </li>
            <li>I like it much better than the Shellac-the price, the colors and the way it applies</li>
            <li>are all much better.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this color.  </li>
            <li>I was looking all over for the best gelish color to use in french manicures.  </li>
            <li>Nice light color.  </li>
            <li>I wish it just had some color or was more opaque.</li>
            <li>The perfect color for a French manicure.</li>
            <li>Perhaps using a shiny top coat would be better.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ll update this review if I have an epiphany about this and love it all over again.  </li>
            <li>I use this for french manicures, and it would perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Love this shade of Harmony Gelish polish.</li>
            <li>I bought the top uv lamp</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t wear this color by itself but it&#x27;s perfect for a French manicure.  </li>
            <li>Best color for french nails.</li>
            <li>I love this color...</li>
            <li>It looks like you have shiny healthy nails.</li>
            <li>It can be layered for more coverage if needed.  </li>
            <li>With the white tips, my nails look just flawless!</li>
            <li>It has no color no matter how many layers I put on.</li>
            <li>Perfect for a French Manicure.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Stays on for more than a week.</li>
            <li>Love it ...</li>
            <li>This color is soooo much better.  </li>
            <li>A great bridal color, or a classic posh girl&#x27;s nail shade.  </li>
            <li>But before the blister I LOVED this stuff I can not say enough good about it.</li>
            <li>Great for the natural look.</li>
            <li>It is a very nice clear though.</li>
            <li>This gelish products are so easy to apply</li>
            <li>Nice pretty neutral.  </li>
            <li>if u like light colors add some glitter looks okay not bad at all</li>
            <li>and I love that I can paint regular polish on top and take it off real easy without messing up the gel.</li>
            <li>Pictures posted are accurate for this product.</li>
            <li>I used it with Sheek white, also from Gelish and my nails look great.</li>
            <li>Would look great alone or with french manicure.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions precisely</li>
            <li>This product along with UV hardener light allows her to fix at home.  </li>
            <li>think it would work great for french manicure.</li>
            <li>These came in the full size bottle, as opposed to so many companies that sell you the mini bottle when you think you&#x27;re getting the full bottle.</li>
            <li>the only available Harmony Gelish polish are .25 cc, 1/2 the size for so much more money!!</li>
            <li>Very nice sheer color.</li>
            <li>It is clean looking; it would be great with a french manicure!</li>
            <li>Pretty color,just very light.</li>
            <li>Original Review*&lt;br /&gt;LOVE</li>
            <li>it looked like originally.  </li>
            <li>I am posting this review so that people know that even if you follow the directions and fully cure the product you can develop an allergy (though it appears to be rare); it did not even occur to me that this could happen!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still pretty pleased though.</li>
            <li>Of course, by the end of the third week, my nails have grown out and my manicure doesn&#x27;t look good anymore, but the product itself still looks fine.  </li>
            <li>I have been doing my own nails with Gelish for about 6 months now, and love the entire product line.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easy and is the perfect shade of soft pink.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a Very sheer color must use 2 coats  good</li>
            <li>two coats of Little Princess, gorgeous every time!</li>
            <li>Looks fresh and clean on the nails.  </li>
            <li>Looks clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I love thie Gelish system and this color in particular.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>It is definetely my new favorite.</li>
            <li>I can live without it until I find out. :)</li>
            <li>I recommend it to make beautiful natural french nail.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Very light color, almost clear.</li>
            <li>Bunny\\&quot; for a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>Nice color for french manicure.  </li>
            <li>Looks great and natural, but you can still tell it&#x27;s a french manicure.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t mine the led light and love how this last up to two weeks and maybe longer....</li>
            <li>/&gt;After about a week of wearing this color I don&#x27;t like it as much as I did when I originally put it on.  </li>
            <li>And LOVE the price for a full size bottle, at my local supply store</li>
            <li>This is a perfect touch to your french manicure give you nails that extra touch makes it look very professional</li>
            <li>, they look great, they last for at least 2 weeks or more!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a pretty good size bottle compared to other gel polish brands.  </li>
            <li>I think my skin around it makes it look bland - but not in a good way.  </li>
            <li>Great for french nails with Sheek White tips.</li>
            <li>It is subtle but beautiful.  </li>
            <li>My mani&#x27;s easily last 2 or more weeks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely give it another try maybe just with two coats, and a shiny top coat and see how that works.</li>
            <li>Very runny!</li>
            <li>Color was exactly as I anticipated.  </li>
            <li>I love the look of the sheer polish...</li>
            <li>I used three coats to get just a tiny bit more color.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>White\\&quot; on the tips for a very clean french manicure, or with \\&quot;Snow</li>
            <li>Great color if you are looking for that subtle nail color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my go-to color for a professional clean look.</li>
            <li>I do two coats of Sheek White on the tips, clean up the smile line with a brush dipped in alcohol then</li>
            <li>True light pink.</li>
            <li>This is a very natural color for me, and depending on how many layers you put on it can be sheer or opaque.</li>
            <li>One coat gives a perfect very natural soft pink and I use Snow Bunny for a soft white tip.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s even a little milky looking, but it really gives the nail a nice look.</li>
            <li>I also recently bought the PH bond from Gelish which made a huge difference, manicure lasted much longer.</li>
            <li>but my nails grow out so fast</li>
            <li>It is not quite as pink as the picture which is ok with me.  </li>
            <li>I love it for a creamy, whitish, pink look.</li>
            <li>Also chips really fast; used as directed but product chips within 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the minis</li>
            <li>but it really adds no color.</li>
            <li>Wonderful base color, really like this on it&#x27;s own or with a french</li>
            <li>I also bought the color Snow Bunny for the more natural looking white tips.</li>
            <li>Little princess is a pretty, natural nail kind of color.</li>
            <li>This gel nail polish is exactly the right color for a french manicure.  </li>
            <li>This color (Little Princess) is great for a natural french manicure.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and have also worn it just as a clear coat without the sleek white as tips.</li>
            <li>Its pretty much clear.</li>
            <li>Pretty natural looking nail color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a dark skinned black lady and This color is perfect for French manicure for my complexion.</li>
            <li>A little whiter than expected but super cute and durable polish!</li>
            <li>A true light natural pink for French manicures</li>
            <li>It is very close to OPI&#x27;s Bubble Bath, but it&#x27;s too sheer to be an exact dupe.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely shade of pale white-pink.  </li>
            <li>This polish works fine but is an opaque light pink, not a solid color like white.</li>
            <li>was hoping it would be a little more pink but still looks okay with french tip.</li>
            <li>It is very pale like skin color, will be good with french nails.</li>
            <li>Nice sheer pink for French Manicure, no glitter, cures fast.  </li>
            <li>But it just looks sort of blah - sorry not the most accurate description.  </li>
            <li>This color is sheer and more of a milky pink.</li>
            <li>I applied two coates and it was still very clear...</li>
            <li>I would get if I wanted to have a full coverage neutral pink.</li>
            <li>Odd it was considered safe to ship it to me, but I can&#x27;t ship it back?!</li>
            <li>Slight pinkish color but just enough to give your nails a healthy color and shine.</li>
            <li>Very pretty soft pink.  </li>
            <li>Not just a clear coat.</li>
            <li>almost looks clear</li>
            <li>Princesses\\&quot; (which is a semi-transparent light pink color) and used it over \\&quot;Sheek White\\&quot; color for my french manicures.  </li>
            <li>It has been applied in a professional salon for me.  </li>
            <li>I have no complaints with this product so far.</li>
            <li>This gel polish has a hint of milkiness so that two coats even out your natural nails.  </li>
            <li>I find the formula to be a bit thicker than my newer polishes, but not by much, and I only noticed when I swatched it along with the newer colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I still developed an allergy to the product.</li>
            <li>Even with professional nail replacement, my wife often chips a nail.  </li>
            <li>I applied it three times and my friends asked me if I went to a professional nailist.</li>
            <li>I purposely bought through Amazon Prime to avoid this kind of crap, not at all pleased to be faced with it now.</li>
            <li>This is exactly the same color as my nails and so sheer that it looks like nothing is on them.</li>
            <li>It would be a great base for a french but by itself it is very pretty.  </li>
            <li>and she really loves the gel as she does not have to do her nails every few days, more like every few weeks now.</li>
            <li>I first made the mistake of buying the \\&quot;Simple Sheer\\&quot; color (which is actually just clear nail polish) for my french manicure.  </li>
            <li>This color gives a perfect base color for my french manicure.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a perfect French manicure base.</li>
            <li>It gives a very natural, French look.</li>
            <li>Glam and Glits Ink has a super sheer pink that&#x27;s really interesting, but it&#x27;s a little too pink IMO for a french.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a white-out white for french tips but a pretty snowy semi-sheer white.  </li>
            <li>Each coat did set hard after 30 seconds under an LED light.</li>
            <li>It makes a gel french manicure look natural.</li>
            <li>For those who don&#x27;t like animal cruelty and caged, even strapped down, animals being tested on so we can have pretty nails.    </li>
            <li>Next time I might try a sheer with a little brighter pink color, but this is fine.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you like natural looking nails (not a French), this is sheer enough to give you that look.</li>
            <li>This is a super sheer pale pink (almost clear) that I use for a french manicure.  </li>
            <li>Because the brush is larger than the typical small bottled gel polish brushes, it can be hard to not glob too much polish onto the nail, so the polish is more likely to peel off with such a thick coat, but I&#x27;m still mainly pleased.</li>
            <li>and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth.</li>

            <li> I have ordered more colors and the Structure too.  </li>
            <li> I like it much better than the Shellac-the price, the colors and the way it applies</li>
            <li> are all much better.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this color.  </li>
            <li> I was looking all over for the best gelish color to use in french manicures.  </li>
            <li> Nice light color.  </li>
            <li> I wish it just had some color or was more opaque.</li>
            <li> The perfect color for a French manicure.</li>
            <li> Perhaps using a shiny top coat would be better.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ll update this review if I have an epiphany about this and love it all over again.  </li>
            <li> I use this for french manicures, and it would perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Love this shade of Harmony Gelish polish.</li>
            <li> I bought the top uv lamp</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t wear this color by itself but it&#x27;s perfect for a French manicure.  </li>
            <li> Best color for french nails.</li>
            <li> I love this color...</li>
            <li> It looks like you have shiny healthy nails.</li>
            <li> It can be layered for more coverage if needed.  </li>
            <li> With the white tips, my nails look just flawless!</li>
            <li> It has no color no matter how many layers I put on.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a French Manicure.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Stays on for more than a week.</li>
            <li> Love it ...</li>
            <li> This color is soooo much better.  </li>
            <li> A great bridal color, or a classic posh girl&#x27;s nail shade.  </li>
            <li> But before the blister I LOVED this stuff I can not say enough good about it.</li>
            <li> Great for the natural look.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice clear though.</li>
            <li> This gelish products are so easy to apply</li>
            <li> Nice pretty neutral.  </li>
            <li> if u like light colors add some glitter looks okay not bad at all</li>
            <li> and I love that I can paint regular polish on top and take it off real easy without messing up the gel.</li>
            <li> Pictures posted are accurate for this product.</li>
            <li> I used it with Sheek white, also from Gelish and my nails look great.</li>
            <li> Would look great alone or with french manicure.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions precisely</li>
            <li> This product along with UV hardener light allows her to fix at home.  </li>
            <li> think it would work great for french manicure.</li>
            <li> These came in the full size bottle, as opposed to so many companies that sell you the mini bottle when you think you&#x27;re getting the full bottle.</li>
            <li> the only available Harmony Gelish polish are .25 cc, 1/2 the size for so much more money!!</li>
            <li> Very nice sheer color.</li>
            <li> It is clean looking; it would be great with a french manicure!</li>
            <li> Pretty color,just very light.</li>
            <li> Original Review*&lt;br /&gt;LOVE</li>
            <li> it looked like originally.  </li>
            <li> I am posting this review so that people know that even if you follow the directions and fully cure the product you can develop an allergy (though it appears to be rare); it did not even occur to me that this could happen!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still pretty pleased though.</li>
            <li> Of course, by the end of the third week, my nails have grown out and my manicure doesn&#x27;t look good anymore, but the product itself still looks fine.  </li>
            <li> I have been doing my own nails with Gelish for about 6 months now, and love the entire product line.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easy and is the perfect shade of soft pink.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Very sheer color must use 2 coats  good</li>
            <li> two coats of Little Princess, gorgeous every time!</li>
            <li> Looks fresh and clean on the nails.  </li>
            <li> Looks clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I love thie Gelish system and this color in particular.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> It is definetely my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I can live without it until I find out. :)</li>
            <li> I recommend it to make beautiful natural french nail.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Very light color, almost clear.</li>
            <li> Bunny\\&quot; for a more natural look.  </li>
            <li> Nice color for french manicure.  </li>
            <li> Looks great and natural, but you can still tell it&#x27;s a french manicure.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t mine the led light and love how this last up to two weeks and maybe longer....</li>
            <li> /&gt;After about a week of wearing this color I don&#x27;t like it as much as I did when I originally put it on.  </li>
            <li> And LOVE the price for a full size bottle, at my local supply store</li>
            <li> This is a perfect touch to your french manicure give you nails that extra touch makes it look very professional</li>
            <li> , they look great, they last for at least 2 weeks or more!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a pretty good size bottle compared to other gel polish brands.  </li>
            <li> I think my skin around it makes it look bland - but not in a good way.  </li>
            <li> Great for french nails with Sheek White tips.</li>
            <li> It is subtle but beautiful.  </li>
            <li> My mani&#x27;s easily last 2 or more weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely give it another try maybe just with two coats, and a shiny top coat and see how that works.</li>
            <li> Very runny!</li>
            <li> Color was exactly as I anticipated.  </li>
            <li> I love the look of the sheer polish...</li>
            <li> I used three coats to get just a tiny bit more color.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> White\\&quot; on the tips for a very clean french manicure, or with \\&quot;Snow</li>
            <li> Great color if you are looking for that subtle nail color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my go-to color for a professional clean look.</li>
            <li> I do two coats of Sheek White on the tips, clean up the smile line with a brush dipped in alcohol then</li>
            <li> True light pink.</li>
            <li> This is a very natural color for me, and depending on how many layers you put on it can be sheer or opaque.</li>
            <li> One coat gives a perfect very natural soft pink and I use Snow Bunny for a soft white tip.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s even a little milky looking, but it really gives the nail a nice look.</li>
            <li> I also recently bought the PH bond from Gelish which made a huge difference, manicure lasted much longer.</li>
            <li> but my nails grow out so fast</li>
            <li> It is not quite as pink as the picture which is ok with me.  </li>
            <li> I love it for a creamy, whitish, pink look.</li>
            <li> Also chips really fast; used as directed but product chips within 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the minis</li>
            <li> but it really adds no color.</li>
            <li> Wonderful base color, really like this on it&#x27;s own or with a french</li>
            <li> I also bought the color Snow Bunny for the more natural looking white tips.</li>
            <li> Little princess is a pretty, natural nail kind of color.</li>
            <li> This gel nail polish is exactly the right color for a french manicure.  </li>
            <li> This color (Little Princess) is great for a natural french manicure.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and have also worn it just as a clear coat without the sleek white as tips.</li>
            <li> Its pretty much clear.</li>
            <li> Pretty natural looking nail color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dark skinned black lady and This color is perfect for French manicure for my complexion.</li>
            <li> A little whiter than expected but super cute and durable polish!</li>
            <li> A true light natural pink for French manicures</li>
            <li> It is very close to OPI&#x27;s Bubble Bath, but it&#x27;s too sheer to be an exact dupe.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely shade of pale white-pink.  </li>
            <li> This polish works fine but is an opaque light pink, not a solid color like white.</li>
            <li> was hoping it would be a little more pink but still looks okay with french tip.</li>
            <li> It is very pale like skin color, will be good with french nails.</li>
            <li> Nice sheer pink for French Manicure, no glitter, cures fast.  </li>
            <li> But it just looks sort of blah - sorry not the most accurate description.  </li>
            <li> This color is sheer and more of a milky pink.</li>
            <li> I applied two coates and it was still very clear...</li>
            <li> I would get if I wanted to have a full coverage neutral pink.</li>
            <li> Odd it was considered safe to ship it to me, but I can&#x27;t ship it back?!</li>
            <li> Slight pinkish color but just enough to give your nails a healthy color and shine.</li>
            <li> Very pretty soft pink.  </li>
            <li> Not just a clear coat.</li>
            <li> almost looks clear</li>
            <li> Princesses\\&quot; (which is a semi-transparent light pink color) and used it over \\&quot;Sheek White\\&quot; color for my french manicures.  </li>
            <li> It has been applied in a professional salon for me.  </li>
            <li> I have no complaints with this product so far.</li>
            <li> This gel polish has a hint of milkiness so that two coats even out your natural nails.  </li>
            <li> I find the formula to be a bit thicker than my newer polishes, but not by much, and I only noticed when I swatched it along with the newer colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I still developed an allergy to the product.</li>
            <li> Even with professional nail replacement, my wife often chips a nail.  </li>
            <li> I applied it three times and my friends asked me if I went to a professional nailist.</li>
            <li> I purposely bought through Amazon Prime to avoid this kind of crap, not at all pleased to be faced with it now.</li>
            <li> This is exactly the same color as my nails and so sheer that it looks like nothing is on them.</li>
            <li> It would be a great base for a french but by itself it is very pretty.  </li>
            <li> and she really loves the gel as she does not have to do her nails every few days, more like every few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I first made the mistake of buying the \\&quot;Simple Sheer\\&quot; color (which is actually just clear nail polish) for my french manicure.  </li>
            <li> This color gives a perfect base color for my french manicure.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a perfect French manicure base.</li>
            <li> It gives a very natural, French look.</li>
            <li> Glam and Glits Ink has a super sheer pink that&#x27;s really interesting, but it&#x27;s a little too pink IMO for a french.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a white-out white for french tips but a pretty snowy semi-sheer white.  </li>
            <li> Each coat did set hard after 30 seconds under an LED light.</li>
            <li> It makes a gel french manicure look natural.</li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t like animal cruelty and caged, even strapped down, animals being tested on so we can have pretty nails.    </li>
            <li> Next time I might try a sheer with a little brighter pink color, but this is fine.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you like natural looking nails (not a French), this is sheer enough to give you that look.</li>
            <li> This is a super sheer pale pink (almost clear) that I use for a french manicure.  </li>
            <li> Because the brush is larger than the typical small bottled gel polish brushes, it can be hard to not glob too much polish onto the nail, so the polish is more likely to peel off with such a thick coat, but I&#x27;m still mainly pleased.</li>
            <li> and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than seeking professional repair and more convenient.</li>
            <li> some of the gel light pinks like shellac&#x27;s romantic are difficult to apply b/c they come out to streaky.</li>
            <li> I applied 3 coats over my pink and white manicure and you could barely see a pink hue.</li>
            <li> This polish is nice, very very subtle though.would recommend using this if doing a French manicure or something to that effect, as may look a little washed out plain on the nail alone.</li>
            <li> I would buy this exact color and brand again as it&#x27;s difficult to find a natural pink for French manicures.</li>
            <li> I suppose you could put several coats on for less of a sheer coat.  </li>
            <li> Looks very natural with a very slight shade of pink.</li>
            <li> It is so sheer that you can see the little white marks from damage on my nails even with 3 coats.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I will just combine it with my french tip white and to other colors as sort of a clearish-white filler to increase the volume of other colors I like</li>
            <li> I will look for other colors in this brand in the future!</li>
            <li> It is very natural and subtle pink, almost a bare shear.</li>
            <li> It is a pale, milky pink that looks totally natural on your nails.  </li>
            <li> Very translucent, subtle pink.</li>
            <li> I use little princess with sleek white on the tips.  </li>
            <li> Out of the bottle and swatched on a nail wheel, Gelish Little Princess looks like a cream white.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly (or at least it does when my professional manicurist applies it).</li>
            <li> Arrived on time as expected.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t find it to on the pink</li>
            <li> it actualy has no hint of pink in it at all.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too pink and it isn&#x27;t too brown.</li>
            <li> it is a sheer matte in a pale pink.  </li>
            <li> One coat provides sheer pale coverage.  </li>
            <li> Multiple coats will allow an opaque pale white-pink to emerge.</li>
            <li> base coat, one coat of Little Princess, wipe with alcohol after curing (or my white tips bleed), two coats of Sheek White for tips (paint on with brush, not stick-on guides), one coat of Little Princess and then top coat.</li>
            <li> ; that isn&#x27;t really very noticeable but this is more bland and boring than &amp;#34;simple and subtle&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I expected to see at least a little pink, but it&#x27;s almost clear.</li>
            <li> Other than that I would not purchase this non-colorless color again.</li>
            <li> but I needed to repolish due to grow out.</li>
            <li> The polish is a bit thicker than the other Gelish colors I&#x27;ve used...</li>
            <li> so I was very careful in applying the product.</li>
            <li> This color has a slight transparent pink tint.</li>
            <li> I am beginning to prefer Sally Hansen gel polish (at Target) and using Gelish for base and top.</li>
            <li> pale pink is the color.</li>
            <li> i needed a pale pink like this b/c</li>
            <li> The color is a pale pink and it has no shimmer.</li>
            <li> In reality however, it is a pale, milky pink.</li>
            <li> I used it with the Gellish Basix Kit and it stayed on for about 2 and a half weeks, probably longer</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want the iridescent/frost or the glitter in the other pale pinks.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be a pale &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; like other reviews mentioned but</li>
            <li> I have found \\&quot;Little Princess\\&quot; to be my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; color.  </li>
            <li> So, I ordered \\&quot;Little</li>
            <li> I was a little heavy handed on one hand</li>
            <li> Thick and hard to put 2 cotes as you need to have any color with this sheer of a polish.</li>
            <li> What a waste of $13.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this color a few times and every time I get streak lines (with two coats) or uneven coverage</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually go over 2 weeks anyway.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product three times over the past six weeks; i.e., one nail appoinment every three weeks.  </li>
            <li> This color works well with a French manicure, just keep it thin coats!  </li>
            <li> I had a difficult time finding a gel color that was very sheer but still looked like something.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure?</li>
            <li> and I put it on heavily!</li>
            <li> I have noticed that if I use two very thin coats of base gel (cured in between each, of course) that my thin, fragile nails hold up much better and the color lasts at least two weeks.  </li>
            <li> VERY subtle, translucent pink with no sparkle.</li>
            <li> The color is very pale</li>
            <li> I will say that it is hard to tell by these pictures on here, when regarding the color.</li>
            <li> I use this as the pink base for my french manicures.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d put it on too thick and it would spread into my cuticle so I cooked the stuff into my skin</li>
            <li> I would like to say it just looks subtle because I know sometimes you want a subtle &amp;#34;color&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Seriously...</li>
            <li> but I had a tough time getting it to cure.</li>
            <li> With only one coat of base, I experience peeling at the tips after a week or so.</li>
            <li> With two thin coats it is close to nail color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting frustrated with the uneven coverage.  </li>
            <li> this completely useless nail polish sits in my cupboard, taking up space.</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;m putting it on very thin).  </li>
            <li> It took 5 month before the painful blisters showed up under my fingernails.  </li>
            <li> Worst gel polish ever!!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a super sheer pale pink (almost clear) that I use for a french manicure.  Looks great.</li>
            <li> I love gelish! At first I wasn&#x27;t so great with the application. I&#x27;d put it on too thick and it would spread into my cuticle so I cooked the stuff into my skin and it would peel but now I paint patiently with thinner layers and it&#x27;s great! My mani&#x27;s easily last 2 or more weeks but my nails grow out so fast I don&#x27;t usually go over 2 weeks anyway.    I want to buy all the gelish colors!!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice neutral color. Got it for french manicures (which I haven&#x27;t mastered yet...). This color is sheer and more of a milky pink. This isn&#x27;t the color I would get if I wanted to have a full coverage neutral pink.</li>
            <li> I love thie Gelish system and this color in particular.  It is not quite as pink as the picture which is ok with me.  I had no problem using it on myself and getting it even.  I used three coats and all three coats came out even.  It would be a great base for a french but by itself it is very pretty.  Since I have found Gelish I can wear polish and grown my nails.  I have ordered more colors and the Structure too.  I like it much better than the Shellac-the price, the colors and the way it applies are all much better.</li>
            <li> This gel nail polish is exactly the right color for a french manicure.  Love it.  I have ordered from this vendor before and have had nothing but great responses and quick receipt on orders.</li>
            <li> Pretty natural looking nail color. I think Gelish has great quality products</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this color.  Goes on easy and is the perfect shade of soft pink.  It is definetely my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a Gelish shellac color that replicates OPI&#x27;s Bubble Bath. This is it. I love it for a creamy, whitish, pink look. Goes on smoothly (or at least it does when my professional manicurist applies it). Lasts like all the Gelish shellacs! It&#x27;s my go-to color for a professional clean look.</li>
            <li> Thick and hard to put 2 cotes as you need to have any color with this sheer of a polish.</li>
            <li> I was looking all over for the best gelish color to use in french manicures.  I use little princess with sleek white on the tips.  it is a sheer matte in a pale pink.  I didn&#x27;t want the iridescent/frost or the glitter in the other pale pinks.  I find one coat is perfect, but two gives a more solid look that is still nice. So happy.</li>
            <li> It is not the color that i expected&lt;br /&gt;The tone is just like a bright not a color. Hoy it see</li>
            <li> Nice light color.  Alone or with french tip look.  Arrived on time as expected.</li>
            <li> Nice sheer pink for French Manicure, no glitter, cures fast.  I suppose you could put several coats on for less of a sheer coat.  True light pink. I will say that it is hard to tell by these pictures on here, when regarding the color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product three times over the past six weeks; i.e., one nail appoinment every three weeks.  Of course, by the end of the third week, my nails have grown out and my manicure doesn&#x27;t look good anymore, but the product itself still looks fine.  It has been applied in a professional salon for me.  I have no complaints with this product so far.</li>
            <li> pale pink is the color. it almost looks milky white. i needed a pale pink like this b/c some of the gel light pinks like shellac&#x27;s romantic are difficult to apply b/c they come out to streaky. this does not apply streaky.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own nails with Gelish for about 6 months now, and love the entire product line.  I have found \\&quot;Little Princess\\&quot; to be my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; color.  It is a pale, milky pink that looks totally natural on your nails.  I use it with \\&quot;Sleek White\\&quot; on the tips for a very clean french manicure, or with \\&quot;Snow Bunny\\&quot; for a more natural look.  I have noticed that if I use two very thin coats of base gel (cured in between each, of course) that my thin, fragile nails hold up much better and the color lasts at least two weeks.  With only one coat of base, I experience peeling at the tips after a week or so.</li>
            <li> It is very pale like skin color, will be good with french nails.</li>
            <li> This gel polish has a hint of milkiness so that two coats even out your natural nails.  Next time I might try a sheer with a little brighter pink color, but this is fine.  It gives a very natural, French look. The quality and wear have been good.  It came in good time and with excellent packaging.</li>
            <li> No color at all. Also chips really fast; used as directed but product chips within 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the minis and they stay on longer. Will not buy this product again</li>
            <li> This is exactly the same color as my nails and so sheer that it looks like nothing is on them. It is so sheer that you can see the little white marks from damage on my nails even with 3 coats. I wish it just had some color or was more opaque. Not just a clear coat.</li>
            <li> The perfect color for a French manicure.</li>
            <li> Love Gelish!  This color works well with a French manicure, just keep it thin coats!  I was a little heavy handed on one hand so it gives an unnatural whitish look to your nail.  With two thin coats it is close to nail color and two weeks later still growing out well.  Can&#x27;t beat the price as this bottle is twice the size of what I can get locally!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dark skinned black lady and This color is perfect for French manicure for my complexion. I love it!</li>
            <li> I prefer a very sheer look for french manis and I have a client who also does. I had a difficult time finding a gel color that was very sheer but still looked like something. Glam and Glits Ink has a super sheer pink that&#x27;s really interesting, but it&#x27;s a little too pink IMO for a french. This is sort of a pinky-beige, kind of a &amp;#34;non&amp;#34; color. If you don&#x27;t like those milky looking french colors, but you don&#x27;t want a completely sheer color that looks like nothing, this is your color. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> *Original Review*&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this sheer white/clear. It is subtle but beautiful.  It&#x27;s not a white-out white for french tips but a pretty snowy semi-sheer white.  IT looks like it&#x27;s semi pinkish in the stock photo but I don&#x27;t find it to on the pink side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;After about a week of wearing this color I don&#x27;t like it as much as I did when I originally put it on.  Perhaps using a shiny top coat would be better.  But it just looks sort of blah - sorry not the most accurate description.  I honestly think this color would look beautiful on someone with much darker skin. After a week it sort of looks like a frosted nude color rather than the frosted white color it looked like originally.  I think my skin around it makes it look bland - but not in a good way.  I would like to say it just looks subtle because I know sometimes you want a subtle &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; that isn&#x27;t really very noticeable but this is more bland and boring than &amp;#34;simple and subtle&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ll definitely give it another try maybe just with two coats, and a shiny top coat and see how that works. And I&#x27;ll update this review if I have an epiphany about this and love it all over again.  Otherwise I will just combine it with my french tip white and to other colors as sort of a clearish-white filler to increase the volume of other colors I like more.&lt;br /&gt;___________________&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: Beauty Shine&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Beauty Shine&lt;br /&gt;Received: 7 days after order date</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be a pale &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; like other reviews mentioned but it actualy has no hint of pink in it at all. I applied two coates and it was still very clear...not what I wanted at all. It applies just like the simple sheer. This did not meet my needs. If you want something clear..then get it. Other than that I would not purchase this non-colorless color again.</li>
            <li> I Googled \\&quot;Gelish\\&quot; and a review on Amazon said this product is not tested on animals, yet I saw this report. It speaks of testing on mice, etc...  [...]    *For those who don&#x27;t like animal cruelty and caged, even strapped down, animals being tested on so we can have pretty nails.    I&#x27;m seeing one thing in one place about whether they test on animals, and then another thing somewhere else. I&#x27;d like to know the truth and appreciate any proof they do (or don&#x27;t) test on animals. I can live without it until I find out. :)</li>
            <li> A little whiter than expected but super cute and durable polish! Love the soak off feature! I used it with the Gellish Basix Kit and it stayed on for about 2 and a half weeks, probably longer but I needed to repolish due to grow out.</li>
            <li> Nice color for french manicure.  Color goes on evenly and looks great woth two coats.  I would recommend this polish.</li>
            <li> Gelish is the only polish I will ever wear.  2-3 weeks on fingers and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth. Perfect for the busy mom who doesn&#x27;t have time to polish her nails 4 times a week! I use this for french manicures, and it would perfectly.  Very translucent, subtle pink.</li>
            <li> A true light natural pink for French manicures and it&#x27;s a pretty good size bottle compared to other gel polish brands.  I also recently bought the PH bond from Gelish which made a huge difference, manicure lasted much longer. I would buy this exact color and brand again as it&#x27;s difficult to find a natural pink for French manicures.</li>
            <li> This color has a slight transparent pink tint. It is clean looking; it would be great with a french manicure!</li>
            <li> I wish this was opaque and descriptions would indicate level of sheerness. I am beginning to prefer Sally Hansen gel polish (at Target) and using Gelish for base and top.</li>
            <li> Love this shade of Harmony Gelish polish. I use this as the pink base for my french manicures. It is very natural and subtle pink, almost a bare shear. Love it!!! And LOVE the price for a full size bottle, at my local supply store the only available Harmony Gelish polish are .25 cc, 1/2 the size for so much more money!! Love this seller and size for the deal!!!</li>
            <li> Worst gel polish ever!!!! Very runny! do not buy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great with just the right amount of color.  Looks fresh and clean on the nails.  As always the Gelish  is by far the best nail polish  could buy.</li>
            <li> loves this color and she really loves the gel as she does not have to do her nails every few days, more like every few weeks now.</li>
            <li> Color is nice but I had a tough time getting it to cure. I bought the top uv lamp so I&#x27;m not sure?</li>
            <li> Was expecting an opaque kind of color, I guess. Its pretty much clear. Didnt make a diff even after 3 coats. Too I cant exchange it.</li>
            <li> Very nice sheer color. Best use would be for a clear coat. Purchased to use over a french manicure but it really adds no color. Therefore I gave it four stars. It is a very nice clear though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Very sheer color must use 2 coats  good if u like light colors add some glitter looks okay not bad at all</li>
            <li> Color was exactly as I anticipated.  Very pretty.</li>
            <li> Great for the natural look. Looks clean and fresh. Perfect for shorter nails or just to put on top of natural nails.</li>
            <li> Nice color, great price! love it</li>
            <li> This wouldn&#x27;t cure under my LED, and when I tried to return it through Prime I was told no because its considered a hazardous material. Odd it was considered safe to ship it to me, but I can&#x27;t ship it back?! Seriously...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller who said I would need to pay to send it to them and they would &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; it to see if it was indeed defective. My refund would be based on their findings. I purposely bought through Amazon Prime to avoid this kind of crap, not at all pleased to be faced with it now. No upfront warning from Amazon either that even though this was purchased through Prime it wouldn&#x27;t fall under their return policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this completely useless nail polish sits in my cupboard, taking up space. What a waste of $13.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t wear this color by itself but it&#x27;s perfect for a French manicure.  I do two coats of Sheek White on the tips, clean up the smile line with a brush dipped in alcohol then two coats of Little Princess, gorgeous every time!</li>
            <li> Best color for french nails.</li>
            <li> This color is great as a base for the french manicure and also to be worn alone. The color is a pale pink and it has no shimmer.</li>
            <li> Way to translucent! No use!</li>
            <li> This is perfect if you want your nails to look natural. Slight pinkish color but just enough to give your nails a healthy color and shine. Pictures posted are accurate for this product.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Very light color, almost clear.</li>
            <li> This color gives a perfect base color for my french manicure.  My skintone is caramel african american.  One coat gives a perfect very natural soft pink and I use Snow Bunny for a soft white tip.  These Gelish polishes work great with the Mally LED lamp.</li>
            <li> Perfect color for my frech manicure !!!</li>
            <li> Out of the bottle and swatched on a nail wheel, Gelish Little Princess looks like a cream white. In reality however, it is a pale, milky pink. I find the formula to be a bit thicker than my newer polishes, but not by much, and I only noticed when I swatched it along with the newer colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a perfect French manicure base. Also, if you like natural looking nails (not a French), this is sheer enough to give you that look. It is very close to OPI&#x27;s Bubble Bath, but it&#x27;s too sheer to be an exact dupe.</li>
            <li> I love this color...when I can get an even coat.  I&#x27;ve used this color a few times and every time I get streak lines (with two coats) or uneven coverage (and I&#x27;m putting it on very thin).  A third coat may make my nails too white.  I may try just one coat next time.  I love the look of the sheer polish...I&#x27;m just getting frustrated with the uneven coverage.  The polish is a bit thicker than the other Gelish colors I&#x27;ve used...so maybe I have a funky bottle!</li>
            <li> This color (Little Princess) is great for a natural french manicure. It almost looks like you aren&#x27;t putting a color on and it&#x27;s even a little milky looking, but it really gives the nail a nice look. It looks like you have shiny healthy nails. I used it with Sheek white, also from Gelish and my nails look great.</li>
            <li> Wonderful base color, really like this on it&#x27;s own or with a french</li>
            <li> Little princess is a pretty, natural nail kind of color. Would look great alone or with french manicure. I used three coats to get just a tiny bit more color.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so I was very careful in applying the product. I followed the directions precisely and I still developed an allergy to the product. It took 5 month before the painful blisters showed up under my fingernails.  I tried giving my nails 2months off but the blisters came back faster that before. But before the blister I LOVED this stuff I can not say enough good about it. I am posting this review so that people know that even if you follow the directions and fully cure the product you can develop an allergy (though it appears to be rare); it did not even occur to me that this could happen!</li>
            <li> This is a perfect touch to your french manicure give you nails that extra touch makes it look very professional I wouldn&#x27;t do a french manicure without it!</li>
            <li> This polish is nice, very very subtle though.would recommend using this if doing a French manicure or something to that effect, as may look a little washed out plain on the nail alone. Pretty color,just very light.</li>
            <li> Even with professional nail replacement, my wife often chips a nail.  This product along with UV hardener light allows her to fix at home.  Much less expensive than seeking professional repair and more convenient.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a French manicure and love that I can do this myself at home!  Easy to apply and have also worn it just as a clear coat without the sleek white as tips.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product and it was as described; I only gave it 4 stars because the color is lighter than I had hoped - no one&#x27;s fault. I didn&#x27;t know how to envision it on my nails, that&#x27;s all. But it flows very nicely onto the nail and stays on while curing and I put it on heavily! I will look for other colors in this brand in the future!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely shade of pale white-pink.  It can be layered for more coverage if needed.  A great bridal color, or a classic posh girl&#x27;s nail shade.  One coat provides sheer pale coverage.  Multiple coats will allow an opaque pale white-pink to emerge.</li>
            <li> This is a great base color for your french manicures.  Nice pretty neutral.  With the white tips, my nails look just flawless!</li>
            <li> It has no color no matter how many layers I put on.</li>
            <li> This polish works fine but is an opaque light pink, not a solid color like white. I applied 3 coats over my pink and white manicure and you could barely see a pink hue. Each coat did set hard after 30 seconds under an LED light.</li>
            <li> This is a very natural color for me, and depending on how many layers you put on it can be sheer or opaque. It isn&#x27;t too pink and it isn&#x27;t too brown. It lasts almost 2 weeks and I love that I can paint regular polish on top and take it off real easy without messing up the gel. I wear this color almost constantly.</li>
            <li> I love this color!  Perfect for a French Manicure.  I also bought the color Snow Bunny for the more natural looking white tips.</li>
            <li> The color is very pale almost looks clear was hoping it would be a little more pink but still looks okay with french tip.</li>
            <li> VERY subtle, translucent pink with no sparkle. Great for french nails with Sheek White tips. I do: base coat, one coat of Little Princess, wipe with alcohol after curing (or my white tips bleed), two coats of Sheek White for tips (paint on with brush, not stick-on guides), one coat of Little Princess and then top coat. Looks great and natural, but you can still tell it&#x27;s a french manicure. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great product! It shipped quickly and was good quality. No issues and I loved the color. It was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> These came in the full size bottle, as opposed to so many companies that sell you the mini bottle when you think you&#x27;re getting the full bottle.</li>
            <li> Very pretty soft pink.  One of my favorite colors and a great price!</li>
            <li> Great price for a large quantity, which is nice. Because the brush is larger than the typical small bottled gel polish brushes, it can be hard to not glob too much polish onto the nail, so the polish is more likely to peel off with such a thick coat, but I&#x27;m still mainly pleased. I am picky about my french manicure colors though. I wanted a see-through pink-tinted polish and this is cloudier than I prefer, but it still does the trick. They just didn&#x27;t have the color that I wanted in existence. I&#x27;m still pretty pleased though.</li>
            <li> Great color if you are looking for that subtle nail color. Very happy with the product.  Stays on for more than a week.</li>
            <li> It arrived super fast, this products are so great! I will continue to shop with this seller! This gelish products are so easy to apply, they look great, they last for at least 2 weeks or more!</li>
            <li> I expected to see at least a little pink, but it&#x27;s almost clear. I had to apply 4 coats before to achieve kind of milk color.&lt;br /&gt;I think it would work great for french manicure.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a color that would look good with a french manicure and this color is perfect.  It looks great!  Looks very natural with a very slight shade of pink.</li>
            <li> I like the quality of this product and they have a great color selection and I don&#x27;t mine the led light and love how this last up to two weeks and maybe longer.... Love it ... I don&#x27;t like how you have to soak your nails in acetone that eats up my skin and my skin starts to peel so I had to stop using it for that reason...</li>
            <li> I first made the mistake of buying the \\&quot;Simple Sheer\\&quot; color (which is actually just clear nail polish) for my french manicure.  Big mistake.  So, I ordered \\&quot;Little Princesses\\&quot; (which is a semi-transparent light pink color) and used it over \\&quot;Sheek White\\&quot; color for my french manicures.  This color is soooo much better.  It makes a gel french manicure look natural.</li>
            <li> I loved it! I recommend it to make beautiful natural french nail. I applied it three times and my friends asked me if I went to a professional nailist. ;-)</li>
