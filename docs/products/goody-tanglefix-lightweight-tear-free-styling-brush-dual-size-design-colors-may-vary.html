            <li>Best when used after shower time.  </li>
            <li>VERY IMPRESSED!!!  </li>
            <li>I love this thing!!!!</li>
            <li>My daughter has curly hair and this works the best out of anything..</li>
            <li>This brush is awesome!</li>
            <li>Thought this would be great for my granddaughters hair but not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t get through tangles like they advertise</li>
            <li>It also good for tender headed people.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love this hairbrush!</li>
            <li>Sigh, I&#x27;m so glad to have this!</li>
            <li>Great brush as my daughter&#x27;s hair tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>Just one pass through the hair and it is all nicely combed without pulling or breaking any hair.</li>
            <li>She no longer protests and has also started to brush her own hair.</li>
            <li>I do like the Tanglefix&#x27;s size and shape - fits the hand perfectly and is very pocketable.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this brush that I was compelled to write my first product review, ever!  </li>
            <li>She is now able to do her own hair as well as myself.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>The bristles are also shorter than I am used to as well as being shorter with more space in between than my Mason Pearson.</li>
            <li>I had my hair 4+ inches to start with a healthy foundation and</li>
            <li>Even better, she can bring it into the shower and use it to detangle her hair after she&#x27;s washes and conditioned it all by herself.  </li>
            <li>After one brush all around your head it does not hurt any more.</li>
            <li>I sent this brush to my grand daughter.</li>
            <li>Most of the stuff is \\&quot;Meh.\\&quot; This brush was recommended to me by my sister-in-law.</li>
            <li>Her children are biracial, as are mine, and their hair has an interesting blend of Caucasian/ethnic attributes.</li>
            <li>So glad we picked this up.</li>
            <li>but now I love it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much better -</li>
            <li>It eliminated tangles so easily and it seems almost miraculous.</li>
            <li>Takes the knots out of my fine hair without ripping out my scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, and after I wash it, even with conditioner, it&#x27;s kinda&#x27; gnarley.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited.  </li>
            <li>It is durable and colorful!  </li>
            <li>It goes right through hair!</li>
            <li>so I am not surprised I loved this brush.  </li>
            <li>Totally surprised by this brush, but I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try</li>
            <li>worth it.</li>
            <li>My only quibble is that the box says &amp;#34;Now your child can brush her own hair!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Of course I am an adult and most people are probably buying this for their children.</li>
            <li>It combs right through with no pain.  </li>
            <li>It goes right through hair.  </li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>The bristles really get the tangles out!</li>
            <li>I never bought one of the gimmicky infomercial hairbrushes, but this is easily as good as one of those.</li>
            <li>So I purchased this on a whim at target because I thought I had read a really positive blog post about this brush</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work, to be the miracle.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like brushing it too much since it breaks and pulls my hair.  </li>
            <li>and my whole head was smoothed out, roots to tips.</li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Looking at it, it really is just a brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is light enough for her to handle.</li>
            <li>so whenever I brush its tips will reach my scalp and they are very scratchy.</li>
            <li>Works just like they say, has saved me from permanent hair loss from the normal brushes!</li>
            <li>But it comes in blue, so he was cool with it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>And she begged me to buy a few more just in case....</li>
            <li>I suffer from naturally wavy hair and if I run a brush through it, It immediately doubles in size and frizz making quick hairstyles next to impossible.&lt;br /&gt;Skeptical</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not somebody that is WOWED by every new product that I try.</li>
            <li>I use it and live it too.</li>
            <li>Between sprays and brushes and leave in conditioners the money down the drain is huge.</li>
            <li>The Wet Brush has soft ball tips on very flexible spokes, making it a very gentle brush.</li>
            <li>I have a sweaty, long-haired 8yr old boy who pretty much always looks like one of the Braveheart warriors after a rough battle.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than regular brushes but still cause hair breakage, especially when used on dry bed hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter constantly gets large nests of tangles in her waist length hair.</li>
            <li>In all of my tangles, I only hit two spots on my whole head where it even gave the slightest tug at all.  </li>
            <li>My child says combing hair hurts just as much as with our regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect much - I have lower back length bleach blonde hair that is wavy/snarly.</li>
            <li>I am completely mystified.</li>
            <li>Initially I could tolerate it but after about 2 weeks my scalp got really irritated.</li>
            <li>My 5 yr old has asked me to cut her hair short because she hates having her hair brushed so much.</li>
            <li>Her hair is very long and curly and gets really tangled.  </li>
            <li>Fine, long hair with a very active girl, makes for lots and lots of knots.</li>
            <li>My 8-year old daughter has biracial hair and for her entire life, I have struggled with her hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush at my local drug store for my 7 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I just tried this on my wet, fresh from the pool hair (otherwise known as chemical covered, dry and ratty).</li>
            <li>eventhough I was being careful with a normal brush.</li>
            <li>I have thick, curly, fly-away, frizzy, 2-foot-long hair and this brush was able to run through my hair to complete smoothness in less than 5 minutes with almost no pain at all!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little different Under first examination; however we have been using it</li>

            <li> Its not often I blow dry straight these days so this little brush has been keeping my hair frizz-free and</li>
            <li> The only other time I do not use this brush is if I am blow drying my hair straight in which I need a larger round barrel brush.</li>
            <li> So I tried it out on me and very quickly brushed through my (also) long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is hollow plastic an one end is larger.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my 5 year old that made brushing a crying event</li>
            <li> She has very long hair</li>
            <li> Still hurts when brushing tangled dry hair</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it takes some practice on using it to pull the hair up into a pony tail with it.</li>
            <li> It turns into a rats nest by the end of every day, and lately I&#x27;ve actually gone to bed with sore arms because I have to brush it for so long just to get out all the little snares (which immediately come back).&lt;br</li>
            <li> We were going to cut her hair to a bob style to avoid the daily crying, but now we don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have now moved onto the Wet Brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like every other brush we tried.</li>
            <li> I also won&#x27;t be using my other brushes anymore...</li>
            <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out like other brushes.</li>
            <li> Now I have to find some creative uses for this Tanglefix brush, as I hate to toss things out.</li>
            <li> Less time brushing while.using this brush</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter who has very long and thick hair.</li>
            <li> I would also say that if you have a tender headed child this will probably still hurt them a little.</li>
            <li> but it can&#x27;t reach the underside of her hair and it is already missing bristles.</li>
            <li> i have very long  very thick hair</li>
            <li> no more scratching, no more tangling and very little hair breakage.</li>
            <li> No more meltdowns, no more matted hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter (3) has been giving me a hard time about brushing her hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thick hair</li>
            <li> I mean...</li>
            <li> Revising my initial review after couple of weeks of daily use: I hate this brush!</li>
            <li> No more tears when brushing her hair!!</li>
            <li> It may work for thin hair but thicker texture hair-doesn&#x27;t even go thru my hair!</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical</li>
            <li> They just pull out clumps of hair instead of detangling my knots anyways (which means my hair has been grotesquely thinning).&lt;br</li>
            <li> My tender headed child would scream, fight, and cry every night (bath times were the worst)!</li>

            <li> I got this for my daughter who has very long and thick hair. it did okay but it can&#x27;t reach the underside of her hair and it is already missing bristles.</li>
            <li> I read about the brush on the recommendation of a hair blog I follow.  It was recommended for wavy hair to reduce frizziness and eliminate dead/frayed ends.  I suffer from naturally wavy hair and if I run a brush through it, It immediately doubles in size and frizz making quick hairstyles next to impossible.&lt;br /&gt;Skeptical when the brush arrived I decided to give it a go.  It is hollow plastic an one end is larger.  The curved design actually helps hold the brush well.  The bristles are also shorter than I am used to as well as being shorter with more space in between than my Mason Pearson. I had my hair 4+ inches to start with a healthy foundation and 2 months later I have to say, this is my go-to brush. The only time I use My Mason Pearson is at night when I want a scalp massage, but I can also get that with this brush the same.  The only other time I do not use this brush is if I am blow drying my hair straight in which I need a larger round barrel brush. Its not often I blow dry straight these days so this little brush has been keeping my hair frizz-free and alot healthier as its not breaking the ends of my hair.  Totally surprised by this brush, but I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try</li>
            <li> Best when used after shower time.  Still hurts when brushing tangled dry hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, fly-away, frizzy, 2-foot-long hair and this brush was able to run through my hair to complete smoothness in less than 5 minutes with almost no pain at all!  In all of my tangles, I only hit two spots on my whole head where it even gave the slightest tug at all.  VERY IMPRESSED!!!  I never bought one of the gimmicky infomercial hairbrushes, but this is easily as good as one of those.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this brush that I was compelled to write my first product review, ever!  My 8-year old daughter has biracial hair and for her entire life, I have struggled with her hair. No more meltdowns, no more matted hair.  She swears this brush does not hurt one bit and not only does she not mind now when I use it in her hair, but she can actually use it herself.  Even better, she can bring it into the shower and use it to detangle her hair after she&#x27;s washes and conditioned it all by herself.  Then, it&#x27;s a breeze for me to do her hair.  It combs right through with no pain.  I&#x27;m so excited.  I think this brush has changed our lives!</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work, to be the miracle. Well, it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s just like every other brush we tried. My child says combing hair hurts just as much as with our regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I got this brush today.It goes right through hair! It really works! After one brush all around your head it does not hurt any more.</li>
            <li> i have very long  very thick hair and I don&#x27;t like brushing it too much since it breaks and pulls my hair.  this brush is like a miracle.  I can now brush my hair every day, even several times a day .  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It may work for thin hair but thicker texture hair-doesn&#x27;t even go thru my hair!</li>
            <li> So I purchased this on a whim at target because I thought I had read a really positive blog post about this brush AND it was on sale. I really didn&#x27;t expect much - I have lower back length bleach blonde hair that is wavy/snarly. It turns into a rats nest by the end of every day, and lately I&#x27;ve actually gone to bed with sore arms because I have to brush it for so long just to get out all the little snares (which immediately come back).&lt;br /&gt;So I just tried this on my wet, fresh from the pool hair (otherwise known as chemical covered, dry and ratty). It literally GLIDED through. I mean... 30 seconds later and my whole head was smoothed out, roots to tips. This hasn&#x27;t happened since before I bleached my hair 2 years ago... I am completely mystified. I also won&#x27;t be using my other brushes anymore... They just pull out clumps of hair instead of detangling my knots anyways (which means my hair has been grotesquely thinning).&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line ... I don&#x27;t know why they market this for kids when adults can benefit too! I love this thing!!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter (3) has been giving me a hard time about brushing her hair. A fellow student in her dance class had one of these and I thought IU would give it a try! I LOVE IT! The bristles really get the tangles out! It is durable and colorful!  I trust the Goody brand already so I am not surprised I loved this brush.  The only down side is that it takes some practice on using it to pull the hair up into a pony tail with it.</li>
            <li> I sent this brush to my grand daughter. She has very long hair and I thought she would like it. I heard that she likes it, but I have not seen it used as she lives in another state.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush at my local drug store for my 7 year old daughter.  Her hair is very long and curly and gets really tangled.  Every morning is a struggle to brush and style her hair.  This brush is a miracle!  My daughter absolutely loves it.  Just one pass through the hair and it is all nicely combed without pulling or breaking any hair. Finally my daughter loves to brush her hair.  And she begged me to buy a few more just in case....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not somebody that is WOWED by every new product that I try. Most of the stuff is \\&quot;Meh.\\&quot; This brush was recommended to me by my sister-in-law. Her children are biracial, as are mine, and their hair has an interesting blend of Caucasian/ethnic attributes. Detangling their hair has always been a nightmare we&#x27;ve both struggled with. When she found this brush, she said her nightmares were over and this brush eliminated the tears and the pushback. After I got one, I tried it on my daughters&#x27; hair. It eliminated tangles so easily and it seems almost miraculous. Finally, we&#x27;ve found something that TRULY works.</li>
            <li> I have a sweaty, long-haired 8yr old boy who pretty much always looks like one of the Braveheart warriors after a rough battle. Combing was a constant struggle. I got this on a whim at Walgreens and he loves it and can use it himself. My only quibble is that the box says &amp;#34;Now your child can brush her own hair!&amp;#34;  But it comes in blue, so he was cool with it.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be great for my granddaughters hair but not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t get through tangles like they advertise and  scratches the head.</li>
            <li> Love this hairbrush! My daughter has curly hair and this works the best out of anything.. No more tears when brushing her hair!!</li>
            <li> We just picked this up at Target. My 5 yr old has asked me to cut her hair short because she hates having her hair brushed so much. Fine, long hair with a very active girl, makes for lots and lots of knots. I just tried it out on her and she said it didn&#x27;t hurt AT ALL!! She was astonished. So I tried it out on me and very quickly brushed through my (also) long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at it, it really is just a brush. I believe the trick is that the bristles are very short. So knots are not stuck in the brush, the brush is short enough to glide through the knots. Thumbs up from us!</li>
            <li> Four thumbs up! (Two from Mommy and two from four year-old daughter)&lt;br /&gt;This brush rocks. My daughter constantly gets large nests of tangles in her waist length hair. Daily brushing routine always resulted in tears. This brush changed that. She no longer protests and has also started to brush her own hair. This brush is light enough for her to handle. So glad we picked this up. We were going to cut her hair to a bob style to avoid the daily crying, but now we don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected. While it is functional and does what it says I feel like it is ripping hair out or splitting my hair. Of course I am an adult and most people are probably buying this for their children. I would also say that if you have a tender headed child this will probably still hurt them a little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little different Under first examination; however we have been using it and I was skeptical but now I love it. It goes right through hair.  I got this for my 5 year old that made brushing a crying event eventhough I was being careful with a normal brush. No tears or even complaints now. I use it and live it too. Sigh, I&#x27;m so glad to have this!</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush as a last resort. I had tried it all. Between sprays and brushes and leave in conditioners the money down the drain is huge. My tender headed child would scream, fight, and cry every night (bath times were the worst)! This was the last resort before chopping her waist length hair off. I was dubious, but it was a dream!  She is now able to do her own hair as well as myself. It&#x27;s restored peace to our home!</li>
            <li> Works just like they say, has saved me from permanent hair loss from the normal brushes!</li>
            <li> Revising my initial review after couple of weeks of daily use: I hate this brush! Its spikes are pointy and scratch my scalp. Initially I could tolerate it but after about 2 weeks my scalp got really irritated. I don&#x27;t have thick hair so whenever I brush its tips will reach my scalp and they are very scratchy. In terms of detangling it&#x27;s better than regular brushes but still cause hair breakage, especially when used on dry bed hair. I have now moved onto the Wet Brush and it&#x27;s so much better - no more scratching, no more tangling and very little hair breakage. The Wet Brush has soft ball tips on very flexible spokes, making it a very gentle brush. Now I have to find some creative uses for this Tanglefix brush, as I hate to toss things out. Maybe I can use it to scrub something. I do like the Tanglefix&#x27;s size and shape - fits the hand perfectly and is very pocketable. BTW I bought both brushes in local stores.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome! Takes the knots out of my fine hair without ripping out my scalp. I actually bought a second one to use on my dog-he is a Shih Tzu and needs brushing often to keep the mats away. Worked well for his hair as well.</li>
            <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out like other brushes. It also good for tender headed people. My hair is fine, and after I wash it, even with conditioner, it&#x27;s kinda&#x27; gnarley.</li>
            <li> Great brush as my daughter&#x27;s hair tangles easily.  Less time brushing while.using this brush</li>
