            <li>The clipper&#x27;s design itself is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>Love the design I get compliments on the clippers all the time they cut great haven&#x27;t had any issues and I recommend them to all barbers who are looking for great clippers with a stylish design you don&#x27;t see in many barbershops</li>
            <li>But do expect that if you are buzzing your own hair, there will be a learning curve.    </li>
            <li>i hae the original color and have loved these clippers since i got them</li>
            <li>I also want to mention that the electric cord is pretty durable and has a great amount of length in comparison to my Whal clippers.    </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I love this clipper</li>
            <li>110% satisfied with the performance of this product</li>
            <li>and I just think they are the best working, warrantied, and overall well designed piece of equipment.</li>
            <li>I believe it was definitely the best gift I could have given to him, and I enjoy having amazing hair cuts at all times.</li>
            <li>Top grade quality clipper.</li>
            <li>He is Oster&#x27;s creative director or something like that.  </li>
            <li>Very clean cut, i found that if you take a shower before buzzing your head you get a better result.</li>
            <li>I suppose the one thing that bothers kids the most is the buzzing sound that some clippers make, as my Wahl clippers do.</li>
            <li>Works like a charm and looks really cool!</li>
            <li>I still have a really high-end Wahl and can assuredly say that this Oster is by far the best clipper that I have ever owned or used.  </li>
            <li>Most defiantly the best clippers I ever had,looks  great,works great very quiet and got them quick,well worth the money,won&#x27;t go back to cheap clippers ever.</li>
            <li>the should come out with cool designs more often</li>
            <li>Shipping was accurate.</li>
            <li>I use this at the salon everyday and it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>Plus they are really unique in design help you stand out from the rest.</li>
            <li>they do get a lil warm at times so just keep cool care near by and keep it</li>
            <li>Has a quality weight and feel to it plus a cool design to boot.</li>
            <li>therefore I look much deeper than most.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love my new clippers</li>
            <li>The grafiti graphics are cool and the clippers are smooth, easily adjustable, and cut hair much better than other lower grade clippers I have used.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe the clean cut you will get on the first try.</li>
            <li>the metal blades provide a fast smooth result and the hair cut</li>
            <li>but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I have had these clippers for a few years now and they work just as great as the day that I first got them.</li>
            <li>The Classic 76 is the king of clippers, if you want top of the line, this clipper pretty much is</li>
            <li>Nice long chord.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, This is a super high quality clipper with a industrial strength motor, if you cut your own hair or cut your kid&#x27;s hair, it will pay for itself in no time, and it will last.</li>
            <li>They also give you so many different options to really customize a clients hair style and make it your own, so as to keep those clients coming back.</li>
            <li>This is the first detachable clipper I have owned and all I have to say is \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;, this thing flies through hair.</li>
            <li>My first cut was done in about 15-20min.</li>
            <li>You can learn more about this from the following post with Style Renegade, David Guerin.</li>
            <li>speed is fast and smooth and its not heavy.  </li>
            <li>We were trying to figure out why everyone says \\&quot;they are so loud\\&quot; because they are not that loud, and they give you confidence your getting a clean cut.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried and have gone through many different brands and levels over the years, but this is the 1st time that I&#x27;ve bought a really high-end Oster.  </li>
            <li>[this one] has been revamped/updated and is just as quite if not quieter than the Andis equivalent and there is no longer an \\&quot;oil hole\\&quot; on the right side for the motor bearing like there is on the older</li>
            <li>Because the motor is so strong, it needs to be cooled with air, thus on the bottom of the clipper where the switch is, you can see silver strips, those silver strips are a mesh system that filters the hair from the air that is used to cool the motor then blown back through the slits near the</li>
            <li>The sound scares the kids a bit because it sounds like a dental drill, but other than that it&#x27;s my favorite thus far.</li>
            <li>but luckily I still had the attachments from my old one that broke.</li>
            <li>It cuts hair very close</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s really nothing to say about these, they&#x27;re Oster 76.</li>
            <li>All I really have to say.</li>
            <li>They cut very well.</li>
            <li>start with quality: the weight is substantial, though not too heavy as to be cumbersome, the plastic is nice and sturdy, it uses \\&quot;impact resistant\\&quot; plastic.</li>
            <li>I am constantly getting compliments on the unique graffiti style.</li>
            <li>Also the clippers are a bit high maintenance for how much they cost.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend investing time learning proper upkeep if you aren&#x27;t familiar with Oster 76.</li>
            <li>old just got his first cut and it went well.    </li>
            <li>I was glad to see it was black.</li>
            <li>Well, I can&#x27;t speak for the older Oster 76 but</li>
            <li>They are fully compatible with the Oster Classic 76076 models.    </li>
            <li>top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are easily replaceable, you just pull the blades back hard, and it will pop open, pull it up, slide a new one in, push the blades in and youre good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;the blades that come with the clipper, 000 is pretty much your standard clipper blade, it can buzz cut very close to the skin and will accept any oster clipper attachment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I would highly recommend them to anyone with experience in the art of hair.</li>
            <li>The switches are firm and decisive, mostly everything about this clipper yells high class.</li>
            <li>New look to a classic clipper.</li>
            <li>The reviews that say it&#x27;s heavy and gets warm are certainly not lying, but it&#x27;s neither so heavy nor so warm as to cause any discomfort.  </li>
            <li>ti get it fixed up a little bit to work better.</li>
            <li>the new model</li>
            <li>Well, I learned that the new design does not need the maintenance.</li>
            <li>It cuts SO quickly and evenly; no more half-baked attempts to cut my own hair with a set of $15 clippers and giving up after half an hour to head to the barber.  </li>
            <li>saying that i also have to give props to the fact that this package supplys almost everything you need to maintain your investment so if you are not lazy about it and keep up with your investment then you are all set.</li>
            <li>They need to be greased consistently and the carbon brushes need to be replaced occasionally.</li>
            <li>i can do a mens hair cut in as little as 8 mins if i dont shampoo after because these clippers cut it right the first time u dont have to keep going over it.</li>
            <li>Many attachments are available for cutting any style you like.</li>
            <li>u dont have to blend with a comb near as much as with the standard styles.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my son who is a professional barber.</li>
            <li>so I have developed a trust with it.</li>
            <li>I recommend them to anybody that is looking for a professional grade clippers.</li>
            <li>Very powerful, clean even cut, a little heavy, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li>the only reason i want new is to get updated outer shell as the new ones</li>
            <li>They are smooth running and do a fantastic job of cutting through any texture &amp; density of hair.</li>
            <li>At under $150, it costs about as much as 15 of (my) haircuts, so having had it for just over two months and having done three cuts already, I&#x27;m well on my way to making my money back, and have a feeling that this thing will last forever.  </li>
            <li>Motor is best in class for this clipper, meaning it is very powerful, cutting through tough hair, wet hair, iron hair with ease.</li>
            <li>i have been wanting a new set since the pink ones came out and have been looking for any reason to buy a new pair but</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this professional grade clipper set.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like that red color on the old ones.</li>
            <li>I love them, have always want them, they are heaver then my other clipper, so some getting used to, the cutting is smooth,</li>

            <li> I definitely recommend this professional grade clipper set.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like that red color on the old ones.</li>
            <li> I love them, have always want them, they are heaver then my other clipper, so some getting used to, the cutting is smooth,</li>
            <li> but when I received in mail the outside of the clipper was broken but no damage to the motor which operates the machine luckily</li>
            <li> but now I know I waited to long..</li>
            <li> Now im gonna start off by by making it clear that these clippers are NOT cheap!</li>
            <li> were small and just maintenance like the spring that was fixed for under $10</li>
            <li> I usually take about 35-45min cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li> The clippers are also a lot lighter than I had expected.</li>
            <li> Finally, for any of you wondering about the Oiler, the silver button on the side and why its missing?</li>
            <li> Clippers were just as expected!</li>
            <li> Not like any other.</li>
            <li> The only reason I decided to post was to dispel some of the other reviews I read (including youtube) in which people complained about the noise and maintenance.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you are looking for other blades that are black, search for the OSTER, TITAN/</li>
            <li> only complaint is that is has no box except for a flimsy paper one, so do not throw the box away</li>
            <li> The 0000 blade included came in Black.</li>
            <li> The cord is long with a thick rubber</li>

            <li> I definitely recommend this professional grade clipper set. The grafiti graphics are cool and the clippers are smooth, easily adjustable, and cut hair much better than other lower grade clippers I have used. Many attachments are available for cutting any style you like.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and looks really cool!</li>
            <li> This is the first detachable clipper I have owned and all I have to say is \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;, this thing flies through hair. The clippers are also a lot lighter than I had expected.</li>
            <li> Awesome design. Shipping was accurate. Clippers were just as expected! Love them.</li>
            <li> I love this clipper I never saw it in the stores the should come out with cool designs more often</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair (and a select few) for 23 years.  I&#x27;ve tried and have gone through many different brands and levels over the years, but this is the 1st time that I&#x27;ve bought a really high-end Oster.  I still have a really high-end Wahl and can assuredly say that this Oster is by far the best clipper that I have ever owned or used.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> I would like to say how amazing and wonderful this tool is.  the metal blades provide a fast smooth result and the hair cut looks great.&lt;br /&gt;the speed is fast and smooth and its not heavy.  they do get a lil warm at times so just keep cool care near by and keep it well greased inside.&lt;br /&gt;its a spendy investment with all the metal blades and clipper but it is well worth it. I was scared to go to this oster but now I know I waited to long..&lt;br /&gt;enjoy</li>
            <li> Now im gonna start off by by making it clear that these clippers are NOT cheap! But, you get what you pay for. Also the clippers are a bit high maintenance for how much they cost. If you are too lazy to keep your property up to par than i do not recomend this product. saying that i also have to give props to the fact that this package supplys almost everything you need to maintain your investment so if you are not lazy about it and keep up with your investment then you are all set. Very clean cut, i found that if you take a shower before buzzing your head you get a better result. 110% satisfied with the performance of this product and i would recomend this clipper set to those who prefer to any DIY groomimg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  PS i also use it to trim my facial hair</li>
            <li> A beautiful clipper that got used but I decided to put it away as a collectors piece!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and they loved it! It looks just like it does on the picture and it works great!!!! I would recommend this to any barber!!!</li>
            <li> I may not have much to add to the many excellent reviews here, but I wanted to sing the praises of this awesome clipper.  At under $150, it costs about as much as 15 of (my) haircuts, so having had it for just over two months and having done three cuts already, I&#x27;m well on my way to making my money back, and have a feeling that this thing will last forever.  It cuts SO quickly and evenly; no more half-baked attempts to cut my own hair with a set of $15 clippers and giving up after half an hour to head to the barber.  The reviews that say it&#x27;s heavy and gets warm are certainly not lying, but it&#x27;s neither so heavy nor so warm as to cause any discomfort.  If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this, stop thinking and click the &amp;#34;order&amp;#34; button.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son who is a professional barber. Great tool with a &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; factor also. Would recommend with no reservations.</li>
            <li> Has a quality weight and feel to it plus a cool design to boot. It cuts hair very close and I have never had it nick me so I have developed a trust with it. I use mine every two days to trim up my beard hair because I am very hairy ( like sasquatch ) and I hate shaving.</li>
            <li> Love them !!!!!! Like the style!!!!!</li>
            <li> I cut my hair once a week an these clippers work perfect! And the design on them is a must have. Didn&#x27;t like that red color on the old ones.</li>
            <li> These clippers work great. I was expecting to come with the attachments to use on the clippers but luckily I still had the attachments from my old one that broke. Very happy though that I was able to find online.</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE CLIPPERS!!! They are smooth running and do a fantastic job of cutting through any texture &amp; density of hair. They also give you so many different options to really customize a clients hair style and make it your own, so as to keep those clients coming back. Plus they are really unique in design help you stand out from the rest. I have used Oster clippers for quite sometime and I just think they are the best working, warrantied, and overall well designed piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> Good clipper but when I received in mail the outside of the clipper was broken but no damage to the motor which operates the machine luckily</li>
            <li> I love them, have always want them, they are heaver then my other clipper, so some getting used to, the cutting is smooth,</li>
            <li> Love the design I get compliments on the clippers all the time they cut great haven&#x27;t had any issues and I recommend them to all barbers who are looking for great clippers with a stylish design you don&#x27;t see in many barbershops</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied at all about this item i had ti get it fixed up a little bit to work better. Hard to believe it was brand knew</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my new clippers</li>
            <li> The Classic 76 is the king of clippers, if you want top of the line, this clipper pretty much is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the parts are removable and serviceable, this is a clipper you dont throw away when broken, you fix it, and keep using it over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets start with quality: the weight is substantial, though not too heavy as to be cumbersome, the plastic is nice and sturdy, it uses \\&quot;impact resistant\\&quot; plastic. The switches are firm and decisive, mostly everything about this clipper yells high class. The cord is long with a thick rubber covering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Motor is best in class for this clipper, meaning it is very powerful, cutting through tough hair, wet hair, iron hair with ease. You can feel it, once you flip the switch, there is a pervasive hum that reverberates but isnt annoying at all. Because the motor is so strong, it needs to be cooled with air, thus on the bottom of the clipper where the switch is, you can see silver strips, those silver strips are a mesh system that filters the hair from the air that is used to cool the motor then blown back through the slits near the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are easily replaceable, you just pull the blades back hard, and it will pop open, pull it up, slide a new one in, push the blades in and youre good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the blades that come with the clipper, 000 is pretty much your standard clipper blade, it can buzz cut very close to the skin and will accept any oster clipper attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a brush, grease, blade cover, and the bottom of the clipper has a hanging metal wire so you can hang the clipper from a hook or screw in the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that is has no box except for a flimsy paper one, so do not throw the box away&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, This is a super high quality clipper with a industrial strength motor, if you cut your own hair or cut your kid&#x27;s hair, it will pay for itself in no time, and it will last.</li>
            <li> I use this at the salon everyday and it&#x27;s awesome. Great blade on it and gets alot of hair in one shot. The sound scares the kids a bit because it sounds like a dental drill, but other than that it&#x27;s my favorite thus far.</li>
            <li> I purchased these clippers for my boyfriend for our anniversary. He has been doing hair for several years. He HATES the color red, which is what the classic 76 typically come in. He was amazed with the design, and was glad to see he got the BEST clippers you can get. He cut my hair with them the next day. The cut was flawless and it made my Mohawk better than it had ever been before. You could not see any lines and the fade was perfect. We were trying to figure out why everyone says \\&quot;they are so loud\\&quot; because they are not that loud, and they give you confidence your getting a clean cut. I believe it was definitely the best gift I could have given to him, and I enjoy having amazing hair cuts at all times. So I would highly recommend them to anyone with experience in the art of hair.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really nothing to say about these, they&#x27;re Oster 76. New look to a classic clipper.</li>
            <li> i purchased a set back in feb 2006 i hae the original color and have loved these clippers since i got them i have since got 2 co workers to get them as well do to the fact clients request me simply because they like how my clippers cut their hair apposed to the standard pairs that r out there. i can do a mens hair cut in as little as 8 mins if i dont shampoo after because these clippers cut it right the first time u dont have to keep going over it. u dont have to blend with a comb near as much as with the standard styles. i have been wanting a new set since the pink ones came out and have been looking for any reason to buy a new pair but not for any reason connected to the clipper it runs great any problems i have had with it were small and just maintenance like the spring that was fixed for under $10 the only reason i want new is to get updated outer shell as the new ones r prettier i recommend these to everyone i must have for a dedicated stylist</li>
            <li> Great! All I really have to say. They cut very well. I can do any fades with these. I recommend them to anybody that is looking for a professional grade clippers.</li>
            <li> I have had these clippers for a few years now and they work just as great as the day that I first got them. I am constantly getting compliments on the unique graffiti style. I notice that they run a lot smoother if only Oster brand spray disinfectant is used on them. I would highly recommend investing time learning proper upkeep if you aren&#x27;t familiar with Oster 76. They need to be greased consistently and the carbon brushes need to be replaced occasionally. If you treat them well they will return the favor.</li>
            <li> The only reason I decided to post was to dispel some of the other reviews I read (including youtube) in which people complained about the noise and maintenance.  Well, I can&#x27;t speak for the older Oster 76 but the new model [this one] has been revamped/updated and is just as quite if not quieter than the Andis equivalent and there is no longer an \\&quot;oil hole\\&quot; on the right side for the motor bearing like there is on the older models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply the best built clipper there is!  For this type of clipper you have to look at it as buying a motor and a drive system since blades are replaceable.  Also as the review title states I am an engineer therefore I look much deeper than most.</li>
            <li> works like a charm and now I do my husbands hair anytime he needs a trim.  Saving us like $25 everytime i do his hair instead of the hair cuttery.</li>
            <li> Very powerful, clean even cut, a little heavy, but you get used to it. Top grade quality clipper. Nice long chord.</li>
            <li> Most defiantly the best clippers I ever had,looks  great,works great very quiet and got them quick,well worth the money,won&#x27;t go back to cheap clippers ever.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe the clean cut you will get on the first try. Not to mention the time you will save. My first cut was done in about 15-20min. I usually take about 35-45min cutting my own hair. I do have to mention that it will take some getting used to handling the clippers, as they are a bit bulky. However, I&#x27;ve asked my wife to handle the clippers, and she had no problem. As a matter of fact she didn&#x27;t  even mention any awkwardness in handling the clippers. But do expect that if you are buzzing your own hair, there will be a learning curve.    The clipper&#x27;s design itself is pretty awesome. Not like any other. I also want to mention that the electric cord is pretty durable and has a great amount of length in comparison to my Whal clippers.    The 0000 blade included came in Black. I believe the image on the product and packaging displays the traditional silver. I was glad to see it was black. Also, if you are looking for other blades that are black, search for the OSTER, TITAN/SOLARIS/APEX clipper blades. I purchased the No.2 clipper and it works and looks great. They are fully compatible with the Oster Classic 76076 models.    One last thing to mention. If you have kids, these clippers are the best. I suppose the one thing that bothers kids the most is the buzzing sound that some clippers make, as my Wahl clippers do. My 2yr. old just got his first cut and it went well.    Finally, for any of you wondering about the Oiler, the silver button on the side and why its missing? Well, I learned that the new design does not need the maintenance. I guess people were over oiling the motor and damaging the clippers. You can learn more about this from the following post with Style Renegade, David Guerin. He is Oster&#x27;s creative director or something like that.  [...]    Invest and get them today! You will not regret it!</li>
