            <li>i love my new case</li>
            <li>Not as bright pink as I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li>but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>It took about a month to come,but it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still useful when watching videos or movies because of the way it stands up.</li>
            <li>It is also not the right size for the Samsung Galaxy S3.  </li>
            <li>I am not going to spend more and take my time to send it back.  </li>

            <li>and I had to use it (looking crappy) while I ordered a new one.</li>
            <li>But, the other reviewers were right!  </li>
            <li>It does not fit my phone the Galaxy S3 much smaller &amp; very cheap looking.  </li>
            <li>It was very inexpensive to purchase, and it will get donated the next time DAV or Goodwill rolls around.  </li>
            <li>Most of them talked about the phone not fitting, that the case is too big.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I ended up going back to my old phone case, this was a bit too bulky as an every day case.</li>
