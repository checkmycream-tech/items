            <li>My hair was already good</li>
            <li>This product I heard was good for growing longer hair</li>
            <li>The procuct is really good.</li>
            <li>However, I have heard good things about Rene Furtherer products and decided to give them a try, believing it was good to switch products once in a while</li>
            <li>It gave me good results</li>
            <li>I paid good $22 for this shampoo hoping it will lessen my hair thinning.</li>
            <li>Just did not do any good to my hair</li>
            <li>and I am very very satisfied with it</li>
            <li>Great shampoo love the smell.</li>
            <li>Great product , changed the way my hair looks, it gives volume and healthy texture.</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo I have ever used and believe me, I am very fussy about shampoos.    </li>
            <li>I did and I liked it too.</li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo just about every time (My hairdresser said to change once in a while even if you love the shampoo because your hair gets used to a shampoo and needs a change from time to time.)</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Oh, it also foams very well and cleans great</li>
            <li>Going to give it to my husband..:)</li>
            <li>The Forticia makes my hair so strong and shiny.</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair and hair-losing problem, try it.&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;A friend who knows a lot about skin care recommended this product.</li>
            <li>, maybe it is more suitable for very oily hair.</li>
            <li>Believe me, I have tried almost everything that is available in Europe and the US, and the rest of the shampoos I have tried do not come even close.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s very good for other people.</li>
            <li>I have no idea where this seller got the product from, however it is not an original RF shampoo.</li>
            <li>At first it is minty but gradually becomes a citrus scent which i love saw a difference on hair growth also</li>
            <li>It arrived in a timely manner and has felt good on hair the few times I was able to use it.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of the oil and shampoo, but it leaves my hair really dry, with \\&quot;straw type volume\\&quot;, instead of \\&quot;bouncy and healthy volume\\&quot;..</li>
            <li>I would recommend going to the company&#x27;s website and choosing the right shampoo for your hair condition.</li>
            <li>Not too many people know about Rene Furterer, because it is not sold in the general stores.</li>
            <li>This cleanses really well, and leave your hair soft supple and very clean</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I believe that Rene Furterer is the best shampoo brand in the world.</li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo for years first in Europe, then in the US through Amazon.</li>
            <li>The hair loss stopped in 2 months of regular use and I was able to keep it up for about 6 months more, I even had new \\&quot;baby\\&quot; hair growing back, my hair was well moisturized and bouncy.</li>
            <li>nice shampoo, smells great and leaves hair soft and shiny, not sure of any other claims by company.</li>
            <li>Forticea really works to restore some of this fullness.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been growing really fast since I&#x27;ve started using it.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used whole tube and just had to go back to my old brand, which works much better.</li>
            <li>, my hair does not fall that much as before if used regurlarly.</li>
            <li>I have been using other brand + extra vitamin supplement for hair loss with good results.</li>
            <li>OK I&#x27;d like to add something after reading other reviews.</li>
            <li>I am an \\&quot;older woman\\&quot; so my hair has lost a lot of its youthful thickness.  </li>
            <li>However, I was very surprised when I got my shampoo a couple of weeks ago from this seller in particular.</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell the same, the color of the actual shampoo is darker and the consistency is thinner than the original shampoo.</li>
            <li>In the past I have had to change shampoos every other washing to get good results.  </li>
            <li>I am in my early 20&#x27;s.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It can bu used daily and will not dry hair out or outweight it.</li>

            <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used and believe me, I am very fussy about shampoos.    It is a bit expensive but worth every penny.  In the past I have had to change shampoos every other washing to get good results.  I have been using this shampoo just about every time (My hairdresser said to change once in a while even if you love the shampoo because your hair gets used to a shampoo and needs a change from time to time.) with continued satisfaction.  It makes my hair look fuller and makes it easier to style.  I am an \\&quot;older woman\\&quot; so my hair has lost a lot of its youthful thickness.  Forticea really works to restore some of this fullness.  I love it.  Oh, it also foams very well and cleans great so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
            <li> nice shampoo, smells great and leaves hair soft and shiny, not sure of any other claims by company. Little spendy</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for finehair with oilyscalp. It can bu used daily and will not dry hair out or outweight it. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I believe that Rene Furterer is the best shampoo brand in the world. Believe me, I have tried almost everything that is available in Europe and the US, and the rest of the shampoos I have tried do not come even close. The Forticia makes my hair so strong and shiny. Every Fall, my hair starts falling due to the weather changes and extensive staying in the sun and swimming pools. This shampoo not only stops the hair loss, but makes my it look unbelievable. Not too many people know about Rene Furterer, because it is not sold in the general stores. They simply don&#x27;t know what they are missing.

            <li> OK I&#x27;d like to add something after reading other reviews. I believe this could help the hair grow thick and reduce losing hairs. My hair was already good so it did show a difference on me. If you have fine hair and hair-losing problem, try it.&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;A friend who knows a lot about skin care recommended this product. I just don&#x27;t like it because it is not giving bubbles. When I don&#x27;t see bubbles, I think it&#x27;s not washing my hair clean.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s very good for other people. It is just not for me.</li>
            <li> Furterer products are reliable. i use this often on my weak oily hair, and it doesn&#x27;t flatten it. I&#x27;ll keept on hand.</li>
            <li> This product I heard was good for growing longer hair and I bought it to try since my hair grows slowly. It&#x27;s been growing really fast since I&#x27;ve started using it.  I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement and I&#x27;ve haven;t used half of it yet.</li>
            <li> The procuct is really good. I have been using it for two years and  I recommend for those who need fortificating shampoos.</li>
            <li> Nioxin is a joke compared to this one. This cleanses really well, and leave your hair soft supple and very clean</li>
            <li> I have thin, sensitive, color treated (highlights +henna)hair that tends to fall out massively if not taken care of properly. I have been using other brand + extra vitamin supplement for hair loss with good results. The hair loss stopped in 2 months of regular use and I was able to keep it up for about 6 months more, I even had new \\&quot;baby\\&quot; hair growing back, my hair was well moisturized and bouncy. However, I have heard good things about Rene Furtherer products and decided to give them a try, believing it was good to switch products once in a while (I continued taking the same vitamin supplement). Forticea just doesn&#x27;t work for my hair. Love the smell of the oil and shampoo, but it leaves my hair really dry, with \\&quot;straw type volume\\&quot;, instead of \\&quot;bouncy and healthy volume\\&quot;.. But the worst thing is that my hair started falling out again. Haven&#x27;t used whole tube and just had to go back to my old brand, which works much better. I don&#x27;t say this is a bad shampoo, but I guess it just doesn&#x27;t work for me, maybe it is more suitable for very oily hair. Going to give it to my husband..:)</li>
            <li> It makes my hair flat and oily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for almost 10 years and I am very very satisfied with it, I think that after you try this shampoo you will stop searching for others, the is the best shampoo for man.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended this product to me and i decided to try it. I did and I liked it too. It gave me good results, my hair does not fall that much as before if used regurlarly. I don&#x27;t know if it would have the same effect on everyone tough...</li>
            <li> Works..stops hair loss</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for years first in Europe, then in the US through Amazon. However, I was very surprised when I got my shampoo a couple of weeks ago from this seller in particular. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell the same, the color of the actual shampoo is darker and the consistency is thinner than the original shampoo. I have no idea where this seller got the product from, however it is not an original RF shampoo. I am very disappointed and will not buy from the same seller again.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo love the smell. At first it is minty but gradually becomes a citrus scent which i love saw a difference on hair growth also</li>
            <li> Have been using for 5 months now and have not seen it aids with hair loss. Have helpep with irritated and itching scalp.</li>
            <li> Great product , changed the way my hair looks, it gives volume and healthy texture. I buy it all the time!</li>
            <li> I paid good $22 for this shampoo hoping it will lessen my hair thinning. I am in my early 20&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;My hair started fall off since 3 months ago, in desperation and with all-so-good reviews about this product, I bought it and used it for about a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It made my scalp itchy&lt;br /&gt;2. Feels like my hair thinning got worse, not better at all&lt;br /&gt;3. Too expensive&lt;br /&gt;4. Just did not do any good to my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is black, typical asian hair, medium coarse, shoulder length.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product, I am going to try Nioxin system 1.</li>
            <li> Difficult for me to rate at this time, as have been unable to use it much due to treatment receiving presently for a scalp condition. It arrived in a timely manner and has felt good on hair the few times I was able to use it.</li>
