    <ol>
            <li>The seller was very good at resolving the problem I had with the mirrow.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the product</li>
            <li>and I thought: \\&quot;Oh, good price for three mirrors\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>mirror is OK for price, all 3 stickers must be removed with goof-off and a jack-hammer!  </li>
            <li>That mostly cleaned it up, but there was still some I could not remove, and now I also had oil to deal with.  </li>
            <li>better take that reading comprehension class.......</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got 99 problems and most of them are stickers</li>
            <li>not what I expected-but will work ok.</li>
            <li>I found this online; it is exactly what I want for a good price.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice, functional mirror, but it came with a large sticker on its face.  </li>
            <li>The sticker on the front is silos huge, ad</li>
            <li>Great mirror with 2 magnified sizes on the back.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the one I purchased.</li>
            <li>The manufacture picked a backing glue that does not separate from glass cleanly.  </li>
            <li>The main mirror is a great size-not sure how the smaller ones will work?</li>
            <li>So, really, just an OK price.</li>
            <li>right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of it peels off pretty easily with hot water and soap, though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This would be a far better mirror if the manufacturer did not put stickers on it.</li>
            <li>The mirror was great but the stickers that were put on it were hard to remove and left a sticky residue...</li>
            <li>I ordered this as an add on item and it came with a huge sticker covering half of the front mirror.</li>
            <li>I just use the 1x as the others are a little too small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, works fine as a mirror.</li>
            <li>These mirrors are so unique due to the two mirrors on the back.</li>
            <li>The final nail in the coffin, is that the mirror is plastered with paper stickers - which, as this is a mirror, I really need little instruction on use.  </li>

            <li> The smaller higher magnification mirrors are very small and I am not sure how useful they would be.  </li>
            <li> You get a single mirror with 2 tiny mirrors on it&#x27;s back (that also have stickers on them, although they&#x27;re a bit easier to take off).</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s one of those old school, crappy stickers where you can only peel off little pieces of it at a time</li>
            <li> The mirror was much smaller than expected</li>
            <li> The sticker on the back of the mirror didn&#x27;t come off all the way and made a mess of the mirror.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s little ones on the back as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one mirror that has 1x on front and 3x and 5x in little circles on back.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is surprisingly heavy and thick, which, while I didn&#x27;t want a flimsy piece of plastic, the additional 3x and 5x small mirrors on the back cause excessive weight and thickness, making it less useful for holding.</li>
            <li> Other than that, no complaints.</li>
            <li> The two little mirrors are hard to see anything in and do not seem to give a clear reflection.</li>
            <li> Yet, these paper stickers are IMPOSSIBLE to remove cleanly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get a stickerless mirror from Walmart on my way home from work tomorrow, it&#x27;s simply not worth my time to slave away over a $4 item like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;FYI, while the pictures may be confusing, you do NOT receive separate mirrors of different zoom levels.</li>
            <li> that covers half the mirror which everyone complains about...........</li>
            <li> The mirror is covered half way with a product sticker and I cannot get the glue off.</li>
            <li> It is one mirror with two little mirrors on the reverse side.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried, yet, to remove the small stickers from the magnifying</li>
            <li> This item is a complete disappointment.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a very hard sticker on the mirror.</li>
            <li> I ended up creating a mess using Goo Gone, and it removed some of the paint and got my hands dirty</li>
            <li> Very Verty annoying!</li>
            <li> and all are difficult to get off.</li>
            <li> I found the sticker difficult to remove, and once it was removed there was still adhesive all over.  </li>
            <li> Granted, this is not an expensive piece of equipment, but how can a mirror get screwed up?  </li>
            <li> I broke the mirrors trying to remove the stickers. :(</li>
            <li> Annoying.  </li>
            <li> The awful stickers make this mirror a terrible purchase.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I like the mirror but I find the picture of it to be a bit deceiving.  It made me think I was actually getting 3 mirrors.  I am happy with the product but I think u need to change the picture to show what the mirror actually looks like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hand-held mirror for primping, what else can I say?</li>
            <li> This hand held mirror came in three strengths. The handle has a hole so it can hang or lay in a drawer.</li>
            <li> The sticker on the back of the mirror didn&#x27;t come off all the way and made a mess of the mirror.  Find another way of marking the item</li>
            <li> four stickers on this mirror.  and all are difficult to get off.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, functional mirror, but it came with a large sticker on its face.  I found the sticker difficult to remove, and once it was removed there was still adhesive all over.  Soap and water did not remove this, so I tried vegetable oil.  That mostly cleaned it up, but there was still some I could not remove, and now I also had oil to deal with.  Also, something (water?) seemed to get under the surface, but I guess that&#x27;s gone now.  Eventually I tried acetone.  Acetone cleaned the mirror well but also removed the paint.  If you use acetone, maybe you should put masking tape on the painted surface first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried, yet, to remove the small stickers from the magnifying surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a far better mirror if the manufacturer did not put stickers on it.</li>
            <li> I saw the picture of three mirrors and then the phrase \\&quot;Swissco 3 View Hand mirror\\&quot; and I thought: \\&quot;Oh, good price for three mirrors\\&quot;. No cigar. This is actually one mirror with one big mirror in front and two tiny magnifying mirrors in back. So, really, just an OK price. Also, got the \\&quot;can&#x27;t get off the glued on sticker\\&quot; that covers half the mirror which everyone complains about...........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d better take that reading comprehension class.......</li>
            <li> There is a picture of three mirrors on the website so I thought it was three mirrors, one for 1x, one for 3x and one for 5x. It is one mirror with two little mirrors on the reverse side. The two little mirrors are hard to see anything in and do not seem to give a clear reflection. The seller was very good at resolving the problem I had with the mirrow.</li>
            <li> Great mirror with 2 magnified sizes on the back.</li>
            <li> The sticker on the front is silos huge, ad there&#x27;s little ones on the back as well. I want my money back....</li>
            <li> These mirrors are so unique due to the two mirrors on the back. I really enjoy the one I purchased.</li>
            <li> This item is a complete disappointment.  Granted, this is not an expensive piece of equipment, but how can a mirror get screwed up?  In several ways, it turns out.  The mirror is surprisingly heavy and thick, which, while I didn&#x27;t want a flimsy piece of plastic, the additional 3x and 5x small mirrors on the back cause excessive weight and thickness, making it less useful for holding. The smaller higher magnification mirrors are very small and I am not sure how useful they would be.  The final nail in the coffin, is that the mirror is plastered with paper stickers - which, as this is a mirror, I really need little instruction on use.  Yet, these paper stickers are IMPOSSIBLE to remove cleanly.  The manufacture picked a backing glue that does not separate from glass cleanly.  The awful stickers make this mirror a terrible purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as an add on item and it came with a huge sticker covering half of the front mirror. But it&#x27;s one of those old school, crappy stickers where you can only peel off little pieces of it at a time and it&#x27;s constantly ripping and leaving remains. After about 15 minutes of working on this thing with a butter knife and some windex, I gave up and threw it in the garbage. I&#x27;ll get a stickerless mirror from Walmart on my way home from work tomorrow, it&#x27;s simply not worth my time to slave away over a $4 item like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, while the pictures may be confusing, you do NOT receive separate mirrors of different zoom levels. You get a single mirror with 2 tiny mirrors on it&#x27;s back (that also have stickers on them, although they&#x27;re a bit easier to take off).</li>
            <li> The mirror was great but the stickers that were put on it were hard to remove and left a sticky residue... what a pain!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got 99 problems and most of them are stickers right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of it peels off pretty easily with hot water and soap, though. But ugh.</li>
            <li> It took me ten minutes with a razor blade and Goo Gone to get the sticker off the mirror.  Annoying.  Other than that, no complaints.</li>
            <li> I could not find a mirror this size at my local big box store.  I found this online; it is exactly what I want for a good price.  I recommend the purchase.</li>
            <li> It comes with a very hard sticker on the mirror. I broke the mirrors trying to remove the stickers. :(</li>
            <li> Bought this mirror for my daughter to use back stage during a musical. The mirror is covered half way with a product sticker and I cannot get the glue off. Mirror is unusable! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t understand from the description is that you get three mirrors.  They were pretty small and the magnification wasn&#x27;t helpful at all.  I returned them.</li>
            <li> mirror is OK for price, all 3 stickers must be removed with goof-off and a jack-hammer!  Very Verty annoying! Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> The mirror was much smaller than expected</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get some of the stickers off when I bought it.  I ended up creating a mess using Goo Gone, and it removed some of the paint and got my hands dirty (yes, I&#x27;m whining).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t 3 mirrors as the picture suggests.  It&#x27;s one mirror that has 1x on front and 3x and 5x in little circles on back.  I just use the 1x as the others are a little too small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, works fine as a mirror.</li>
            <li> not what I expected-but will work ok. The main mirror is a great size-not sure how the smaller ones will work?</li>
