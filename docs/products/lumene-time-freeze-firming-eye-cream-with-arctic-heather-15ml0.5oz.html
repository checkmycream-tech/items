            <li>This is my new best eye creme.</li>
            <li>This is the best eye cream I&#x27;ve found for puffiness and fine lines, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of high end product lines.</li>
            <li>tap a tiny drop around each eye for best results.</li>
            <li>so I thought it was time to start looking for some better eye creams.</li>
            <li>I get compliments on my skin all the time:)</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s so creamy but absorbs in pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>feels good when you put it on, moisturizes and seems to tighten a little.  </li>

            <li> feels good when you put it on, moisturizes and seems to tighten a little.  Long term reduction in fine lines and puffiness, and it seems like my dark circles are even better.  It doesn&#x27;t provide any tint coverage.</li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews I should of read them all this product DOES NOT WORK Im sorry I ordered it</li>
            <li> A friend of mine gave this to me to try. I was amazed at how well it works. This is my new best eye creme.</li>
            <li> This is as good or better than eye creams costing over $50+. I have sensitive skin and was pleased to see that I can use this without problems. I plan to try the moisturizers next. If you are looking for a product that is reasonably priced this is a good one, although I have not found any that reduce under eye puffiness (which is a problem for me) no matter the cost paid. Having said that, it does moisturize the eye area well and for me can be used on the eyelids too without any problems. I gave it 4 stars because of the puffiness issue, but in all other aspects it is a 5</li>
            <li> Not seeing any results after two weeks. Don&#x27;t feel like waiting longer. Switching to different brand.</li>
            <li> Really helps sooth the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products that I can use around my eyes and I was delighted to find some of the Lumene collection available on Amazon! Very soothing and can be used on upper lids as well as underneath . . . tap a tiny drop around each eye for best results. I&#x27;m 68 and have dry, mature sensitive skin. As with all new facial products, remember that 24 hour &#x27;patch test!&#x27; The &#x27;Time Freeze&#x27; series is intended for younger women to help prevent skin damage . . . the eye cream is still a good choice at any age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few suggestions:&lt;br /&gt;Roc Retinol day/night creams, Deep Wrinkle Serum and cleansing discs. Freedman Cucumber or Pomegranate peel masks and Smoothies (that deep line between brows). C. Booth body creams (Honey Almond) and dry oil mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[20 minutes or less a day for me and really terrific results in 2 to 4 months!]</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream! I have very sensitive eyes and dark circles with slight puffiness. I&#x27;m just barely 30 so I thought it was time to start looking for some better eye creams. After reading the reviews on here, I bought some of this eye cream. It&#x27;s so creamy but absorbs in pretty quickly. It does hydrate and even out any fine lines. I don&#x27;t know if it helps with dark circles but it creates a great base for concealer. Both this product and my lumene freeze night cream have been amazing for me. I get compliments on my skin all the time:)</li>
            <li> I heard this was a good product from someone Dr. Oz had on his show but I was very disappointed. It made my wrinkles worse not better. I definitely lost money on this one.</li>
            <li> No improvement,  It did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> these products really work!!</li>
            <li> Nice sensitive under eye moisturizer but that&#x27;s about it. After three weeks of use, I&#x27;ve seen no firming of tissue</li>
            <li> Love it! Erases fine lines in a matter of seconds. Best of the products I&#x27;ve tried.  You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> reasonable &amp; effective</li>
            <li> It seems to have a thinner consistency then when I buy it at the drug store. But a little drop on the eye bags it works like a champ</li>
            <li> It is the best, I love this product.</li>
            <li> probably the best eye cream i have ever used and i have tried them all! however, i found that it works best if used in the morning&lt;br /&gt;and not prior to going to bed as it can have the opposite effect.</li>
            <li> I used this for the puffiness under my eyes. I was pleased. After a few days I noticed a difference. My eyes looked better. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember any thing of What that was!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable eye cream. This is the best eye cream I&#x27;ve found for puffiness and fine lines, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of high end product lines.</li>
            <li> I just started using this Lumene Time Freeze...I have only used it for one week now, and already I can see the difference....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye wrinkle products, and this one is the best!!!!  Very reasonable price also!  Try it!</li>
