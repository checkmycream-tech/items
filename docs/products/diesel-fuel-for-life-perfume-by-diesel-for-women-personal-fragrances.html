    <ol>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a shame because it&#x27;s a totally awesome fragrance</li>
            <li>This perfume smells so wonderful and everytime my wife wears it men ask her what perfume she has on.</li>
            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>Happy, to find it here.</li>
            <li>Nice, attractive scent.</li>
            <li>so I was very happy to see it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Must be an erotic smell.</li>
            <li>recommend to all of my good friends.</li>
            <li>and i love it!</li>
            <li>but i still love it!</li>
            <li>Got here on time and smells amazing</li>
            <li>It has a nice floral aroma.  </li>
            <li>so I begin my own search online for it because many of the dept store no longer carry this fragrance</li>
            <li>Diesel Fuel for Life is 1 of my favorite perfumes I use to purchase it from Perfumania but every time I would go in the store they kept saying we still don&#x27;t have it in</li>
            <li>cannot find it many places anymore</li>
            <li>One of my all-time favorite scents.</li>
            <li>It is not an original!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m grateful it can still be found on-line, since it is no longer available in stores; makes me want to order 5 more bottles</li>
            <li>If you like very fragrant perfumes, this is a good one.</li>
            <li>I bought several bottles since you can not purchase this any more in a store, great product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this scent (its very clean and fresh smelling without being overpowering)</li>
            <li>Ive purchased everything from D&amp;G to Prada to Micheal Koors and this is hands down the best smell I have found.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if perfume can expire when it&#x27;s still sealed in a box and not exposed to light or air</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this scent.</li>
            <li>The bottle came still sealed in the box, which is usually a good sign, and everything on the bottle looked legit, but the smell was completely off.</li>
            <li>This fragrance has a clean earthy but very sensual type smell to it also reminds me of the women&#x27;s Burberry Brit and that&#x27;s 1 of my favorites as well!!!</li>
            <li>As it had been a year since the original date of purchase</li>
            <li>It was resealed and made to look like it was an original and</li>
            <li>Over the course of its life the citrus disappears and it turns into an overly sweet floral (I think gardenia).</li>
            <li>It still smells good but its definitely different.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>This is first time happened with me since the beginning of me ordering on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The sccent was okay, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to wear it.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume so much that I ended up getting a second bottle.</li>
            <li>There were enough good reviews that I decided to ignore the risk of buying perfume (especially discontinued perfume) online, but I should have listened to my gut.</li>
            <li>Thanks for online purchasing.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when I wear this perfume, especially from men and young guys.  </li>
            <li>I chose this rating because the product was delivered in a very timely manner and the fragrance is strong and long</li>
            <li>but it mostly just smelled sour and just...</li>
            <li>This is an interesting, sort of odd fragrance.</li>
            <li>, I found it on Amazon cheaper than anywhere else I looked and needless to say I&#x27;m happy I found it</li>
            <li>The product arrived in a timely manner, box/bottle looked exactly the same as Diesel Fuel for Life</li>
            <li>This large bottle does not smell the same as the perfume in the tiny one that I first got turned on to.</li>
            <li>When my previous bottle finally ran out a few days ago I happily pulled this bottle out and was horrified when I sprayed some on and ended up smelling like I was 90 years old.  </li>
            <li>Was a complete ripoff</li>
            <li>, i guess it&#x27;s getting old</li>
            <li>Lesson learned: beware who you buy perfume from online - especially this particular fragrance as it has become extremely difficult to find, and is therefore more likely to be a knockoff!</li>

            <li> It seemed watered down or old.  </li>
            <li> There were faint hints of the original scent</li>
            <li> i was so disappointed to find that this doesnt have a brown jean kind of cover but</li>
            <li> the scent is a feminine-very rough type scent.</li>
            <li> When I received it, the box was already opened and the perfume not strong enough.</li>
            <li> The fragrance usually stays on my clothes for the longest and on me, but this one didn&#x27;t last but 2 minutes and the smell was gone!</li>
            <li> When I put it on it&#x27;s got a sharp citrus note</li>
            <li> The scent stays on forever and just a little spray will do.</li>
            <li> I received it within just a few days of ordering so that made me even happier.</li>
            <li> Save your money, I wasted $75 on this.</li>
            <li> would if I had bought it in a department store - which is pretty much impossible to do these days -</li>
            <li> it WAS a duck and put it in the closet where it&#x27;s been for the past year, patiently waiting it&#x27;s turn on the shelf.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this after being unable to find it in stores for several years now.</li>
            <li> Usually difficult to find store that carries this product.</li>
            <li> However, it may be difficult to locate in the stores, because it sells out.</li>
            <li> This is really really bad</li>
            <li> and i dont know what I am supposed to do with this perfume now. :(</li>
            <li> I am beyond disappointed in the product I received.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is fake do not buy!!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Awful!!  </li>

            <li> I was very disappointed with this product. I have used this perfume for about 7 years and recently I could not find it here in my hometown again so I decided to order this online.  When I received it, the box was already opened and the perfume not strong enough. It seemed watered down or old.  The fragrance usually stays on my clothes for the longest and on me, but this one didn&#x27;t last but 2 minutes and the smell was gone! I will never order perfume online again.</li>
            <li> Diesel Fuel for Life is 1 of my favorite perfumes I use to purchase it from Perfumania but every time I would go in the store they kept saying we still don&#x27;t have it in so I begin my own search online for it because many of the dept store no longer carry this fragrance and it&#x27;s a shame because it&#x27;s a totally awesome fragrance, I found it on Amazon cheaper than anywhere else I looked and needless to say I&#x27;m happy I found it and now I know where to get my next bottle when I run out again. This fragrance has a clean earthy but very sensual type smell to it also reminds me of the women&#x27;s Burberry Brit and that&#x27;s 1 of my favorites as well!!!</li>
            <li> Nice, attractive scent. Usually difficult to find store that carries this product. Thanks for online purchasing.</li>
            <li> This is fake do not buy!! Was a complete ripoff and when i saw the actual product at the diesel store i was thrown away.</li>
            <li> This is first time happened with me since the beginning of me ordering on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered Diesel Fuel For Life for Men which has a brown case instead of the net one which this perfume has.&lt;br /&gt;When i opened my package i was so disappointed to find that this doesnt have a brown jean kind of cover but a net one.&lt;br /&gt;I didnt realize why this happened till i saw the bottle again and found that its a ladies perfume and not men&#x27;s perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered mens perfume and got ladies perfume. This is really really bad and i dont know what I am supposed to do with this perfume now. :(</li>
            <li> I get a bottle of this for my mom each year. She absolutely loves it. The scent stays on forever and just a little spray will do.</li>
            <li> I bought several bottles since you can not purchase this any more in a store, great product.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting, sort of odd fragrance. When I put it on it&#x27;s got a sharp citrus note (I think it&#x27;s grapefruit) and some unidentified florals. Over the course of its life the citrus disappears and it turns into an overly sweet floral (I think gardenia). The sccent was okay, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to wear it.</li>
            <li> I wish Diesel had not discontinued making this perfume.  It is one of my faves and I can only find it on Amazon.  It has a nice floral aroma.  If you like very fragrant perfumes, this is a good one.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing diesel for quite some time and i love it! cannot find it many places anymore, i guess it&#x27;s getting old but i still love it!</li>
            <li> One of my all-time favorite scents. I get compliments every time I wear it. I&#x27;m grateful it can still be found on-line, since it is no longer available in stores; makes me want to order 5 more bottles so I can stock up on it like Elaine with her birth control on Seinfeld! Lol.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite perfume. I wish it was easier to find!!</li>
            <li> Myabe it was me, but when I wore this I smelled like I had sprayed ant spray on my self. the scent is a feminine-very rough type scent. not for moe or anyone I sat by.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a timely manner, box/bottle looked exactly the same as Diesel Fuel for Life would if I had bought it in a department store - which is pretty much impossible to do these days - so I assumed if it walked like a duck and quacked like a duck it WAS a duck and put it in the closet where it&#x27;s been for the past year, patiently waiting it&#x27;s turn on the shelf.  When my previous bottle finally ran out a few days ago I happily pulled this bottle out and was horrified when I sprayed some on and ended up smelling like I was 90 years old.  I don&#x27;t know what was in this bottle, but it was DEFINITELY not Fuel for Life.  As it had been a year since the original date of purchase I ended having to throw it out.  Awful!!  Lesson learned: beware who you buy perfume from online - especially this particular fragrance as it has become extremely difficult to find, and is therefore more likely to be a knockoff!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent (its very clean and fresh smelling without being overpowering) Since I ran out, I hadn&#x27;t worn it for over a year so I was very happy to see it available on Amazon. I received it within just a few days of ordering so that made me even happier.</li>
            <li> I am beyond disappointed in the product I received.  It is not an original!  It was resealed and made to look like it was an original and it was not.  Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume so much that I ended up getting a second bottle.</li>
            <li> This large bottle does not smell the same as the perfume in the tiny one that I first got turned on to. I was disappointed. It still smells good but its definitely different.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I wear this perfume, especially from men and young guys.  Must be an erotic smell.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves her present!</li>
            <li> Ordered this after being unable to find it in stores for several years now. There were enough good reviews that I decided to ignore the risk of buying perfume (especially discontinued perfume) online, but I should have listened to my gut. The bottle came still sealed in the box, which is usually a good sign, and everything on the bottle looked legit, but the smell was completely off. There were faint hints of the original scent but it mostly just smelled sour and just...off. I don&#x27;t know if perfume can expire when it&#x27;s still sealed in a box and not exposed to light or air but if so, then this was definitely expired. Save your money, I wasted $75 on this.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so wonderful and everytime my wife wears it men ask her what perfume she has on. It smells heavenly and can&#x27;t find it in the store. Accidentally bought the men&#x27;s one time so gave it to my brother-in-law. Don&#x27;t know what my wife will wear if they stop making it!</li>
            <li> Ive purchased everything from D&amp;G to Prada to Micheal Koors and this is hands down the best smell I have found.  Give it a shot!!  You will not be dissapointed</li>
            <li> Got here on time and smells amazing</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the product was delivered in a very timely manner and the fragrance is strong and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like everything about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend to all of my good friends.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this scent. However, it may be difficult to locate in the stores, because it sells out. Happy, to find it here. The price is the same as in stores.</li>
